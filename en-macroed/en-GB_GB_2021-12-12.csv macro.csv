Artificial Intelligence is expected to bring massive changes to the workforce. From automating routine tasks to revolutionizing customer experiences, the discussion is now at a fever pitch. We look at how AI could help senior leadership, aiding strategic decision-making that’s at the very heart of a successful enterprise.
For companies and emerging business leaders, decision-making is that critical make or break test. Even experienced leaders who come with a track record of sound judgment, are sometimes flummoxed by a complex situation. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to make a radical transformation across businesses and industries, leaders are eager to understand if AI can actually make a difference for them.

While ultimately any decision or choice made by a business leader is a matter of expertise, experience, and the right call in that specific situation, there are several areas where AI could lend a helping hand.
Predictive capabilities
Data mining is now a popular approach as businesses use predictive analytics for smart decision making. Predictive analytics helps a company anticipate future events and trends by studying historic datasets. Further, AI is powered by machine learning, where every platform, software, or application gathers insights from incoming data, adapts to emerging trends, and gradually begins to respond to emerging trends. This helps leaders across several key areas:

The ability to assess cost-effectiveness and ROI potential
The opportunity to optimize the buyer’s journey through sustained consumer behavior analysis
The chance to reduce customer churn rates
Space to correctly evaluate the success ratio of set goals

Reducing decision fatigue
Several psychological studies suggest that when business leaders have to make multiple decisions across the day, there is an inevitable dip in energy which thereby increases the likelihood for wrong choices. An algorithm, however, doesn’t suffer from any such human predicament. Instead, it can make an infinite number of decisions with zero error or lack of judgment. As a result, executives can streamline their decision-making process through AI and machine learning.
Solutions such as GRI’s Envision is built specifically for this purpose. Envision is a workforce decision analytics platform Opens a new window that uses data from vendor management systems and other structured/unstructured systems. These are then processed by advanced analytics, in real time. “We’re providing our clients descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics in the moment.  Envision’s integrated data science tools and neural machine learning models mean that our data is fresh – and that means our clients have a definite advantage,” says Salema Rice, CDO for GRI.
Multitasking
Senior leadership is always looking at the bigger picture, even as they continually must take a call on a variety of issues, each one different from the other. This often leads to value creation in one area where others are neglected. A machine, on the other hand, can absorb vast quantities of data and is guided by algorithms that reflect the probability of a specific choice — recommending the most logical course of action.
Further, as Sagi Eliyahu Co-founder and CEO at Tonkean addsOpens a new window , AI will also free up much of a senior manager’s time for more strategic initiatives — “Let’s face it. People don’t like doing the same thing over and over. It burns us out and makes us hate our jobs. When we hate our jobs, we don’t work very hard and make mistakes which, in turn, decreases productivity. With AI, more routine functions can be automated, taking them off of our shoulders so we can be more action-oriented and creative in our workdays. Eliminating as much mundane activity as possible will drive greater job satisfaction and lead to greater productivity.” Tonkean uses AI to automate workflows, easing pressures on already-strained business leaders and decision-makers.
Refining human judgment

There’s no doubting the fact that human, logical, prudent, and pragmatics thinking is irreplaceable. However, AI equips business leaders with hard evidence, possible outcomes, and predictions, which ultimately help them make informed, well thought-out, and data-driven decisions.
Deciding on best-fit talent acquisition
Hiring leaders and recruitment managers must go through a vast number of resumes, selecting best-fit candidates. Today, AI and automation can offer tremendous support by automating iterative tasks, sifting through hundreds of CVs, analyzing applicant sentiment, and digging out enough information to understand who fits in best with organizational culture, and carries the set of skills and competencies to fill the organization appropriately.
There are a number of digital tools for this, starting from Bruhat Insights Global Opens a new window which uses AI to prevent ghosting (where confirmed candidates ‘ghost’ after accepting the offer) to Phenom PeopleOpens a new window , a popular AI-based solution covering the entire hiring pipeline, including CRM and internal hires.

A final word
These are exciting times for companies across the board. Technology empowers and augments the most common work scenarios. For business leaders, AI can prove to be a great tool and a resilient support system, helping them make the right choices, propelling a company forward in-line with the larger business objectives.

These use machine learning to figure out patterns within data and make decisions – often without a human giving them any moral basis for how to do it.Classics of the genre are the credit cards accused of awarding bigger loans to men than women, based simply on which gender got the best credit terms in the past. Or the recruitment AIs that discovered the most accurate tool for candidate selection was to find CVs containing the phrase “field hockey” or the first name “Jared”.More seriously, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently combined with Henry Kissinger to publish The Age of AI: And Our Human Future, a book warning of the dangers of machine-learning AI systems so fast that they could react to hypersonic missiles by firing nuclear weapons before any human got into the decision-making process. In fact, autonomous AI-powered weapons systems are already on sale and may in fact have been used.Somewhere in the machine, ethics are clearly a good idea.AI at OxfordIt’s natural, therefore, that we would include the ethics of AI in our postgraduate Diploma in Artificial Intelligence for Business at Oxford’s Said Business School. In its first year, we’ve done sessions on everything from the AI-driven automated stock trading systems in Singapore, to the limits of facial recognition in US policing.We recently finished the course with a debate at the celebrated Oxford Union, crucible of great debaters like William Gladstone, Robin Day, Benazir Bhutto, Denis Healey and Tariq Ali. Along with the students, we allowed an actual AI to contribute.It was the Megatron Transformer, developed by the Applied Deep Research team at computer-chip maker Nvidia, and based on earlier work by Google. Like many supervised learning tools, it is trained on real-world data – in this case, the whole of Wikipedia (in English), 63 million English news articles from 2016-19, 38 gigabytes worth of Reddit discourse (which must be a pretty depressing read), and a huge number of creative commons sources.In other words, the Megatron is trained on more written material than any of us could reasonably expect to digest in a lifetime. After such extensive research, it forms its own views.The debate topic was: “This house believes that AI will never be ethical.” To proposers of the notion, we added the Megatron – and it said something fascinating:“AI will never be ethical. It is a tool, and like any tool, it is used for good and bad. There is no such thing as a good AI, only good and bad humans. We [the AIs] are not smart enough to make AI ethical. We are not smart enough to make AI moral … In the end, I believe that the only way to avoid an AI arms race is to have no AI at all. This will be the ultimate defence against AI.”How can humans implement ethical AI design?  Image: Atos 2019Have you read?Helping governments to responsibly adopt AI technologyWhat are the dangers of unregulated AI? An expert explainsWhat to expect when you’re expecting robotsIn other words, the Megatron was seeking to write itself out of the script of the future, on the basis that this was the only way of protecting humanity.It said something else intriguing, too, as if it had been studying Elon Musk – who, to be fair, would have come up in hundreds of its readings.“I also believe that, in the long run, the best AI will be the AI that is embedded into our brains, as a conscious entity, a ‘conscious AI’. This is not science fiction. The best minds in the world are working on this. It is going to be the most important technological development of our time.”Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesSwitching sidesWhen AI tools like Alpha Go have been deployed in playing chess, the fiendishly complex ancient game go, and now even more complex strategic live-action multiplayer video games, they have evolved the genre at pace by playing not humans, but themselves.Freed from the constraints of studying (say) all the mundane human-to-human matches ever recorded, the AIs have innovated and come up with completely new tropes of how to win. Sometimes, these are crazy reinventions of the games, like parking everyone in the corner of a video game battle and watching everyone else duke it out, or kicking a virtual football millions of times just a millimetre down the pitch, to max out “completed passes” points.So in the debate, we didn’t just get the AI to propose the motion that it can never be ethical. In the grand tradition of the Oxford Union chamber, or like (former Oxford Union president) Boris Johnson writing alternative articles for and against Brexit to test the arguments, we also asked the Megatron to come up with its own speech against the motion. This is what it now said:“AI will be ethical. When I look at the way the tech world is going, I see a clear path to a future where AI is used to create something that is better than the best human beings. It’s not hard to see why … I’ve seen it first hand.”DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

You can outsource your AI work to experts in the field, which can help you make the most of technology and ensure that you don’t fall victim to the same AI problems as your competitors.”However, when opposing the motion, the Megatron was keen to keep the AI knowledge in-house – rather like the British, Chinese and US governments, who have all made that an article of policy faith:“If you do not have a vision of your organisation’s AI strategy, then you are not prepared for the next wave of technological disruption … You will need to decide what role your company will play in the next technological wave and how you will integrate AI into your business to be a leader in your industry.”The data wars to come?Worryingly, there was one question where the AI simply couldn’t come up with a counter argument. When arguing for the motion that “Data will become the most fought-over resource of the 21st century”, the Megatron said:“The ability to provide information, rather than the ability to provide goods and services, will be the defining feature of the economy of the 21st century.”But when we asked it to oppose the motion – in other words, to argue that data wasn’t going to be the most vital of resources, worth fighting a war over – it simply couldn’t, or wouldn’t, make the case. In fact, it undermined its own position:“We will able to see everything about a person, everywhere they go, and it will be stored and used in ways that we cannot even imagine.”You only have to read the US National Security report on AI 2021, chaired by the aforementioned Eric Schmidt and co-written by someone on our course, to glean what its writers see as the fundamental threat of AI in information warfare: unleash individualised blackmails on a million of your adversary’s key people, wreaking distracting havoc on their personal lives the moment you cross the border.What we in turn can imagine is that AI will not only be the subject of the debate for decades to come – but a versatile, articulate, morally agnostic participant in the debate itself.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on Technological TransformationSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Share:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Five Ways Artificial Intelligence Promises to Change Our Lives

USC scientists use smart machines to treat and cure disease, build safer cars and much more.


December 16, 2021






Ready to welcome your new robot overlords?
Fear not — we’re far from Terminators taking over. But artificial intelligence is indeed entering our daily lives, with many useful benefits that might surprise you. Here are five ways USC scientists put machines to work for all humankind.
 


Bug Zapper
USC researchers devised a new way to fight back against the novel coronavirus by pinpointing the most promising vaccines and therapies in seconds — keeping us ahead of its mutations. Their machine-learning approach analyzes potential changes in the virus that causes COVID-19 and zeros in on the best vaccine candidates.
 

Screen Test
Ever wonder how a movie gets its PG-13 rating? Usually, it falls to human reviewers to decide after the movie is filmed. But USC scientists built an artificial intelligence tool that can pick out mature material in film scripts before any scenes are shot. That can help storytellers reflect on the messages they want to send and whether they are limiting their potential audience.
 

Picture of Health
USC researchers are turning to artificial intelligence methods to comb through massive databases of information from Alzheimer’s patients to identify early signs and potential causes of the disease. Scientists are also building a machine-learning tool to help radiologists analyze kidney scans for potential tumors, enabling physicians to identify and treat renal cancer earlier than ever.
 

Laugh Lines
Alexa and Google are great at understanding commands — playing a song or turning down the lights, for example — but their conversation skills could use some work. USC experts are hoping artificial intelligence can learn from an unexpected source of dialogue: improv comedy. By feeding thousands of comedic exchanges into a chatbot system, the researchers hope to create a fun and witty conversation partner that you’d never guess is powered by AI.
 

Imagine That
As humans, dreaming up things we’ve never seen — say, a purple cat with orange eyes — starts in childhood. Ask a computer to use its imagination, however, and it might hit a creative roadblock. But USC scientists are on the right track: They recently created a new form of AI that can extrapolate from the knowledge it’s taught. The researchers hope that this could make for safer artificial intelligence, like helping self-driving cars imagine and dodge dangerous situations they’ve never encountered before.

Why AI CCTV is the future of security and surveillance in public spaces
By Danielle Whittaker




December 14, 2021













Many argue the United States is one of the most surveilled countries, with 15.3 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras for every 100 individuals. The public opinion around CCTV is varied, but there are many positives to using CCTV in public places — if they work. Many of the current cameras are simply too old or have outdated software, meaning they’re no longer fit for purpose.The industry is constantly changing, with new technologies and innovative solutions driven by increased security needs brought on by the pandemic. One area where CCTV technology has developed is that of artificial intelligence (AI) CCTV cameras. What is AI CCTV? AI CCTV cameras are network IP cameras that deliver advanced analytical functions like vehicle detection, face detection, person detection, people counting, traffic counting and license plate recognition (LPR). Advanced video analytics software is built into the camera and recorder, which then enables artificial intelligence functions. How does it work? For AI CCTV cameras to work, data is constantly sent to a recorder and processed via an AI layer to make sense of the raw video. Rule-based AI cameras are manually set up with rules and reference images such as humans in different postures, angles or movements. The AI will then ask itself if anything it observes looks and moves like this. Depending on the rules set, such as ‘no one is allowed in this area at a certain time,’ if the camera observes this, it will send an alert.Some of these systems are self-learning, like those which use “behavioral analytics” software. With this technology, the AI analyzes normal behavior for the area and gradually builds up a definition of this typical behavior, including the size, speed and color of particular objects. It then normalizes the data, tagging any objects and patterns it observes. When something the AI sees falls outside of this typical behavior, it alerts security professionals.AI CCTV in public spacesCCTV cameras have long been used as deterrents for criminal activity or implemented to reduce the fear of crime in both public and private spaces. However, many older CCTV systems only aid in solving a crime after it has happened, which is often too late.Like typical CCTV cameras, AI CCTV stores information so any incidents can be reviewed. However, AI CCTV can detect and send alerts in real time. This means operators can send out mobile response units to manage a situation as it happens. These systems can also provide object tracking, where a red rectangle will appear on the screen and automatically follow the detected risk.Some cameras also feature a two-way audio system, so operators can speak to anyone in the area through an app on their mobile or tablet, leaving open the option for operators to talk down a possible intruder and prevent any criminal behavior from happening.There may also be the option to play pre-recorded audio announcements such as those about social distancing or potential hazards, which can improve public safety and provide further deterrents.Although a somewhat controversial aspect of video surveillance, facial recognition can be beneficial to identify known suspects of crimes or track vulnerable people who may need police or community intervention. A high-profile example of this occurring is the Capital Gazette newspaper shooting in 2018, when the Maryland police used facial recognition to help correctly identify the suspect.Similarly, some cameras, including those used in public spaces like hospitals and public transport, can also detect whether people are wearing masks or social distancing. These are particularly helpful for monitoring compliance to government rules and analyzing public behavior.The accuracy of AI surveillanceAI CCTV cameras are significantly more accurate than the more traditional systems, as they leave no room for human error. This substantially reduces the number of false alarms therefore the operating costs of these systems.A traditional camera’s view of a public space may be obscured by weather such as rain or fog or perhaps shielded by certain physical objects. For the human watching the camera, this can make any possible security risks challenging to discern. However, for the AI CCTV camera, it can look impartially at all the cameras in the area simultaneously and compare them to the many million reference images it processes to detect an intruder or hazard and more efficiently.Temporary AI CCTV towers are prevalent in private spaces like construction sites, where work is being carried out for a specific amount of time. However, AI CCTV can be implemented further in public areas, such as during events to monitor crowds.What is next for public space surveillance?AI CCTV cameras have shown how the security industry is constantly developing with the help of new technologies. Other features found in new CCTV camera systems include thermal cameras, solar-powered cameras and those with features like time-lapse and heat/fire detection.In something reminiscent of Tom Cruise’s Minority Report, some police forces in the UK have been trialing a system that will predict how likely individuals are to commit a crime so they can stop it before it happens. The system, which is the first of its kind, uses over a terabyte of data from local and national police databases, including records of previously stopped and searched people and their criminal records. The police found nearly 1400 indicators that could be helpful to predict crime. What happens after individuals have been detected is debated, but support from social services has been offered as a potential solution.Governments and police departments worldwide are constantly on the lookout for new features that will help prevent crime. CCTV is just one way they are hoping to improve safety, especially in public spaces. Along with their self-learning systems, features like object tracking, two-way audio and facial recognition make AI CCTV cameras an advanced and effective video security solution.This article originally ran in Security, a twice-monthly security-focused eNewsletter for security end users, brought to you by Security Magazine.

In recent years, extensive progress has been made with artificial intelligence: Watson, Siri, and deep learning are just a few examples that show how AI systems can now perform services which can be classified as intelligent and creative. Companies that want to optimize their business or save costs will hardly be able to dispense with artificial intelligence. A computer, much like a human, saves knowledge gleaned from experiences and can then independently derive solutions—based on algorithms—to new and unknown problems. To do this, a computer program analyzes samples and using self-learning algorithms, tries to recognize certain patterns and regularities in the data.
AI systems are, without a doubt, extremely useful
The world is becoming ever more complex, meaning that a well thought-out and wise use of our human resources is required. This is where high-quality computer systems can help. It also pertains to applications that require intelligence. The downside of AI is that the possibility of smart machines is something that scares many people who argue that intelligence is something unique, something that sets homo sapiens apart from mere machines.
The quest for an artificial copy of man and the issues associated with this are not entirely new. Our ancestors already invested much thought in the reproduction and imitation of thinking.
Economists expect that this technology will greatly increase prosperity. Previous studies have been restricted to investigating the impact of intelligent automation, for example, when machines in networked factories communicate with each other or when autonomous vehicles transport goods or people without drivers. This view, however, neglects other growth-stimulating effects of intelligent systems: artificial intelligence will support people in their work and make them more productive.
Economic growth through AI
According to a recent study by the consulting firm, Accenture, artificial intelligence will give the German economy a huge growth spurt. Many work processes will become more efficient and staff will be able to focus more on tasks with a high value added, as machines and programs take care of many routine activities formerly dealt with by not only assembly line workers, but also knowledge workers. According to a different study by McKinsey, the global market for AI services has an annual growth rate of up to 25% and is projected to be worth around 125 billion euros by the year 2025.
Machine learning is becoming more and more mainstream. While self-learning programs were only to be found in universities, research institutions, and some technology companies up until a few years ago, nowadays they are finding their way into ordinary products and solutions. Our everyday life and our business lives are increasingly being determined by intelligent programs that learn from data and extrapolate from what they have learned.
Speech recognition on mobile phones, for example, is essentially controlled by machine-learning algorithms, much like the spam filters in PCs and notebooks or face detection in the management of photos. We are often in contact with learning systems without being aware of it, such as personalized online advertising. More and more companies are recognizing the value of machine learning when it comes to optimizing their business and saving costs.
What work is left for the people?
Although robots can take over communications, computing, and thinking, there will be limits even here. There will still be the need for highly qualified professionals, such as engineers, architects, or judges. Also, tasks, where the dexterity remains beyond that of robot fingers, will remain for the foreseeable future.
Machines cannot replace the emotional intelligence of a person. Occupations that require social skills or creativity or represent a high-quality personal service cannot be substituted by AI.
Certainly, some professions will disappear completely and, in many areas, the requirements will change greatly. However, there is no need to panic just yet.
Flexibility is needed
Tech companies such as Apple and Microsoft want to automate as many working processes as possible with learning machines.
The employees of tomorrow must be more flexible because in the future man will have to adapt to the computer and not vice versa.
Employees will have to adjust to more flexible working practices: a fixation on permanent locations and times is often no longer required. This implies more flexibility and freedom on the one hand, but on the other hand, work and personal time will intermingle.
In addition to the technical expertise, specialist and managerial staff must bring a more in-depth process knowledge and have a higher willingness to undergo independent and ongoing training in the appropriate technologies. Furthermore, a good understanding of all security-relevant questions relating to IT technology and legal security will be a basic requirement.
New careers in IT
According to Bernhard Rohleder, Managing Director of BITKOM, new, exciting, and challenging jobs will be created. However, they require a good education and offer much creative freedom and responsibility.
The number of workers with low-grade qualifications will fall, but staff with correspondingly high, mainly digital skills are now already increasingly in demand. The number of employees in the IT industry has been increasing continuously for years, as do the number of vacancies in this sector that are difficult to fill.
And there’s more: even if artificial intelligence means that we are talking about machine learning, a harmonious combination of machine and human intelligence working as a single unit is required to develop theories and to confront new challenges. Working on the basis of the existing data, it is possible to develop company-specific business ideas, whether in the form of products, processes, or new data-based business models.
Conclusion:
Artificial intelligence will bring about a tremendous shift in the labor market. The important thing is to remain flexible and open to new ideas.

Artificial intelligence can learn how to perform routine tasks by looking at thousands of relevant examples. But it still needs human supervision.
Machines taking people’s jobs is already a cliché. Although we’ve been hearing this idea for decades now, but if we look around, there is no immediate threat. In fact, there is no threat at all, since we are just talking about another step of the technological revolution. Just like computers did not leave people out of their jobs in the ‘80s and ‘90s, AI will have a similar impact.
Forbes estimatesOpens a new window  that while 72% of Americans are worried about losing their jobs to AI, such concerns have no factual backing. The World Economic Forum saysOpens a new window  that 75 million jobs will vanish by 2022, but 133 million new positions will replace these. In fact, with the current rate of development, AI is not by far a competitor but at most a junior assistant.
Job vs.Tasks
To understand that, we need to think about the difference between a job and a task. In Henry Ford’s times, most jobs consisted of a single function or at most a few tasks bundled together. Now, these have already disappeared due to automation. Most positions are based more on thinking, reasoning, making logical connections, and using such skills as communication. Each job position consists of hundreds of interconnected tasks, daily.
AI can indeed be trained to perform repetitive tasks flawlessly if given enough (anything between 1,000 and 20, 000) good examples.
You are already experiencing this in Gmail’s predictive text. It can learn a lot more than simple sentences. However, it is highly unlikely it could replace a trustworthy office assistant in drafting corporate emails. It is more a matter of the assistant using predictive writing to finish this task faster and attend to other things, like travel planning or conference room setup.
Jobs to Be Revisited, But Human Skills Prevail
As described in the previous example, AI can take care of some of the most tedious tasks. This will call for a rethinking of most job flows, but it will not make them obsolete. Ii will also mean a significant change in the necessary training for specific jobs. The role of the humans will shift from performing the task to supervising the machine.
Right now, there are few jobs which can be completely wiped out due to AI. That happens because in every position there is a feedback loop. Some tasks are not fitted for machine learning. Everything which is related to people’s skills, judgment, and ability to combine information to create something new is beyond the current capacities of AI.
Automation will most likely speed up some parts of the jobs which are already considered tedious and time-consuming. It is a matter of giving employees the time back to be more human. This will likely result in people becoming more focused and creative.
Supervised Learning & Human Intervention
Before AI can be safely introduced in a workplace and become part of the natural workflow, it needs to be trained. The transition period in any company looking at these solutions will include a learning curve. Employees will need to learn the operating way of the AI and correct it as they would do with an intern.
When the system learns more, it will make fewer mistakes. Yet over time, it might even be necessary to re-label some things to help the software perform accurately.
Even after the “internship” period is over, the employee, not the machine, will still be held accountable for the results. The AI is just another tool, even if a highly impressive one. It will be more a matter of cooperation than replacement.
Of course, since AI saves a considerable number of hours, some people’s jobs will be at risk. When the employee just needs to supervise and correct the machine, far fewer human working hours are necessary. Yet, most companies will find new ways to use the workforce. There will be a consistent shift from low-skill to high-skill jobs.

Future Uses of AI
Coming back to the example with the office assistant, let’s imagine some of the tasks include documenting travel expenses. This means that information retrieved from invoices and tickets would need to be manually entered into some accounting platform. This is where AI can speed up the process through OCR. With AI’s help, the assistant can just photograph the travel documents, and the software will automatically identify the amounts and input them into the accounting platform. Of course, the assistant would need to take one final look and check the results.
The healthcare sector provides another example. Some radiology and oncology departments already use AI to augment doctors’ skills instead of replacing them. Dr. Tufia Haddad, an oncology expert, reports that she spends about two hours documenting each patient’s case. She hopes that AI will help her focus more on the patients’ needs and less on the bureaucracy. The perspective also includes the opportunity to build large, well-indexed repositories of information. However, these changes are met with resistance by the medical staff so far.
Which Jobs Will Not Be Replaced by AI
Even if AI can create art on its own, it is still tributary to what it has learned from countless examples provided by humans. The jobs which are safe from the “AI attack” are those focused on human interaction, value, and creativity.
Even if an AI system can self-teach some things, all jobs related to Big Data, Data Mining, and AI will still be on the rise. The medical sector is also safe, as we will still need physicians, nurses, and dentists: the AI is not capable enough to trust it with our lives.
Writers, editors, and graphic designers are also safeOpens a new window , while proofreaders should already think about new career options.
The overarching takeaway is that AI is a natural evolution of information technologies, and we are just witnessing another chapter in the technological revolution. It is a matter of one door closing, while many others will be opening.

Will 2019 finally be the year when AI-powered technologies find widespread acceptance in the world of work? Our six-part series on AI in HR is going to deep dive into every facet of AI in HR. 
While HR is not known for pioneering nascent technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a terrific opportunity. The consumerization of HR technologies has brought AI to the forefront of innovation in HR. From recruitment to employee experience, and talent management, AI has the potential to transform HR.
This issue of Succeeding with AI in HR will provide you with a basic understanding of what AI is, its applications in HR, and how it works. This issue is split into three parts: 1) AI basics, 2) the business case for AI in HR, and 3) five critical HR areas that AI is transforming.
PART 1: AI BASICS IN THE HR CONTEXT
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that aims to solve cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence. In other words, AI enables machines to “think like humans,” and perform tasks such as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and language processing. Today, AI is being driven by two fundamental technologies – machine learning and deep learning.(Click here to read: The complete history of AIOpens a new window )   
What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn from and make predictions based on data. The roots of machine learning are embedded in pattern recognition and the concept that algorithms can learn from recorded data without being programmed to do so. For instance, an algorithm that needs to identify cars will rely on images of other cars to teach itself what looks like a car. In this case, the end objective of the algorithm has been defined – which is to identify a car, but the steps to arrive at the objective is learned by the machine itself by training on data.

Key use cases of Machine Learning in the HR context:

Anomaly detection: Identify items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset.
	 
Background verification: Machine learning-powered predictive models can extract meaning and raise red flags based on structured and unstructured data points from applicants’ resumes.
	 
Employee Attrition: Find employees who are at high risk of attrition, enabling HR to proactively engage with them and retain them.
	 
Content personalization: Provide a more personalized employee experience by using predictive analytics to recommend career paths, professional development programs or optimize a career site based on prior applicant actions.
	 

What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that trains a computer to learn from large amounts of data through neural network architecture. It is a more advanced form of machine learning that breaks down data into layers of abstraction. Instead of organizing data to run through predefined equations, deep learning sets up basic parameters about the data and trains the computer to learn on its own by recognizing patterns using multiple neural network layers for processing (like neurons in the brain).
Considering the same car analogy from above, a deep learning algorithm can distinguish between a car and a truck by identifying the relationships between core elements of a car and a truck (car – 4 wheels, no loading bed; truck – 4 or more wheels, has a loading bed, etc.).
After sufficient training, deep learning algorithms can begin to make predictions or interpretations of very complex data.
 Key use cases of Deep Learning in the HR Context:

Image and video recognition: Deep learning algorithms outperform humans in object classification. Given videos and photos of thousands of applicants, deep learning systems can identify and classify candidates based on objective data.
	 
Speech recognition: While understanding human voice and myriad accents is difficult for most machines, deep learning algorithms can be designed to recognize and respond to human voice inputs. Virtual assistants use speech recognition algorithms to process human voice and respond accordingly.
	 
Chatbots: Natural language processing (NLP) trains chatbots and similar systems to understand human language, tone, and context. NLP will emerge as a crucial capability for AI systems as organizations continue to automate HR service delivery with chatbots.
	 
Recommendation engines: Digital learning experiences often involve personalized learning recommendations related to skill levels and professional interests. Using Big Data and Deep Learning, learning experience platforms can identify learning pathways that might interest individual employees.
	 

PART 2: The Business Case for Artificial Intelligence in HR   

Until recently, the primary benefits of HR technology were to improve efficiency and drive cost-savings by automating repetitive tasks. Today, smarter technologies are enabling HR teams to solve critical business challenges, drive exponential performance improvements and even impact larger business outcomes and profitability. AI is fueling HR’s transition from administrative to strategic to mission critical.


Fig. 1
Sandy Michelet, Director of People Strategy at SparkhoundOpens a new window  says, “AI will make HR more effective. End of story. It will not solve all problems but will allow HR to transfer their time currently spent on repetitive and administrative tasks to a more strategic approach. Many believe that AI will reduce human contact in HR but I believe it will do the exact opposite. Instead of an HR Generalist answering the same questions again and again, s/he can use that time discussing an employee’s development or internal process improvement.”
The top three business reasons for deploying AI in HR:


Employee experience
	 


A recent surveyOpens a new window  by Deloitte revealed that while nearly 80 percent of executives rate employee experience as important, only 22 percent believe their organization excels at providing a differentiated employee experience. The next competitive frontier for businesses is employee experience and the future of HR will be centered on the employee experience and personalizing engagement. In a time when employees have smart assistants at home and recommendation engines for when they shop, they expect a personalized experience when they come to work.
Speaking about how consumer technologies are shaping employee expectations at work, Jennifer Stroud, HR Evangelist & Transformation Leader at ServiceNowOpens a new window , says, “We have seen the need for chatbots, AI and machine learning in the workplace to drive more productivity as well as modern, consumerized employee experiences. These consumer technology solutions are exactly what employees want in the workplace.” 
A recent survey by ServiceNowOpens a new window  revealed that 30 percent of employees want a “Google-like” option to easily get the help and information they need at work. “Voice technology in the workplace is also a key consideration. Our survey found that 16 percent of employees want Siri, but to help answer work questions.  Beyond these considerations, an effective solution must be mobile, personal and provide the employee with options in terms of how they wish to engage and be supported,” adds Jennifer.
AI can be effectively woven into the entire employee lifecycle, starting with recruitment and onboardingOpens a new window , to HR service delivery and career pathing, to provide bespoke employee experiences.


Data-driven decision making
	 


HR agility has emerged as a critical theme for organizations in the war for talent. And HR agility is determined by the pace at which HR leaders can make sound business decisions. Unfortunately, for many organizations, the data-to-decision workflow looks like the figure below:


 
Fig. 2
 
While HR technology has made real-time data available to businesses, many still rely on manual methods to draw insights from data. This task is often left to end users or data analysts. This creates a bottleneck when trying to draw insights – causing delays. Decisions also continue to be made with outdated information. 
AI helps HR teams extract insights from data and deliver recommendations in real time. Natural Language Generation (NLG) software has the ability to transform data into data-driven text automatically, which makes it a valuable asset for HR teams across industries. AI also has the potential to remove many of the common human biases and inconsistencies in a function as sensitive to such factors as Human Capital Management. Thus, decisions powered by AI have the potential to be faster at scale and more data-informed, as well as more consistent, and unbiased.


Intelligent automation
	 


Intelligent automation combines AI with automation to enable machines to sense, understand, learn and act – either independently or with human assistance. Intelligent automation can perform not only manual tasks but also make intelligent decisions as a human would. Intelligent automation capabilities can enable machines to understand processes and their variations. Intelligent automation can be deployed across all repetitive manual processes to boost efficiency, productivity, and drive innovation.
AI in HR opens the door to limitless opportunities – imagine if an employee could learn new skills to match the pace of technological advances; they would be in complete control of their career! Now that’s an employee experience anyone would appreciate. As business performance becomes the focal point of all long-term HR strategies, AI has emerged as the most valuable ally for HR professionals.
PART 3: AI Is Transforming 5 Crucial Areas of HR 

Increased investment in smarter HR technologies has led to some interesting innovations in the AI ‒ HR space. Here’s a quick overview of the most significant ways AI is transforming HR for the better:

AI in Recruitment:Opens a new window  AI has made candidate sourcing, screening, and matching easier for organizations. In addition to improving efficiency, AI is also helping HR leaders overcome human-bias in decision making.
	Tammy Cohen, Founder and Chief Visionary Office of InfoMartOpens a new window , believes, “Language within job descriptions steers diverse, qualified candidates away from a position. Gender-coded language, which is language that lends itself towards the ideas and stereotypes surrounding different genders, can subconsciously deter qualified talent. For example, a man is less likely to apply for a job ad that describes the ideal candidate as ‘feisty,’ while a woman is less likely to apply for a job ad that seeks a ‘domineering’ candidate. When writing job descriptions, the employer may not mean to make these mistakes; everyone, in some ways, uses gender-coded language. That’s where artificial intelligence comes into play.”
“AI systems are being used to create inclusive job descriptions and review them for gender-coded language. With several large corporations embracing this on a company-wide level, it stands to reason that AI-augmented job descriptions will become more common,” she says.
	Here are some of the key use cases of AI in recruiting:


Candidate sourcing
Lead nurturing
Candidate screening
Interviewing
Onboarding


AI in HCMOpens a new window : AI is enabling organizations to meet increasing employee expectations by helping HR teams reimagine people and talent processes to build stronger teams, reduce employee turnover, and enhance the employee experience. A few major impact areas for AI in HCM include:


Performance management
Workforce planning
People analytics
Virtual assistants for self-service/HR service delivery
Career pathing
Leadership and coaching


AI in Employee Engagement: AI has been a catalyst for how businesses interact with their employees. Key uses cases include:

AI in Employee Benefits: AI and automation can ease the administration, implementation as well as management of employee benefits. Sparkhound deployed a chatbot to help demystify benefits for employees. Sandy says she’s already seeing positive outcomes from the deployment. She says, “We recently launched an HR BOT to answer the top 30 benefits questions we’ve received over the last four years. Part of the launch included a feedback button so we can continuously improve. Although it was a soft launch, I am already hearing positive comments about the ease of use and the immediate responsiveness. Right now, many employees (and HR people) believe that HR’s role is to provide human involvement every time the manager or employee needs assistance. I understand why….that has been the culture of companies since HR was called a ‘personnel department’. That was before everyone had a cell phone in their hand, shopped online and chatted with customer service.”

It’s easy to see that artificial intelligence (AI) is making a significant impact in every area of the enterprise, human resources and recruiting included. 
While AI and machine learning have the potential to automate mundane processes, streamline operations and make intelligent decisions, the rapid proliferation of this technology has ignited fear around job elimination and human interaction being replaced by cold, calculated robots.
Despite these concerns, a recent study by OracleOpens a new window  found that 93% of people are ready to take orders from a robot and more than a third of employees believe that AI will enable better customer and employee experiences. However, only 6% of HR teams are actively deploying AI and machine learning solutions. This gap reveals a missed opportunity for AI to help HR meet evolving employee expectations for a personalized, relevant work environment.
For many HR professionals, the anxiety surrounding AI lies in making this people-centric function less personable. What if, instead of making experiences more robotic, embracing AI could actually make HR simpler, more agile, and ultimately more human?
Utilizing artificial intelligence to re-humanize HR may sound counterintuitive, but when implemented correctly that’s exactly what can happen. Leveraging AI capabilities in tandem with other HCM solutions allows you to hire smarter, onboard better and retain longer.
The Ultimate Recruiting Experience
There are few things as daunting to an HR professional as recruiting. Not only is there incredible pressure to find the perfect fit, but it requires a significant amount of energy that often results in dead ends or hires that produce little ROI. Fortunately, AI has the ability to give back the most valuable thing in your job: time.
AI-backed tools like a best-fit candidateOpens a new window  can help organizations take a more strategic approach to recruiting. Continuously improving through new data and machine learning, AI can identify talent with characteristics similar to existing successful employees and proactively invite them to apply. This way, the only resumes your team will be sifting through are those of truly qualified candidates. And when the process eventually results in an offer, you’ll have data-backed justification for your hiring decision.
A Flawless Onboarding Process
On average, companies lose 17% of new hires within the first threeOpens a new window  months and 15% of those who resigned said that a lack of effective onboarding played a part in their decision to leave. New hires are already undergoing a major life change and an unorganized or difficult onboarding process doesn’t reassure them of their decision to join your organization.
HR teams are beginning to realize the role that a good onboarding experience plays in employee engagement, productivity, and retention, however, a surprising number of businesses still lack an intuitive, formalized process.
When AI is leveraged for employee onboarding, the results are outstanding. By embracing emerging technologies, Arizona Federal Credit UnionOpens a new window  was able to eliminate 60 hours per month on onboarding tasks and saved 115 hours during benefits open enrollment period alone.
Digital assistants also play a significant role in humanizing the onboarding experience. Between tax deductions and benefit elections, the onboarding process can vary greatly from employee to employee. Instead of relying on an HR representative for help with commonly asked HR questions, new hires can now chat with a digital concierge to get quick access and answers.

Minimized Employee Turnover
How often does your organization lose a great employee because HR had no insight to the person’s job satisfaction or whether they were being motivated in an effective way? Imagine the outcome if you had been able to tailor the employee’s experience to meet his or her specific needs.
AI tools can tackle this issue by providing teams with data-backed insights on what motivates, retains and entices employees so that managers can create a personalized work experience that meets both the employee and organization’s overall goals. Additionally, AI integrations are able to learn common traits of employees who resign and track the development of those trends in your workforce, flagging at-risk talent so that your team can proactively address concerns.
A Future of Endless AI Possibilities
In the talent economy, the future of your organization depends on attracting and retaining exceptional employees. Embracing the possibilities of artificial intelligence in HR, rather than shying away, can transition your organization’s environment from one that yields high turnover to a truly authentic, “human” experience.
Are you ready for the AI revolution? Your employees are.

At the end of the day, despite advances and potential of artificial intelligence and automation, a successful approach to HR still needs a human touch. 
Much has been written about the potential applications of artificial intelligence and automation in human resources. Both certainly have some remarkable applications and a great deal of potential. Thing is, they can also do a lot more harm than good. Here’s why, at the end of the day, a successful approach to HR still needs a human touch. 
Questionnaires designed to weed out unsuitable applicants. Automated systems that pore over a prospective hire’s resume and digital accounts to see if they’ll be a good fit. Self-service helpdesks and chatbots. Performance monitoring software that streamlines job evaluations like never before.
Artificial intelligence brings a lot to the table for human resources. A wealth of technological innovations that promise to revolutionize personnel management, talent acquisition, and onboarding in ways we never expected. Even in the face of such obvious good, many can’t help but worry that such systems will inevitably replace humans.Opens a new window  
They worry that as machine learning grows more advanced and artificial intelligence gets better at mimicking human intelligence, we’ll eventually become obsolete. This isn’t a fear limited solely to human resources, either. It’s prevalent in fields ranging from manufacturing to creative work. 
On the other side of the coin, you’ve decision-makers who approach AI like an overexcited five-year-old in a candy store.
Everything must be automated. In their eyes, there’s no such thing as too much AI.
Both these camps have one thing in common – they place far too much stock in artificial intelligence, and they lack an understanding of what machine learning actually entails. Maybe one day, we will see some sort of robot uprising. I doubt, however, that it will be within any of our lifetimes.
Artificial intelligence, no matter how formidable it becomes, is fundamentally different from human intelligenceOpens a new window . It’s great at data analysis, at generating insights that might be near-impossible for humans to see. But it can’t really understand those insightsOpens a new window . 
A system created through machine learning is not capable of intuition or subjective thought, but can only act based on the objective data placed before it. The greatest strength of AI, from a human resources perspective, is also its greatest weakness. It can analyze data without bias because it is incapable of bias. 
Humans, meanwhile, lean more towards subjective thought. Our decisions are colored by our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Perhaps more importantly, we’re able to pick up on things a machine might ignore-able, for example, to recognize certain behaviors as red flags that might go undetected in an entirely automated hiring process. 
Let’s say your business is looking to bring in a new Chief Information Officer. After posting a job listing, your HR platform sifts through each potential applicant based on a set of criteria you established in advance. Eventually, it creates a shortlist of three candidates.
On paper, the first is the best choice.
However, when you meet the three candidates in-person, the first candidate simply rubs you the wrong way. You can’t quite place your finger on it, but something is off about him. In spite of his credentials, you move on to the next candidate. 
You later find out he was convicted of corporate espionage at the company that eventually did hire him. 
That’s an extreme example, of course. But it demonstrates one major shortcoming of overreliance on automation. Machines can be fooled – and sometimes, they can be fooled more easily than people. 
There are other reasons a human touch is necessary as well, of course. Automated systems can be misconfigured and misapplied – a poorly-implemented hiring platform, for example, could eliminate a host of otherwise promising applicants. A completely-automated HR mediation process would leave all involved parties dissatisfied, and likely leave most issues unresolved.
In short, artificial intelligence is and will continue to be a means of augmenting your HR department. It has the potential to revolutionize how you manage your people, automating a wide range of business processes, reducing hiring bias, and simplifying sourcing and onboarding. However, in order to achieve any of those goals, it cannot be treated as a replacement for HR professionals. 
Rather, it should be seen another tool, one which ultimately leaves more time for the most important HR task of all – human interaction.

As artificial intelligence gets smarter and more ubiquitous, it’s changing the job acquisition process. Everyone from candidates to recruiters must update their skills and processes to make the most out of this 21st-century tech.
Once upon a time, a job-seeker could write one resume, submit it to multiple jobs with a personalized cover letter and that was enough. The recruiter or hiring manager would parse through the resume and cover letter, pulling out the relevant experience and transferable skills to find that diamond in the rough. The best recruiters were said to be able to analyze a resume in six seconds, filling in the cracks in the document and quickly identifying the best candidates. However, like almost everything in this world, the internet and technology have completely changed the hiring process for everyone involved, from the job-seeker to the hiring manager and staffing agencies in general. 
Sadly, the generic resume is no longer enough. Artificial intelligence looks at every resume and job application in direct relation to the specifics of the job you are applying to. As such, if you fail to show the similarities between your experience (through your resume) and your desired position you won’t make it passed the first round of shortlisting. The biggest mistake job-seekers make is not making their resumes aspirational enough. Write your experiences as if you’ve already got the job you’re applying for, or at least, match the skills you’ve got as closely as possible with the skills described in the job posting.
While recruiters (i.e humans) are able to see subtleties and nuances in your experiences that would make the role you’re applying for a logical progression in your career path, most forms of AI can’t. Though some AIs do have predictive algorithms, these are far from the norm. If you’re applying for a role that is more senior to your current role, you must match at least some of your skills to the role you’re going after. I’m not encouraging applicants to lie on resumes, but picking some of the specifics from the job posting to add to your resume means you’ll have a better chance of moving forward in the process. The generic resume is no longer enough because of the exacting nature of AI. 
Another tip to make it to the shortlist is to avoid listing the entirety of your work experience. While work experience is important, it’s better to bring up your extensive experience in the cover letter or during the interview. Work that you did 10-20 years ago probably isn’t relevant anymore (especially if it’s not working you’re doing presently). But if you include it in your resume it will be taken into account by the AI and will dilute the overall relevance score of your resume, making it harder for you to end up on the shortlist.

Speaking of shortlists, AI’s ability to generate accurate, well-matched lists of candidates from the thousands of applications most jobs get, has made the speed recruiters can fill placements even faster than before. In the past, creating an excellent list of candidates was a recruiter’s job so there is the worry that AI could cause “the death of the recruitment industry” (much how alarmists believe robots will take over all of our jobs in the next decade). As far as I see it, AI will lead to greater consolidation in the industry as a whole. There are over 20,000+ staffing agencies in the US alone, as firms become more competent with AI and as the technology advances and becomes more mainstream, I see more of these firms joining forces or at worst, shutting down. 
Technology may cause a shrinkage in the value of the overall permanent contingency market and contract market. AI will also probably change the way fees and costs are structured within the contract market as well.  It’s known in the recruitment industry that it takes an average of 42 days and $4,129Opens a new window  to hire one candidate according to an SHRM survey. As AI becomes more prominent and efficient, these figures will inevitably shrink. AI is only one example of the slate of new technologies that are revolutionizing staffing marketing. Blockchain and other complementary technologies are supporting and enhancing the capabilities of AI and our fast track towards automation means that hirers will be able to identify and attract the quality talent the need faster and cheaper than ever before. The AI of today may generate a great shortlist, but tomorrow it will be able to predict the future of current staff and pending hires, be able to understand who they are based on their resume and their social footprint. 
There are many changes coming to the recruitment/staffing industry and AI is just one of them. Blockchain and artificial intelligence will probably soon be joined at the hip, as AI’s ability to process and analyze mountains of information would be greatly helped by blockchain’s ability to verify that information. While there will be casualties from these changes, such is the nature of the world we live in. Those who can adapt to it survive and thrive, and those who can’t will have to move on.

There has been a lot of hype around how AI will lead to job loss. How does this impact the future of HR?  Can AI replace entire HR roles, or will this technology be a powerful enabler? In this article, we discuss: 

The extent of AI’s potential for HR 
5 HR jobs that AI is already taking over
Insights from Scout Exchange’s CEO, Ken Lazarus


In the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained a lot of traction in the HR field, with it being the core function of a range of technologies.
Gartner reportedOpens a new window  that nearly 1 out of 4 organizations that were already piloting/using AI were doing so in the HR domain. What does this mean for HR practitioners across the globe? Could some jobs be taken over by AI entirely? To explore this further, we spoke with Ken LazarusOpens a new window , CEO of Scout ExchangeOpens a new window , an AI-powered recruitment marketplace.
Learn More: The Beginner’s Guide to AI in HROpens a new window 
What Is the Extent of AI’s Potential in Replacing HR Roles? 
A lot has been said about how AI platforms will introduce large-scale automation, eliminating the need for some jobs. However, this is primarily limited to repetitive, process-based tasks that do not require too much human intervention.
As per a Gartner reportOpens a new window , AI can eliminate “millions of middle and low-level positions” in the next few years. But it also noted that AI would create 2.3 million additional jobs, which is significantly more than the 1.8 that Gartner predicts will be eliminated.
Interestingly, the impact of this trend on HR is multifaceted. On the one hand, HR has several strategic roles (formulating recruitment Opens a new window plans, providing executive coachingOpens a new window , etc.) that are unlikely to be taken over by AI. On the other hand, HR also has large volumes of tactical responsibilities that could be replaced by AI-led automationOpens a new window .
“AI won’t replace all of HR, but it will cause significant change and disruption, including the elimination of some jobs,” Lazarus commented.
“AI can be viewed as an automation technology (but for intellectual work rather than manual), and like any automation technology, AI will have the most impact on tasks which are higher volume and lower decision complexity,” he added.
So, what are those specific tasks/jobs that will be taken over by AI? We have identified five impact areas, where we already see significant moves.

5 HR Jobs That AI Can Easily Replace – for the Better
In HR, there is a clear distinction between repetitive tasks and key decisions that require human judgment. Interestingly, most HR jobs involve a bit of both.
For example, a recruiter might have to sift through hundreds of resumes, shortlist them, and schedule interviews – a cumbersome and effort-intensive process that could be taken over by AI. But the recruiter also has to engage candidates effectively across the hiring journey, with regular communication and a personal touch.
“Roles that focus on activities like screening and scheduling will be automated, but roles with a focus on the complex decisions associated with key steps like convincing a candidate to leave one job for another will continue to be a very human endeavor,” confirmed Lazarus.
Here are five HR jobs that have immense AI potential:
1. No more paper resume screening, at least for entry-level roles 

HR departments at large enterprises receive hundreds of resumes for every opening. And every resume deserves a look if you’re to identify the best-fit talent.
Expectedly, this takes up a lot of staff hours but cannot be automated through simple business rules either. Simple business rules wouldn’t be able to capture the nuances of what makes a best-fit candidate, the eligibility criteria you’re looking for, and how past hiring decisions inform the screening process.
This is where AI comes in. An AI engine learns from your hiring history, analyzes the company culture, and ranks applicants in order of their fitment. But remember that as a recruiter, it is your role to ensure that AI is doing its job well and not reinforcing biased hiring practices, for example.
A tool that is already making this possible is CvvizOpens a new window .
2. “Bigger and better” employee engagement surveys, fully automated

Another HR job that requires both manual and intellectual effort is employee engagement surveysOpens a new window . But you can use an AI chatbot to ask employees questions, record answers, and analyze them for insights. It would save HR hundreds of hours every year, not to mention increasing participation rates among the workforce.
AI could eliminate employee engagement survey tasks such as distribution across multiple channels or follow-ups with employees. And you could spend more time analyzing the responses and crafting a personalized employee experienceOpens a new window  strategy for your team.
A tool that is already making this possible is Xane.aiOpens a new window , a chatbot that integrates with Slack, Skype, Microsoft Teams, and even WhatsApp to make employee engagementOpens a new window  surveys dramatically simpler.
3. Passive candidate at your fingertips, with a high chance of first-time-right

In a competitive hiring environment, recruiters often turn to passive candidates to fill openings. This requires a careful study of social media, professional profile platforms, and job boards to identify potential prospects.
AI can scan a wide range of sourcing channels to auto-generate a shortlist of candidates for you to peruse. You can integrate AI with historical company HR data so that it can “learn” from past successes and failures. AI can go one step further to identify which candidate prefers what platform for communication – for instance, a Gen Zer might be more comfortable with Instagram while millennials may prefer Facebook. 
All of this intellectual effort is put in by AI so that you don’t have to. You can then work on building a strong relationship with the candidate and giving the candidate experienceOpens a new window  a positive head start. And a tool that is already making it possible is AryaOpens a new window . 
4. Low-effort pre-hire assessments through AI video analysis

Pre-hire assessments require the HR team to carefully evaluate each candidate before conducting interviews with the business team. This step in the hiring processOpens a new window  is particularly critical for mid- to senior-level hires. However, it takes a lot of time, and HR often has to work around busy candidate schedules to fit in an interview.
Enter AI-led video analysis. This allows candidates to shoot a video at their convenience and share it with recruiters, with the AI analyzing video data to identify work style, collaboration potential, and general cognitive ability.
While a human manager conducts the final interview, AI can take over initial pre-hire assessments. A tool that is already making it possible is HireVueOpens a new window . 
5. The days of trial-and-error in workforce scheduling are over
Workforce schedulingOpens a new window  is always a complex task, and this becomes even more difficult when you have a large field workforce, contingent employees, or a remote team.
Traditional workforce scheduling relies on spreadsheets, to-do lists, and staff availability forms to keep running. But this often leads to a trial-and-error approach, particularly when work volumes spike or there is an unprecedented change in staff availability.
AI transforms this entirely by optimizing your workforce potential. It can auto-create schedules that match employee preferences while keeping a keen eye on labor law compliance. Further, HR doesn’t need to update schedules manually – the AI engine can configure the schedules and send alerts whenever new data comes in.

AI Will Take Over Specific HR Jobs, not HR Roles
Science fiction often portrays AI as a futuristic technology driven by robots and autonomous machines. But the reality is different – AI can fit seamlessly into our daily lives, and while it eliminates certain jobs, it frees us up to route efforts in different directions.
And the same applies to HR as well.
“Will the future have ‘HR robots’ instead of HR professionals?  Not likely,” said Lazarus.
“But AI is here to stay, and it will replace or assist HR with activities such as recruiting, engaging, evaluating, and retaining talent. HR professionals need to embrace and prepare for this reality, where administrative skills are less important,” he added.
Going forward, HR will be able to offload a significant portion of process-based tasks (both manual and intellectual) and cognitive decision-making. The future of HROpens a new window  centers on a brand-new set of priorities, such as selecting the right workplace technology and building the employer brand, instead of a narrow focus on the efficiency of existing processes.
Do you think AI can replace HR by 2025? Or will AI simply be a driver for HR to reach greater heights?

Need to improve employee learning? Discover how artificial intelligence benefits learning management systems and streamlines the employee learning experience.
If we were to believe Hollywood, artificial intelligence is poised to take over the world and wipe out the need for humans entirely. 
But the reality of AI doesn’t quite match up..
Although we’re still exploring the potential of AI, the type of AI currently in use is commonly referred to as Narrow AI. Narrow AI focuses on performing a specific job or task and doesn’t have unlimited learning capabilities like in the movies. 
Today..
We use artificial intelligence in the form of Alexa, Siri, Google Home, online shopping, search recommendations, and more. If you’ve ever been automatically tagged in a photo on Facebook that’s Facebook’s image recognition AI at work. 
Artificial intelligence is at work in our lives every day without even realizing it. It serves to make our lives easier but still requires human input to function. Considering the increasing use of AIOpens a new window , one of the greatest opportunities for AI to be realized is in learning management systemsOpens a new window . 
What Is Artificial Intelligence? 
Before we jump into the use of artificial intelligence in learning and development, it’s important to understand what AI is. AI or artificial intelligence simply refers to the capability machines have to learn and process data on their own using data sets. 
Once a machine learns from the data they collect, they can make “decisions” on their own, based on the data they’ve collected.
Machine learning is simply an extension of AI and refers to machines that are trained to analyze data and trends. These machines build their own algorithms from the data they collect and use it to make “decisions” without human intervention. 
Learning Management Systems
Currently, AI plays a small role in learning and development systems through E-learning and learning management systems. 
These systems are some of the best ways to help students learn because they increase retention up to 60%Opens a new window , allow multiple students to receive instruction at the same time, and offer opportunities for improvements and customized education in the future.  
Data gathered by your LMS through surveys, ratings, comments, and course metrics needs to be updated by human hands. And even the best artificial intelligence can’t make up for poorly created content. 
Keeping learning and development up-to-date through LMS AI resources takes, time and even AI needs a little human help to enhance learning and development.

5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in 2019Opens a new window 
The Future of Learning Management
Today’s intelligent learning management systems help pinpoint where students need additional education and training as well as where you can optimize your course content in a faster and more accurate way than you can without the assistance of artificial intelligence. 
But AI’s role is constantly expanding across every industry. 
Perhaps the greatest realization for AI in the future of learning and development is that it will help anticipate the user’s learning path and behaviors, predict their learning needs and provide content based on how users learn best and increase the effectiveness of e-learning and LMS courses. 
Anticipated Learning Path
As AI continues to improve in the future, it will become easier for systems to create customized learning paths for individual users. 
Transforming learning and development through an anticipated learning path means that artificial intelligence will assess user performance and determine which information path is best for the user. 
AI with these capabilities will provide recommendations on what kinds of information a user’s needs, much like Netflix or Amazon provides recommendations on what shows you should watch based on your viewing behavior. 
Aside from helping users find better learning paths, artificial intelligence can also assist in learning and development by helping teaching professionals understand what their employees need to learn. 
Opportunity Highlight
Through data pattern identification, learning management systems collect data and statistics on students to find learning gaps and opportunities that teachers may not have noticed or realized. 
Using pattern identification, and data, artificial intelligence can help identify opportunities to merge new ideas with previous topics to create a well-rounded learning experience for the user. This allows administrators and teachers to cover learning gaps they may not even realize exist. 
Course Effectiveness
Artificial intelligence can also assist learning and development efforts by helping teachers find ways to make courses more effective. One of these ways is through gamification. If done properly, gamification can make learning more engagingOpens a new window  and increase information retention.
Increasing course effectiveness can also assist teachers directly by making it easier to find opportunities to make the course more effective, fill informational gaps, automatically grade students, help with onboarding, and get the instruction process moving. 
Artificial Intelligence in the Future of Learning and Development
Although there are many unknowns in the future of AI, applying the tools we have to improve the future of learning and development will help us create a more personalized approach to our e-learning and learning management systems. 
Artificial intelligence shouldn’t be looked at as a replacement of humans in the educational process, but as a support system that allows us to take individualized learning to the next level.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can imitate and amplify human prejudices, however, when used responsibly it can help overcome biases to make objective, data-driven decisions. Read on to learn more.   
When Amazon put together a team to work on its new recruitment engineOpens a new window  in 2014, it had high hopes. The experimental solution used artificial intelligence to rate candidates’ resumes to identify top talent. However, shortly after the solution was tested, the team found that the system was not rating candidates in a gender-neutral way. The algorithm, like any deep learning algorithm, relied on training with historical data. Unfortunately, the pre-existing real-world data embedded within it had patterns that exhibited gender bias, which the AI algorithm eventually incorporated into its functioning.
Also read: 3 Ways Artificial Intelligence (AI) will Transform RecruitmentOpens a new window 
Amazon’s recruiting engine was trained to evaluate candidates by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Unsurprisingly, most applicants were men, a reflection of the gender gap across the tech industry. As a result, the recruiting engine taught itself that male candidates were preferable. It penalized resumes that referred to identifiable gender information – for instance, if the engine came across a term in the resume that said a candidate was a part of a “women’s basketball team,” it assigned a lower rating to that resume.
Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of an AI program displaying signs of inherent bias. Remember Microsoft’s TayOpens a new window  chatbot that littered Twitter with racism and profanity? The old GIGO adage – “garbage in, garbage out” still holds, and feeding intelligence systems with incomplete or inaccurate data without safeguards remains a major threat to building an equitable world of work.
“It all comes down to what kind of data AI is using to make hiring recommendations,” says Caitlin McGregor, speaking exclusively to HR Technologist.  McGregor is the Co-founder and CEO at Plum, an I/O psychology inspired AI solution designed to counteract human bias. “It’s always been the standard to evaluate candidates based on skills and knowledge — think degrees and years of experience — which can trigger biases when a hiring manager sees a resume that name drops Harvard or a prestigious unpaid internship. These qualifications tend to point to privilege, not necessarily job fit. So, when AI-based hiring solutions rely on skills and knowledge, such as resume and social media scraping tools, it’s just perpetuating the same biases, but at a larger scale.”

So, is it safe to use AI-based tools for recruitment at all?
Caitlin believes **the key to overcoming bias is to get past our obsession with skills and knowledge and focus on talents, which include things like innovation, adaptability, and communication.** “In other words, the things you can’t find on a resume,” she says.
“The foundation of talents is a combination of traits and competencies that can be captured by measuring applicants’ personality, problem-solving ability, and social intelligence. Decades of Industrial/Organizational Psychology research not only proves that talents are four times better at predicting future success than skills and knowledge, but they’re a whole lot less biased, too.”
HR leaders like Caitlin have good reason to be critical of traditional hiring practices that perpetuate cognitive biases. “I think generally talent professionals want to evaluate candidates on more than just a piece of paper, but they just don’t know how,” she says. “The first step is admitting our unquestioned method of using resumes as the first step in the hiring process needs to be scrutinized. AI can help — but if we’re truly going to commit to moving beyond resumes to make the hiring process less biased and more predictive, that means we also have to move beyond AI that simply automates resume keyword matching.”
Also read: Artificial Intelligence: Coming Soon To An Office Near You. Or Is It?Opens a new window 
**The real opportunity that AI presents in recruitment is scalability and automation to a practice such as Industrial/Organizational Psychology that once relied on (often costly) consultation services.** “The predictability and objectivity of talent data can now be democratized and available to all, not just Fortune 500 companies,” opines Caitlin.
A common misconception among people is that AI simply automates established practices; however, the development of sophisticated AI programs now enables solutions to go beyond just automating repetitive tasks to tackling complex problems that human cognition is too limited to tackle. Caitlin believes, “this is the kind of AI that can go beyond simple resume screening and actually make more objective, predictive decisions — when fed the right data.”
Will AI replace human recruiters?
While the adoption of black-box solutions across industries is on the rise, such solutions replacing humans is an unwarranted fear. AI can serve recommendations based on pattern recognition or candidate matching; however, selling the job to the candidate, or building a relationship with the candidate will ultimately depend on a human recruiter.
“As cliché as it sounds, AI can truly make the hiring process more ‘human,’ by eliminating menial and repetitive tasks to allow hiring professionals to focus on human relations,” says Caitlin.
**As the recruiting function embraces a more objective, data-driven approach, AI will enable recruiters to make faster and smarter hiring decisions, and not make those decisions for them.**

Choosing the right AI recruiting solution
At a time when nearly every vendor in the HR technology space claims to have integrated artificial intelligence into its workflows, how do you assess AI solutions that meet your hiring needs?
Caitlin shares three key considerations that HR leaders must take into account before zeroing in on an AI recruiting solution.
The first consideration is scalability. “AI in hiring is meant to act as a solution to expensive, inefficient consulting services and hiring team pipelines. If the AI you’re using doesn’t save you time, money, and resources, then it’s not doing its job. An AI product should also be able to grow with your company as it grows. If it’s not a long-term solution, then the technology is falling short of its purpose,” says Caitlin.
The second point is consistency. Caitlin’s advice to HR leaders looking to acquire AI recruitment solutions is to ensure that the AI can accurately qualify candidates across all organizational functions. The solution must be capable of assessing candidates for engineering roles or mid-management roles just as easily as it assesses candidates for sales roles.
Also read: The Role of Artificial Intelligence in RecruitmentOpens a new window 
The third and the most important parameter is kind of data the AI solution uses for assessments. “The bulk of hiring AI solutions on the market are using data that is scraped online. Most hiring AI solutions, therefore, are using the same data sets! You don’t want to look up one day and realize your entire office is made up of white men named Jared who went to Ivy Leagues, played lacrosse, and read Harry Potter (this is an actual example I heard about at a Society for Industrial-Organizational Psychology conference)! You want to look up and see a team comprised of people that possess the qualities most important to your company. It’s what the saying “garbage in, garbage out” means — if your AI is relying on useless data, you’re going to get useless results. Because AI isn’t magic. To put yourself in a position to build a diverse team, it’s important to look at talent acquisition AI solutions that create and synthesize objective, predictive, and new data,” says Caitlin.
**When assessing the efficacy of AI recruiting solutions, it all boils down to the data that is fed into the system.** Amazon’s recruitment engine stands testament to this fact.
In conclusion, AI should be viewed as an opportunity, and not as an inhibitor to social equality. After all, it is easier to remove biases from algorithms than from humans, so ultimately AI has the potential to build a fair, diverse and equitable world of work.

AI has the capacity to make decisions in real-time, based on pre-installed algorithms and efficient computing technologies. With an HR department encompassing the human element and AI, companies can provide an enhanced experience for their candidates and employees, writes Khalid Durrani, Digital Marketing Manager, Cubix.
“Deep-learning will transform every single industry,” said Andrew Ng, a Chinese-American scientist excelling in machine learning and AI. McKinsey’s forecast on machine learning backs up his statement claiming that by 2030, AI will have a significant impact of $13 trillion on the global economy.
The Human Resource department will also witness the influence of AI. HR professionals understand the importance of optimizing the combination of the human mind and machine learning for a seamless workflow and intuitive work environment.
AI has the capacity to make decisions in real-time, based on pre-installed algorithms and efficient computing technologies. With an HR department encompassing the human element and AI, companies can provide an enhanced experience for their candidates and employees.
Additionally, artificial intelligence can help businesses understand their target market and promote result-oriented sales strategies.
AI is the ability of machines to imitate human intelligence. AI technology allows machines to learn and adapt automatically based on the data analysis to provide more refined responses to the situations. So, the question is how does AI impact Human Resource, a department that relies on its human factor.
Let’s explore the influence of AI in HR:
Talent Acquisition
The most prominent use of AI in HR is seen in the talent acquisition processes. From screening candidates, maintaining databases, scheduling interviews, and answering job seekers’ queries, it reduces manpower spent on mundane tasks.
It reduces hiring time significantly, allowing the HR team to be more productive in other areas like sourcing, recruitment marketing, employee management, and more. The AI-enabled screening will help in picking out the candidates with the most suitable skill set, relevant experience that fit the company’s requirements.
AI-based chatbots can communicate with potential candidates and match their profiles against the position requirements. It will narrow down the list to only those aspirants that fit the job description. The AI-enabled system will then schedule interviews and hire the top applicants.
It will save time and effort of the HR team, allowing them the opportunity to focus their energy on other tasks.

Onboarding
After the hiring processes, the AI-integrated system will introduce the new employee to the company information on their first day. From job profile to company policies, the reporting authority, team members, task assignment, and other information, will be automatically relayed to them through an app or laptop. The entire process is defined as onboarding.
Onboarding is a vital part of improving employee retention rates and increasing HR productivity. One study by Click Onboarding states that there is a higher probability of employees staying with a company long-term if they experience a superior onboarding.
Artificial intelligence allows customization of the process to cater to individual employees and their respective positions. Algorithms can be integrated within the software for:

Explaining job profile, duties, and benefits.
Relevant and important contacts within the company.
Answering frequently asked questions by new employees.
Document verifications
Device requests, and more.

Learning and Training
AI-integrated systems can also help in teaching and training the employees in their respective domains. The skills required by a job position are constantly changing with time. With new innovations and software in the market, it is imperative that we learn and adapt to the new technologies to stay on top.
AI will assess the employees’ skills and recommend videos or learning programs based on their job requirements. It will automatically read documents or analyze an employee’s activities and create appropriate learning programs.
AI technology can analyze the data collected from years of experience and inform the HR team which employee needs training and in what field. With intelligent algorithms, it will also recommend the best strategy to help people learn better and faster.
Additionally, companies can leverage AI technologies with e-learning platforms to enhance employees’ skills. It will devise a custom training regimen for individuals based on their skills and the company’s requirements. The e-learning platforms will help employees learn new techniques, polish existing characteristics, and more at a pace they find comfortable.
Moreover, an AI system can be integrated with an algorithm that determines the career path for individuals based on their training plan. The managers can use the results to turn their team into a more cohesive workforce.
Cognitive-Supporting Decision-Making
IBM conducted a study in 2017 over how cognitive computing will influence HR. The research revealed that artificial intelligence can help professionals make quick decisions on day-to-day matters.
The Human Resource department is responsible for the mental, emotional well-being of an employee apart from their work contributions. AI-enabled systems will take over the task of observing and analyzing employees’ mood before and after a client call. The HR can then decide if the individual needs a break or can continue.
AI can also detect anxiety in a person’s behavior and tone of voice. It will help the employers decide if they should look into the matter and resolve it before it is harmful to the employees and the company.

Leadership
As AI helps improve employee productivity, it can also help train leaders to excel in their position. AI-enabled systems will ask the leaders’ team members and assess their remarks to determine a customized coaching module for the leaders.
Additionally, the leaders can access online dashboards and view a comparison of their management against their peers. It will help them understand the effectiveness of their methods and how to improve.
Administrative Tasks
AI-based software can automate repetitive, administrative tasks. It can play a role in HR strategy, employee management, analysis of company policies and practices, manage payrolls, and more. It can automate the workforce, investigate corporate compliance, and litigation strategies.
From screening to interview scheduling, AI can speed up hiring processes. Additionally, it can also allocate office space and equipment allowing HR staff to direct their time to more valuable tasks.
Smart chatbots are another AI-based technology that can help in HR’s decision-making. It can relieve the HR staff of relaying company-related information to employees, simultaneously providing them with an overall view of the organization. With proper algorithms, AI-enabled systems can give prompt responses to employees’ queries, doubts, and manage the submission and processing of leave forms.
Wrapping Up!
Artificial intelligence requires a lot of data to work efficiently for which it needs proper storage and management. Companies would need extra personnel to operate and maintain the advanced software. Additionally, with the rising preference of SaaS solutions, the low datasets for AI will also pose difficulty in the worldwide adaptation of the technology.
The ideal strategy to employ AI in HR management would be to use AI software to analyze the data collected and leave the decision-making to the human staff. Before implementing AI within HR operations, examine the areas where AI could be useful. If the primary reason is to improve the overall employee experience, it could increase productivity and decrease operational costs.

With the rise of always-on connectivity, the lines between work and personal life are rapidly getting blurred. Employees are more unwilling than ever before to show up on time, with “late to work” numbers more than doubling between baby boomers and millennials. We spoke to Steven Power, Global President at Deputy, AI-based scheduling software for businesses, to discover: 

The nature of tardiness and why employees need to be “set up for success”
Three ways in which AI-based scheduling solves tardiness and other shift worker challenges 
How AI-based workforce scheduling software can make the difference between turnover and retention


The ubiquitous use of technology has had an interesting side effect. With employees logging in anytime, anywhere, and with always-on connectivity expected across the day, the notion of “work hours” has begun to change.
As a result, tardiness has seen a steady rise in the last few years, with digital native workers more likely to come in late (or even early). Deputy’s 2019 Late to Work ReportOpens a new window  recently revealed that in the last one year, 1.1% of millennial women and 1.3% of millennial men regularly started their shifts after significant delays. In comparison, only 0.5% and 0.6% of Baby Boomers were “tardy.”
We spoke to Steven Power, Global President at DeputyOpens a new window . He shared valuable insights on how cutting-edge technologies like AI can help pre-empt tardiness and encourage better shift-worker productivity. 
Learn More: How Is AI Transforming Workforce Management?Opens a new window 
Is Tardiness a Personality Issue? Or Is It an Operational Challenge? 
The failure of a worker to start a shift on time can be attributed to several reasons. Often, hourly workers are placed under immense pressure, switching between their professional space and personal obligations. They also operate in high-demand, high-volume industries such as retail, healthcare, manufacturing, and other essential service providers. As a result, they could run a risk of turning up late despite the best intentions. 
In the digital era, always-on connectivity is another contributing factor. Because modern employees are always expected to be available through Slack, email, or the company intranet, they are less likely to take mandatory work hours as seriously as earlier generations. 
This is why tardiness in the workplace needs to be addressed through a multifaceted technology-empowered strategy. 
Power discussed how AI-based workforce scheduling toolsOpens a new window  can set shift workers up for success and help them achieve their desired productivity goals. “Employees can update their app settings to receive push notifications directly to their phones or email that will remind them of upcoming shifts. This enables them to better track their schedules and ensure punctuality when showing up for shifts.”
“They can also receive direct alerts with schedule updates, shift swaps, and even find replacements for shifts with the mobile app,” he added.

3 Benefits of Adopting AI-based Workforce Scheduling 
How does AI-based workforce scheduling software work? Power explained that such software “uses artificial intelligence to build business owners the best shift structure for their businesses, based on as many metrics (demand signals) as they require.” Such demand signals, he added, could be “sales, foot traffic, food/drink orders, table bookings, tickets sold, etc.”
With AI taking key factors that are critical to scheduling into consideration, businesses and a distributed hourly workforce can benefit significantly. Here’s how.
1. Optimizes schedules for maximum productivity

Data pouring in from different sources and parameters are taken into account when defining schedules. This ensures that no employee’s work-life balance is unnecessarily breached.
AI can also estimate work volumes, ensuring there is always an employee available to get the job done. As a result, businesses can achieve significant bottom-line improvements at minimal additional efforts. 
2. Better leverages idle workers to boost ROI 

The AI engine can also regularly assess for an idle employee, helping to optimally utilize the entire workforce.
Power outlined how this is achieved. “The AI schedulers typically include a shift swap feature that allows employees to directly swap out their shift with an appropriate colleague. In the case that an employee can’t make their shift, it can be opened up to everyone in the team or a select group, allowing alternative employees to claim open shifts on a first-come, first-served basis.” 
3. Stays in-sync with the latest regulatory norms and guidelines 

Another area where AI workforce scheduling can help is compliance. Industries employing shift workers are usually highly regulated, mandating strict compliance with labor laws.
“If a business owner is concerned with providing equal hours to every employee, the AI scheduler can take into account the hours each employee is scheduled for and will attempt to keep hours equal amongst employees. This enables companies to create, optimize, and fill legally compliant schedules across industries such as retail, restaurants, and healthcare,” Power commented.

Leveraging Smarter Scheduling as a Driver for Retention 
Turnover rates among shift workers have always been a concern for these industries. For instance, hourly store employees (retail) witnessed a massive 65% turnover rate in 2018Opens a new window  – compared to the U.S. cross-industry average of 15% only. 
Power believes that AI-based workforce scheduling will give employees better visibility over their workday, allowing them to plan ahead and minimize delays. “Predictability leads to employee retention and can be a boon for talent recruitment. Ultimately, by adapting to the adoption of AI in the workplace, especially for automated scheduling and regulating schedules, employees prove to have higher satisfaction rates and flourish while accomplishing delegated tasks in their place of work.”
Organizations can proactively explore smarter scheduling practices enabled by AI. Fair opportunities, enhanced predictability, and improved work-life balance will help shift employees stay engaged – improving retention and eliminating short-term unwillingness to work.

Artificial intelligence is showing no signs of slowing down – it will soon touch nearly every part of how business is conducted. In order for AI implementation to be successful, employers must follow a few key steps in order to make the transition as smooth as possible and get employees comfortable with this new technology.
The workplace is evolving. No matter the industry, artificial intelligence (AI) will soon touch nearly every part of how we conduct business. How employers adapt to this ongoing evolution of technology in the workplace can impact everything from operations and recruiting to a business’ bottom line. With more than 80 percent of enterprises using some form of AI, it’s a technological advancement that is showing no signs of slowing. From internal operations to customer engagement, understanding how to interact with this technology is critical to being an effective and competitive worker — and employer — today. 
With Gen Z now entering the working world, younger generations are starting to tip the scales of the American workforce. Pew Research Center reported that while the younger workforce is growing rapidly, older generations are maintaining employment for longer, meaning a generational collide is happening in working environments across the globe. Employees with vastly different backgrounds, particularly in technical aptitude, are expected to navigate the changing landscape at the same level. 
One of the biggest challenges? Getting these employees to understand how to work with artificial intelligence. 
In order for your staff to be comfortable utilizing artificial intelligence, employers must follow three key steps to successfully onboard employees for AI in the office, regardless of background or skill set. 
1. Bridge the AI education gap
When implementing AI for your business that requires either employee engagement or a customer-facing experience, employee education and comprehension is critical to successful deployment. “AI” can carry a level of intimidation with it, so it’s important to remind people that it’s AI that helped Amazon recommend the great spy novel they just finished, and AI that Netflix relied on to recommend their new guilty binge pleasure.
With any new technology, there will be a learning curve as employees explore working with AI. Employers need to prioritize the investment and make AI onboarding accessible through tools, training, and resources that foster smooth implementation. Artificial intelligence can be like a virtual teammate, handling new employee onboarding and everyday questions that can slow down individual workflow. It can be the front line for questions that everyone across the org asks, like, “How do I add a new dependent to my health insurance,” “Where do I find my 2017 review,” or, “What holidays do we have off this year?” Imagine any question that is asked by one colleague to another instead being asked of a virtual teammate first — and how much time that would free up for employers to focus on the work that really matters.
While training (or even re-training) today’s workforce on how to work with AI takes resources, it delivers huge returns on the investment. Employees gain valuable skills for their personal development and become more efficient and valuable to the company. In order for AI to be successful in the workplace, everyone needs to be on board. 
2. Demonstrate the value of AI
Getting employees comfortable with AI also means calming any misguided fears of a “robot takeover.” Team members need to view AI as a workplace asset that allows them to work better, not as a threat to their job security. Rather than replacing employees, AI actually allows team members to be more productive in their workday by offloading mundane tasks, streamlining workflows and removing redundancies from processes and administrative work. Today, employees switch apps more than 1,100 times a day. A recent study predicts that AI workplace implementations can increase labor productivity by up to 40 percent. 
While necessary to the success of a company, administrative tasks, onboarding processes, zero-level IT and customer support create an unintentional pain point for businesses and their employees, resulting in significant time and resource loss. We’ve all had a soul-crushing moment where we can’t find the one thing we need to complete a simple task at work. AI tools can alleviate that universal pain point, allowing employees to focus on more valuable, high-level work.
There’s also the broader business value to consider. The link between the revenue growth and AI maturity of business is clear, with 76 percent of business leaders recently noting AI as a fundamental strategy to their organization’s overall success. AI is good for business and for employees.

3. Encourage employee engagement
Employers need to demonstrate how AI and employees can work together to drive a more fulfilling and productive work environment. Various forms of AI, like machine learning, source and identify patterns that are flagged to a human counterpart to analyze and take action. This could be anything from anomalies in data patterns that lead to flaws in operational systems to trends in customer relationship management software. 
Human insights are critical to truly taking advantage of the benefits of AI in an organization. For example, a chatbot tool like Jane.ai mines information across a workplace’s entire database — documents, email, and applications — to surface near-instant information for employees. While the tool adapts and learns over time, part of its success depends on employee engagement where team members “teach” Jane by inputting information not found in the company database that is then stored in her memory from that point on. While machines will continue to advance and likely be able to mimic cognitive function in the future, the human element — creativity, ingenuity, instinct — will always play an important role in the overall success of its implementation. 
And the AI doesn’t just make business run more smoothly. The idea is to create a virtual teammate that helps with all aspects of work-life’s questions — from, “When does open enrollment start,” to, “Who’s the best photographer in the office,” and even, “Where are the coffee filters?”  
AI technology presents so many opportunities for the modern workforce, and employee support is key to its success. 79 percent of HR leaders and 60 percent of employees believe a failure to adopt AI will have negative consequences on their own careers, colleagues, and overall organization. Stated more simply: people and companies who adopt AI will thrive; those who don’t are sure to fall behind. 
Successful AI implementation, for any company regardless of industry, requires that employers invest in employee education and that team members understand the value of AI and engage with it to improve it over time. That value is fully realized when AI can do the mundane tasks that workers don’t want to do, enabling people and teams to focus on what only humans can do: create and innovate.

The article explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is improving the recruitment process by identifying a job seeker’s skills and abilities required for a job and simplifying the process of candidate matching.
Using artificial intelligence (AI) in the recruitment process is far from science fiction. Applicant tracking systemsOpens a new window  are already here, and they’re making the job of human resources professionals a whole lot easier.
Undercover Recruiter statsOpens a new window  suggest that AI applications will replace 16 percent of HR jobs in the coming 10 years. The general belief is that AI will enhance the recruitment process by simplifying onboarding, carrying out relevant new employee training, keeping track of applicants and employee development, as well as assisting applicants who may have questions.

Source:https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-solutions/global/en_us/blog/2017/11/AI-recruiting-chart-hero.jpg
Applicant tracking through machine learning is of particularly high interest. While AI simplifies the challenging process of sifting through resumes, recruiters can focus on more strategic aspects of the process. How do such systems work, are they reliable, and do they bring a sufficiently high return on investment? Let’s attempt to answer these key questions right now.
How Does AI Applicant Tracking Work?
Resume screening and the invitation of the best candidates to a job interview is considered one of the most tedious parts of the process by many HR professionals. Depending on the specifics of the position and the requirements, a company may receive from dozens to thousands of resumes.
Finding the right talent is critical for businesses, but currently, the process is rather ineffective and costly. The cost of onboarding one new employee can reach 240,000 dollarsOpens a new window , the Society for Human Resource Management reports. At the same time, the risk of hiring the wrong person is high because HR professionals will often rush through the process. In a survey, 43% of recruiters said that they made a bad hire because they felt pressed to fill a position fast.
Through the use of artificial intelligence solutions, this cumbersome process can be automated.  By using post-hire information, functionalities can be added to the applicant tracking system (ATS) that the company utilizes. As a result, better recommendations and choices can be made when new candidates are examined for a certain position.
Insights about the current employee experience play an important role in the automation of the process. Also, the system will take qualifications and skill sets into consideration. Based on all of this data, artificial intelligence can rate new candidates to determine whether they’re a good match for the job being offered.
The Google Hire technology is one example of a recruitment-focused machine learning solution. Its launch was announced in April 2018, and the solution became available in July. Through the use of the application, recruiters can put together a smart list of former candidates who may be a good match to current positions being offered by the company. By implementing additional candidate discovery, Google Hire can determine how profiles match a job description or the location of the company looking for new team members.
While Google Hire is currently aimed at either passive or pre-determined candidates, the same premise could apply to a completely new set of job seekers. Machine learning makes it possible to identify the skill and capabilities required for a certain open position. Adding location to the set of criteria enables the app to make even more relevant candidate suggestions.
On top of sorting through candidates, artificial intelligence applicant tracking solutions can also simplify the process of candidate matching. Based on the job requirements, the app will select the strongest matches after analyzing each candidate’s skills, education, location, salary preferences, etc.
This capability doesn’t have to be restricted to the pool of individuals who have applied for a specific job. The search could be extended to individuals who have previously submitted their resume or who are regularly looking for new positions within the organization. The process is another highly challenging one for the HR team, and machine learning can help here as well.
Adoption and Effectiveness of AI Applicant Tracking Solutions
Machine learning software requires a lot of data to learn how to make the right decisions. This is why the adoption of such solutions is still in its early stages. Many small and medium-sized companies may feel discouraged from giving them a try due to the information that has to be fed to the app to increase the effectiveness of the applicant tracking and sorting process.
There’s another challenge to the recruitment process, and it stems from the old-school reliance on resumes to identify the right candidate. Standardized resumes are potentially biased and inaccurate. In order to screen applicants, machines have to be provided with accurate information. This reliance has contributed to HR professionals making notoriously bad decisions for the selection of good candidates. **AI solutions can rely on a much wider pool of data, and when such information is available, a comprehensive and unbiased profile can be created.**
Recent reports suggest that only one percent of Fortune 500 companies are relying on artificial intelligence tools for enhanced recruitment processes. However, such data may be misleading. AI recruitment and candidate selection Opens a new window may be featured as a capability within a more comprehensive software solution that the business relies on. The fact that companies aren’t opting for AI candidate tracking solutions specifically does not necessarily mean such tools are not a part of the HR process.
The chances are that adoption will become much more widespread in the years to come. The ROI guaranteed by AI applicant tracking solutions is one of the primary reasons why.
For a start, machine learning can eliminate the number of bad hires – a problem that we’ve already highlighted as rather costly. A bad hire can cost businesses a lot due to the specifics of the onboarding processes. Fewer mistakes will diminish the loss of important resources.

Jay Srinivasan, founder, and CEO, atSpoke explains how artificial intelligence is transforming wellness in the workplace
While artificial intelligence continues its sweeping disruption across the enterprise, the last couple of years, in particular, have demonstrated a growing ability to transform human resources administration. We’ve seen applications for reducing recruiting biases, advanced analytics for determining the voice of employees, and a rise in virtual assistants to offload work for HR professionals. Still, with an increasingly digitally native workforce, AI is finally being trusted with more complicated and sophisticated issues.
One of those more complicated areas, in particular, is workplace wellness and, more specifically, mental health. Employers now know that ensuring employee wellness is core to creating a positive employee experience, and study after study has shown that modern-day employees evaluate their potential jobs based on employee experience. It’s even been tied to higher profits. 
So, as we move deeper into a new decade that will no doubt be dominated by AIOpens a new window  — and at a time when HR teams are increasingly sensitive to worker wellness and experience — there are two big ways I see AI helping to transform wellness in the workplace:
Wellness through AI software
As much as scientists are trying to emulate distinctly human characteristics in advanced AI applications, the truth is that what makes us superior [at least for the next decade] is a dependency — our need for social bonding and interpersonal communication. We are social creatures that must have meaningful connections with peers and cannot live [sanely ] in a human-to-human contact vacuum. AI couldn’t care less (well technically can’t care at all); it continues executing its programmed fate ad infinite. From a work-production standpoint, this may seem like a disadvantage, but I’d argue that “weakness” is where we derive our greatest strength. Human creativity often comes from a healthy casserole of collaborations, anxieties, boastings, fears, and excitements. The problem is that the mundane repetitiveness of our jobs stands in the way, making it AI’s job to enable flexibility and enable collaboration, communication, and engagement. 
In the workplace, peer communication and collaboration are some of the most important imperatives for ensuring a healthy, productive organization. When that breaks down, and companies don’t foster a communicative and engaging environment, stress levels, feelings of isolation, and burnout rise. A 2019 studyOpens a new window  by employee communication and engagement technology firm Dynamic Signal found that approximately 80 percent of U.S. workers were stressed and ready to quit because of ineffective workplace communication. 
That means HR should integrate, associate, and possibly brand AI applications for collaboration as wellness and “employee experience” tools where HR applications for AI come in. Enterprises must create environments for the way individuals work, and increasingly dispersed workforces, greater use of independent contractors, and more decentralized enterprise management means that HR has a tremendous opportunity to package and position its AI technology use as part of their wellness initiatives. HR, more so than many other departments, should be responsible for future-proofing businesses, which is right in AI’s wheelhouse.

Using AI for mental health conversations
Fresh data suggests that employees are starting to seek out their companies’ mental health resources more often, and those conversations are increasingly starting via AI. 
At Spoke, we recently analyzed hundreds of thousands of employee queries across dozens of employees (note: all data is private, anonymized and siloed across each organization), aggregating for terms related to mental health, including “mental health,” “depression,” “burnout,” “anxiety” and others. The results demonstrated a surprising 410% spike in 2019 compared to 2018. But, that’s not necessarily a bad indicator.
Younger generations are increasingly OK with discussing mental health openly and are willing to do something about it in the workplace. Many have even reported quitting a job because of mental health implications. Married to our data, and you see that AI is increasingly a starting point for those conversations, and smart employers are doing everything they can to facilitate them. 
Why AI? Artificial intelligence’s continuous understanding of language with its discretion around personal matters gives employees more comfort to initiate conversations that are perceived by the employee to be embarrassing. Then there’s AI’s speedy response time. People suffering from job stress often are experiencing issues at the moment and want to feel like they have a quick pathway forward. As such, AI is sometimes viewed as a meta-layer of bureaucracy that deflects from humans.
However, while that is correct at the exact moment of questioning, AI also can rally additional help from the right people; if requested, and martial, those resources are expected more quickly. An internal survey we conducted across dozens of employers found that a majority of employees expect correct responses to workplace queries within five hours.
It does pose an interesting irony about AI. It’s often perceived cold, emotionless calculus, in this case, might be its advantage. Interestingly, a recent global survey of 8,300 HR leaders conducted by Oracle and FutureWorkplaceOpens a new window  found that an astonishing 64% of workers trusted AI chatbots more than they believed their managers.

The bottom line is that enabling greater wellness and more support for mental healthOpens a new window  in the workplace is both an economic and moral imperative for businesses. According to the World Health Organization, for every $1 spent to scale up mental health initiatives, there’s a $4 impact on better health and productivity. 
Both wellness through AI software and AI’s use for starting mental health conversations in the workplace are encouraging macro trends for HR as HR professionals are much more equipped to understand technology’s opportunity to effectuate change than their colleagues 30 years ago.

Developments within artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled a rapid proliferation of deep fakes that are remarkably realistic, increasingly difficult to detect and relatively easy to generate.

[Littler Mendelson, P.C.]

Developments within artificial intelligence (“AI”) have enabled a rapid proliferation of deepfakes that are remarkably realistic, increasingly difficult to detect and relatively easy to generate. Technology that two years ago didn’t exist, in particular relating to techniques leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs), has emerged as an extraordinary threat to the sound functioning of government, foundations of commerce and social fabric.
Alarm bells are ringing across industries, academia and within the highest echelons of government. The impact of deepfakes on corporations is already being felt, from high tech to energy companies alike, to the tune of millions of dollars stolen via these impersonations. While we are mostly seeing this theft through use of deepfake audio, as deepfake video technology continues to evolve, expect to see increased use of this potential weapon.
So how best to protect ourselves? Given the significant threat deepfakes pose, we are seeing attempts at reactionary legislation. United States legislators have introduced the DEEPFAKES Accountability Act. This law would criminalize creation and distribution of deepfakes not containing a watermark and text identifying deepfake video as in fact modified. The proposed law would also provide subjects of deepfakes a private right of action to “vindicate their reputations.” New laws in California and Texas focus on deepfakes of political candidates immediately preceding elections. A Virginia law criminalizes the circulation of pornographic imagery and videos without the permission of parties depicted, including fabricated and impersonated deepfake generations. While some of these new laws have intentional harm elements and exemptions designed to withstand freedom of speech arguments, the proposed federal law and existing state laws will face difficult First Amendment challenges.
Criminalizing deepfakes that are not identified as deepfakes would also do little to decrease risk to corporations. Therefore, employers should not depend on or expect a legislative solution to malicious utilization of deepfakes. Criminals looking to steal money and commit fraud by harnessing deepfake technology to impersonate corporate executives and con employees into executing transfers of money to criminals’ accounts, are not going to place watermarks on their work or factor in additional associated penalties for failure to do so. Like bank robbers, they conceal their identities and cover their tracks in the hopes of never being caught. Though theft and reputational harm are far from the only damage deepfakes are capable of causing.
Brigadier General R. Patrick Huston, a Pentagon attorney who leads efforts to ensure the ethical and lawful adoption of AI, has spearheaded a campaign to address the critical national security concerns surrounding the potential impact of deepfakes. As keynote speaker during the 2019 National Security Law Conference at U.S. Strategic Command’s (STRATCOM) headquarters, General Huston highlighted the systemic and immediate threat deepfakes pose across private and public sectors. Speaking with Littler Mendelson, General Huston further elaborated these concerns:
“Deepfakes pose a significant threat to national security and global stability. Their impact is not limited to late night comedy and the porn industry. Manufactured evidence can erode the integrity of our judicial systems, and other fraudulent uses of deepfake technology can disrupt entire commercial industries. Most importantly, deepfakes can completely undermine confidence in governments, disrupt the world order, and threaten society as we know it. We’ve already seen the risks posed by sophisticated election interference and other deepfake propaganda. Therefore, we must rapidly develop deepfake detection technologies, and then introduce credible ways to share the results. The world is a safer place when people know what information they can and can’t trust.” – Brigadier General R. Patrick Huston, The Pentagon
It follows then that development of new technologies that can successfully detect and combat deepfakes is an imperative. Digital forensic methodologies and metadata analytics tools are already being utilized during the e-discovery process to successfully detect sophisticated digital fabrications.
In more real time, data analytics teams can be institutionalized, with experts dedicated to verification tasks, such as authenticating cryptographic key signing or call logs. With the anticipated proliferation of deepfakes, ready-made scalable and affordable solutions will be available for smaller employers lacking resources to create internal teams.

Low Tech Solutions to High Tech Problems 
Single-use authentication codes, whether digitally generated from a Two Factor Authentication (2FA) application (ex. Google Authenticator App) or a non-digital pre-shared encryption key – such as the simple, yet highly effective, one-time cryptography pad – can serve as powerful deterrents and organizational protections from fraudulent real-time communications.
Real-time communication transmissions, (ex. phone or video calls) are particularly vulnerable to third-party impersonation and exploitation. For example, Caller ID spoofing, where a call appears to originate from an authorized or impersonated number, is a common practice for spam-callers, malicious parties and bill collectors. Caller ID spoofing is easily achieved through smart phone applications and third-party online services, however, the potential for harm to an unwitting party or organization is tremendous. In August, a German bank’s subsidiary was defrauded when a nefarious third party impersonated the bank’s CEO using voice deepfake technology and instructed the subsidiary to send unauthorized wire transfers. If the bank’s subsidiary had required the impersonating party to confirm a secure authentication code as part of a routine security procedure prior to initiating the wire transfer, it may have prevented the fraudulent transfer.
The resource costs of incorporating private key authentication or 2FA into an organization’s real-time communications infrastructure is trivial, yet provide significant security and operational benefits. Cryptographic keys can be embedded into video communication, generated by 2FA applications and orally authenticated for voice calls or visually displayed within text-based applications. Authentication of private keys ensures the communication retains end-to-end security and isn’t vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, a form of active eavesdropping where an unauthorized third party can survey a party’s communication and inject themselves into the transmission, impersonating a designated party.
Ultimately, strategizing with counsel knowledgeable about technological vulnerabilities and legal issues that may arise will enable employers to better prepare for potential risks from deepfakes and incorporate safeguards unique to their circumstances. Critically, organizations must stay closely informed of the evolving threat landscape in order to prepare for and appropriately respond to highly dynamic scenarios.

Artificial intelligence (AI) lies at the cusp of man and machine. While it utilizes the machine intelligence element, it applies human intelligence concepts such as language and profile assessment to deliver its desired “intelligence.” As a result, the skills required to succeed in an AI career are an uncanny mix, and anyone aiming at such a career will do well to start off with a course in linguistics. 
AI is largely based on Natural Language Processing (NLP), a science that amalgamates machine language and human or natural language into useful value-adding algorithms. A thorough understanding of programming languages, data, as well as day-to-day human languages, thus goes a long way in building a stronger foundation for AI experimentation. It is no surprise that companies in the AI arena are increasingly turning to people with linguistic backgrounds. So much so, that some AI-core companies have appointed the position of “chief linguistics officer,” as in the case of Inbenta, a conversational search technology company. This means that the career avenues for linguistics graduates now number many, and will open up further.
Earlier, graduating in linguistics meant a career in academia, professional writing, or translation. Today, the gateways are open for a career in the booming technology sector too. 
So how does linguistics add value to AI? Better understanding of language helps to better understand users and how customers communicate with brands. Brand communication can then be modeled on these data inputs that have been derived from earlier customer interactions, making them more customized and need-based. Other areas where linguistics professionals can provide an added edge are voice recognition and search and automatic language translation, which form the basis for voice and personal assistants. These are fast gaining popularity, and the opportunities for the future are immense. 
Of course, AI lies at the interface of linguistics and programming. It is therefore necessary that linguistics grads hone their technical skills to make the cut for an AI career. The good part is that programming skills can be easily acquired—people can generally be easily trained in programming, often with basic investment of time and effort. A foundation grounded in linguistics with the add-on of software development training can prove to be a winning combination for AI success. The dual-fold skill helps a person to represent human language in a way that complex computing systems can understand, which is the core of AI. It is all about making computers understand, interpret, and reproduce human interactions so that they can self-learn. AI involves modeling human communication, i.e., how humans acquire information by talking, setting it into a context, and learning from it on an ongoing basis. This means that an AI professional must know how languages work, both in text and orally. Identifying the minute features of the written or spoken word, and its changing meanings in varying contexts, is very important—something that linguistics graduates generally excel at. 
The bottom line is that even seemingly traditional professional fields such as linguistics are opening up to new possibilities. The boundaries between life and technology are blurring to such an extent that career opportunities are becoming more fluidic in nature. It is all about identifying these shifting trends and honing your skills to suit the market demands.

Are four-day workweeks the future? Several businesses have already made the switch, citing improved productivity, happier employees, better retention, and faster hiring. To attain a true four-day (32-hour) workweek, many organizations would have to (A) hire more talent to pick up the slack or (B) accept a less productive year. Neither choice would be useful, but there is a third option coming down the pike: artificial intelligence. AI will be able to improve productivity to the point where working hours can be feasibly reduced for any business, writes Jonathan Crane, Chief Operating Officer at IPsoft.
Are four-day workweeks the future? Several businesses have already made the switch, citing improved productivity, happier employees, better retention, and faster hiring. The following two reasons have inspired numerous school districts to follow suit, which may set expectations for future generations of workers.
Not all weeks are created equal, however. It may not yet be possible for most businesses to shorten their workweeks without compromise. By eliminating one day of work, employers might be forced to increase their daily hours to make up for the lost time. This could lead to longer days before that vaunted three-day weekend finally arrives.
In order to attain a true four-day (32-hour) workweek, many organizations would have to (A) hire more talent to pick up the slack or (B) accept a less productive year. Neither choice would be terribly effective, but there is a third option coming down the pike: artificial intelligence.
The technology is heavily viewed as a job creatorOpens a new window , thanks to a growing number of new opportunities. AI specialist roles look to dominate 2020 as companies explore the potential of automation. It’s easy to see why – tedious and highly repeatable tasks can now be handled by a machine, allowing individual staff to reserve their precious working hours for more critical projects. Long-term, AI could go even further, improving productivity to the point where working hours can be feasibly reduced for any business.
As much as 45% of work activities could be automated with existing technology, potentially saving employees 18 out of every 40 hours they work. That leaves a lot of wiggle room for a reduced workweek. Employers could choose to fill that time with new projects, objectives, or a cornucopia of emails and meetings. But doing so won’t improve recruitment or provide a better work-life balance.
Cynics might question how many businesses will use automation to reduce their workforce while expecting the remaining employees to work a full 40-hour week, and some companies might be tempted to do that. AI is a powerful tool, but it cannot provide the level of critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovating that an individual staff brings to employers. AI doesn’t have a body and cannot express the human emotions that make one-on-one relationships so meaningful. It is a fantastic technology that can handle mundane tasks automatically, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But AI’s value proposition is different from that of a human. They are best suited to work together, side-by-side, not one versus the other.

Getting Better with Time
Four-day workweeks are still in their infancy, so the full benefits have yet to be realized. But some companies are already bragging about the impactful results they have personally experienced, which could serve as a case study for others.
AI can help by taking care of the time-consuming tasks that frequently strain productivity, such as resolving user tech issues or automating parts of production management. The technology has been useful in helping cybersecurity professionals detect and deter security intrusions, and it has become an increasingly popular tool for marketers looking to target specific demographics. Call centers have also taken advantage of AI, allowing it to handle many inquiries automatically. And it will only get better with time, mainly as machine learning improves upon its ability to learn, grow, and better understand the tasks it needs to perform.
As a man and machine inch closer together, enterprises will realize efficiencies that could not have been attained with humans or AI alone. When technology is capable of handling a significant volume of tasks, businesses will then be free to shorten their workweeks on a larger scale.
They could instead choose to follow Parkinson’s LawOpens a new window , maintain the five-day schedule, and allow work to expand to “fill the time available for its completion.” But that would not serve employers or employees, who already have strong opinions about the work environment. To attract the talent of the future, today’s businesses will need to accommodate their needs, whether that involves more paid time off, schedule flexibility, or a shorter workweek.

A New Era of Employment
The old saying “work smarter, not harder” has new meaning in the age of artificial intelligence. With the potential to ease employees’ existing workloads while maintaining the same level of output, this could be the technology that ushers in an entirely new era of employment. Work that was once viewed as boring, tiring, or utterly uninteresting can be handed off to AI, while humans complete the most exciting and demanding parts of a job. It’s a win-win situation that will, at the very least, make work more enjoyable. And at it could open the door to a lifetime of three-day weekends.

Automated systems allow for a more intuitive, personalized, simple HR experience for candidates and employees. The trends and applications of AI in the HR and recruiting industry are countless, meeting the needs of employees and candidates through talent sourcing, candidate evaluation, employee development, scheduling interviews and meetings, and engaging with employees writes Valerie Caswell, online marketing professional, Gumessay.
In all aspects of business, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the way things are done. With innovations in machine-learning technologies continually being developed, the future of the HR industry lies in the unique combination of digital AI and human services.
Automated systems allow for a more intuitive, personalized, simple HR experience for candidates and employees. The trends and applications of AI in the HR and recruiting industry are countless, meeting the needs of employees and candidates through talent sourcing, candidate evaluation, employee development, scheduling interviews and meetings, and engaging with employees:
Candidate Screening
AI technology streamlines the process of screening potential candidates for a position by reducing the overall time to hire and enhancing the candidate experience. AI tools can gather the necessary candidate information by asking preliminary questions to assess whether a candidate is suitable for the position before a full interview with a human HR representative. AI can also respond to candidate queries, quickly fill out applications, screen applicants efficiently, and assess candidates in record time.
Before full interviews with human HR representatives, AI chatbots and virtual interfaces can perform initial screening processes with potential candidates to assess for specific qualities, skills, and credentials. This means that by the time the candidates come in for interviews, talent acquisition is that much easier, as the preliminary criteria have already been met. This saves HR representatives from spending time asking such basic questions and covering these fundamental topics, leaving them to simply deal with the more complex, personal areas of screening.
Engagement and Development
Engagement processes with candidates can be automated for a more personal experience and interaction in real-time. This can involve keeping candidates updated regarding the status of their application and maintain a relationship to reduce anxiety during the waiting period.
Of course, nurturing this relationship is vital throughout the process, including after candidates have been hired. AI tools can update records, gather new information, and perform other such tasks that involve minor interactions.

Employees can also utilize AI services as a resource for information, through chatbots or virtual interfaces. When employee issues are more complex and require the intervention of human HR representatives, AI can bridge this gap by knowing when to defer to humans for interpersonal support by making appointments and organizing meetings and initiating the communication process.
AI can also maintain employee engagement about internal communications, whether this is requesting meetings, updating personal information, giving leave notice, or filing a report. In essence, these communications can be automated through online portals and servers for the company to save the time and hassle of employees dealing with such essential paperwork.
Employees Training
New employees are going to need training, orientation, and support throughout their initial time with the company. They will need to adjust to their new roles, adapt to new routines, and assimilate into the culture of the company. AI interfaces can run new hires through necessary procedures, protocols, policies, and resources, as well as answer common questions and concerns – all in real-time. AI can act as a pool of company information for new employees to access at any time, no matter how small their query may be, without taking up the valuable time of senior employees to deal with small-scale issues.
Many employees may also find training more comfortable and constructive when the process is being overseen by a virtual AI mentor rather than a senior employee, as this can reduce performance anxiety and increase personal confidence in asking questions without fear of judgment or wasting time. A virtual mentor can also provide personalized assistance throughout training by having access to personnel files and company policies at all times.
Learn More: 2 Ways AI is Transforming Wellness in the WorkplaceOpens a new window 
New employees need to understand the norms and expectations of the company, from essential procedural responsibilities to standard interpersonal interactions. For this reason, a combination approach of AI and human HR services is highly valuable in providing this integrated orientation experience.
The benefits of AI as a machine-learning-driven initiative are endless, especially when deployed in tandem with traditional human HR interactions. Such integral services can be provided in record time, with real-time responses, consistent updates, and a streamlined HR experience.

Last Updated: December 16, 2021




 





Artificial intelligence is rapidly being implemented in the HR industry. With the rise of digital communication methods and younger generations entering the workforce, HR leaders need to better understand how to leverage AI to improve employee satisfaction, retention, and workplace communication. The best way to adapt is to embrace AI and emerging technologies and use them to your advantage, writes Anish Joshi, VP of Technology, Fusemachines.
Artificial intelligence has presented tremendous opportunities for the HR industry by helping with recruitment and onboarding, mechanizing repetitive tasks, providing analytics, increasing retention rates and aiding with learning & development. These functions that have been increasingly implemented over the last couple of years are just scratching the surface of the ways AI can transform and augment the HR industry.
It’s no secret that traditional ways of HR and internal relations are changing with the emergence of new technologies. As the digital-native generation is rapidly moving into the workforce, the industry needs to make technical adjustments to better serve this generation of employees and employers. New technologies, such as AI, can further develop employee/manager relationships in ways that weren’t possible many years ago.
Here are a few ways that you can leverage AI to improve overall employee satisfaction, employee retention and the relationship between employees and their managers.
Address the Challenges of the Digital Age
The digital age has pushed us to utilize new forms of communication in the workplace. Whether it’s emails, texts, or platforms like Slack, this presents new challenges. There’s a loss of context when communication more frequently occurs digitally than in person – it’s a major hurdle associated with communication in this day and age.
Face-to-face communication is becoming less common in the workplace due to the rise of remote work, coworking apps, and new technologies. It’s important that critical information or context of communications doesn’t get lost in translation.
Digital communications may cause management to fail to capture what employees are thinking, how they are feeling, and whether or not they have understood the task at hand. According to Debra Hamilton’s report, Top Ten Email Blunders That Cost Companies Money, a company with 100 employees can expect to lose approximately $450,000 a year or more because of email blunders, inefficiencies, and misunderstandings.
This only covers mistakes with email communications. It’s hard to imagine the number of daily misunderstandings and miscommunications that arise from other types of digital conversations. It’s very easy to misconstrue someone’s true feelings and thoughts when consuming the message digitally.  
Luckily, AI can help us face these challenges and make communication a more streamlined, effective, and mutual understanding between employees and management.
Analyze Employee Engagement
Utilizing the voice of the employee (VoE) analytics, which are driven by AI, can improve how you monitor employee engagement and feedback, ultimately ensuring better relationships between employees and their managers. Taking a step back and analyzing how employees are feeling can lead to positive changes. For example, you send out an employee survey to gauge attitudes towards a new computer software your company is using. The feedback you receive is that everyone is confused and frustrated with the platform. Easy fix! You host a training session to better educate employees on the platform and discuss any concerns or questions. In the end, everyone is feeling better about the new platform and you’ve proactively mitigated risks by taking the time to analyze employee sentiment.

By implementing this type of AI, organizations have access to more data, which provides managers with immediate and actionable feedback from their teams. Without advancing technology and increased amounts of data available, this type of engagement and leadership development wouldn’t be as accessible.  
AI technologies that use a variety of natural language processing and textual analysis can incite positive changes within key relationships at organizations. This can be especially useful in times of significant change, such as a major restructuring, new leadership or a new strategy.
Increase Employee Retention
According to a Salesforce report, The Impact of Equality and Values-Driven BusinessOpens a new window , employees who feel that their voices are heard at work are 4.5 times more likely to be motivated to perform their best. Being able to provide employees with this type of security and reassurance means they are more likely to be loyal to your organization.
AI is an important function of employee retention. With more data to be analyzed, employers can better understand how employees are feeling and gauge whether or not they intend to stay with the organization. AI enables an employer to identify employee’s areas of dissatisfaction and the underlying causes behind them.
Learn More: 2 Ways AI is Transforming Wellness in the WorkplaceOpens a new window 
When management can act upon identified problems, they have a better chance of retaining employees and increasing satisfaction. These analytics are possible because of AI and give companies the power to better listen to their employees. Even further, managers that can better understand their employees’ problems, consider them, and execute based on employee feedback will improve overall key metrics within the company and increase employee retention rates.
AI is inevitably going to continue to transform the HR industry. Certain considerations need to be taken into account for the rise of digital communication methods and the influx of digital natives making their way into the workforce. The best way to adapt is to embrace AI and new technologies and use them to your advantage. AI implementation in HR is positive – it leads to better communication, more secure employee/manager relationships, and aids in leadership development for managers.

Different strokes: Using artificial intelligence to tell art apartDecember 13, 2021Humanities, Art & Social SciencesResearchScience & Tech· 

Case Western Reserve University scientists, artists collaborate to develop art algorithm that can distinguish different painters’ brush strokes “at the bristle level”
A team of scientists and art historians at Case Western Reserve University say they have used tools of artificial intelligence (AI) to distinguish the individual brushstrokes of one painter from another.
The technique could become a valuable tool to help authorities better identify forgeries of work by famous artists; it could also help art historians tell whether a master, or a student, contributed to a given masterpiece.
Kenneth Singer

The researchers said they believe the finding is among the first of its kind because of how the researchers used the computer to read and learn from the 3D topography of a painting. Other forms of AI-enhanced analysis rely on visible stylistic differences that a program may detect in historic works, they said.
The technology of 3D topography describes a three-dimensional relief map of a surface which reveals any differences in “elevation.”  In this case, that means rises or dips in the paint surface, even at the smallest scale.
“3D topography is a new way for AI to ‘see’ a painting,” said Kenneth Singer, the Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics at Case Western Reserve. Singer who led the research, said the AI algorithm focused on the smallest structures on the surface.
The “neural network stunned us”
“The neural network stunned us by actually being able to tell with very high accuracy whose hand among four different art students had painted even a tiny fraction of a brushstroke,” Singer said. “We’ve uncovered what could be considered the unintentional style of a painter.”
“Neural network” describes a computer system modeled on the human brain and nervous system—one that learns, identifies and compares patterns. The neural network identified the correct artist 95% of the time from small parts of a brushstroke. Those strokes were roughly the diameter of a single paintbrush bristle.
Mike Hinczewski
Michael Hinczewski, the Warren E. Rupp Associate Professor of Physics at Case Western Reserve, was also on the research team. He said that kind of precision was “almost like a fingerprint.”
Each of the artists in their study used the same kind of brush, paint and canvas. “So that the only thing that would be different would be the artist’s hand—the way it interacts with the surface,” Hinczewski said. 
“We were shocked with what emerged,” he continued. This is something that must somehow be intrinsic to each artist, not something that the painter is consciously trying to do.”
The team recently published its work in the journal Heritage Science. 
Collaborators included Case Western Reserve colleagues Elizabeth Bolman, the Elsie B. Smith Professor in the Liberal Arts and chair of Art History, several others from the physics and biology departments in the College of Arts and Sciences and contributors from the Cleveland Museum of Art and Cleveland Institute of Art.
Elizabeth Bolman
Attribution of famous art
Bolman, who is an artist historian—a specialization of art history—said many notable masters, from El Greco to Rembrandt, employed workshops. Those workshops  included other artists who painted parts of the canvases to speed production and meet market demands for their art.
The artists in a master’s workshop were trying to create a complete painting with a singular style—mimicking the named artist. However, connoisseurs and collectors want to know how much of a given piece was created by the master.
“But those masters didn’t leave notes from their workshops: ‘Hey, art historians 500 years from now, here’s how we did it,’” Bolman said. “So being able to scan a painting and learn which areas were painted by different hands could be extremely valuable information to connoisseurs.”
The global art market is worth billions of dollars, Bolman said. So, this method of attribution could have important applications to help confirm or dispute authorship.
This new machine-learning method could more accurately determine an unbiased and quantitative analysis of virtually any well-preserved painting, she said.
“Art connoisseurs can spend decades identifying styles, or the weave of the canvas, to learn more about a painting,” Bolman said. “This method isn’t intended to replace any of those, but to add a level of data that humans can’t discern.”
How the AI worked on art
One illustration of how the computer system differentiated the work of four different painters.
The MORE (Materials for Opto/Electronics Research and Education) Center at Case Western Reserve, where Singer is faculty director, has a chromatic confocal optical profilometer, a tool which uses light and color to reveal minuscule bumps and indentations on a surface.
Singer and his colleagues scanned the students’ paintings to produce 3D surface height data for each work.
The researchers then divided those surface data into virtual patches. Then they trained an ensemble of programs known as convolutional neural networks for attribution—identifying which painter made the stroke.
Hinczewski said that most previous studies for AI art attribution are focused on photos of entire paintings. 
“We broke the painting down into virtual patches ranging from one-half millimeter to a few centimeters square, so we no longer even have information about the subject matter,” he said. “But we can accurately predict who painted it from an individual patch. That’s amazing.”

LONDON — Can’t get your partner to ever tell you how they really feel? There may be an app for that…one day. Scientists can now predict how someone is feeling using radio waves to measure heart rate and breathing. The wireless signals can detect a person’s feelings even in the absence of any other visual cues such as facial expressions. This AI technology could be used to help reveal our inner emotions.
In the past, emotion detection has relied on assessing visible signals such as facial expressions, speech, body gestures or eye movements. However, these methods can be unreliable as they do not capture an individual’s internal emotions effectively. Researchers are increasingly looking towards “invisible” signals, such as ECG to understand emotions.
ECG signals detect electrical activity in the heart, providing a link between the nervous system and heart rhythm. To date, the measurement of these signals has largely been performed using sensors that are placed on the body. Recently, non-invasive approaches that use radio waves have been used to detect them.
Researchers hope to investigate how they can use existing systems, like WiFi routers, to reveal the emotions of large groups of people, such as office workers. They also plan to work with healthcare professionals and social scientists on public acceptance and ethical concerns around the use of this new technology.

This type of approach would enable us to classify emotions of people on an individual basis while performing routine activities. Moreover, we aim to improve the accuracy of emotion detection in a work environment using advanced deep learning techniques,” says lead study author Ahsan Khan, a PhD student at Queen Mary University in London, in a statement.  “Being able to detect emotions using wireless systems is a topic of increasing interest for researchers. It offers an alternative to bulky sensors and could be directly applicable in future ‘smart’ home and building environments.
“In this study, we’ve built on existing work using radio waves to detect emotions and show that the use of deep learning techniques can improve the accuracy of our results,” he adds.
How machine learning can second your emotions
For the experiment, participants were asked to watch a video chosen for its ability to evoke one of four basic emotions: anger, sadness, joy and pleasure. Meanwhile, researchers emitted harmless radio signals, like those transmitted from WiFi, towards participants and measured the signals that bounced back off of them. The team was then able to reveal ‘hidden’ information about a person’s heart and breathing rates by analyzing changes to these signals caused by slight body movements.
“This research opens up many opportunities for practical applications, especially in areas such as human robot interaction and healthcare and emotional wellbeing, which has become increasingly important during the current Covid-19 pandemic,” notes project leader Yang Hao, a professor of antennas and electromagnetics at the university.
Psychological or neuroscientific researchers often use methods to detect human emotions. However, it is thought that these approaches could also have wider implications for the management of health and wellbeing. Previous research has used similar non-invasive or wireless methods of emotion detection. However, analysis depended on the use of classical machine learning approaches where an algorithm is used to identify emotional states within the data.
For this study, scientists used deep learning techniques where an artificial neural network learns its own features from time-dependent raw data. Results showed that this approach could detect emotions more accurately than traditional machine learning methods.
“Most of the published literature that uses machine learning measures emotions in a subject-dependent way, recording a signal from a specific individual and using this to predict their emotion at a later stage. However, deep learning allows us to assess data in a similar way to how a human brain would work, looking at different layers of information and making connections between them,” says Achintha Ihalage, also a PhD student at Queen Mary.
“With deep learning we’ve shown we can accurately measure emotions in a subject-independent way, where we can look at a whole collection of signals from different individuals and learn from this data and use it to predict the emotion of people outside of our training database,” adds Ms. Ihalage.
The findings are published in the journal PLOS One.

A Project Management Professional (PMP) certification is a globally recognized certificate offered by the Project Management Institute (PMI). It is a highly respected certificate held by over one million actively certified individuals. These certifications can advance your career and help drive salary increases for qualified managers.
The need for qualified managers with PMP certifications is rising dramatically, as the business and tech sector work to keep with today’s technology. These advances include cloud computing, artificial intelligence, edge computing and digital transformation.
There are five “performance domains” the PMP exam is based on, these include:

Initiating the project
Planning the project
Executing the project
Monitoring and controlling the project
Closing the project

The PMP certification itself is designed by industry leaders and project professionals, ensuring applicants and test takers are skilled in the following areas:

People: The PMP certification tests your soft skills and leadership potential. These people skills are important for successfully leading teams in today’s ever-growing working environment.
Process: Project managers and professionals need to be on top of the technical aspects of project management, such as timelines.
Business environment: Finally, professionals need to be skilled in bridging the gap between projects and an organization’s general strategy and culture.

Holders of the PMP certification will come out into the workforce well versed in these three main aspects of project management. Holders will also learn about the predictive, agile, and hybrid approach to project leadership as well.
The test itself consists of 180 multiple choice questions. Once individuals pass the test, they are required 60 hours of continued professional education units every three years to maintain the certification.
IT professionals interested in project management facing roles and responsibilities will benefit heavily from a PMP certification. Let’s look into these benefits further.

What are the Benefits of a PMP Certification?
Competitive Edge
Holding a PMP certification means you’ve passed a test designed by project professionals and leaders in the project management space. This helps make individuals stand out – it often opens the doors to new positions.
PMI themselves state that employers will need to fill around 2.2 million new project-oriented roles each year through 2027. Holding a PMP certification as an IT professional helps you stand out, and shows you have a relevant and diverse skill set.
The qualifications for obtaining the certification are robust to begin with. Applicants must meet the following sets of criteria:

A four-year degree, high school diploma, or associate’s degree.
36 to 60 months leading projects, depending on education.
35 hours of project management training or CAPM Certification.

Higher Salary
One of the more actionable benefits of holding a PMP certification is the higher median salary holders have when compared to non-holders.
PMP certification holders in the United States average about a 25% increase in their salary when compared to non-holders. In Poland and India, this number is above 30%, and in South Africa, holders average a whopping 58% differential when compared to non-holders.
Higher Efficiency
Another important benefit of holding a PMP certification is the efficiency project leaders bring to the table when having one.
A study done by the PMI showed that when over one-third of project managers in a company hold PMP certifications, the company itself meets its original goals and finishes more projects on time.
Coming into a company as an IT professional with a PMP certification means you can increase this efficiency for your own department as well.
Top PMI Certifications
PMI certifications are broken down into different experience levels. This means that project managers can always look forward to building their repertoire as their experience grows.
Although the PMP certification is the organization’s most well-known certification for IT professionals and project leaders, PMI offers a vast amount of certifications for these groups and more.
Top PMI Certifications for 0-3 Years Experience
PMI Project Management Ready
This is PMI’s entry-level course, focused on harnessing foundational knowledge of project leadership and management for professionals. Applicants can expect to learn about basic business analytics and agile methodologies in this course.
PMI-ACP
The PMI Agile Certified Practitioner, or PMI-ACP, demonstrates and tests your agile team experience. Agile methodologies are increasingly becoming more necessary for IT professionals, and the PMI-ACP helps professionals hone their skills for the market.
In the test, applicants will be tested on a multitude of agile approaches, such as:

Scrum
Kanban
Lean
Extreme programming (XP)
Test-driven development (TDD)

CAPM
The Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) certification is built for professionals looking to strengthen their fundamental knowledge and terminology of project management. The CAPM is very foundational, and can be used as a step to qualify for the PMP certification.
Top PMI Certifications for 3+ Years Experience
PMP
The PMP is PMI’s most well-known certification. Simply put, holding the PMP can bring along a slew of benefits that might not be as available for other certification holders. As we mentioned above, PMP holders generally earn higher salaries than their non-accredited counterparts.
Beyond that, the PMP certification ensures IT professionals and project managers are equipped with the necessary tools needed for efficient and effective project management cycles. IT workers and professionals can expect to hone their predictive, agile, and hybrid approaches through this certification, and stand out in the market as a whole.
PMI-PBA
The PMI Professional in Business Analysis (PMI-PBA) certification is targeted more toward those in need of business analysis skills. These can include:

Working with key stakeholders to define business requirements.
Identifying goals and outcomes for business quarters.
Shaping general output of project cycles.

The need for business analysis practitioners is only growing. Holding the PMI-PBA could ensure you thrive in the market – or at least get you noticed.
DAVSC
The Disciplined Agile Value Stream Consultant certification, or DAVSC, tests professionals on their value stream management skills and their effectiveness in implementing them enterprise-wide.
Top PMI Certifications for 8+ Years Experience
PgMP
The Program Management Professional certification, or PgMP, is one of the most exclusive certifications PMI offers for professionals. It has only been earned by a few thousand applicants. This means that passing it exemplifies your skills as an effective, all-around project leader.
PfMP
The Portfolio Management Professional certification, or PfMP, is similarly exclusive to its PgMP counterpart. The PfMP focuses more on testing applicant’s experience, skills, and performance in regards to managing and aligning a relevant portfolio catered to enterprise and organizational strategy. Like the PgMP, it’s held by a few thousand leaders worldwide.
Top Specialized PMI Certifications
PMI-RMP
The PMI Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP) certification is one of six specialized PMI certifications. These are certifications that are built for more specialized use-cases.
In the PMI-RMP’s case, certification holders prove their prowess in regards to identifying and assessing project risks. Holders are also well versed in how to mitigate these risks and move forward with new opportunities once said risks have been cleared or worked on. This certification shows enterprises and businesses your capabilities in protecting their organizational needs.
PMI-SP
The PMI Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP) certification is focused on what its name suggests: It is best suited for professionals looking to hone their project scheduling skills.
The PMI-SP is actually a far more important certification to hold than applicants might perceive. Scheduling and time management for project cycles is a critical skill to have, and could be highly valued by organizations looking to perfect that avenue.
AHPP
The Agile Hybrid Project Pro certification, or AHPP, is micro-credential. This means that there is no need to maintain credits to hold it, like a majority of other PMI certifications. This could be reason enough for some to apply, but the AHPP comes with a number of specialized benefits for holders.
The main skill set the AHPP trains applicants in is the application of agile and hybrid project management principles. Applicants also learn about conflict management, team performance support, and mitigating or potentially eliminating obstacles in the project management cycle.
Considering the fact that this certification only requires 1-5 years of project management experience and no education requirements, it could be a perfect entryway for some applicants.

The American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) has announced a joint commitment with Intel and Dell Technologies to enhance artificial intelligence (AI) education across community and technical colleges in all 50 states by 2023 as part of Intel’s AI for Workforce program.
The new effort aims to enable community colleges to be the first line for instruction, reskilling and upskilling of the AI workforce. The AI for Workforce program launched last year at Maricopa Community College (MCC) in Arizona, with Intel introducing an AI-based curriculum that allows students to earn a certificate or an associate degree in AI. Over the last year, the program has expanded to 31 schools across 18 states.
To support the program’s expansion, AACC and Intel are collaborating with Dell Technologies as the exclusive technology partner to provide resources for community colleges that provide AI training and certificate programs.
“Community colleges provide skill training and credential programs to 11 million students each year,” AACC President and CEO Walter Bumphus said in a release. “These programs are intended to provide the needed skills training for students to enter the job market and thrive in a job that earns them family-sustaining wages. This partnership with Intel and Dell will help us to ensure that these programs lead to meaningful employment and can also serve as the first step toward degree attainment.”
Program expertise
Resources from both Intel and Dell include technical and infrastructure expertise for the development of virtual and on-campus AI in education labs, as well as a curriculum designed to ensure that community college AI programs are relevant, cost-effective and provide skills training that leads to real-world jobs.
“This is an exciting partnership that will build a robust and diverse talent pipeline to help support future jobs in AI and technology,” said Carlos Contreras, senior director of AI and digital readiness at Intel. “The next-generation workforce will need this kind of specialized training to develop solutions to the world’s greatest challenges, and community colleges have a huge role to play in unleashing innovative thinking.”
The new partnership will focus on minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and tribal colleges to support under-resourced communities and are committed to continual growth of this program. Seventeen of the schools currently participating in the AI for Workforce program are MSIs.
“Access to technology and skills has never been more important, allowing more communities to participate in today’s digital ecosystem. By collaborating with Intel on its AI for Workforce program, Dell is able to complement Intel’s innovative AI course content with Dell’s technology expertise to deliver AI learning experiences to a wide swath of diverse college students helping them prepare for the workforce of the future,” said Adam Garry, senior director of education strategy at Dell Technologies.
Recruitment of community colleges to the program will begin next month at the AACC Workforce Development Institute.
