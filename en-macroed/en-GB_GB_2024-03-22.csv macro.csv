After a banner year celebrating all that generative AI has to offer, it seems clear that the technology behind ChatGPT—which has now proven to write solid letters, reports, and even movie scripts—is placing some positions at risk and potentially obsolete. Indeed, IBM recently announced its marketing and communications team is downsizing, due in part to generative AI. More than one-third of companies using AI said AI had replaced workers in 2023, with 44% anticipating that AI will lead to further layoffs in 2024.


The question is no longer, “How much can generative AI do?” It’s, “How much work can human workers keep to stay relevant in a post-gen-AI world?”

As we face a future defined by AI, one of the most important truths for us as workers in the global economy to accept is this: efficiencies will always make good business sense. Just as automation took over manufacturing jobs, AI will take over many white-collar jobs—in marketing and beyond. The goal of any business—in America, at least—is to maximize profits. Any technology that allows businesses to work faster, create more, and benefit from deeper insights will be seen as a positive thing by business executives. Research shows that by 2030, work that accounts for about one-third of hours currently worked in the US economy could be automated, thanks in part to generative AI.

Here are a few considerations as we weigh the risks and opportunities of generative AI on the future of work.

Generative AI Will Create New Jobs—but will those Suit You? Test the Video Game Dilemma:
PROMOTED
It’s possible that one job lost in marketing will lead to a new, more advanced role in marketing, but that’s highly unlikely. Chances are higher that the work landscape is going to be spotty, and strange, and different for years to come—but eventually these technological revolutions do create new and often unexpected roles.
Consider this interesting scenario: If AI allows programmers to develop a new game 50% faster and with 20% of the resources, we will still need fewer programmers to do that work, even if more people want to play the game. That just means that we need to start thinking differently about work and our place in it as we continue to press forward with advancements in generative AI—and whatever technology comes next. One thing is certain: spend time acquiring new AI skills and adopting the ‘AI mentality’ behind automation and data-oriented value creation. In several recent interviews NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has recently shared a perspective on programming and coding that indicates that the oft-fashionable path of becoming a programmer may not be the ultimate safety net.

OpenAI’s Sam Altman suggested that in the future we will have single person, billion dollar companies. While that seems improbable without massive inflation, it seems increasingly likely that 10-20 person companies could generate more than $100 million in revenue and potentially reach a billion with the smart use of generative AI and intelligent chatbots.
Generative AI Can Be your Competitor—but Make it a Friend instead
For the first time, people with very few design skills, for example, can use AI to generate beautiful graphic layouts. People with limited writing skills can use generative AI to write letters, reports, and even marketing campaigns. And they can use AI to determine how successful those campaigns are—and change them in real-time if they aren’t working. Those are all, on their own, really cool things. And before you suggest that we need humans to deal with generative AI because it isn’t perfect, and it hallucinates. I agree, but every day it gets better, and it will continue to at an order of magnitude faster as the tech and algorithms get better.
So how can you stay relevant when AI is capable of doing so much?
First, stay engaged. In a time when it’s easy to let AI do all the work, resist the temptation. While it’s absolutely imperative for workers in marketing and communications specifically to familiarize themselves with what generative AI is capable of doing, it’s also important that they remain engaged with their company’s data, brand, and culture. AI can draft a report. But we still need bright people to review the information to ensure it makes sense, that AI didn’t go adrift, and that the insights being produced are going to lead to positive results.
Second, all employees in marketing and communication specifically need to look at AI as a partner that enhances their portfolios rather than an enemy that could potentially steal it. Employees who know how to take advantage of what AI has to offer have way less chance of having their positions outsourced to AI than those who continue to avoid it altogether. Marketing and communications leaders need to know what AI is capable of, but they also need to be the most outspoken about its limits in terms of maintaining customer relationships and keeping humans at the heart of every customer interaction. You can’t define AI’s limits if you’re too afraid to know what it does. So get to know it, inside and out.
AI Will Change the Job Landscape—It’s All About Staying Productive and Efficient
Every technology revolution has ultimately yielded more, not less jobs.
Based on Futurum Intelligence data, the investment in proof-of-concept projects with AI in these areas is on the rise at a three-fold rate from the year before. These numbers were further validated by Accenture’s recent earnings which saw the company announce it saw $1.1 Billion in revenue from generative AI in the first half of its fiscal outpacing the revenue of all VC backed AI startups combined.
AI is coming to a career near you. It’s happening and it’s moving quickly and the best way to stay ahead of it is to understand it and how it can help the work that you do. There is no guarantees that a role won’t succumb to AI disruption, but roles have always been vulnerable to the next wave of tech—stay agile, stay sharp and keep learning. Being marketable and diverse in your skills will always be seen positively by employers.

By Chet Kapoor, Chairman & CEO at DataStax
Along with the exciting possibilities of generative AI (genAI), there have been concerns around job (in)security and displacement. Leaders are feeling the pressure to implement genAI quickly and automate as much as possible. Some will see this as an opportunity to “get lean” and reduce headcount. Others will keep the people they have and find new ways to become super efficient.
We believe choosing the latter is imperative – because the benefits of genAI can only be realized when combined with human creativity and innovation. Together, humans and genAI have the power not only to transform industries but also to create new opportunities for workers across various sectors. How we work and what we do may shift, but removing people to make way for productivity would prove to be a huge mistake.
If we want a future of AI for all, we should reinvest productivity gains into the people and processes that drive growth and innovation. We call this the “abundance agenda”
Looking back
This is not the first time that a groundbreaking technology has brought concern about job displacement. The emergence of the steam engine, assembly lines, and computers all caused fears of widespread unemployment. But history has shown that while some jobs will be replaced, new roles emerge, and industries evolve and adapt to changing technologies. GenAI is no exception.
Beyond automation
One of the key reasons for concern surrounding GenAI is its potential to automate tasks typically performed by humans. From customer service interactions to data analysis, genAI has already shown remarkable progress in streamlining processes and increasing efficiency. However, workers across sectors worry that “no one’s job is safe.”
While genAI might automate certain tasks, it also has the potential to enhance human productivity and creativity. Instead of viewing it as a threat to job security, organizations can leverage genAI as a tool to empower their workforce and augment their capabilities. By adopting a mindset of collaboration between humans and machines, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth and innovation.
Looking beyond just the organization, genAI also brings the opportunity for inclusive economic growth. By giving workers the skills and knowledge needed to harness the potential of this technology, companies can ensure that no one is left behind. Investments in education, training, and re-skilling programs can empower people to thrive in the age of genAI, creating a more inclusive and equitable workforce.
Proactive strategies
Proactive measures should be taken to address concerns about job insecurity and displacement. For example:

Transparent communication about the potential impact of genAI on job roles and responsibilities. This helps build trust and ease fears among employees.
Reimagining job design and creating opportunities for upskilling and retraining. This enables workers to adapt to the changing landscape and remain competitive in the job market.

Ultimately, the goal is to embrace a forward-thinking approach that prioritizes collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity. Taking the potential of genAI while investing in the skills and well-being of workers helps organizations navigate the challenges of this technology wave – creating a future where humans and machines work together towards shared abundance for all.

An ever-increasing number of employers are experiencing the many benefits of artificial intelligence throughout their human resources practices—from candidate personalization, conversational experiences, matching and scoring algorithms and AI-generated insights.
With the emergence of generative AI, HR tech products are starting to build use cases to optimize communication among recruiters, managers, candidates, and employees as well as build assistants to boost HR productivity. These technologies are also assisting HR teams to build better employee retention and growth strategies and helping them transform into a skills-based organization.
While all this innovation is underway, consistency and inclusiveness within job descriptions continue to be a challenge and are often overlooked.











 
 
 
Generative AI can help ensure that job postings consistently meet the level of criteria needed for a specific function, including the necessary skills and competencies required, along with the use of inclusive language and reduction of bias. This is especially helpful as the labor market remains strong and businesses continue to need workers.

Thoughtfully crafted with the appropriate contextual considerations, generative AI has the capability to responsibly generate adaptive and inclusive job descriptions on a large scale. It produces highly personalized postings that preserve the organization’s tone and brand, accomplishing this in a fraction of the time it would take a human.
Offloading this task to generative AI allows HR to concentrate on content that shapes the culture and brand experience—areas where technology falls short in understanding the nuanced human elements











 
 
 
LLMs need the right context
Commercial large language models (LLMs) used for generative AI are essentially an approximation of the extensive knowledge available on crafting job descriptions. While existing industry standards generally have well-phrased descriptions, they may lack the specific context of the organization or team, making them appear impersonal or generic to candidates. Furthermore, if these models are prompted to generate a job description using gendered titles (such as “fireman”), the outcome is likely to be non-neutral, highlighting the need for careful consideration of language for inclusivity.
Generative AI models require precise prompts to shape the writing of job descriptions and to specify which words and phrases to steer clear of. Rather than employing a job title like “weatherman,” the program should be directed to use the more inclusive term “meteorologist,” accompanied by an illustrative tone and well-crafted examples. And doing this at scale throughout the organization may not be easy.
It might be tempting for HR teams to dig out an old job posting for a similar role to save time, but the effort that’s made on the front end will pay off on the back end in the form of a job description that piques the interest of the right talent. A posting that steers away great candidates could have an expensive and long-lasting negative impact on the business.











 
 
 
What defines a biased job description? Identifying bias is not always straightforward for HR; it’s a subjective task. While certain corrections may be apparent, discerning whether bias is truly eliminated or inadvertently introduced can be challenging. This is where technology proves invaluable, assisting humans in striking the right balance swiftly and accurately. AI models, which learn from past performance and adhere to fundamental guidelines, can play a crucial role in generating job descriptions that align with fairness and inclusivity.
The challenges for developers
During OpenAI’s first developer conference in early November, the company said GPT-4 turbo models have a 128k context window, which means it can digest the equivalent of more than 300 pages of text in a single prompt. ChatGPT almost certainly will learn how to provide the right responses from that much context, which is really a game changer. And ChatGPT has gotten a lot cheaper too. From that perspective, developers are thinking, “OK, how best do I add value to my users?”
With previous versions of ChatGPT, finding use cases was all about figuring out a scenario to generate content and building an app on top of ChatGPT. But now one can just get the context and leave a lot of other things out. That’s a clear indicator of the huge promise of the technology.











 
 
 
But against that optimistic outlook, enterprises using generative AI must grapple with ethical and privacy concerns. Governance, monitoring, and fundamental documentation are the safeguards against deploying discriminative AI. In the past, developers could rely on those safeguards alone to guard against discriminative AI. However, the landscape has evolved significantly, and that requires developers to consider a whole lot more in their design. It’s a whole new ballgame.
Today there is much more scrutiny around several big issues, namely masking personally identifiable information, injecting context without a data leak, and saving customer information in its own ecosystem while only passing the inferred aspects of the request to generative AI models. Those are some of the complexities that developers are running into at the moment.
Why generative AI needs guardrails
As with any new or emerging technology, industry and government are working to set proper ethical and legal guardrails around AI. For an engineer, building on generative AI requires a keen awareness of both the ethical and practical uses of data.











 
 
 
Data protection. Passing a job applicant’s resume through a large language model without the applicant’s consent, or using it to write a rejection letter to a candidate, could be problematic if personally identifiable information is inadvertently revealed to LLMs. Data privacy is paramount when sending personal details to a platform that is not technically dedicated to an existing setup.
How is information masked? How are prompts reengineered? How does an engineer prompt for a specific example without passing personally identifiable information, and on its way back, how is the data substituted with the right parameters to show it back to the user?
These are all questions developers should consider when writing applications on generative AI for B2B use cases.











 
 
 
Segmented learning. Another critical factor for developers to consider is segmenting customer data from a model training or machine learning perspective, because the nuances of how an email is written varies from one organization to another, and even among different users within an organization, for example.
AI learning cannot be combined and made generic. So continuing to compartmentalize and have learning by a specific customer, location, or viewers is critical.
Cost optimization. Having the ability to cache and reuse the data is important, because data input and output can get expensive for certain use cases that involve volume transactions.











 
 
 
A small document with a huge impact
Some may question the need for written job descriptions in the modern workforce, but job descriptions remain the most effective way to communicate an employer’s talent needs and the underpinning skills for specific roles.
When done well, vacancy notices attract candidates and employees who are aligned with a company’s values, mission, and culture. A paycheck and a corner office are no longer enough to get a job seeker’s attention. They want to work for firms with a top-notch culture and impeccable values.
Using thoughtful and sensitive language signals to candidates that the employer has an inclusive workplace that considers all applicants. Similarly, by ensuring that generative AI has the proper context and that private data is kept private, developers play an important role in an exciting and promising technology that is ethical, inclusive, and free of bias.

Large language models, such as those that power popular artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT, are incredibly complex. Even though these models are being used as tools in many areas, such as customer support, code generation, and language translation, scientists still don’t fully grasp how they work.
In an effort to better understand what is going on under the hood, researchers at MIT and elsewhere studied the mechanisms at work when these enormous machine-learning models retrieve stored knowledge.
They found a surprising result: Large language models (LLMs) often use a very simple linear function to recover and decode stored facts. Moreover, the model uses the same decoding function for similar types of facts. Linear functions, equations with only two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward, straight-line relationship between two variables.
The researchers showed that, by identifying linear functions for different facts, they can probe the model to see what it knows about new subjects, and where within the model that knowledge is stored.
Using a technique they developed to estimate these simple functions, the researchers found that even when a model answers a prompt incorrectly, it has often stored the correct information. In the future, scientists could use such an approach to find and correct falsehoods inside the model, which could reduce a model’s tendency to sometimes give incorrect or nonsensical answers.
“Even though these models are really complicated, nonlinear functions that are trained on lots of data and are very hard to understand, there are sometimes really simple mechanisms working inside them. This is one instance of that,” says Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student and co-lead author of a paper detailing these findings.
Hernandez wrote the paper with co-lead author Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University; his advisor, Jacob Andreas, an associate professor in EECS and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); senior author David Bau, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern; and others at MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations.
Finding facts
Most large language models, also called transformer models, are neural networks. Loosely based on the human brain, neural networks contain billions of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that are grouped into many layers, and which encode and process data.
Much of the knowledge stored in a transformer can be represented as relations that connect subjects and objects. For instance, “Miles Davis plays the trumpet” is a relation that connects the subject, Miles Davis, to the object, trumpet.
As a transformer gains more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a certain subject across multiple layers. If a user asks about that subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to respond to the query.
If someone prompts a transformer by saying “Miles Davis plays the. . .” the model should respond with “trumpet” and not “Illinois” (the state where Miles Davis was born).
“Somewhere in the network’s computation, there has to be a mechanism that goes and looks for the fact that Miles Davis plays the trumpet, and then pulls that information out and helps generate the next word. We wanted to understand what that mechanism was,” Hernandez says.
The researchers set up a series of experiments to probe LLMs, and found that, even though they are extremely complex, the models decode relational information using a simple linear function. Each function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved.
For example, the transformer would use one decoding function any time it wants to output the instrument a person plays and a different function each time it wants to output the state where a person was born.
The researchers developed a method to estimate these simple functions, and then computed functions for 47 different relations, such as “capital city of a country” and “lead singer of a band.”
While there could be an infinite number of possible relations, the researchers chose to study this specific subset because they are representative of the kinds of facts that can be written in this way.
They tested each function by changing the subject to see if it could recover the correct object information. For instance, the function for “capital city of a country” should retrieve Oslo if the subject is Norway and London if the subject is England.
Functions retrieved the correct information more than 60 percent of the time, showing that some information in a transformer is encoded and retrieved in this way.
“But not everything is linearly encoded. For some facts, even though the model knows them and will predict text that is consistent with these facts, we can’t find linear functions for them. This suggests that the model is doing something more intricate to store that information,” he says.
Visualizing a model’s knowledge
They also used the functions to determine what a model believes is true about different subjects.
In one experiment, they started with the prompt “Bill Bradley was a” and used the decoding functions for “plays sports” and “attended university” to see if the model knows that Sen. Bradley was a basketball player who attended Princeton.
“We can show that, even though the model may choose to focus on different information when it produces text, it does encode all that information,” Hernandez says.
They used this probing technique to produce what they call an “attribute lens,” a grid that visualizes where specific information about a particular relation is stored within the transformer’s many layers.
Attribute lenses can be generated automatically, providing a streamlined method to help researchers understand more about a model. This visualization tool could enable scientists and engineers to correct stored knowledge and help prevent an AI chatbot from giving false information.
In the future, Hernandez and his collaborators want to better understand what happens in cases where facts are not stored linearly. They would also like to run experiments with larger models, as well as study the precision of linear decoding functions.
“This is an exciting work that reveals a missing piece in our understanding of how large language models recall factual knowledge during inference. Previous work showed that LLMs build information-rich representations of given subjects, from which specific attributes are being extracted during inference. This work shows that the complex nonlinear computation of LLMs for attribute extraction can be well-approximated with a simple linear function,” says Mor Geva Pipek, an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at Tel Aviv University, who was not involved with this work.
This research was supported, in part, by Open Philanthropy, the Israeli Science Foundation, and an Azrieli Foundation Early Career Faculty Fellowship.

 Artificial intelligence (AI), or technology that is coded to simulate human intelligence, is having a huge impact on the business world. Now prevalent in many types of software and applications, AI is revolutionizing workflows, business practices, and entire industries by changing the way we work, access information, and analyze data.


Key Takeaways
AI technology promises significant benefits for businesses, including improved customer engagement, data analysis, automation of processes, strategic recommendations, and enhanced decision making.AI can be applied in various business areas such as accounting and finance, customer service, recruitment, cybersecurity, sales and marketing, supply chain and logistics, information technology (IT) operations, and legal.However, implementing AI in business is not without challenges, which can include ethical and privacy concerns, skill gaps, and integration issues.The future of AI for business will necessitate ever more collaboration among governments, businesses, and individuals, as well as further integration of AI into software processes and workflows.
  Benefits of Using AI in Business  
 Artificial intelligence can deliver significant benefits across different departments and business functions. Noémie Ellezam, chief digital strategy officer of Société Générale, the sixth-largest bank in Europe, describes AI as being “an accelerator” of their digital strategy, “with potential impact across all of [their] businesses and business areas.”1


 Here are some of the advantages that AI can offer businesses.


  Improved Customer Engagement and Experience  
 Tools like chatbots, callbots, and AI-powered assistants are transforming customer service interactions, offering new and streamlined ways for businesses to interact with customers.1


  Data Analysis and Insights  
 AI can quickly process large volumes of current and historical data, drawing conclusions, capturing insights, and forecasting future trends or behaviors. These can help businesses facilitate better decision making about customers, offerings, and directions for future business growth.2




  Automation and Efficiency of Business Processes  
 AI enablement can improve the efficiency and processes of existing software tools, automating repetitive tasks such as entering data and taking meeting notes, and assisting with routine content generation and editing.3


  Personalized Recommendations and Targeting  
 AI can analyze consumer data (such as that captured in a business’s customer relationship management (CRM) system) to understand similarities in preferences and buying behavior across different segments of customers. This allows businesses to offer more personalized recommendations and targeted messaging to these specific audiences.4


  Applications of AI in Business  
 AI can be applied to many different business areas, offering increased productivity and efficiency and promising insights, scalability, and growth. Here are some of the business departments and applications in which AI is making a significant impact.


  Accounting  
 Many accounting software tools now use AI to create cash flow projections or categorize transactions, with applications for tax, payroll, and financial forecasting. It can help reduce input errors, catch duplicate or suspicious transactions, and identify opportunities to save money.5


  Content Generation  
 Generative AI can assist in writing, researching, and editing as well as creating graphics, videos, and other media. It can be used for everything from marketing campaigns to business document templates like proposals and presentations. AI can also transcribe and translate language and generate code, providing businesses with quicker, easier, and more cost-effective access to these specialized skill sets.6


  Customer Service and Support  
 Chatbots and callbots can offer businesses a way to extend their current customer service capabilities and increase the volume of customer inquiries that their team is able to respond to, in addition to freeing up time for customer service agents to focus on more complex cases or interactions. Many AI-enabled call center and voice applications can also perform caller sentiment analysis and transcribe video and phone calls.3


  Cybersecurity  
 AI-powered cybersecurity tools can monitor systems activity and safeguard against cyberattacks, identifying risks and areas of vulnerability. It can also help security teams analyze risk and expedite their responses to threats.73


  Information Technology (IT) Operations  
 The use of AI in informational technology (IT) operations is so widespread that a special term for it was coined: AIOps. AI can be used to streamline data and maintain IT infrastructure, automating tasks like performance monitoring, workload scheduling, and data backups. It offers IT professionals better insights into the root causes of anomalies and errors, allowing them to resolve system issues more quickly and anticipate future ones.8


  Financial Analysis, Trading, and Fraud Detection  
 Financial departments and businesses can benefit from quick and powerful AI-driven data analysis and modeling, fraud detection algorithms, and automated compliance recording and auditing. Because of AI’s ability to analyze large, complex datasets, individual and institutional investors alike are taking advantage of AI tools in managing their portfolios. AI can also detect fraud by identifying unusual patterns and behaviors in transaction data.910


  Human Resources  
 AI can assist human resources departments by automating and speeding up tasks that require collecting, analyzing, or processing information. This can include employee records data management and analysis, payroll, recruitment, benefits administration, employee onboarding, and more.11


  Legal  
 As a profession that deals with massive volumes of data, lawyers and legal departments can benefit from machine learning AI tools that analyze data, recognize patterns, and learn as they go. AI applications for law include document analysis and review, research, proofreading and error discovery, and risk assessment.12


  Sales and Marketing  
 Sales and marketing departments can use AI for a wide range of possibilities, including incorporating it into CRM, email marketing, social media, and advertising software. Generative AI can create all kinds of creative and useful content, such as scripts, social media posts, blog articles, design assets, and more.3


  Supply Chain and Logistics  
 AI can have a huge impact on operations, whether as a forecasting or inventory management tool or as a source of automation for manual tasks like picking and sorting in warehouses. It can prove useful in allocating resources or people, like drivers, scheduling processes, and solving or planning around operational disruptions.13


  Challenges and Ethical Considerations for Implementing AI in Business  
 In October 2023, President Joe Biden released an “Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,” citing AI’s “extraordinary potential for both promise and peril.” In it, he touched on how responsible AI use could help address urgent challenges and increase prosperity, productivity, and innovation—but noted that potential downsides include exacerbating social and societal harms such as discrimination, disinformation, and worker displacement.14


 Here’s a closer look at some of the important ethical and other considerations around implementing AI in business.


  Ethical and Privacy Concerns  
 The introduction of AI to business applications raises urgent concerns around the ethics, privacy, and security of the technology. Governance of AI technology must consider how to develop and expand current legislation around privacy and data protection, including purpose specification, data collection and use limitations, accountability and security of data storage.15


 AI also requires human oversight to review and interpret the results it generates and monitor how it is generating them, lest it end up reproducing or worsening current and historical biases and patterns of discrimination.16 For example, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University revealed that Google’s online advertising algorithm reinforced gender bias around job roles by displaying high-paying positions to males more often than women.17


  Skill Gaps and Workforce Transformation  
 Although AI can bridge skill gaps, offering workers access to skill sets like coding, translating, and writing, it also creates skill gaps. As a rapidly advancing and developing technology, training and keeping up with knowledge about AI tools can be a challenge for workers and businesses alike. A 2023 survey of small business owners by Microsoft revealed that only 10% of small businesses with up to 24 employees “know how to use AI for their work-related tasks,” while 67% “say they know little to nothing about AI in general.”18


 There is much concern over worker displacement due to the use of AI technology. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economists Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, and Simon Johnson have written about how digital technologies have exacerbated inequality over the past 40 years. However, they believe that the nature of AI’s relationship to inequality is still to be determined, and its impact will depend on how it is developed and applied—particularly, whether it is considered as a complement to human workers or a substitute for them.19


 For example, AI can be used to bolster skills and productivity as an on-the-job assistant or personalized tutor, and it could even help more people get hired by providing resume writing and editing assistance.


 MIT professor John J. Horton recommends that business leaders consider the following before deciding whether to replace human labor with AI:


 How much time the task would take otherwiseHow much the employee who performs the task is paidWhether AI is capable of correctly performing the taskHow easy it is for a human to confirm whether the AI output is accurate1920


 A 2024 International Monetary Fund (IMF) study found that almost 40% of global employment is exposed to AI, including high-skilled jobs. The study states that 60% of jobs in advanced economies may be impacted by AI, with half of those benefiting from increased productivity and half being affected in a way that could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages, reduced hiring, and, in extreme cases, job disappearance. In contrast, expected AI exposure was lower in emerging markets (40%) and low-income countries (26%), suggesting fewer immediate workforce disruptions but worsening inequality over time as the technology is adopted more widely.21


  Integration and Compatibility Issues  
 Companies that have successfully implemented AI solutions have viewed AI as part of a larger digital strategy, understanding where and how it can be instrumentalized to great advantage. This requires considering how it will integrate with current software and existing processes—especially how data is captured, processed, analyzed, and stored. Another important factor is the structure of a company’s technology stack—AI must be able to flexibly integrate with current and future systems to draw and feed data into different areas of the business.221


  Future AI Trends and Business Opportunities  
 As AI becomes ever more integrated into business technologies, it’s possible that the focus will shift away from specific AI-powered apps in favor of general AI assistance built into websites, software, and hardware. For example, Samsung’s Galaxy S24 Ultra has AI built into the phone in the form of a transcript assistant, “circle to search” feature, and real-time translation capabilities.23


 Adriana Hoyos, professor of economics at IE University, writes that as “technology’s influence endures, collaboration between governments, businesses, and individuals takes on unprecedented significance,” with “collaborating partnerships serv[ing] as incubators of innovation.” One example is Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI, which aims to responsibly democratize AI and make it more accessible. However, she notes that governments “shoulder the responsibility of recalibrating regulations to harmonize with technological progress.” She predicts that future drivers of job growth will include big data analytics, climate change technology, encryption, and cybersecurity.24


 Many successful companies are approaching AI with a view to augment current efforts and work, rather than the intention to replace human workers with AI. This future is already expressing itself in the trend of AI-augmented software development, but AI researcher David De Cremer and chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov see a future in which humans work alongside AI in a complementary way, calling it the “new diversity.” This will necessitate leaders who are skilled in creating inclusive teams and bringing different parties together.25


 Can You Use AI to Start a Business?
AI can be used to generate business ideas, write business plans, and guide entrepreneurs in the steps it takes to start a business. By making time-consuming tasks like coding a website, writing emails, and scheduling meetings more efficient, AI can save entrepreneurs valuable time and allow them to focus their efforts where they matter most.26


 Can AI Replace the Workforce In the Future?
Analysis of the impact of AI on the workforce holds mixed predictions for the future. A 2024 IMF study found that nearly 40% of global employment is exposed to AI; however, whether the technology complements or negatively impacts current jobs depends on the experience and current income of workers as well as the current level of economic development in the country of work.21


 How Is AI Used In Business Analysis?
AI business analytics tools can offer analysts and decision makers insights derived from large and complex datasets, as well as automation for repetitive tasks, such as standardizing data formatting or generating reports. Predictive analytics can identify future trends and patterns from current and historical data.2


 How Is AI Used In Healthcare?
There are many applications for AI in the field of healthcare, including analyzing large volumes of healthcare data like patient records, clinical studies, and genetic data. AI chatbots can assist in answering patient questions, while generative AI can be used to develop and test new pharmaceutical products. AI-powered robots could even be used to make surgery less invasive.27


 What Is the Impact of Using AI in Business?
AI is having a transformative impact on businesses, driving efficiency and productivity for workers and entrepreneurs alike. However, its potential to replace the jobs of human workers remains to be seen.


  The Bottom Line  
 One useful way for businesses to think of AI’s future possibilities is in terms of capabilities, as opposed to technologies. AI can support businesses in three broad categories: automating processes, analyzing data to gain insight, and customer and employee engagement. Firms that apply AI strategically in these ways have much to gain in terms of productivity, efficiency, and potential cost savings and growth.28


 However, AI presents challenges alongside opportunities, including concerns about data privacy, security, ethical considerations, widening inequality, and potential job displacement. Researchers and analysts suggest that a collaborative approach among businesses, governments, and other stakeholders is the key to responsible AI adoption and innovation.2129

Is HR really ready for generative AI? Probably not


March 25, 2024 

Brian SommerBrian Sommer is an award-winning author and consultant to some of the most complex clients globally. He has recently published his fourth book: The Executive’s ESG Playbook (available on Amazon). He welcomes your comments at contact@techventive.net. Brian has also been an HR Executive Top100 HR Tech Influencer for five consecutive years.

Generative AI is showing up in HR applications in a big way, and interest in the tools is strong. I’ve identified exactly 100 AI use cases in HR, and I’m confident I could add many more to that list. But, are HR departments taking the time to really understand these new capabilities and, more importantly, how others outside the company will use them as well? My recent interactions throughout the industry suggest that HR leaders need to pause the purchasing enthusiasm for a bit and do some soul-searching and research first.
What HR teams will need are:

new HR policies regarding the planned (or banned) use of generative AI;
deeper understanding of newer AI tools and the specific risks, security and other challenges they could possibly present;
new workflows for affected HR activities; and
new countermeasures based on how job seekers, employees and others might use generative AI tools

Let’s look at each of these areas.
Should HR object to AI-assisted resumes?
I recently spoke to an audience of about 700 HR professionals on the intersection of AI and HR. Things got interesting when I asked some pointed questions like:

Would you choose to decline to move a candidate forward in the recruiting process if their resume or cover letter was materially influenced by a generative AI tool?
How would HR professionals react if they suspected a candidate used generative AI technology to identify potential interview questions the job seeker might get asked and that the tool provided suggested answers?
Would your HR team acquire some of the new tools that detect AI-generated content that might be present in a job seeker’s resume/application?

What the audience initially registered was that they would consider an applicant whose resume had gotten some help from a generative AI tool. That sentiment, I noticed, started to change once we discussed the matter in a more fulsome manner.
And the same HR executives also thought that HR might want to get tools to look for AI-generated content in job applications, resumes, cover letters and thank-you notes. That sentiment also changed as the topic got discussed.
Here are some of the issues raised:

Tools that can identify AI-generated verbiage may themselves be AI tools and are subject to the same shortcomings found in other AI tools (e.g., hallucinations, inappropriate language, unsuitable responses, etc.). The use of these AI detection tools might open up the employer to potential litigation if a job seeker’s application was flagged as being AI-assisted when it was not. To that point, an AI tool that looks for plagiarism recently flagged a university student’s paper as plagiarized. The student claims to have used a grammar-checking tool, not an AI content-creation tool.
A job applicant who uses AI-generated copy for resumes is simply gaming talent acquisition software. Job seekers have been trying to outfox ATS (applicant tracking software) technology for decades with low-tech tricks (e.g., keyword stuffing in a resume) and are now getting more sophisticated and powerful tools to use. Job seekers are definitely using generative AI tools to do a better, more timely and efficient job of keyword stuffing.
Some job seekers may feel quite justified using these tools, as they provide them a competitive advantage, and employers have not cautioned them to avoid them.
Some might find it ironic that HR departments that are using AI tools to perform many functions (including AI-assisted job description generators) would want to prohibit job seekers from using similar tools. What’s good for the goose should also be good for the gander?
Resumes that get enhanced by AI may relegate non-enhanced resumes to the reject pile. In other words, great candidates could be eliminated from consideration, while more marginal candidates with resumes designed to delight an ATS are moving ahead in the process.

In the situation where an employer is casting for a wide net of applicants, those resumes that have been keyword stuffed and tarted-up by a generative AI will have a sameness about them that isn’t actually true. Employers that don’t look at what is (or is starting to) happen to their recruiting practices and results are in for a shock. The biggest casualties in recruiting may be:

scores of resumes will appear to be the same;
scores of candidates will appear to be great candidates, and it will be difficult to differentiate between them;
“authentic” job seekers and their paperwork will never be seen, as AI-using job seekers will advance in ATS scoring while those who don’t use AI will not get any notice; and
the actual quality of applicants being considered for in-person interviews may decline.

It saddened me to note that some companies are so focused on filling job vacancies now that they don’t care whether resumes are AI-enhanced or not. Ugh! This “the end justifies the means” kind of thinking is both unappetizing and depressing. If your firm isn’t winning its war for talent, taking generative AI shortcuts may not be the best business decision.
There are two big issues at play here. First, how can a firm understand who the authentic job seeker is if it gets super-sanitized and enhanced materials from the candidate? How much of a gap/delta is acceptable, and will the recruiting process need to be amended to add more tests or personal interviews to ascertain this recruit’s true status? Second, job seekers may currently be savvier about generative AI than recruiting or HR teams.

Recently, USA Today ran a story about a job seeker and noted that she:
“cut and pasted the job description and my resume into ChatGPT and had AI create a list of interview questions … [the job seeker] used ChatGPT to help with an early first draft of a cover letter and to critique her resume based on specific job descriptions. ‘These needed heavy editing, obviously,’ she added, ‘but they used all of the keywords that AI would look for on the receiving end.'”
Playing devil’s advocate, I noted that if the applicant’s resume is much more compelling than their actual skills, is HR incurring additional costs (e.g., more testing and interviewing of candidates) to prevent the hiring of less-qualified candidates? There’s also the opportunity cost of HR spending time and money interviewing AI-enhanced but still less-qualified candidates. What does it cost your firm when you let a great candidate get away because you let less-qualified candidates tie up recruiters’ time? And, I followed that with this question: Does your talent acquisition team ever read the resumes of people your ATS down selects to see if it is actually recommending the right people move forward? One HR person bluntly responded with, “We just don’t have time to do that.”
What I took away from these discussions is that HR professionals are approaching AI in a trusting and naïve manner that could be problematic. They also seem to be looking at AI from one perspective (i.e., their own selfish perspective) and failing to understand how other constituents might view this technology or the consequences it could generate. Having a blind spot toward generative AI can create major problems for unprepared HR teams.
These HR leaders also weren’t of one mind when it came to whether AI usage is acceptable (for HR or job seekers) or not. That’s fascinating, as it shows just how little HR professionals are talking about AI with each other. HR leaders will need to quickly get up to speed on AI, clarify what acceptable uses of the technology will be, understand all related risks (e.g., litigation, data privacy, security, etc.) and create relevant policies that all employees will follow. Apparently, that may not be happening, given the interactions I’ve recently had.

An emerging arms race
What no one is saying explicitly is that we’re seeing an arms race in recruiting technology, and HR groups need to have both effective countermeasures and policies to deal with these rapidly escalating challenges. How bad is it? One job seeker used an AI tool to not only perfect his resume but also to pre-fill applications that he submitted to 5,000 firms in one week! Job seekers will swamp talent acquisition teams with tarted-up resumes for jobs that they might not have a great interest in. This is akin to job application spamming, and it does nothing to help employers. Does your recruiting team have a countermeasure for this?
Militaries often possess teams that monitor the new armaments/weapons being deployed by other militaries. They assess how well their current methods and weaponry will perform against these new threats. Where they detect weaknesses in their current tools, they identify countermeasures (i.e., changes in their tactics and weapons).
HR organizations need to monitor competitors, technologies and job seekers to see what new tactics and tools are now possible and what countermeasures are needed in their own firm’s toolset. Generative AI is clearly triggering a need for new countermeasures, as job seekers may be better equipped than HR teams and more aware of the opportunities that new AI tools can offer. HR can’t afford to fall behind in this arms race.
Ask the right questions
I recently asked a major software vendor executive what kinds of questions prospective buyers were asking his firm regarding AI. He said that they usually only inquire as to how they can keep their internal data out of public AI models and not about much else. In other words, the world of HR is being altered materially by AI, and buyers may not be savvy enough to know what they really should acquire, what controls they’ll need and what AI-powered HR technology they should run away from.
What we’re seeing is that AI adoption and/or interest by HR leaders may be running ahead of needed policies, controls, guidelines, etc. So, before HR teams start entertaining new software purchases, they may want to consider what their AI guiding principles are first.
New policies
Generative AI should trigger discussions within every HR team. Those discussions will likely cover assessments of new AI-powered technologies and how employees, alumni, contractors, job seekers, governments and other constituents will use them. Those discussions will also illuminate whether existing HR processes and policies need to be adjusted.
The key output from these policy and process assessments could trigger new/updated guiding principles for HR’s use of new generative AI tools.


This isn’t optional, and I believe many HR teams will struggle to get full agreement on some matters. For example, what does recruiting do if some recruiters believe it is acceptable for job seekers to use generative AI to create large portions of resumes, cover letters, thank you letters and interview content while other recruiters strongly disagree with this? Some policies will generate new work (or eliminate some work steps altogether) for HR. Process changes are likely, and even the economics of the HR function might warrant review.
Guiding principles might help in evaluating new HRMS software, needed controls, policy changes, process steps and more. And these guiding principles might help prevent HR team members from doing something that exposes the company to unwanted risk and/or litigation.
Get the results you need and want
Some of the new AI tools are relatively trouble-free (e.g., benefits Q&A chatbots) while those that try to ascertain the truthfulness of a job interviewee’s responses have their challenges (and may trigger lawsuits). Not every AI-powered HR tool will be a great tool or be of great value to your firm. Each tool has its own risks and rewards, and HR teams need to look at each with a discerning eye.
HR teams need to assess whether each tool will deliver the results their organization desires. More specifically, HR should not simply acquire new AI tools without really thinking through how each will deliver competitive advantage—not just competitive parity. This effort mandates that HR leaders become very cosmopolitan—that is, to become quite aware of one’s environment (and not just of one’s firm). This worldly view should impart insights into how others will use (or abuse) these new technologies and what risks or opportunities your firm might see.
HR must get clear on the boundaries of the AI tools it will use and define the bright lines HR won’t cross. It’s time for HR to get ready for the generative AI world and to do so wisely.

0Sponsored ArticleWhat Does It Mean To Be Skills-First? Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

Artificial intelligence is transforming several business functions, including HR. However, there are concerns about privacy, trust, and the human element in HR.
So, how do HR professionals and employees view AI’s role in HR? Here are a few findings from Paychex’s recent study.

Technology, analytics, and automation are transforming every aspect of HR, from recruitment to performance management and employee engagement. That being said, while they promise enhanced efficiency, they also raise questions and concerns about trust, privacy, and the role of human judgment in a digital workplace.
So, how do employees and HR professionals view technology’s effectiveness and burgeoning role and its challenges? What are the sentiments around artificial intelligence (AI), the tasks it is reshaping, and the delicate balance between machines and humans in managing people? Paychex recently conducted a study to get some answers. The following are a few insights and steps HR pros can take to leverage technology to improve processes and the overall employee experience.
AI Is Significantly Impacting HR Processes
Incorporating AI across various business functions has become a focus for many organizations this year. In fact, the study found that 56% of HR professionals already use AI in various operations. Among them, 85% said the technology provides useful HR data and analytics.
So, what are some of the most AI-driven HR solutions? About 59% use automated candidate screening and recruitment analytics, while 46% use chatbots to handle employee queries. About 38% use automated employee onboarding and training modules, and 37% conduct performance analysis and management through AI algorithms.

Most Used AI-Drive HR Solutions (Among HR Pros Using AI)

About 56% believe AI speeds up candidate recruitment and screening, while 41% believe it speeds up employee onboarding and training. About 27% think it speeds up payroll processing and administration, and an equal percentage think it speeds up performance evaluation and management. Overall, on average, AI saves HR pros 7.5 hours per week.
Despite all this, when it comes to trusting AI for fair decision-making, only 40% of HR professionals trust it. About 28% distrust it, and 32% are neutral. Further, 79% also believe AI reduces bias, 14% believe it increases bias, and 7% think it makes no difference. These sentiments indicate that AI can pave the way for more balanced and fairer business practices.

HR Pros Believe AI Will Become an Integral Part of Operations
The world is facing a tight labor market, and organizations are increasingly incorporating technology to streamline talent acquisition and onboarding. The ability to identify and hire qualified talent quickly is particularly helpful for companies competing for top talent.
Similarly, almost 25% of HR professionals anticipate AI will become integral to HR in the next five years. About 58% feel AI will transform HR analytics and data management, 46% feel it will transform talent acquisition, and 43% feel it will transform onboarding and offboarding.
HR pros believe recruitment stands to benefit the most, pointing to a future where recruitment is more tech-driven. That said, they predict employee engagement is least likely to gain from tech advancements. HR professionals can address this by strategizing and investing more time and resources in employee engagement and development programs.
HR pros also see a few challenges related to adopting AI. For example, 53% have technical challenges adopting AI, while 44% face resistance from staff. Above 27% cite high implementation costs. HR professionals also see a few ROI-related challenges. For example, 49% find finding the right AI tools challenging, while 47% face challenges with employee acceptance. About 42% also cite a lack of proper training, and 42% cite challenges with the learning curve.
Non-HR Employees Want an Appropriate Level of AI Involvement
What do non-HR employees think about AI? Their perspectives help HR pros determine the level of human intervention and intuition in certain tasks.
For starters, about 41% of employees prefer less AI involvement, while 39% prefer the current level of involvement. Only 20% prefer more AI involvement in HR decisions. Many employees also believe there isn’t much transparency as HR departments incorporate AI in their operations. Only about 32% feel their HR departments are transparent in communications regarding AI in HR, while 38% cite poor communication. About 30% are neutral about the transparency of HR departments. HR departments can enhance communication by clearly explaining AI’s role, its benefits, and how it can affect employees’ daily work.
Regarding the HR aspects employees think should be human-led instead of AI-led, conflict resolution and employee relations come on top, with 78% agreeing. About 76% believe sensitive issues like layoffs and disciplinary actions should be human-led, and 72% believe personalized employee counseling and support should be human-led. Further, 52% believe the development and management of organizational culture should be human-led, and 46% believe DEI initiatives should be human-led.
Considering the potential challenges of an AI-driven HR department, about 71% are uncomfortable with the prospect. Data privacy is a significant concern, with 68% wary of the data risks of AI to HR processes. Moreover, replacing HR with AI will lead 46% of employees to consider quitting their jobs.

Actionable steps for HR pros
HR professionals should take the following steps to use AI to improve processes and the overall employee experience.

They should assist in implementing policies to safeguard AI practices and ensure the right measures are taken to ensure data safety.
They should ensure that the tools are validated. This helps ensure compliance with new laws related to AI in HR and reduces potential bias in HR practices.
They should understand how tools may change. They should work with legal teams and trusted vendors to conduct AI audits.
HR professionals should learn about the tools available to better support consultation with their organization and clients.
Most importantly, they should ensure a human element is present in all AI decisions.

HR professionals are cautious and simultaneously optimistic that AI can work in HR. Benefits, such as time saved and reduction in bias, point to an AI-driven future. Yet, the journey has its challenges. Going forward, balancing tech-fueled efficiency improvements with a human touch is critical. HR pros should ensure AI augments and does not replace the human touch, which is crucial to “human” resources.

Many Americans think generative AI programs should credit the sources they rely on
By Alec Tyson and Brian Kennedy

Overall, 54% of Americans say artificial intelligence programs that generate text and images, like ChatGPT and DALL-E, need to credit the sources they rely on to produce their responses. A much smaller share (14%) says the programs don’t need to credit sources, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. About a third say they’re not sure on this question.
How we did this
Pew Research Center published this analysis as part of its ongoing work to understand attitudes about artificial intelligence. This analysis draws on a survey of 10,133 U.S. adults conducted from Feb. 7 to 11, 2024.
Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.
Here are the questions used for the analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.


A separate Pew Research Center analysis finds growing public engagement with ChatGPT – one of the most well-known examples of generative AI – especially among young people.
Generative AI programs work by reviewing large amounts of information, such as the works of an artist or news organization. That allows them to generate responses when users ask questions. 
This process has spurred lawsuits from authors, artists and news organizations, who argue that this is an unauthorized use of copyrighted material. But some technology companies argue that this is fair use under copyright law and that the programs provide a clear public benefit.
Our survey finds that the public consistently says AI programs should credit sources across seven examples of content they could generate.

For instance, 75% say AI programs should have to credit the sources they rely on if they provide information that matches what a journalist wrote nearly word-for-word. Just 6% say they shouldn’t have to credit their sources in this scenario, while 19% say they’re not sure.
Majorities of U.S. adults (67% each) also see a need for crediting sources if AI programs generate images that imitate the style of a current artist or text that imitates the style of a current author.
Whether an author is living or dead has little impact on public attitudes: 65% say credit is needed if AI programs imitate the writing style of a famous author who died many years ago.
Similarly, about six-in-ten say generative AI programs should have to credit the sources they rely on if they draft a movie script in the style of a popular movie. Hollywood screenwriters recently secured limits on using AI in script writing, as part of a larger labor agreement.
The view that credit is needed also extends to more general types of information. For instance, 60% of Americans say AI programs should have to credit the sources they use if they summarize information about the U.S. population. And 61% say credit is needed if these programs provide information that was reported by many different news organizations.
How often do Americans think they interact with AI?

Over the years, Center surveys have explored public views on multiple aspects of artificial intelligence, including overall awareness of and engagement with these technologies.
Our new survey finds that 22% of Americans say they interact with artificial intelligence almost constantly or several times a day. Another 27% say they interact with AI about once a day or several times a week. Half of Americans think they interact with AI less often.
Adults with higher levels of education are more likely than those with less education to say they interact with AI frequently. For instance, 63% of postgraduates and 57% of college graduates say they interact with AI at least several times a week. That compares with 50% of those with some college education and 36% of those with a high school diploma or less education.
Younger Americans also are more likely than their older peers to say they interact with AI often. Majorities of those ages 18 to 29 (56%) and 30 to 49 (54%) say they interact with AI at least several times a week. Smaller shares of those ages 50 to 64 (46%) and 65 and older (37%) say the same.
While AI now powers many widely used functions – like personalized online shopping recommendations – its presence may not always be visible to all Americans. For instance, only 30% of U.S. adults correctly identify the presence of AI across six examples in a recent survey about AI awareness. 
Note: Here are the questions used for the analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.

On March 20, 2024, at an American Bar Association meeting held in Boston, Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda and the Acting Director of OFCCP, Michelle Hodge, indicated that the Department of Labor is moving full speed ahead on issuing multiple guidance documents regarding artificial intelligence, as directed by President Biden’s expansive AI executive order, signed on October 30, 2023. On the same panel, independent agency heads, notably Chair Charlotte Burrows of the EEOC and NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo, emphasized their ongoing commitment to use their agencies’ existing enforcement authority to address concerns with employers’ use of AI.
1. The Department of Labor and OFCCP Are Working on AI Guidance and Promising Practices
President Biden’s EO on artificial intelligence initiated a comprehensive government-wide approach to AI regulation, and set in motion actions across multiple executive agencies. One of the Secretary of Labor’s many deliverables under the EO is to develop and publish, by the end of April 2024, “principles and best practices for employers that could be used to mitigate AI’s potential harms to employees’ well-being and maximize its potential benefits.” In her remarks, Solicitor Nanda shed light on the Department of Labor’s approach towards this guidance. Notably, she said that the Department of Labor will be issuing a “broader value-based document” that contained “principles and best practices” for both employers using AI and developers of the AI tools.
Among the “principles and best practices” the Solicitor discussed were the need for employers using AI to engage with their workers, especially if their workers were unionized. She asserted, “If you are developing AI without engagement of workers, you’re going to be missing a key component.” The need for stakeholder engagement is not a new concept in AI risk management, and the inclusion of this principle should not come as a surprise to observers paying attention to other federal government efforts on AI, as the concept of stakeholder engagement was explored as part of NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework issued in January 2023.
Other principles that Solicitor Nanda mentioned were the need for human oversight of AI systems and the need for validation and monitoring. “You have to make sure it [the AI] is working,” she said. Solicitor Nanda also discussed the need for greater transparency regarding the AI systems employers were using, inviting employers and AI developers to consider whether they were creating an avenue for the public or job applicants to know that AI is being used to make an employment selection decision that might be screening out candidates.
President Biden’s executive order also specifically directs the Secretary of Labor’s report due at the end of April 2024 to cover “job-displacement risks and career opportunities related to AI, including effects on job skills and evaluation of applicants and workers.” In her remarks, Solicitor Nanda confirmed that the Department of Labor was also working on this job-displacement report.
Solicitor Nanda also confirmed that the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division is working on guidance that would make it clear that employers who deploy AI systems to monitor workers “must make sure workers are compensated.” While Solicitor Nanda did not provide further details about this guidance, President Biden’s executive order specifically directs that the Secretary of Labor “shall issue guidance to make clear that employers that deploy AI to monitor or augment employees’ work must continue to comply with protections that ensure that workers are compensated for their hours worked” in order to “support employees whose work is monitored or augmented by AI in being compensated appropriately for all of their work time.”
Both Solicitor Nanda and OFCCP Acting Director Michelle Hodge discussed the progress of OFCCP’s work on additional AI guidance. (President Biden’s executive order directs the Department of Labor to “publish guidance for Federal contractors regarding nondiscrimination in hiring involving AI and other technology-based hiring systems” within one year – i.e., by the end of October 2024.) Acting Director Hodge specifically confirmed, “We are working on new FAQs and promising practices.” In this context, we expect that Acting Director Hodge was referring to updates to OFCCP’s FAQ on Validation of Employee Selection Procedures from 2019, that touches on AI issues.
Consistent with OFCCP’s existing FAQ, Acting Director Hodge emphasized that an employment selection procedure that includes AI “still is a selection procedure” that federal contractors must audit in order “to ensure [they] are not creating barriers to equal employment.” She reiterated OFCCP’s expectation that federal contractors “can’t just pull something off the shelf and decide to use it” and that OFCCP expected employers to “drill down, under the Uniform Guidelines.” She also discussed OFCCP’s recent changes to its scheduling letter, describing these amendments as coming from OFCCP’s desire “to know at the beginning of a compliance process, are you using AI or algorithms in your screening or hiring process.”[1]
Regarding Acting Director Hodge’s reference to “promising practices” documents we note that such documents issued by federal agencies do not establish new mandatory legal requirements under federal law. Thus, failing to follow a federal agency’s “promising practices” recommendations will not independently result in an enforcement action, and conversely, demonstrating compliance with them does not independently insulate an employer from liability.[2] Nevertheless, any AI “promising practices” document issued by OFCCP has the potential to reflect the developing consensus on best practices and industry standards for managing AI risk. Employers using AI selection tools, especially federal contractors, will be well-advised to carefully consider what OFCCP will say in this area, in order to achieve compliant and responsible AI usage.
2. EEOC and NLRB Agency Heads, and the Department of Justice, Emphasized Their Existing Authority
On the same panel, leaders from the EEOC and NLRB, along with a representative of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, all agreed that using their existing enforcement authorities as employers implement AI practices is an ongoing priority for their agencies.
Johnathan Smith, Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Acting Chief of Staff of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, briefly described how the Civil Rights Division’s convened federal government officials to discuss how they could work together on AI issues. He cited challenges faced by government agencies in hiring people with technical expertise and integrating them into their legal investigation and enforcement processes. He predicted, “AI issues are going to be something that we’re all going to be grappling with for many years to come.”
EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows concurred, observing, “This is really an area where we are taking a whole of government approach…We are talking to each other and other agencies at the principal levels and up and down at all levels.”
Chair Burrows emphasized that the existing laws the EEOC enforces “really do give a lot of applicable tools to protect against harms” from AI, and that it was important for technology creators to understand that. She mentioned the EEOC’s prior technical assistance documents regarding the applicability of the Americans With Disabilities Act and Title VII to AI tools.
In response to a question regarding whether the EEOC was considering updating the 1978 Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, Chair Burrows suggested that while there might be some “clarification” forthcoming, she felt the Uniform Guidelines were “fairly clear” and the problem was not with the guidelines themselves, but rather the “way people are thinking” about them, which included “an over-simplification” of the 4/5ths test[3] set forth in the Uniform Guidelines. In her remarks, Chair Burrows emphasized, “I think the Uniform Guidelines are pretty clear that this is a rule of thumb, not an active bright-line,” and that the EEOC’s statistical cases involving discrimination were “more-sophisticated than the 4/5ths test.”
In additional comments, Chair Burrows identified two distinct issues regarding AI.
First, consistent with remarks that Chair Burrows has made in the past, she cited concerns that people with protected characteristics were disproportionately over-represented in “bad” data sets that were being used as AI training data. She also cited concerns that these same categories of people were disproportionately under-represented in “good” data sets being used to train AI.  
Second, Chair Burrows expressed concern about algorithms and AI being used to monitor employees, especially monitoring that might be happening without employees knowing about it or understanding enough about it in order to exercise their rights under the Americans With Disabilities Act.  She also expressed concern that an employee could be “stuck in a feedback loop” without being able to “find a person to talk to” to request an accommodation, in violation of the interactive process requirements in the ADA.
NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo also spoke at length about her assertions that an employer’s electronic surveillance and algorithmic monitoring of workers could violate Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. She cited her prior GC memo regarding electronic monitoring, issued in October 2022.
GC Abruzzo specifically expressed concerns regarding electronic monitoring or algorithmic management that prevented workers from taking breaks together, or which forced them to increase the pace of their work. She asserted that these practices were “interfering with [workers' rights] … to engage together to address areas of mutual concern” and that workers were entitled to do so under the NLRA. She concluded her remarks on AI emphasizing, “AI can be a great thing in so many ways, but it also can interfere with workers’ rights.” 
Implications for Employers
President Biden’s directive that the federal government adopt a “whole of government” approach to regulating AI is in full-swing, as evidenced by recent comments by multiple agency heads. Employers should expect the heightened enforcement scrutiny on AI issues from OFCCP, EEOC, the NLRB, and the Department of Justice to continue. We will continue to monitor these developing issues, especially as the Department of Labor and other agencies continue their work to meet the multiple deadlines for issuing AI-related guidance set forth in President Biden’s executive order on AI.

[1] Contractors who are scheduled for a compliance audit are now required to “identify and provide information and documentation of policies, practices, or systems used to recruit, screen, and hire, including the use of artificial intelligence, algorithms, automated systems or other technology-based selection procedures” at the time of the initial desk audit submission. 
[2] In fact, the EEOC’s “promising practices” document regarding the prevention of harassment observes that while the practices described in the document are not legal requirements, “refraining from taking certain actions recommended here as promising practices may increase an employer's liability risk in certain circumstances.”
[3] As described in the EEOC’s technical assistance on Title VII and AI, issued in 2023, “The four-fifths rule, referenced in the [Uniform] Guidelines, is a general rule of thumb for determining whether the selection rate for one group is “substantially” different than the selection rate of another group. The rule states that one rate is substantially different than another if their ratio is less than four-fifths (or 80%).”",,,,,,,,

You could be forgiven for thinking that journalists, like others who make their living from writing, would be among those most in danger of being made redundant by generative AI.

After all, tools available today at practically no cost are already capable of churning out thousands of articles by the minute.


However, studies such as this one suggest that nearly three quarters of us still prefer to read news content that’s written by a human.

According to other studies, it’s a different story with marketing copy. So perhaps we still feel that humans should take the lead when it comes to writing about serious and important topics.

PROMOTED
So, if news organizations aren’t yet ready to make wholesale cuts to their workforces, and independent bloggers and writers can still find an audience, is the generative AI unimportant to them?
Not at all. There are many other ways they can leverage this world-changing technology to become more productive, efficient, and effective at spreading the word. So, here’s a rundown of the most realistic changes I think those working in these occupations will see in the coming years.
Writing
Writing is what ChatGPT is best at and there are many other AI platforms such as Writesonic and Jasper that are specifically built to create written text. But does anyone want to read what they write?

Human writers, journalists and bloggers build a following because people like what they say and the way they say it - not what they’ve made an AI write for them.
However, there are still many ways journalists can use generative AI to do their job better.

It can help with structuring stories by suggesting the best way to present information. It can generate a list of questions that people reading their articles might want to find the answers to. And it can cut down the time it takes to write proposals, synopses and outlines, and other periphery pieces of writing needed to conduct the business of journalism.

Generative AI is likely to have a big impact on the working processes of journalists and other writers. But I don’t think journalists – good ones, at least – have to worry about being replaced by AIs for a while.
Good journalism involves coming up with original thoughts that people want to hear. While generative AI can write in a convincingly human way, ultimately, all it does is repurpose and restructure existing knowledge. Journalists will thrive in the AI age by honing their ability to uncover new facts, bring original thinking to issues and debates, and give it to their audiences in compelling, human ways.
Charts And Graphics
Journalists and bloggers often support their writing with data in the form of charts, infographics, or other visual representations. Traditionally, this would require data skills and an in-depth understanding of graphical communication.
Thanks to generative AI, journalists will simply describe the visualizations that they need and let AI generate insightful, compelling graphics. It will identify trends and suggest the best ways to present information.
Ultimately, this will make data-driven storytelling more accessible.
Reviewing And Editing Work
Once a writer has finished an article or report, it will often pass through the hands of numerous editors and sub-editors before reaching the intended audience.
Generative AI will play an increasingly important role here as it becomes routine to use it to critically appraise human output and suggest improvements. It can examine the evidence presented by the writer and identify areas where there may be holes or inconsistencies. It can also suggest alternative lines of inquiry that an article could pursue or raise important considerations that a writer might have overlooked.
Personalized Reporting
While writers and readers might prefer to read human-created content, generative AI could be useful when it comes to personalizing stories to suit a particular audience. For example, a writer could write one article giving an overview of a subject for a mainstream, non-technical audience, then use AI to personalize it depending on who is reading it – adding more technical details for experts or perhaps simplifying language further to make a version that can be better understood by children.
Automated Reporting
Many media outlets were already experimenting with automated news before generative AI exploded. Mainly, this involved using AI to fill out templated news stories by adding facts and figures from incoming data streams. For example, short sports or economic reports were being created simply by using AI to add the names of winning teams or stock market activity.
Although this enables news organizations to publish stories in large volumes and very quickly, they are very formulaic. By using generative AI, the templated parts can be re-written in order to make stories that are more interesting to read and also cover the more unusual or quirky elements that can’t be communicated simply by pulling in structured data.
And The Ugly …
Of course, there is a downside to this, as AI has undoubtedly already increased the amount of “churnalism”—low-quality journalism that simply regurgitates (or fabricates) facts to fill pages and sell advertising space.
And we can’t gloss over the fact that it’s inevitable that this kind of technology will be used by less scrupulous writers to spread disinformation, false news and propaganda.
Today’s AI can easily create convincing but entirely false narratives, and we will see this done both to make money and to destabilize political and democratic processes.
Another issue for news outlets relying on generative AI to create audience-facing content is that it isn’t always reliable and does make mistakes. Take, for example, a recent bulletin put out via a tweet stating that Elon Musk’s “massive space sex rocket” had exploded thanks to an AI transcription error.
Ultimately, though, audiences vote with their views and loyalty. Those outlets that avoid engaging in underhand tactics or becoming over-reliant on AI and continue to put out valuable, original content will be rewarded with engaged, trusting readers, viewers and listeners.

By Bryan Kirschner, Vice President, Strategy at DataStax
One of the major findings of our recently released State of AI Innovation report was how bullish managers and technical practitioners were about generative AI enhancing, rather than threatening, their careers.
A key reason why I think they’re right is generative AI’s ability to operate in useful ways using content that people already produce–or could produce quite easily.
I use the word “content” rather than “data” here deliberately. All AI thrives on data, but generative AI applications can readily be built against the documents, emails, meeting transcripts, and other content that knowledge workers produce as a matter of course.
This is made possible by a process called “retrieval augmented generations,” or RAG. RAG provides large language models (LLMs), which comprise the foundation of generative AI apps, with contextual content and data in real-time from corporate databases. (Here’s a more detailed explanation of the importance of RAG.)
Interrogate ‘all that you’ve done before’
There’s an individual use case and a (potential) enterprise use case that provide glimpses of how proprietary content can fuel powerful AI-driven outcomes.
The first is technologist and consultant Luke Wroblewski’s “Ask Luke” personal assistant. It enables people–including Wroblewski himself!–to ask questions against the 2,000-plus articles, 100-plus videos, and three books (and more) that he’s produced in his career.
Here’s how he describes the benefit of Ask Luke’s robust response to a usability question: “It’s not hard to see how the process of looking across thousands of files, finding the right slides, timestamps in videos, and links to articles would have taken me a lot longer than the ~10 seconds it takes Ask Luke to generate a response. Already a big personal productivity gain.”
As someone who has also been in this line of work a long time and values paying it forward by sharing what I’ve learned with others, being able to instantly and easily interrogate “all that you’ve done before” is a very compelling idea.
But above and beyond just saving time and (for example) getting new hires up to speed faster, generative AI offers some intriguing opportunities to raise everyone’s game–if you play your cards right as an organization.
Gain a better understanding your audience
I’ve been a long-time fan of Amazon’s “working backward from the customer” approach—specifically, the mock press release.The “customer quote” in particular invites the right kind of “outside-in” conversation: I’ve seen an example red-lined with the question, “would a customer really say this?”
It’s a powerful mechanism for pivoting people from crafting reactions that “sound great” internally with hopes of getting a green light toward something that “rings true”–and for provable reasons–coming from the audience that, at the end of the day, matters most.
This practice starts to look even more exciting with generative AI in the mix. Using RAG, a generative AI agent could read the corpus of mock press releases and real comments and reactions from customers on (for example) social media, as well as reviews and press coverage, and then provide meaningful guidance.
What teams or segments outperform or underperform? For certain audiences, is there a tendency to over- or under-shoot? By looking at consumer reaction to competitive or adjacent products, a genAI agent could enter the mix by producing what it would think a customer would say from an “outside-in” perspective–the point being not to replace the judgment of product managers, but to spin up a richer dialogue that would previously have been infeasible.
AI keeps getting better. You should, too.
This brings us to the strategic implications.
Most companies don’t do prospective press releases, but any given company might create some other form of content that’s unique fuel for generative AI. Most individuals don’t create as much content as Wroblewski, but many business units or functional organizations do.
It would be foolish to bet against generative AI’s capabilities continuing to get better. It would be wise to bet on people coming up with ingenious applications of those capabilities, using the content they already produce or could easily start producing.
As our survey showed, people are excited about the potential. Now’s the time to back them up with the permission to experiment and an architecture that’s ready and able to take all their good ideas into production without skipping a beat.

The use of artificial intelligence at work and in everyday life increases the productivity of individuals. The maximum benefit of AI is obtained by adding AI to an organization’s every application, function, and service. In order to create intelligent applications that solve real problems, we need more skills. The AI Developer microdegree offers a practical study path to AI development.
Artificial intelligence is constantly changing and evolving, offering new opportunities. Therefore, it is necessary to stay up to date with the latest innovations and applications of AI. We must continue learning and practical experimentation in order to help Finland fully utilize the potential of AI. We need in-depth development experts who understand business needs and know how to bring AI to the workplace safely, responsibly, and efficiently.
Finland has a unique opportunity to become a pioneer and role model in the deployment of artificial intelligence. We are already well-known for our high quality education, strong technology culture, reliable governance and commitment to the green transition. When we combine these strengths with excellence in application development, we can be one of the world’s most advanced countries in AI utilization, data economy, cybersecurity, and sustainability.
To renew continuous competence and ensure lifelong learning, higher education institutions and technology companies have joined forces to create a new AI Developer microdegree.
After completing the university-level, free and open-to-all AI Developer microdegree, a student has gained understanding of AI technologies, cloud services and application development. The microdegree is in English and worth 10 ETCS credits and it has been implemented in cooperation with higher education institutions, Arrow ECS Finland, Devisioona, Digital Workforce, Elisa, Microsoft, Reaktor and Sovelto Eduhouse.
“At Microsoft, we believe that technology education is essential to stay competitive in Finland and make the most of the opportunities offered by AI,” says Mervi Airaksinen, Managing Director of Microsoft Finland.
“Application development is changing at a rapid pace. Through AI, work efficiency rises to the next level. As a higher education institution, we want to offer everyone the opportunity to learn how to utilize new tools and technology. With these, one’s own competence develops and competitiveness improves,” says Rector Matti Sarén, Kajaani University of Applied Sciences.
“Efficient utilization of AI solutions requires competence development, which Arrow invests heavily in every year. It is once again a pleasure and honour to act as a corporate mentor in the new microdegree,” says Jyrki Korhonen, Country Manager, Arrow ECS Finland.
“In the next few years, information technology will grow into cross-cutting intelligence: the ability to independently advance user goals across application boundaries. For this change, we need IT educators, i.e. developers of the future,” sums up Jouni Heikniemi, CEO of Devisioona.
“At the core of Digital Workforce is continuous learning. Over the years, we have trained thousands of automation experts. We are living through a revolutionary transformation of knowledge work, which opens up opportunities to improve productivity and develop new kinds of business models with the help of artificial intelligence and automation. It’s great to be part of a team that educates new AI developers to seize these opportunities,” says Jussi Vasama, CEO of Digital Workforce.
“As Elisa, we want to be at the forefront of making Finland a forerunner in artificial intelligence, as artificial intelligence will permanently change work. The introduction of artificial intelligence as part of IT services and business processes is already improving the competitiveness of companies. More experts will be needed in all industries,” comments Sari Torkkola, Elisa’s Vice President of IT business.
“AI is becoming more democratic. That is why Finland needs all the means – such as this microdegree – to educate the next generation of technology experts to take advantage of artificial intelligence. In the end, they will enable organisations to utilise information in high-quality business operations, which will provide Finland with the keys to being a forerunner in artificial intelligence,” says Mikael Kopteff, Reaktor’s Chief Technology Officer.
“Every workplace needs its own AI developers. The growth in the areas of application of AI makes continuous learning necessary, as it is the only way to keep up with the pace of development,” assures director Marika Kotola, Sovelto Eduhouse.
The AI Developer microdegree is part of  the Skills for Jobs programme, which aims to skill or reskill 100,000 technology experts over five years. Through the programme, more than 48,000 experts have so far gained new technology skills. The Skills for Jobs programme also offers the Cybersecurity microdegree, Power Platform microdegree and the popular Practical AI course, as well as other opportunities for competence development through training partners, customer and partner skilling programmes.

It’s the organizational question that has been top of mind for executives for nearly a year now: How do I change my operating model to quickly generate value and results from generative AI?


The wealth of possibilities—and their organizational implications—can be overwhelming. By 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will have used generative AI application programming interfaces or deployed generative AI-enabled applications, according to Gartner
IT
0.0%.

However, there’s a difference between pockets of experimentation and a scalable, organization-wide approach that achieves tangible results. To bridge the gap, it’s important for executives to first distinguish between two types of value:

new businesses or changes to the customer offering, and
operational changes to support the existing business

Building Businesses With Generative AI
The biggest potential sources of value lie in building new businesses and evolving the customer offering. From an operating model standpoint, this often requires dedicated, multidisciplinary teams with enough distance from the core business and a clear sandbox where they can break rules and move fast.
In some instances, this may also require a more formal, executive-led program where decisions can be escalated and resolved quickly. Companies in highly regulated industries, such as financial services, understandably tend to shy away from the “break rules” part, opting instead for greater oversight on new businesses that hold promise. One leading global financial services company, for example, has launched an executive-sponsored approach of this kind.

Scaling a new customer use case can involve small contributions from hundreds of people. Accomplishing that kind of re-prioritization and alignment quickly can only be done with top-down sponsorship. Such sponsorship from the CEO allowed grocer Carrefour to launch Hopla, its customer assistant, in about six weeks.

Augmenting Work With Generative AI
However, most of the discussion around generative AI today is not about building new businesses or customer offerings, but about how the technology will change existing operations and reshape the workforce. Far from a doomsday scenario of a jobless future, only four of 27 industries expect net job losses as a result of AI, according to an August 2023 World Economic Forum study. Respondents surveyed for that study believe only an additional 9% of operational tasks will be automated in the next five years, supporting the idea that AI is more likely to augment jobs than replace them. Other predictive studies on potential augmentation or labor time saved from generative AI range from 12% to 34%. At Bain & Company, we estimate 20%, based on an assessment of 14 sample companies across industries.
Of course, the actual effect will be felt unevenly across capabilities and roles. In our experience at Bain, some use cases show results in line with averages. At one energy company, an AI assistant to support service agents was able to reduce customer handling time by 17%. Other use cases far exceed the averages. For example, my colleagues found that AI reduced the time needed to generate initial regulatory filing drafts at a healthcare company by around 73% when accounting for review and quality control, turning a multi-month endeavor into a weeks-long task.
Generative AI provides an opportunity for companies to make jobs better by eliminating undesirable work and creating more joyful routines. Done right, becoming more digital should always mean becoming more human.
So, how can organizations evolve to capture the most value? Adapting the operating model for work augmented by generative AI is similar to any other technology adoption. Changing the work means editing job descriptions, supporting skill development for new tools, and redesigning processes. Take an entry-level job, say, a junior engineer—the engineer is still accountable for creating code that performs as intended, but the day-to-day role may become more about code review and synthesis than code development. That frees up more time for the engineer to explore customer experience improvements or groundbreaking product features.
Similarly, team size is unlikely to change dramatically because it is defined by the nature of the work. Engineering teams likely will still function best with around six to eight people. Even if AI can handle more routine customer calls, call centers may still run teams of 15 because the higher value calls that remain are more complex and take longer, requiring a human touch.
Process redesign is often overlooked or undervalued in technology adoption because of limited collaboration between the business and technology teams. It’s imperative to have close partnership across technology, data science, and business teams to remove friction and make it easier to change the way work is done.
While many companies have engaged in isolated pilots and scattered experimentation, few have progressed to a structured, scalable enterprise-wide approach that delivers real value. In the next stage of adoption, the ability to adapt the operating model for generative AI will separate the best from the rest. Some organizations are uniquely advantaged. Their operating models already embrace change, and they are used to standing up or standing down teams around new opportunities and priorities. These leaders are moving fast with generative AI—and the results are starting to show.

Generative AI may have made headlines for its ability to write text and create art, but its uses extend beyond simply generating content. Amazon has been using the technology to recognize customer palm scans for its Amazon One payment system. Let’s explore how the technology behind ChatGPT is helping Amazon to reimagine the shopping and payment experience.


What Is Amazon One?
Forgot your wallet? No problem. That’s the idea behind Amazon One, a contactless payment system that lets customers pay, not with their wallet or phone, but with the palm of their hand. Customers show their palm to an Amazon One scanner, which then uses infrared light to recognize the palm’s unique features like lines, grooves, ridges, and veins. It’s a palm signature that is effectively connected to the customer’s credit card or Amazon account.

The scheme is being rolled out at retailers, grocery stores (including Whole Foods), and entertainment venues. But Amazon One isn’t just a payment method – it can also be used to verify a customer’s age, as an entry system, or in place of a loyalty card.

PROMOTED
Sounds great, right? However, the problem with an innovative system like this is that it needs to be super-accurate for it to work. This is where generative AI comes into play.

The Problem
When you’re training any deep learning model, if you want it to be highly accurate (which of course, Amazon does), you need quality data. And lots of it. In this case, lots and lots of images of palms. Which was a problem for Amazon, since the company only had a small amount of palm data to train their system.

So the company turned to generative AI to generate millions of synthetic images of palms to train their model. As Amazon describes it, they used generative AI to create a “palm factory.”

Known as “synthetic data,” AI-generated data like this can prove useful in several ways. For one thing, it can be used to create additional data when available real-world data is limited. It can be used to create a more balanced, diverse dataset – thereby helping to reduce bias in AI models. It can also help preserve privacy by using synthetic data instead of the real, personal data of millions of people. In other words, synthetic data can replicate the breadth and variety of real data without the complications that often come with real-world data.

So, How Did This Work In Practice?
One of the things Amazon did was use generative AI to quickly generate hands reflecting all sorts of subtle changes, such as different hand poses, different lighting conditions, and even the presence of rings, scars, and Band-Aids. Generative AI was also used to create images not just of the palm itself but of the veins underneath the skin. And this played a major role in making the system more accurate. The system was also trained to recognize the difference between a live palm and, say, someone holding a fake silicon hand over the scanner. Amazon even tested the system with 3D-printed palms, and it was able to tell the difference.
Thanks to AI, palm images could also be automatically annotated, with labels telling the system that it was looking at, for example, a hand wearing a wedding band. This saved time and allowed Amazon to accelerate the system’s training.
As Amazon explains, the problem of identifying palm scans is more complex than, say, your smartphone recognizing your face and automatically unlocking it. Your smartphone already knows who you are, so all it has to do is verify that the face in front of the screen is indeed yours. It’s a one-to-one scenario; in other words – your phone is basically working out, “Is this you or not.” Whereas an Amazon One scanner doesn’t know who is putting their hand over the scanner. It has to work out the palm signature, differentiating it from all the other Amazon One palm signatures and quickly. It must also be able to identify palms that aren’t enrolled in the Amazon One program – when a person isn’t an Amazon One customer but is trying to use the scanner anyway.
The Results Are Impressive
Amazon set out to create a highly accurate system that could recognize palm scans, and that’s exactly what it achieved. According to Amazon data, in the more than 3 million times the system has already been used, it has proven to be 99.9999% accurate. In fact, the Amazon One system is 100 times more accurate than scanning two irises, marking a significant breakthrough in biometric identification.
And as a bonus, Amazon says its system is designed to protect customer privacy. Amazon One doesn’t use palm information to identify a person – it is purely matching the palm signature to the payment associated with it. Amazon also says its system is race and gender agnostic, meaning it cannot accurately perceive sex or skin tone.

Google is pushing hard on a generative AI product that would help news outlets write, distribute, and monetize their work. “It feels very big,” one person with knowledge of the project told me. “It’s certainly a high priority project,” said another person within Google said. 
The initiative has been in the works since at least last summer, but public information about it has been scarce. Last month, a report about the program alarmed me, so I went poking around for more details. And after speaking with multiple sources close to the project, I’m going to share the most comprehensive public description of the program here with you today.
