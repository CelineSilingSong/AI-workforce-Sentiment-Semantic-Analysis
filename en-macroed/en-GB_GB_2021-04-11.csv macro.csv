Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly ubiquitous throughout all enterprises and industries. For this reason, it’s imperative that everyone in the organization understands how AI and machine learning can make them better at their jobs and help inform mission-critical decisions. But beyond a few specialized technical roles, AI literacy is currently lagging at most organizations.
So how can business leaders help encourage their non-technical employees to understand and effectively use AI in their daily work and to better collaborate with colleagues at all literacy levels?
Here are four ways to help make AI more approachable, useful, and impactful for all.
1. Make AI understandable
There is a common misconception that AI can be used and understood only by those with advanced technical or analytical skills. This mindset has deterred many otherwise strong business professionals from interacting with AI – what people don’t understand, they’re often resistant to.
Shifting this mindset must be a top-down initiative. It is the responsibility of the C-suite to educate employees on the usefulness and applicability of AI. Reframe and explain AI in relatable and simple terms and demonstrate its potential value and impact, while reinforcing the message that AI is a tool that enables better work, not a technology that’s going to replace them.
Once more employees understand what enterprise AI entails, how easy it is to use, and how its practical applications can enhance their own role and responsibilities, you will see an increased willingness to implement it.

2. Customize AI for teams
Enterprise AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The way non-technical teammates will use it varies – you cannot deploy a blanket approach across the board and hope for a successful outcome. Approaches and models must be tailored, adjusted, and optimized to meet the needs of specific departments – a daunting endeavor for teams that aren’t yet using AI.
One way to get started is to create small pilot programs and then scale those initial successes across the organization. In creating and testing experimental models, teams can refine and adjust algorithms to fit their departments’ needs, and team members can see firsthand how data can inform better decision-making.
For example, a marketing department might use several AI models to increase customer engagement, conduct accurate market segmentation, and predict churn rates. In contrast, a healthcare provider might adjust their AI models to detect insurance fraud detection, anticipate patient volumes, and predict staffing needs.
To successfully encourage non-technical roles to use AI, every employee should be able to see how it can make their job even a little easier.
3. Demonstrate AI's impact on productivity
Beyond increasing the bottom line, AI can positively impact the lives of employees by boosting their productivity and effectiveness. Software engineers, coders, and programmers are needed to create the initial AI model, but once the model is up and running, employees in many roles can use it to understand vital trends and to predict future outcomes.

Enterprise AI automates menial tasks and gives a clear picture of actionable insights, freeing employees to work strategically, creatively, and collaboratively. It’s not about replacing human workers but augmenting a team’s abilities and increasing the value of their labor.
4. Create a culture of accessible, responsible AI

Responsible use of AI requires that tools be inclusive. A human-centric approach to enterprise AI supports organizations in creating a global, interconnected, and collaborative workplace that uses AI effectively.
Noelle Silver, founder of the AI Leadership Institute, says, “Inclusive engineering isn’t all about the tech – in fact, in AI it is less about the tech, and much more about the human component and interactions.”
Non-technical roles that are slightly removed from development can provide valuable insight into the impact AI has on society. They bring important questions and discussions to the table, and often call out biases and inaccuracies in AI models.
Ensuring that all types of roles – and their different values and perspectives – are included from inception to implementation can ensure that these colleagues are not only on board, but actively contributing to the overall success of AI in the enterprise.

By Paul Mozur and Cade MetzPublished June 9, 2020Updated April 13, 2021阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版When the Defense Department launched Project Maven, an effort to remake American military technology through artificial intelligence, it leaned on a team of about a dozen engineers working at Google. Many of them, according to two people familiar with the arrangement, were Chinese citizens.The Pentagon was fine with that, they said, even amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. Classified data was not involved, the Pentagon reasoned, and the American military needed the most qualified minds for the job.The Trump administration is now moving to limit Chinese access to advanced American research, as relations between the United States and China reach their worst point in decades. That worries many of the companies and scientists in the heady realm of cutting-edge A.I., because much of the groundbreaking work coming out of the United States has been powered by Chinese brains.A new study from MacroPolo — a think tank run by the Paulson Institute, which promotes constructive ties between the United States and China — estimated that Chinese-educated researchers comprised nearly one-third of the authors of the papers accepted and promoted at a prestigious A.I. conference last year, more than from any other country. But it also found that most of them lived in the United States and worked for American companies and universities.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe study shows they are helping to power American dominance over a strategically important field, one that can enable computers of the future to make decisions, identify faces, find criminals, pick military targets and drive vehicles.Many studied in the United States, grew comfortable living there and found work with American employers. They now worry that the flow of students and professionals will come to an end.“Sacrificing international students is killing the goose that lays the golden egg,” said Lisa Li, a Chinese engineer who recently graduated from Johns Hopkins University. “It will eventually destroy the future competitiveness of America.”China sees artificial intelligence as a field of strategic importance. It has thrown vast amounts of money at researchers with an aim of getting them to work for Chinese companies and institutions.The United States has noted China’s technology ambitions with alarm. It has cracked down on espionage and bolstered enforcement of disclosure rules at American universities and institutions. Last month, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration planned to cancel the visas of Chinese researchers and graduate students who have direct ties to universities affiliated with China’s military.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEfforts that broadly block Chinese talent could undermine the American lead in A.I., said Matt Sheehan, an analyst with MacroPolo and a co-author of the study.“These are some of the brightest minds in China, and they’re choosing to work for American research labs, teach American students and help build American companies,” Mr. Sheehan said. “If the U.S. no longer welcomed these top researchers, Beijing would welcome them back with open arms.”MacroPolo looked at a sample of papers published last year at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. NeurIPS, as it is known, focuses on theoretical advances in neural networks and deep learning, which have anchored recent developments in A.I. It found that more than half of the papers were written by authors in the United States.






















Many top A.I. researchers start their academic careers in China, but they don’t stay there.

The think tank also looked at where the authors went to school. It found that nearly 30 percent of them pursued undergraduate degrees in China, more than any other country. But more than half went on to study, work and live in the United States.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTChinese A.I. researchers may have more opportunities in the United States. MacroPolo found that the top homes of the authors included Google, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Microsoft Research. Tsinghua University and Peking University, two of China’s best universities, were the only Chinese institutions among the top 25.Multiple studies indicate that Chinese nationals who studied A.I. in the United States were likely to remain. Through 2018, nine out of 10 who completed doctorate degrees stayed for at least five years after graduation, according to a study from Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.Those numbers showed no signs of decline, but some organizations say more recent tensions between the United States and China have already begun to affect talent flows.“I am terrified by what the administration is doing,” said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a high-profile research lab in Seattle, which has seen a significant decrease in the number of applications from Chinese researchers. “How many times can you push people out the door and put obstacles in their way before they say, ‘I am not going to try’?”Chinese-born researchers are a fixture of the American A.I. field. Li Deng, a former Microsoft researcher and now chief A.I. officer at the hedge fund Citadel, helped remake the speech recognition technologies used on smartphones and coffee-table digital assistants. Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford professor who worked for less than two years at Google, helped drive a revolution in computer vision, the science of getting software to recognize objects.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt Google, Dr. Li helped oversee the Google team that worked on Project Maven, the Pentagon effort. Google declined to renew the Pentagon contract two years ago after some employees protested the company’s involvement with the military. The Google team worked to build technology that could automatically identify vehicles, buildings and other objects in video footage captured by drones. In the spring of 2018, at least five of the roughly dozen researchers on the team were Chinese nationals, according to one of the people familiar with the arrangement.A certain amount of government restriction is natural. The Pentagon typically bars citizens of rival foreign powers from working on classified projects. China also has a long history of carrying out industrial espionage in the United States.A.I. is different, people in the industry argue. Researchers generally publish what they find, and anybody can use it. So what the industry is looking for is not intellectual property but the minds that conduct the research.“For much of basic A.I. research, the key ingredient in progress is people rather than algorithms,” said Jack Clark, policy director of OpenAI, a prominent lab in San Francisco, and a co-chair of the AI Index, an annual effort to track the progress of A.I. research, including the role of Chinese researchers.“There’s a lot of open-source technology lying around for researchers to use, but relatively few researchers with the sorts of long-term idiosyncratic agendas that yield field-changing advances,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPeter Chen, a prominent Chinese-born researcher who is a legal U.S. resident, said further government crackdowns could hurt companies across the community, including his start-up, a robotics company called Covariant.AI in Berkeley, Calif. “If this continues, there will be people we can’t get,” he said. “It will definitely affect our ability to recruit talent.”For many Chinese students, the decision to stay or go has been more personal than political. Robert Yan, a former Google employee, returned to China to work at an A.I. start-up. The Bay Area didn’t suit him. He hated driving and missed Chinese food. A native of Shanghai, he thought he could advance more quickly in his home culture.Still, Mr. Yan said, only about one out of 10 of his Chinese colleagues in the United States chose to go home. For those looking to do high-end theoretical research, many Chinese companies still weren’t the best place, he said.“Compared to Google I now have far less freedom,” Mr. Yan said. “At a start-up you need to have a reason to do each task. We’re chasing efficiency. That does not facilitate doing things because you’re curious.”Ms. Li, the Johns Hopkins graduate, helped organize a petition supporting foreign student access to the United States. She prefers living in the United States in part because China’s tech industry is riddled with sexism.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“I’m big, and I’m loud,” Ms. Li said. “Respect for female engineers is very important to me.”Lin Qiqing contributed research.Paul Mozur is a technology correspondent focused on the intersection of technology and geopolitics in Asia.

Artificial Intelligence: Can We Trust Machines to Make Fair Decisions?

Data and Computer Scientists, Ecologists, Pathologists, and Legal Scholars Study AI’s Biases


by  Catherine Kenny

April 13, 2021










Artificial Intelligence touches almost every aspect of our lives, from mobile banking and online shopping to social media and real-time traffic maps. But what happens when artificial intelligence is biased? What if it makes mistakes on important decisions — from who gets a job interview or a mortgage to who gets arrested and how much time they ultimately serve for a crime? 
“These everyday decisions can greatly affect the trajectories of our lives and increasingly, they’re being made not by people, but by machines,” said UC Davis computer science professor Ian Davidson.

A growing body of research, including Davidson’s, indicates that bias in artificial intelligence can lead to biased outcomes, especially for minority populations and women.
Facial recognition technologies, for example, have come under increasing scrutiny because they’ve been shown to better detect white faces than they do the faces of people with darker skin. They also do a better job of detecting men’s faces than those of women. Mistakes in these systems have been implicated in a number of false arrests due to mistaken identity.
In fact, concern about bias in facial recognition technologies led to a number of bans on their use. In June 2019, San Francisco was among the first cities in the nation to ban the use of facial recognition technologies by the police and other city departments. The State of California followed suit in January 2020, imposing a three-year moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology in police body cameras.

Has racial profiling gone digital?
A number of technologies take facial recognition a step further, analyzing and interpreting facial attributes and other data to make risk assessments, identify threats or unusual behavior. In the world of data surveillance, this is called “anomaly detection.” Increasingly, these technologies are deployed by law enforcement, airport security, and retail and event security firms. 
In a recent study, Davidson and Ph.D. student Hongjing Zhang demonstrated that these types of anomaly detection algorithms are more likely to predict that African Americans or darker skinned males are anomalies.
“Since anomaly detection is often applied to people who are then suspected of unusual behavior, ensuring fairness becomes paramount,” Davidson said. “If one of these algorithms is used for surveillance purposes, it’s much more likely to identify people of color. If a white person walks in, it would not be likely to trigger an anomalous event. If a black person walks in, it would.” 



“The machine is not biased. It has no moral compass. It’s just seen more white faces in the data it was trained on before and so it’s learned to associate that with normality.”  — Ian Davidson, UC Davis computer science professor



That sounds a lot like computer-aided racial profiling.
“But it’s completely unintentional,” Davidson said. “The machine is not biased. It has no moral compass. It’s just seen more white faces in the data it was trained on before and so it’s learned to associate that with normality.”
Ensuring that AI is fair and free from bias is complex, he explained. His work shows that adding more people of color to the data the machine learns from helps, but it does not eliminate the issue. 




A UC Davis study showed that deep anomaly detection methods are unfair. When tested on facial images, the algorithm predicted most of the white faces to be normal, while many black faces fall in the group categorized as anomalies. There’s also a noticeable difference with gender. More females are predicted to be in the normal group, with more males predicted to be anomalies. (Courtesy)




Bias reflects an unjust world
Examples abound of technologies that don’t perform accurately for people with darker skin. In February, the FDA warned that the pulse oximeters used to monitor oxygen saturation levels for COVID-19 patients may be less accurate for people with darker skin pigmentation. A study from Georgia Tech also found that people of color were more likely to be hit by driverless cars because object detection systems they use to recognize pedestrians don’t work as well on people with darker skin.
“Bias reflects a world that is unjust,” said Computer Science Professor Patrice Koehl. He teaches an ethics course that’s required for all UC Davis students majoring in computer science and engineering. Part of the course focuses specifically on bias in AI and other technologies.
“I want students to have an awareness of the problem and to understand why there are biases in our decisions,” Koehl said. “For example, if all your colleagues are white male, you’re unlikely to discuss problems associated with machine recognition of dark skin.”




“The danger with bias comes from the fact that we consider AI as a system that can make decisions.” — Patrice Koehl, UC Davis computer science professor

This lack of diversity in the workforce has been a persistent problem in the technology sector. Nearly 80 percent of employees at Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are male and there’s been little growth in Black, LatinX and Native representation since 2014, according to Mozilla’s 2020 Internet Health Report. 
“The danger with bias comes from the fact that we consider AI as a system that can make decisions,” Koehl said. “You want that decision to be as informed as possible. If the information you provide is wrong or biased, the decision will be wrong.”
When it comes to developing future technologies, Koehl is optimistic that today’s students will do a better job. “The problem associated with AI was created in the last 20 years, partly by software engineers. If those engineers were able to create such a big problem, my hope is that the next generation of engineers will spend just as much time looking at the problems and identifying solutions,” he said.
Unraveling the tangled roots of bias
While there’s growing awareness of bias in artificial intelligence, there’s no simple solution. Bias can be introduced in a number of ways, beyond the software engineer developing a new technology. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms rely on data, which is not always representative of minority populations and women. That’s because behind the data, the decisions — about which data to collect and how to use it — are still made by people. 
“We cannot address bias and unfairness in AI without addressing the unfairness of the whole data pipeline system,” said Thomas Strohmer, director of UC Davis’ Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research, or CeDAR. 
CeDAR is a hub for research activity focused on using AI for social good, from better healthcare to precision agriculture and combating climate change. Fighting bias and standing up for privacy is a natural part of that mission, Strohmer said.




“Things like racial profiling existed before these tools. AI just enhances an existing bias."" — Thomas Strohmer, director of CeDAR

“Things like racial profiling existed before these tools. AI just enhances an existing bias. If you feed a biased data set into an algorithm, the result will be a biased algorithm.” 
Because new technologies are often adopted at scale, Strohmer noted, biases can quickly become widespread, and they’re not always easy to detect. To determine if there’s bias in a data set or an algorithm, you need access to the data and the algorithm. 
Facial recognition, video analytics, anomaly detection and other kinds of pattern matching are being used in law enforcement — often out of public view.
AI in the shadows
Elizabeth Joh, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law, says this hidden nature of AI is a major concern. 
“If there are problems in law enforcement, they are increasingly difficult for people to see,” said Joh, who has written extensively about technology, policing and bias. “Most people understand the utility of a firearm and a badge. If someone experiences excessive force by the police, we intuitively understand that. With technology, we might not even recognize that the problem exists. You might never know unless you become the target of that interaction.”
For this reason, she said accountability is crucial. She points to increasing experimentation with AI tools by police departments in towns and cities all across the country, all with little consideration for long-term consequences.
“We need to realize that these tools can quickly get out of hand or can be used in ways that are unexpected and have socially harmful consequences or disparate consequences,” Joh said. “A certain amount of bias has always existed in policing. Hidden technologies can exacerbate the problem immensely.”
Joh added it’s not too late for police departments and other organizations to take a step back and ask the most fundamental questions about the use of AI: Should we be using these tools at all?
Harnessing AI’s power for good




Pamela Reynolds, Associate Director of the UC Davis DataLab

“Education, training and promoting diversity are key to addressing how technology is perpetuating bias,” said Pamela Reynolds, associate director of the UC Davis DataLab: Data Science and Informatics department. “Just as AI is contributing to these persistent societal problems, it can also be empowering for uncovering bias and finding solutions.”
In this regard, the DataLab leads by example. It supports a diverse faculty and affiliates program and hosts events for women and underrepresented individuals in data science. 

WHAT DO DATING TECHNOLOGY AND ALZHEIMER’S HAVE IN COMMON?

UC Davis neuropathologist Brittany Dugger, along with researchers at UC San Francisco, has found a way to teach a computer to precisely detect one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease in human brain tissue, delivering a proof of concept for a machine-learning approach capable of automating a key component of Alzheimer’s research. Read the research, and watch the video.​ 





“In data science, we are working with large sets of information and these inevitably reflect the structural inequalities of our society,” said Reynolds, who is an experimental ecologist by training. “Without a critical and inclusive approach to data and the AI tools it enables, we run the risk of reproducing past injustices.” 
The DataLab helps students and researchers understand the complexity of large data systems and how technologies and computational methods work. This has added value to a number of research projects, including a three-year study to improve early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s in women and communities of color, being conducted by Brittany Dugger, assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine, and her team at UC Davis Health. 
Trust will require transparency
The trend toward greater use of artificial intelligence shows no signs of abating  — whether it’s to improve healthcare, recommend movies via a streaming service, conduct surveillance, or any of a myriad of other uses.
For that reason, transparency in AI is more important than ever. According to Davidson, that will require fairness, explainability and privacy.
“As machines replace humans and make more decisions, we need to be able to trust them,” he said. “That includes understanding exactly how machine algorithms are processing information and how decisions are being made.”

The first AI application programs for playing checker and chess were developed in 1951. After the ’50s, AI was on the rise and fall until the 2010s. Over the years, there have been some investments in AI by vendors, universities, institutions. Sometimes, hopes were high and sometimes hopes were low. It was referred to as the artificial intelligence winter when there was not enough interest in AI from industries.For the last ten years, AI, especially Deep Learning (a subset of AI), has been on the rise after two successful events: First, IBM announced the Watson super system which defeated several Jeopardy multiple time winners, namely Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings on February 14–15 and AlexNet, the name of a convolutional neural network (CNN), competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge on September 30, 2012 and achieved the top in this challenge. Based on various market research, almost all institutions in different industries have started to invest in AI and they will increase investments in AI for different use-cases in upcoming years. Future jobs related to AI will be needed more based on the World Economic Forum’s ”Future of Jobs” report (October 2020). Moreover, according to Glassdoor online employment company, data scientist has been called one of the best jobs in the USA last 3 years.References to the phrase “cloud computing” appeared as early as 1996, with the first known mention in a Compaq internal document. The term cloud was introduced even before 1993. But modern cloud computing was created and popularized by Amazon in 2006 with Elastic Compute Cloud service. The first cloud delivery model was Infrastructure as a Service to provide pre-packaged IT resources to users. Later delivery models PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) were introduced. All these delivery models were used for different workloads including AI workloads. There are there cloud deployment models namely Public, Private and Hybrid. These deployment models are also important to locate AI workload based on functional and non-functional requirements and constraints. According to the World Economic Forum’s “The Future of Jobs” report, cloud computing is the highest priority for business leaders and until 2025, cloud computing will be adopted the most by companies.Though artificial intelligence started much earlier than cloud computing, cloud computing and its technologies have improved AI very much. Cloud computing has been an effective catalyst.Image by Kivanc Uslu, inspired by source AI dynamic forcesWe can see dynamic forces that have shaped AI: Data/datasets, processing capability including GPUs, models/algorithms, and talents/skills. Let’s look at how cloud computing has been taking part to advance and enrich AI ingredients:Cloud delivery modelso IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) helped AI practitioners to have an infrastructure environment — CPU, memory, disk, network, O/S easily so that a practitioner doesn’t lose time without waiting for an infrastructure team to prepare it. Moreover, cloud providers started to provide GPU resources later.o PaaS (Platform as a Service) helped AI practitioners to use AI and data science services including jupyter notebooks, data catalog services to develop new generation applications easily.o SaaS (Software as a Service) helped users to consume AI services within an application i.e. CRM, payment applications to create efficient results.Cloud technologieso Containers: As containers started to isolate applications from computing environments, containers provided the same interface and environment to all data scientists. Moreover, data scientist teams may run their containers on different cloud providers even with GPU capabilities that they preferred.o Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. As data scientists wanted to use containerized data science platforms in a scalable way, Kubernetes helped them. Kubernetes provides efficient usage of computing environment resources including GPU. Kubernetes also provides data science applications, platforms running on containers to run on different cloud providers without worrying about compute environment.o Data Sets consumption: Data is the most important ingredient of AI. You need to have rich data sets to run your algorithms, models. Whether data sets are shared or not from a cloud environment, once you got it that you could store them on public or private cloud environments to work on them easily.Talent/Skills availabilityo Although classical AI courses, educations were available in universities especially as part of computer engineering, computer science, applied mathematics, nowadays independent AI engineering bachelor and data science master programs have been available in different universities. Moreover, specialized data science courses are available from well-known universities. Coursera, Udemy also provides very successful courses about deep learning, machine learning courses on the cloud.o Competition platforms like Kaggle, CrowdANALYTIX run on cloud environment and where data experts collaborate & compete to build & optimize AI, ML, NLP, and Deep Learning algorithms. These platforms are open to everyone. Some Data sets are available. With these new platforms, new talents can be raised.DevOpso DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The term was the first time used in a conference with the same name. Although it is possible to use DevOps approach in any development environment, especially microservices architecture style development requires DevOps. DevOps addresses the application development lifecycle, not the Data Science life cycle. So ModelOps was coined by Gartner in 2018. Before ModelOps, MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) was used as an extension of DevOps.Almost all cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle so on) already provide complex extensive data science and machine learning platforms and API services (i.e. NLP, Vision, Automated Machine Learning) in their cloud environment. Moreover, strong analytic firms (IBM, SAS, RapidMiner) provide their data science and machine learning platforms on different cloud providers. Many data science platforms and AI API services are also available on premise with cloud native (Kubernetes) environments. It seems that cloud providers and analytic firms will enrich these services on the cloud platform in the future.ConclusionDifferent analysts and technology companies predict future AI usage in different industries with different use cases. Cloud delivery and cloud computing models will help much to shape to use of AI use cases effectively. Moreover, edge computing which extends the cloud capabilities to on premise with low latency even offline capabilities will provide more use cases (i.e. video analytics) as organizations will have large amounts of data with processing capability on premise. And quantum computing will be expected to advance AI, especially in machine learning.Sources and further readingThe Dynamic Forces shaping AIhttps://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-four-dynamic-forces-shaping-ai/IBM’s new tool lets developers add quantum-computing power to machine learninghttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ibms-new-tool-lets-developers-add-quantum-computing-power-to-machine-learning/Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning PlatformsMagic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning PlatformsThis report assesses 20 vendors of platforms that data scientists and others can use to source data, build models and…www.gartner.com",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*X0GD0v-NqWu_ysnnSNxrxQ.png'],https://towardsdatascience.com/the-role-of-cloud-computing-in-artificial-intelligence-507ffd68ca46,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-role-of-cloud-computing-in-artificial-intelligence-507ffd68ca46,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kivanc Uslu', 'url': 'https://towardsdatascience.com/@kivancus'}",2022-01-07T02:34:58.822Z,2021-04-13T03:40:28.606Z,The Role of Cloud Computing in Artificial Intelligence,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Towards Data Science', 'url': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 192, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:384/1*cFFKn8rFH4ZndmaYeAs6iQ.png'}}",,,,,,,The Role of Cloud Computing in Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,2021-04-13T03:40:28.606Z,507ffd68ca46,['Kivanc Uslu'],,,,,,,,,

Published: Apr 11, 2021 11:44 AM ESTDonovan Alexander3 years ago0ShareChristie's/Wikimedia CommonsIn 2018, in late October, a distinctly odd painting appeared at the fine art auction house Christe’s. At a distance, the painting looks like a 19th-century portrait of an austere gentleman dressed in black. Contained in a gilt frame, the portly gentleman appears middle-aged; his white-collar insinuates that he is a man of the church. The painting seems unassuming, something expected at an auction house that sells billions of dollars of painting each year.  Bionic hands and laser rust removal, the best of IE this week

However, upon closer inspection, things get a bit odd. The work appears to be unfinished. The facial features are indistinct, as if the entire body of the subject was captured in motion. In fact, the whole composition is also somewhat displaced to the top left. The entire painting itself is soft but surreal. 
If you were at the auction house, you would read that the painting is part of a series of portraits of the Belamy family. The aforementioned piece is of Edmond de Belamy. But, who is Edmond de Belamy? Some famous family head? A renowned preacher? Someone of great wealth? Well, Edmond de Belamy does not exist. 
The answer to our mystery can be found at the bottom right of the portrait. There you will find the artist’s signature in cursive Gallic. It reads: 
Source: Christie’s/So Obvious
Our painter is a machine — an intelligent machine. Though the initial estimates had the portrait selling under $10,000, the painting would go on to sell for an incredible $432,500. The portrait was not created by an inspired human mind but was generated by artificial intelligence in the form of Generative Adversarial Networks or GAN. That’s right; machines are starting to take over the art world. 
Artificial Intelligence able to comprehend and create art would represent a big step in developing intelligent machines
The AI “painter” was engineered by the Paris-based collective Obvious. They fed their GAN (more on this later) a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries. Their algorithm analyzed the human-made images and proceeded to create its own art based on what it had learned from the thousands of portraits. 
AI art is nothing new. More than 150 years ago, the famous mathematician Ada Lovelace dreamt of developing a computer able to create music. Indeed, it seems that the rise of intelligent machines is imminent. AI is growing more prevalent, helping to analyze and categorize data and solve problems in a wide number of fields. Yet, artificial intelligence is also intruding into the creative world and is being used to develop music, paintings, and poetry.

Aside from its potential financial value, the research driving this field could take AI further than we’d previously thought possible. Artificial Intelligence that is able to create art indistinguishable from that created by humans could represent a big step in building machines that can think more like humans. After all, what is more human than making art? 
However, commercial projects like the Edmond Belamy portraits and similar experiments in computational creativity have sparked debates among engineers, artists, philosophers, and concerned citizens. 
Can artificial intelligence really create art? 
So, how would you go about teaching a computer algorithm how to draw a dog? Like a child trying to draw a dog for the first time, you could start by giving it various images of dogs, to get a general idea of what a dog looks like and what features make up a dog. By creating its own image of a dog, and then comparing it against the images in the data set, over time the algorithm would “learn” how to create a puppy portrait. This process of getting a machine to learn from past data without new programming is how machine learning works. 
This process uses what is known as a neural network, or a series of algorithms designed to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. As new data is added, the neural network can adapt to generate the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.
There are many different types of machine learning techniques and architectures used by researchers. However, when creating art, one commonly used technique is called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). For the sake of simplicity, we will primarily focus on GANs in this article.
What is a Generative Adversarial Network?
Originally developed by Ian Goodfellow and set out in a 2014 paper, GANs are a type of machine learning technique that uses two neural networks, pitting one against the other in order to generate an output that can pass for real data. GANs can be effectively used to create art, among other things. But how do they work?
Simply put, the two neural networks are called a Generator and Discriminator. Say we want to train our model to create its own 19th-century portrait of a dog. For the sake of our example, think of the Generator as an art forger and the Discriminator as an art authenticator. We will first need to show the Generator thousands of paintings of dogs in various sizes and breeds, so that it can learn what different elements can make up a dog. 
The Generator uses the information in the data set to create a painting of a dog. The Discriminator will then try to spot the difference between the synthetic painting and the human-created ones from the data set. When the Discriminator spots the “fake,” the Generator “learns” how its attempt failed and tries again. In the beginning, the Generator makes many paintings that do not look dog-like enough to fool the Discriminator. 
However, the Generator also learns from the Discriminator’s constant feedback. Eventually, it creates dog portraits that look more and more like dogs, until it can eventually fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real-life portraits. The end result is our art. 
One of the most extraordinary things about GANs is that you can take the underlying architecture and train the model on any data set that you want
This method can be used not just for art, but also for voices, text, and even faces. The viral website This Person Does Not Exist creates eerily realistic human faces using Generative Adversarial Networks, creating, as the name implies, faces of humans that do not exist, but which are almost indistinguishable from those that do. Factors like the size of the dataset, the underlying features of the data, the time you spend training your model, and the type of GAN model all affect the final output. By using different types of datasets, you can create something hyperrealastic like the images on the Does Not Exist website, or something dreamy and abstract like the Edmond Belamy portrait. 
There are various methods to this machine madness 
Artists, researchers, and data scientists are exploiting the power of Generative Adversarial Networks to create artistic masterpieces. One of the most prominent figures in this growing artistic field is the New Zealand artist and lecturer in computational design, Tom White. His artwork investigates, “the Algorithmic Gaze: how machines see, know, and articulate the world”. White has collaborated with AI systems to create art which depicts the world not as humans see it, but as algorithms do.

To humans, the pictures White’s algorithms create look like random arrangements of lines and blobs. But to the algorithms, they can be identified as specific objects: a shark, binoculars, a lawnmower. The images are created by choosing an object and then having a drawing system generate some abstract lines. This image is fed into a machine vision classifier, which tries to guess what the chosen object might be. Based on the guess, the drawing system then tweaks the image and feeds it through again. The process continues until the classifier guesses correctly.
However, much like Kadinsky, Picasso, and Miro, these are abstract paintings. They are not a human’s idea of what the object looks like, but a machine’s idea — they represent how the algorithm “sees” the world. And this, it turns out, is very different from how a human sees the world.
White’s work is just the tip of the iceberg. The German artist Mario Klingemann has developed neural networks the produce dreamlike antique-looking portraits that evolve and “come to life” in real-time. Another AI artist is Google’s former artist in residence, Sougwen Chung, who has created a system that draws alongside her to make stunning duet paintings. 
Outside the realms of painting, researchers have also managed to train AI to write poetry. In a paper published by the University of Toronto and IBM, the researchers describe how they used 3,000 sonnets to train an algorithm to write its own Shakespearean-style sonnets. This is one end result:
“With joyous gambols gay and still array
No longer when he was, while in his day
At first to pass in all delightful ways
Around him, charming and of all his days”
Not bad for a machine, right? But what if music is your preferred form of expression? AI can do that too. In the spring of 2019, classical music enthusiasts gathered for an unusual event. The musical experience featured music composed by Bach and by artificial intelligence. Audience members were tasked with deciphering which musical composition was created by the human and which was created by machine. 
Using a form of Generative Adversarial Network, researchers behind the project were capable of training AI to compose music that sounded like Bach himself came back to life. Even the lead on the project, Marcus du Sautoy, an Oxford mathematician, struggled to decipher the differences in the two compositions. 
But, is AI truly creating art?
Can artificial intelligence be creative? This question lies at the heart of the research driving this field. Let’s go back to our painting examples. Who is truly the author behind the paintings? The algorithm itself or the person behind it? For many, it is the former. We humans like to think that our creativity makes us unique, something that separates us from animals and machines. However, others argue that the vastness of human creativity can be condensed into a complex process that involves essentially solving problems.

Can a machine be taught to mimic the creative process? Professor Marcus du Sautoy, the author of The Creativity Code, doesn’t necessarily think so. If anything, Professor Sautoy believes we are asking the wrong question. Instead of thinking about AI as replacing human creativity, it’s beneficial to examine ways that AI can be used as a tool to augment human creativity. 
In the examples here, AI has been used to explore new perspectives on existing mediums. The machines we have seen so far may not be truly creative, as they still rely on humans for their initial data and parameters, their “sources of inspiration”. If anything, this new creative process is collaborative rather than adversarial. 
So rather than say, This Art was Created by AI, it would be more appropriate to say that This Painting Was Created with the Help of AI. It is just not as catchy.
Even if machines grow to be more intelligent, reaching some type of General intelligence, Professor Sautoy believes that their role in creating art will still be collaborative, exploring entire new creative realms that would likely not develop if either of them were working alone. 
You can create your own AI art 
Perhaps you could even sell one as an NFT? There is a wide range of tools out there that allow those with little to no background in programming or machine learning to create their own art. Tools like GANBreeder will enable you to take two images and create a new one using various GAN models and datasets. If you want a little more control, without coding, check out the semi-free tool, Runaway ML. You can import massive data sets and synthesize everything from galaxies that do not exist to your own pokemon. RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

Artificial intelligence experts from Tulane University and the University of Maryland have received a Google Scholar Research Award to develop better ways of promoting diversity and fairness in a variety of pipeline and selection problems, including hiring, graduate school admission and customer acquisition.
Nicholas Mattei, an assistant professor of computer science at Tulane, and John Dickerson, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, received the $60,000 award as part of the Google Research Scholars program, an initiative by Google to support early career professors who are pursing research in fields relevant to Google.
“Our work aims to operationalize and incorporate responsible AI practices and techniques into real-world systems, informed by data from real processes at our two universities,” Mattei said.  “We’re not going to develop a solution in a year. Our intention is to produce an open-source toolkit, preliminary studies and whitepaper to be discussed by policymakers.”
“This research directly addresses questions of transparency, constraints, and fairness when working with complex, multi-stage decision-making problems.""
Nicholas Mattei, assistant professor of computer science at Tulane
The work is an outgrowth of their recent paper, “We Need Fairness and Explainability in Algorithmic Hiring,” presented virtually at the 2020 Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems Conference.
“Our proposal focuses on graduate admissions but is broadly applicable to any problem where we need to expend a limited set of resources to validate and select a small group,” Mattei said.
In focusing specifically on graduate admissions, a form of academic hiring, Mattei and Dickerson will look at two key factors related to admissions — how to allocate aspects of the process, such as budget and interview slots, and how to explain decisions made by their algorithm in a transparent and compliant way.
“Several recent reports related to algormithic hiring, including one from the non-profit UpTurn, motivates us to focus on how to allocate additional human resources to these problems, and we feel that we must treat issues of bias and fairness as first-order concerns in any system that may have an impact on people,” Dickerson said.
“This research directly addresses questions of transparency, constraints, and fairness when working with complex, multi-stage decision making problems where we need to end up with a recommendation or selection at the end. This type of sequential decision-making problem is typically optimized using multi-armed bandit algorithms,” Mattei said. “But these algorithms may optimize for criteria that we may not intend, or may not even be legal.”
Such algorithms are in widespread use across many of Google’s core areas, including recommendation and advertising and hence understanding them in detail is critically important, he said.
Mattei and Dickerson believe their work will support their thesis that data-driven approaches to measuring and promoting fairness at a single stage of the talent sourcing process can be extended beyond graduate admissions. They said the technologies could be applied to internal product ideation and review, academic proposal reviewing, advertising selection or any setting that involves the collection of recommendations from experts.
“We envision these as algorithms and workflows that could be deployed both internally at Google or offered broadly as screening tools throughout GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and other Google products.”
Mattei and Dickerson have worked closely together for many years, and the fact that they work at two very different academic institutions — one a large public university in a wealthy geographic area and the other a smaller private university in a lower income part of the country — will actually be an advantage in their research.
“The student application profiles at both schools are very different, and will lead to different concerns and distributions of data” Mattei said. “We believe this diversity strengthens the results that will arise from the data-driven validation of our model.”

But it is still hard to understand. BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.In this article, we will go a step further and try to explain BERT Transformers. BERT is one of the most popular NLP models that utilizes a Transformer at its core and which achieved State of the Art performance on many NLP tasks including Classification, Question Answering, and NER Tagging when it was first introduced.Big Data JobsSpecifically, we will try to go through the highly influential BERT paper — Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding while keeping the jargon to a minimum.What is BERT?In simple words, BERT is an architecture that can be used for a lot of downstream tasks such as question answering, Classification, NER etc. One can assume a pre-trained BERT as a black box that provides us with H = 768 shaped vectors for each input token(word) in a sequence. Here, the sequence can be a single sentence or a pair of sentences separated by the separator [SEP] and starting with a token [CLS]. We will get into explaining these tokens in more detail in later stages.A very High view of BERT — We get a 768 sized vector for all words in our input sentence.What is the Use of a BERT Blackbox?A BERT model works like how most Deep Learning models for ImageNet work.First, we train the BERT model on a large corpus (Masked LM Task), and then we finetune the model for our own task which could be classification, Question Answering or NER, etc. by adding a few extra layers at the end.For example, we would train BERT first on a corpus like Wikipedia (Masked LM Task) and then Fine Tune the model on our own data to do a classification task like classifying reviews as negative or positive or neutral by adding a few extra layers. In practice, we just use the output from the [CLS] token for the classification task. So, the whole architecture for fine-tuning looks like this:We just use the [CLS] Token output for classification along with some added Linear and Softmax Layers.In other similarly published articles on transformers, all Deep Learning is just Matrix Multiplication, where we just introduce a new W layer having a shape of (H x num_classes = 768 x 3) and train the whole architecture using our training data and Cross-Entropy loss on the classification.We could have also acquired the sentence features through the last layer and then just run a Logistic regression classifier on top or take an average of all the outputs and then run a logistic regression on top. There are many possibilities, and what works best will depend on the data for the task.In the above example, we explained how you could do Classification using BERT. In pretty much similar ways, one can also use BERT for Question Answering and NER based Tasks. We will get to the architectures used for various tasks in a few sections below.Trending AI Articles:1. Why Corporate AI projects fail?2. How AI Will Power the Next Wave of Healthcare Innovation?3. Machine Learning by Using Regression Model4. Top Data Science Platforms in 2021 Other than KaggleHow is this Different Than Embedding?This is a great question. Essentially, BERT just provides us with contextual-bidirectional embeddings.Let’s unpack what that means:Contextual: The embeddings of a word are not static. That is, they depend on the context of words around it. So in a sentence like “one bird was flying below another bird”, the two embeddings of the word “bird” will be different.Bi-Directional: While directional models in the past like LSTM’s read the text input sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left), the Transformer actually reads the entire sequence of words at once and thus is considered bidirectional.So, for a sentence like “BERT model is awesome.” the embeddings for the word “model” will have context from all the words “BERT”, “Awesome”, and “is”.How Does It Work?Now that we understand the basics, we will divide this section into three major parts: Architecture, Inputs, and Training.1. ArchitectureThis is the most simple part to understand if you’re familiar with this post on Transformers. BERT is essentially just made up of stacked up encoder layers.In the paper, the authors have experimented with two models:BERT Base: Number of Layers L=12, Size of the hidden layer, H=768, and Self-attention heads, A=12 with Total Parameters=110MBERT Large: Number of Layers L=24, Size of the hidden layer, H=1024, and Self-attention heads, A=16 with Total Parameters=340M2. Training InputsInputs to BERT. SourceWe give inputs to BERT using the above structure. The input consists of a pair of sentences, called sequences, and two special tokens: [CLS] and [SEP].So, in this example, for two sentences “my dog is cute” and “he likes playing”, BERT first uses wordpiece tokenization to convert the sequence into tokens and adds the [CLS] token in the start and the [SEP] token in the beginning and end of the second sentence, so the input is:The wordpiece tokenization used in BERT necessarily breaks words like playing into “play” and “##ing”. This helps in two ways:It helps limit the size of Vocabulary as we don’t have to keep the various forms of words like playing, plays, player etc. in our vocabulary.It helps us with out-of-vocab words. For example, if plays don’t occur in the vocabulary, we might still have embeddings for play and ##sToken Embeddings: We then get the Token embeddings by indexing a Matrix of size 30000x768(H). Here, 30000 is the Vocab length after wordpiece tokenization. The weights of this matrix would be learned while training.Token Embeddings come by indexing a matrix of size VocabxH.Segment Embeddings: For tasks such as question answering, we should specify which segment this sentence is from. These are either all 0 vectors of H length if the embedding is from sentence 1, or a vector of 1’s if the embedding is from sentence 2.Segment embedding are all 0’s or all 1’s vector specifying 1st Sentence or 2nd Sentence.Position Embeddings: These are the embeddings used to specify the position of words in the sequence, the same as we did in the transformer architecture. So we essentially have a constant matrix with some preset pattern. This matrix has the number of columns as 768. The first row of this matrix is the embedding for token [CLS], the second row is embedding for the word “my”, the third row is embedding for the word “dog” and so on.Patterns are used to specify word position.So the Final Input given to BERT is Token Embeddings + Segment Embeddings + Position Embeddings.3. Training Masked LM:We finally reach the most interesting part of BERT here, as this is where most of the novel concepts are introduced. We will try to explain these concepts by going through various architecture attempts and finding faults with each of them to arrive at the final BERT architecture.Attempt 1: So, for example, if we set up BERT training as below:Attempt 1: Predict all words.We try to predict each word of the input sequence using our training data with Cross-Entropy loss.Can you guess a potential problem with this approach?The problem is that the learning task is trivial.The network knows beforehand what it has to predict, and it can thus easily learn weights to reach a 100% classification accuracy.Attempt 2: Masked LM: This starts the beginning of the paper’s approach to overcoming the previous approach’s problem. We mask 15% random words in each training input sequence and just predict output for those words. In Pictorial terms:Attempt 2: Predict only masked words.Thus the loss gets calculated only over masked words. So now the model learns to predict words it hasn’t seen while seeing all the context around those words.Please note, we have masked 3 words here even when we should mask just 1 word as 15% of 8 is 1 to explain in this toy example.Can you find the problem with this approach?This model has essentially learned that it should predict good probabilities for only the [MASK] token. That is at the prediction time or at the fine-tuning time when this model will not get [MASK] as input; the model won’t predict good contextual embeddings.Attempt 3: Masked LM with random Words:In this attempt, we will still mask 15% of the positions. But we will replace any word in 20% of those masked tokens by some random word. We do this because we want to let the model know that we still want some output when the word is not a [MASK] token. So if we have a sequence of length 500, we will mask 75 tokens(15% of 500), and in those 75 tokens, 15 tokens(20 % of 75) would be replaced by random words. Pictorially, here we replace some of the masks by random words.Attempt 3: Predict masked words and Random Words.Advantage: The network will still work with any word now.Problem: The network has learned that Input Word is never equal to the Output word. That is the output vector at the position of “random word” would never be “random word.”Attempt 4: Masked LM with Random Words and Unmasked WordsTo solve this problem, the authors suggest the below training setup.The training data generator chooses 15% of the token positions at random for prediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace the i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of the time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3) the unchanged i-th token 10% of the timeSo if we have a sequence of length 500, we will mask 75 tokens(15% of 500), and in those 75 tokens, 7 tokens(10 % of 75) would be replaced by random words, and 7 tokens (10% of 75) will be used as it is. Pictorially, we replace some of the masks with random words and replace some of the masks by actual words.Attempt 4: Predict masked words, Random Words and Unmasked Words.So, now we have the best setup where our model doesn’t learn any unsavory patterns.But what if we keep only Mask + Unmask Setup? The model will learn that whenever the word is present, just predict that word.4. Training Additional NSP TaskFrom the BERT paper:Many important downstream tasks such as Question Answering (QA) and Natural Language Inference (NLI) are based on understanding the relationship between two sentences, which is not directly captured by language modeling. In order to train a model that understands sentence relationships, we pre-train for a binarized next sentence prediction task that can be trivially generated from any monolingual corpus.So, now we understand the Masked LM task, BERT Model also has one more training task which goes in parallel while Training Masked LM task. This task is called Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). So while creating the training data, we choose the sentences A and B for each training example such that 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A (labelled as IsNext), and 50% of the time it is a random sentence from the corpus (labelled as NotNext). We then use the CLS token output to get the binary loss which is also back propagated through the network to learn the weights.Training BERT with NSP taskSo we have got the BERT model now that can provide us with contextual embeddings. How can we use it for various tasks?Fine Tuning for Relevant TaskWe already have seen how we can use BERT for the classification task by adding a few layers on top of the [CLS] output and fine tuning the weights.BERT Finetuning for ClassificationHere is how we can use BERT for other tasks, from the paper:Source: BERT PaperLet’s go through each of them one by one.Sentence Pair Classification tasks — This is pretty similar to the classification task. That is add a Linear + Softmax layer on top of the 768 sized CLS output.Single Sentence Classification Task — Same as aboveSingle Sentence Tagging Task — This is pretty similar to the setup we use while training BERT, just that we need to predict some tags for each token rather than the word itself. For example, for a POS Tagging task like predicting Noun, Verb, or Adjective, we will just add a Linear layer of size (768 x n_outputs) and add a softmax layer on top to predict.Question Answering Tasks — This is the most interesting task and would need some more context to understand how BERT is used to solve it. In this task, we are given a question and a paragraph in which the answer lies. The objective is to determine the start and end span for the answer in the paragraph.BERT Finetuning for Question-Answer TaskSo in the above example, we define two vectors S and E (which will be learned during fine-tuning) both having shapes(1x768). We then take a dot product of these vectors with the second sentence’s output vectors from BERT, giving us some scores. We then apply Softmax over these scores to get probabilities. The training objective is the sum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and end positions. Mathematically, for the Probability vector for Start positions:where T_weis the word we are focusing on. An analogous formula is for End positions.To predict a span, we get all the scores — S.T and E.T and get the best span as the span having the maximum Score, that is max(S.T_we+ E.T_j) among all j≥i.Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/0*5TNlPPk4X4DKKCqw.jpg'],https://becominghuman.ai/bert-transformers-how-do-they-work-cd44e8e31359,https://becominghuman.ai/bert-transformers-how-do-they-work-cd44e8e31359,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'James Montantes', 'url': 'https://james-montantes-exxact.medium.com'}",2022-01-07T02:37:57.194Z,2021-04-12T14:22:34.757Z,BERT Transformers — How Do They Work? - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",,,,,,,BERT Transformers — How Do They Work? - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,,,,,,,,,2021-04-12T14:22:34.757Z,cd44e8e31359,['James Montantes'],,,,,,,,,

Software for artificial intelligence 



Machine learning, neural networks and artificial intelligence have become dominant themes in the development of applications, bots, programs, and services. 
Regardless of whether you are a simple developer, a startup, or already a large company, you need the right tools to get the job done. That is why, Gartner predicted that 80% of emerging technologies will have AI foundations by 2021.
In addition, as a result of its popularity, the developer community itself has grown, which also led to the emergence of AI frameworks, making it much easier to study artificial intelligence!
Artificial intelligence (AI) is slowly becoming more mainstream, as companies amass large amounts of data and look for the right technologies to analyze and leverage it.
Large and small retailers can use data science to predict goods demand during a certain period of time and place or analyze sentiments about a company, product, and service, or brand.


So you may find it useful to visit this website and learn more about data science frameworks that can help you launch any data science project.
In this post, we’ll talk about the best software that can help you develop and learn about artificial intelligence.
TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open source, comprehensive machine learning platform. Like most deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow has a Python API on top of the C and C ++ engine, making it faster.
TensorFlow has a flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources. This allows researchers to use the most advanced ML technologies, and developers to create and deploy applications based on machine learning.
The platform provides intuitive high-level APIs like Keras with fast execution, allowing immediate model iteration and easy debugging.
Due to its multi-platform nature, the solution allows you to train and deploy models in the cloud and locally, regardless of the language used by the user.
PyTorch
PyTorch is an open source Python machine learning framework that provides GPU-accelerated tensor computing. The framework is suitable for rapid prototyping in research, as well as for hobbyists and small projects.
The framework offers dynamic computation graphs that allow you to handle variable length input and output, which is useful, for example, when working with recurrent neural networks.
By deeply integrating the framework with C ++ code, developers can program in C and C ++ using the FFI-based Python API Extension.
Unlike TensorFlow, PyTorch is less flexible in supporting multiple platforms. It also lacks native data visualization tools, but has a third-party counterpart called tensorboardX.
Keras
Keras is an open source deep learning framework written in Python. The framework is aimed at operational work with neural networks and is compact, modular and extensible.
Suitable for small projects, since it is difficult to create something large-scale on it and it will obviously lose in the performance of neural networks to the same TensorFlow.
Keras works on top of TensorFlow, CNTK and Theano and provides an intuitive API that our engineers believe is the best of its kind so far.
The framework contains numerous implementations of widely used building blocks of neural networks, such as layers, target and transfer functions, optimizers, as well as many tools to simplify the work with images and text.
Darknet
Darknet is an open source framework written in C using the CUDA hardware / software parallel computing architecture. It’s fast, lightweight and easy to use. Darknet also supports CPU and GPU computing.
The Darknet stores the trained weights in a format that can be recognized using different methods on different platforms. However, this can be a problem if you decide to train a model on one heavy duty equipment and then use it on another.
Since the framework is written in C and has no other API, then in the case when the platform requirements or your own preferences force you to turn to another programming language, you will have to additionally fuss over its integration.
In addition, it is only distributed in source format, and the compilation process on some platforms can be somewhat problematic.
Caffe
Caffe is a deep learning framework. It is made with the expectation of expressiveness, speed and modularity. Initially, the framework was created for machine vision projects, but has since evolved and is now used for other tasks, including speech recognition and working with multimedia.
The main advantage of Caffe is speed. The framework is entirely written in C ++, supports CUDA, and, if necessary, can switch the processing flow between the processor and the video card. The package includes a set of free and open source reference models for standard classification tasks.
Caffe2, the second iteration of Facebook’s Caffe framework, originally designed for machine vision, now includes other uses such as speech and multimedia. The main features of Caffe2 are speed and modularity, so the framework is written primarily in C ++.
Microsoft Azure ML Studio
Given the massive amount of data and processing power required for machine learning, clouds are an ideal environment for ML applications. Azure ML Studio allows you to create and train models, turn them into APIs to provide other services.
One user account can be allocated up to 10 GB of storage space, although you can connect your own Azure storage. A wide variety of algorithms are available, both created by Microsoft and third parties.
To try the service, you don’t even need to create an account, you just need to sign in anonymously, and you can run Azure ML Studio for eight hours.
Microsoft Azure ML Studio allows users to create and train models, turn them into APIs and use them in other services. The free version has 10 GB of storage for training data.
The service includes many training algorithms from both Microsoft and third-party companies.
AI means integrating more data sources and using that data to improve the prioritization, personalization and content of marketing campaigns using machine learning algorithms.
An effective AI will eventually become an integral part of a successful and profitable business.

This initiative by the Mumbai-headquartered Sapio Analytics, a data management company, for the restoration and preservation of Ajanta paintings with the help of modern technology is in tandem with efforts that have been in the process all around the globe.

The digitized form of these paintings, the Ajanta Caves in India's Aurangabad district, are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They are being preserved on an island called Svalbard, in Norway, as part of a project called Arctic World Archive.

Along with the Ajanta paintings, digital artifacts from around the world such as manuscripts from the Vatican library, political histories, masterpieces from different eras, scientific breakthroughs and contemporary culture treasures, are also being preserved.




Ajanta paintings are being preserved with the help of modern technology


If one was to delve a little deeper into the process of this initiative of digitization by Sapio Analytics, which also has its operations in the UK and Silicon Valley, they have used a dataset of reference work to develop the AI mannequin, called Ancient AI.

Balkrishna Choolun, Indian-origin co-founder of Ajantahc and chairman of UITV, based in London said, ""We believe that this is India's century, and our cultural history should be available to the world.""

He added, ""Both Sapio Analytics and UITV have joined forces to digitize, restore and preserve for eternity ancient Indian heritage associated with the culture, artworks, and artifacts of India and other Asian countries.""

""Furthermore, we are also going to promote contemporary Indian artists' works to our global audience,"" Choolun said.

Experts from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee who have been selected for this project, have developed this AI which uses a deep-learning technique to restore the damaged murals of the Ajanta Caves.

The experts believe that digital restoration does not alter the original artwork, and at the helm of this work are artwork historians who are well versed in the field so that the restoration aligns with the original work on the masterpieces.

Not just that, the team working on the restoration efforts also includes photographers, artists, and culture experts, including new-age technology experts.

How does this restoration work?

A damaged area of a mural, for instance, is restored by altering the pixels of the damaged elements through mathematical inference of the neighbouring undamaged part. High-end pixel-level scanning of documented photographs of the original artwork helps in the digitization process. This, therefore, is a combination of manual digital restoration and artificially intelligent trained restoration.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

SRU students gain valuable programming experience working with humanoid robot

April 14, 2021
SLIPPERY ROCK, Pa. — Computer science students at Slippery Rock University are now adding Pepper to their resumes. But we're not talking about the condiment they would put on their food. Rather, they are becoming ""seasoned"" programmers by working with Pepper, which is the name of a semi-humanoid, emotional robot manufactured by SoftBank Robotics.
SRU's College of Health, Engineering and Science acquired Pepper for use in the Computer Science Department's Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
""It's incredibly rare for a school like ours to have this type of robot,"" said Sam Thangiah, professor of computer science and department chair. ""Our students are very fortunate to get hands-on programming experience with an emotional robot like this. Working in this lab on this project is going to provide them with an important edge when they are looking for jobs or applying to graduate schools.""
Standing 4 feet tall and weighing 60 pounds, Pepper has human qualities such as a head with two eyes, a torso and two arms and hands with fingers. It's equipped with high-definition cameras, sonars, gyroscopes and others sensors that allow it to interact with humans and collect data by mapping its surroundings as it moves around on its wheeled base. Pepper communicates by voice and a 10-inch touchscreen display on its chest.
""Especially since (the COVID-19 pandemic), these robots continue to be more prevalent,"" Thangiah said. ""They are sanitizing warehouses and interacting with people in places like airports, telling people which gate number they should go to and other tasks. It can autonomously take over an entire job because it can understand speech.""
Students from Thangiah's Artificial Intelligence class this semester are programming Pepper to greet people on the second-floor hallway of SRU's Advanced Technology and Science Hall. For example, a visitor could ask to be directed to Thangiah's office or the Robotics/IA lab.
""It is definitely a unique experience to do this type of higher-level programming and troubleshooting,"" said Wayne Bloom, a senior computing major from Everett. ""There's a lot of self-learning and pushing through frustrations that goes into something that is fairly new technology. And it's cool to work with a piece of equipment that's able to talk back to you.""


   THANGIAH

For most of the students in the 400-level AI class, their time in the lab is the only in-person class activity they'll have all semester, with 80% of SRU's classes conducted online this semester because of COVID-19. Bloom, along with Christian Carr, a senior computing major from Pittsburgh, and Jeffrey McFarland, a senior computing major from New Castle, spend about four hours per week working together in the lab programming Pepper and using operating software called Choregraphe. Their IA class is conducted online.
""I can teach them things online, but to actually implement it on a real-life device takes a lot of dedication,"" Thangiah said. ""That is what employers are looking for, to know that they can give someone a project and that they can stick with it, see it through and deliver. (Our students) are learning skills like persistence and tenacity that they don't even realize.""
Carr was recently hired for a full-time, summer internship as an application developer for Highmark in Pittsburgh. He said his interviewers were particularly interested in his work with Pepper. Bloom and McFarland are also interested in software engineering positions.
In future semesters, more students will be able to work with Pepper in other classes and outside of class through a Robotics Group organized within the department. The Robotics/IA Laboratory at SRU already has several robot kits and 11 smaller, two-legged humanoid robots, called NAO, which were also developed by SoftBank Robotics.
""But something like (Pepper) is far more advanced,"" McFarland said. ""It's very exciting to be stepping into this world of AI and it's something I didn't expect when I signed up for this class.""
More information about computer science programs at SRU are available on the department's webpage.
