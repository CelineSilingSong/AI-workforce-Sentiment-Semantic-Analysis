It involves the use of computers to reproduce or undertake such actions, often at a higher speed and accuracy than previously achieved.

AI typically combines computer science with data to solve problems or make predictions. Its processes involve algorithms, which are a series of rules written into computer code.

Historically, AI has been used to carry out complex mathematical tasks, or to play strategy games such as chess, often beating human competitors. In general, the more specific the application, the more effective an AI can be. But it has limitations, including bias in outcomes, a high cost of computing power, and a lack of transparency over why a system makes a particular decision.

Machine learning (ML) is an application of AI whereby computer programs can automatically learn from, and adapt to, new information without being specifically programmed to do so. Algorithms can detect patterns in the past data that a computer is trained on and make predictions or recommendations without explicit instructions from humans. ML programs improve over time with training, learning from past experiences or mistakes, as well as spotting patterns in new data.

Deep learning (DL) is a subset of ML that solves complex problems, such as speech recognition or image classification. It encourages the AI to learn through high volumes of unstructured data in various mediums including text, images and video. DL models run on software called neural networks, modelled on the human brain.

The main difference between ML and DL is that ML requires human input to understand the data and learn from it. DL can ingest unstructured data in a raw form and distinguish the difference between different categories of data.

Deep learning uses neural networks, which are systems for processing data inspired by the way neurons interact in the human brain. Information goes into the system, the neurons communicate to understand it, and the system creates an output.

For example, an AI could recognise a turnip by identifying multiple turnips in its data. It will then be able to spot any new turnips it encounters. If it comes across a carrot for the first time, it might mistakenly think it is a turnip at first. But, the more carrots it sees, the better it will be able to discern a difference. Humans can help an AI’s judgment by marking output as correct or incorrect — for example, by labelling images of any new vegetables input to the AI.

Generative AI takes vast amounts of raw data — for example, the entire works of Shakespeare — and learns the patterns within it, in order to generate the most likely correct response when prompted with a question. For example, if you asked it to write a Shakespearean sonnet, the AI would use its learning to generate the most likely sequence of words, with the correct number of lines and rhyming pattern. It would create a version similar to, but not a direct replica of, his poems.

Generative models have been used on numerical data for a number of years. But, as deep learning and natural language processing have become more advanced, generative AI has been applied to images, audio and text.

The term became widely known after the Microsoft-backed company OpenAI released its chatbot ChatGPT in November, which can produce humanlike paragraphs of text. GPT-4, the AI model behind the technology, has been trained on millions of text sources, including websites, newspapers and books.

Generative AI marks a turning point in natural language processing — the ability for computers to process and generate text and other language-based mediums, including software code, images and scientific structures.

Early examples include GPT-4, Google’s PaLM, which is used in its chatbot Bard, as well as image-generation AI, such as DALL-E 2 and Midjourney.

This focus on Generative AI is causing a shift towards AI systems trained on large, unlabeled data sets, which can be fine-tuned for different purposes, rather than AI systems that execute specific tasks in a single area.

Reducing the need to label the data makes the AI more accessible, as consumers or companies can deploy it in different circumstances.

Generative AI tends to rely on large language models (LLMs), a type of AI system that works with languages and uses neural networks. LLMs are the current, cutting-edge way of laying out neural networks from research.

They are called “large” language models as they hold vast amounts of data. LLMs today can have millions or billions more data sets than those trained just a few years ago, due mainly to the increasing computational capacity.

GPT-4, PaLM and Meta’s LLaMa are all examples of LLMs. Adding language models to Google’s search engine, for example, was what the company called “the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of search”.

Although the potential for LLMs is huge, so are the resources needed to design, train and deploy the models. All require vast amounts of data, energy to power the computers, and engineering talent.

AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence — an AI that is capable of the same level of intelligence as humans, or an even higher level.

So far, AI has been able to outperform humans in standardised tests but still stumbles with common knowledge, having so-called “hallucinations” where it states falsehoods as facts. Examples of these hallucinations include creating fake book citations or answering “elephant”, when asked which mammal lays the largest eggs.However, Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “Godfather of AI,” has said that AGI could be here in as little as five years. He and others have warned about the risks that such a level of AI could pose to society and humankind.

One in 12 (8 per cent) of UK adults, or around one million people, have used generative AI for work, according to a new report.Despite this, Deloitte’s 2023 Digital Consumer Trends report revealed that only 23 per cent of the one million believe their employer would approve.Generative AI is a type of system capable of generating text and images in response to prompts.The survey of 4,150 UK adults aged 16-75 also found that half (52 per cent) of individuals in the UK had heard of generative AI and a quarter (26 per cent) had used it. Kate Palmer, who works in HR advice and consultancy at Peninsula, said the fast rate of development and widespread use of AI made the results “hardly surprising” and advised disapproving employers to adopt specific policies. “It's recommended to implement a specific AI policy that clearly lays out a company’s stance on utilising this technology within the workplace to eliminate any uncertainty,” she said. Palmer also warned that being reliant on AI-generated content could “lead to copyright infringement [and] potential issues with accuracy”, adding that inputting sensitive data could  “drastically increase vulnerability to cyber attacks or phishing attempts”.Similarly, Sarah Hamilton-Gill, mentor and managing director of Globus HR Consulting, said  there were “very few” companies that had addressed the “boundaries and issues” surrounding AI. She also encouraged organisations to consider the following critical areas as a minimum when contemplating the usage of AI:
Establishing clear usage guidelines for employees. Make sure they understand what ChatGPT can be used for and what it should not be used for.Providing adequate training for employees to understand the full capabilities of the AI model and how to use it appropriately.Maintaining policies that respect privacy rights, especially if the AI is used to interact with sensitive information. Transparency, making it clear when a user is communicating with AI. Being aware that the AI might not fully understand or interpret complex legal language, which could lead to incorrect outcomes. Returning to the survey, 30 per cent of those who had tried a generative AI tool said they had used it once or twice, while 28 per cent of respondents said they used it frequently. One in 10 (9 per cent) indicated they used an AI tool daily or more often. Gemma Bullivant, HR consultant and coach, said the statistic did not surprise her because many people were interested in AI and what it could achieve, and many were experimenting with it with mixed results.She said she wanted to see more training around this to help HR consultants and coaches to handle it properly. The training should also help them to understand generative AI and how it could be used and misused, and enable them to use it ""wisely and productively” instead of fearing it. “Without this understanding, policies will be difficult to get right and could be counterproductive,” she said. The survey also found that 64 per cent of those who had heard of generative AI felt there would be fewer jobs available overall in the future, while half (48 per cent) believed some of their job duties would be replaced.The news comes as Hollywood’s actors and writers have both gone on strike for the first time since 1960. They are protesting against a number of studios' decisions, including how generative artificial intelligence tools could replace their roles in the industry. Additionally, exclusive data analysis by People Management recently revealed that HR professionals were curious about integrating AI solutions into their day-to-day workflow. According to the report, one third (33 per cent) of 1,000 respondents to a LinkedIn poll claimed they had not yet used ChatGPT but would like to.Read the CIPD's guide to preparing your organisation for AI use and catch up on the CIPD webinar which explores the ethical considerations around AI

Each week, Pharmaceutical Technology’s journalists explore movements in job postings that shed light on hiring trends in our sector. These job signals provide insights into where the leading companies are focusing their recruitment efforts, and why. We reveal the skills that are in high demand in the sector, and the themes driving current hiring patterns.

The number of job postings related to generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the pharma sector has increased by 407% over the last three months. This dramatic rise is particularly notable given a general downturn of 7% in postings across the pharmaceutical industry over the same period. 
Although the increase is an outlier due to the low number of jobs in previous months – the number of postings identified by GlobalData still sits below 100 – it is indicative of a desire to harness the technology’s potential. A GlobalData report suggests that generative AI trained on big data can cut the length of an initial exploratory phase in drug design by three or four years, significantly reducing the cost of drug development in terms of both time and money.  

It's not just traditional pharmaceuticals players interested in this technology. It was announced earlier this month that Nvidia, the tech company predominantly known for its role as a graphics card manufacturer, has invested $50m (£38.19m) in the 10-year old biopharmaceutical generative AI startup Recursion as part of its pivot towards AI.  See Also:BMS gains EMA validation for Opdivo/Yervoy combo in liver cancer Rona Therapeutics gains Series A+ funds for siRNA pipeline expansion 
A number of other young companies have been hiring within the sector, including AbSci Corp and Precision for Medicine Inc., suggesting that the future of the industry may be shaped as much by technology as traditional practices.

News about artificial intelligence (AI) is hard to tune out these days. The technology is in explosion mode at the moment, and we are witnessing its application and entry into countless fields. Yet there’s a long road ahead in this narrative, especially when it comes to the implications AI is unleashing upon industries, and in some cases upon careers. Many workers have concerns about being replaced by AI, and there are certainly some job types that may be vulnerable to its powerful capabilities. The advancement of artificial intelligence has the potential to impact various job roles across different industries, but the widespread fears about jobs being replaced by AI may be somewhat unfounded.


Some Jobs Are Vulnerable to AI Displacement
The question for many is what jobs are potentially on the hook. It’s a complicated one to ask, because there are varying degrees of how much AI can step in as a human replacement. AI can take the load of performing repetitive, routine tasks, and even handle some of the outcome of its analysis. While the exact extent of displacement can vary, here are some job categories that may experience changes or potential displacement due to AI:




Routine and Repetitive Tasks: Jobs that involve repetitive tasks such as data entry, assembly line work, or basic customer service interactions can be automated with AI systems, leading to a decrease in demand for human workers in these roles.
Transportation and Delivery: The rise of autonomous vehicles and drones has the potential to impact jobs in transportation and delivery services, including truck drivers, taxi drivers, and couriers.
Customer Support: Chatbots and virtual assistants are increasingly being used for customer support, reducing the need for a large number of human customer service representatives. While AI can handle basic inquiries, human support may still be required for more complex or empathetic situations.
Data Analysis and Research: AI-powered algorithms and machine learning systems can quickly process and analyze large volumes of data, potentially impacting jobs in data analysis and research. However, human expertise will still be necessary for higher-level analysis and business decision-making.
Manufacturing and Warehouse Operations: Automation using AI and robotics can streamline manufacturing processes and warehouse operations, leading to a reduced demand for manual labor in these fields.
Financial Services: AI algorithms are being employed for tasks like automated trading, fraud detection, and risk assessment, potentially affecting jobs in financial analysis, auditing, and certain aspects of banking.
Healthcare Diagnostics: AI has shown promise in medical imaging analysis and diagnostics. Because it can assist healthcare professionals in interpreting results, it may impact jobs in radiology and pathology.



PROMOTED
The list continues and can be expanded by imagining the kind of positions that could be tedious, repetitive, and ultimately costly to the organization as candidates for AI solutions and displacement.
It is important to note that while AI may automate certain tasks, it also has the potential to create new job opportunities and transform existing roles. Many industries are adopting AI to augment human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. As technology advances, it is crucial for individuals to adapt and acquire skills that complement AI systems to remain relevant in the evolving job market.

Where AI is Already Getting to “Work”
The application of AI technology extends beyond traditional domains, with various industries harnessing its capabilities to drive innovation and improve processes. One fascinating example comes from the beauty industry, where AI algorithms are revolutionizing eyelash extensions. As highlighted by The Washington Post, computer vision and machine learning algorithms are being used to analyze facial features to recommend customized eyelash styles based on factors such as eye shape, lash length, and desired outcome. This integration of AI empowers beauty professionals with invaluable insights and personalized recommendations, elevating the overall customer experience.

In healthcare, AI-powered systems are revolutionizing medical image analysis, diagnosis, and treatment planning, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient patient care. By leveraging AI algorithms healthcare professionals can achieve higher precision and streamline decision-making processes, ensuring improved outcomes for patients.
AI's impact is being felt in the manufacturing sector as well. Manufacturers are increasingly relying on AI to optimize production processes, minimize downtime, and enhance quality control. By harnessing AI technologies, businesses can unlock new levels of efficiency, productivity, and operational excellence.
These examples highlight the diverse ways in which AI is already making a tangible impact across industries. As organizations continue to embrace and explore the potential of AI, we can anticipate even greater advancements that will transform how we live, work, and interact with technology.
Empowerment Through AI
These emerging use cases teach us a valuable lesson: the integration of AI into the workforce won't involve an HR person tapping you on the shoulder and replacing your job with an AI. Instead, these examples demonstrate how AI is being introduced to enhance efficiency across various aspects of our work. The ultimate value of AI lies in its ability to augment human capabilities, recognizing that humans are indispensable contributors to productivity and the resources businesses rely on. Rather than displacing human workers, AI empowers them to perform their jobs more effectively, allowing for the optimization of processes and the realization of greater outcomes. AI simply acts as a catalyst for improved job performance.
The evolution and integration of AI into industries and economies are ongoing processes that require careful consideration and foresight. When applied intelligently, AI holds transformative possibility that can maximize human potential within the workforce. By leveraging AI as a tool for empowerment, businesses can unlock new levels of productivity and innovation. This approach serves as the foundation for a future where AI and human collaboration together drive prosperity and technological advancement. Embracing the symbiotic relationship between AI and human intelligence is key to cultivating a prosperous future where both can thrive.
Risking it All on Artificial Intelligence
Hopefully, thought leaders envision and encourage AI in a way that prioritizes collaboration rather than focusing on replacing humans. As we navigate these new waters, it’s imperative to consider the risks associated with driving a narrative solely centered on replacing human workers. This approach carries ethical concerns, potential drops in productivity, reputational damage, and exposure to the unknown. Any industry that rapidly displaces a critical component of their workforce is likely to encounter significant challenges, regardless of the possibilities.
It's undeniable that artificial intelligence presents a remarkable opportunity for transformation and innovation across industries. While it is important to address concerns about job displacement and establish robust AI regulations, a balanced perspective is crucial. By identifying vulnerable sectors, harnessing the streamlining potential of AI, advocating for responsible regulations, addressing ethical considerations, and fostering ongoing collaboration, we can navigate the path of generative AI. Through thoughtful, informed decision-making, we can ensure its positive impact on our society, workforce, and economic landscape.
By striking a balance between innovation and human well-being, we can steer the course of AI towards a future that maximizes benefits and minimizes risks. We can leverage the capabilities of AI while upholding our ethical responsibilities.

The job cuts were said to be primarily within functions including marketing, site security, enterprise engineering, programme management, content strategy, and corporate communications rather than engineering roles. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly stated that the staff rationalisation is a bid to restructure the business towards a more optimal ratio of engineers to non-engineering roles.

Although there is a huge amount of interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the consumer world, particularly since the release of OpenAI’s free ChatGPT program last November, in the hallowed halls of academia the response has been more wary. Concerns abound about academic integrity. There are also worries about how AI-generated content can be biased, inaccurate, and sometimes contain entirely false information, dubbed “hallucinations.”  The cautious response is to be expected according to Houman Harouni, lecturer on education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and a former elementary and high school teacher. He has compassion for educators trying to grapple with a rapidly shifting world shaped by machine learning.“Technology creates a shock,” he explains. “This shock is sometimes of a magnitude that we cannot even understand it, in the same way that we still haven't absorbed the sharp shock of the mobile phone.”Harouni has long wrestled with the impact of cutting-edge technology on education, including experimenting in his own classroom, and is convinced that when it comes to teaching  “the medium is part of the message.” He believes that getting school students and those in higher ed to engage with virtual worlds is essential. “Where we want to get to is a place where you’re dancing with it, dancing with robots,” he says.If the idea of waltzing with a robot creates apprehension for educators, Harouni has some advice :1) Stop pretending that it doesn’t existEducators must “help the next generation face the reality of the world and develop instruments and ways of navigating this reality with integrity,” Harouni says. Students are well aware that technologies such as ChatGPT exist and are already experimenting with them on their own, but they need guidance about how to use them responsibly.Teacher education and professional development programs should not ignore generative artificial intelligence either. 2) Use AI alongside your studentsEngage with generative AI tools with your students in person, when possible. Otherwise, share AI-generated responses to questions during class time and ask students to consider them or have students experiment with the technology at home, document their experiences, and share them with the class. 3) Teach students how to ask the ChatGPT tool questions “The educator's job is to understand what opportunities are left open beside the technology,” Harouni says. Teach students to do what artificial intelligence cannot do. For example, unlike robots, we can ask ourselves questions and that is what students need to be trained in: to know how to ask questions and to learn how to critique their own questions, frameworks, and the answers generated by AI, he says. Students can start with topics and questions that they are interested in and ask ChatGPT for answers, he suggests. The knack is then getting them excited about asking follow-up questions. Harouni uses a personal experience with his 10-year-old stepdaughter and his newborn baby to illustrate his point. When his stepdaughter asked him why he kept telling her to be careful with the baby, Harouni turned to ChatGPT to help her to get to the bottom of her question. “My creativity as the teacher or the parent at that moment is to say, ‘What is it that you're really trying to ask? What is it that you really want to know?’”While ChatGPT churned out a “whole bunch of answers about the fragility of the baby,” with some patience, Harouni helped his stepdaughter discover the question that she truly wanted to ask which was what she could safely do with the new baby. “At the moment that the exploration [with AI] ends with the answer, you know that your work as a teacher begins,” he explains.4) Use generative AI tools to spark the imagination One frequent concern about generative artificial intelligence is that students will use it to cheat and avoid the hard work of thinking for themselves, but Harouni says that tools like ChatGPT should really challenge teachers and professors to reassess the assignments they give their students. “You have to stop thinking that you can teach exactly the way you used to teach when the basic medium has changed,” he explains. If students can turn to ChatGPT or other AI language models for quick and easy answers then there is a problem with the lesson, Harouni believes.“We have to create assignments that push [students] to the point where they have to question what is the framework that is being used here and what would it mean for me to radically change this framework,” he says.Harouni recently wrote about how he used ChatGPT to spur higher-level thinking among his students at HGSE when he presented them with a challenging case study that had no easy solutions. The students’ initial responses were no better than the chatbot’s ideas. Instead “it was after ChatGPT reflected to the students their failure of imagination that they could begin to think of options that they, or any automatic language scrawler, would not have readily reached for,” he explained in a co-authored article for Wired.

Most likely, they say, employees will work in concert with machines, and workers’ roles may become more sophisticated as AI eliminates repetitive and manual tasks. Ideally, employees will instead spend their time focusing on the uniquely human tasks that AI isn’t currently positioned to usurp – i.e. creative approaches to problem solving, interpersonal communication – and be able to generate more, better output.If workers transition into more intellectually demanding roles, or see their productivity spike when they harness AI’s benefits, it’s tempting to believe wages will evolve in parallel. After all, if job descriptions are changing, and workers are contributing more, compensation should theoretically follow. However, experts say the outlook may be more complicated for workers of all skill levels. Going up? Going down? As AI takes some of the mundane tasks out of workers’ days, particularly in knowledge-work roles, experts expect many jobs may become more sophisticated and creative. Productivity could spike, too, as workers transition time-consuming minutiae to machines. For some employees, this means their fundamental job descriptions are changing – and that they’re producing more output at a higher level. Although it’s possible some companies will raise pay as employees take on new tasks, some experts, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economics professor Daron Acemoglu, are dubious all workers will see pay rises as AI pushes them to do more, different work.Getty ImagesExperts say it's possible companies will accept automation that may not be quite as good as human labour, so they don't have to spend money on labourers (Credit: Getty Images)Tech DecodedFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter. The twice-weekly email decodes the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world. Sign up for free here.In a 2019 research paper with colleague Pascual Restrepo, Acemoglu wrote that we “should not expect automation to create wage increases commensurate with productivity growth”. One reason, he believes, is that financial gains realised from increased worker productivity are generally absorbed by the company, not passed onto the workers as better compensation.Harry J Holzer, economist and Georgetown University professor of public policy, and non-resident fellow at US think-tank The Brookings Institution, says this chimes with research that shows AI shifts compensation from the worker to the business. According to an economic study by the White House Council of Economic Advisors of automation in blue-collar jobs, Germany, France, Spain and The Netherlands saw revenue from productivity gains go to shareholders and not to the salaries of warehouse workers.For hourly and shift-based workers, often in low-skill industries, AI has the potential to limit earning potential. Experts say one concern is workers may end up working less, as some parts of their jobs become automated.Acemoglu beieves even though current automation technology may not match the quality of human work, companies will increasingly accept what he calls “so-so automation” in lieu of paying labourers – even if their wages are not substantial. He also warns this could become more of a problem as the technology gets increasingly advanced. And across all labour of all skill levels, increased worker monitoring may affect pay. Veena Dubal, professor of law at the University of California, Irvine, says many companies are already using AI to measure productivity, and subsequently determine wages.Even though current automation technology may not match the quality of human work, companies will increasingly accept “so-so automation” in lieu of paying labourers – even if their wages are not substantialHer research shows these evaluations lead to lower wages and inequality among worker earnings, which she calls “algorithmic wage discrimination – where individual workers make vastly different amounts based on an AI evaluation that the worker themselves doesn't understand”.  She believes if companies invest heavily in productivity-tracking technologies, the problem could get worse.There may be one group, however, that does stand to see their pay rise amid widespread AI integration.Workers at top ranks, says Mark Muro, a senior fellow and policy director for the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, may be more protected from wage fluctuation – especially if they facilitate and decide the processes by which AI is used in their workplaces. For instance, there may be “higher pay for some of those who are managing all of this [AI transformation] or doing the most sophisticated work supported by these tools”.Levelling the playing field? The conversation around AI and salary isn’t just a question of whether wages will rise, stagnate or fall, however. Some experts argue that the rise of workplace AI could help close the wage inequality gap between high- and low-skilled workers, across many demographic groups.David Autor, professor in economics at MIT, argues AI may be able to lower the barrier to entry for highly skilled positions by eliminating the need for a traditional, elite higher education usually required for a top role. With AI, a wide variety of workers can gain specialised expertise faster and more widely – in a sense, roles that were once gatekept may be increasingly less so.Getty ImagesAmong the workers concerned about reduced earning potential and fewer hours are entertainment writers, who are currently on strike (Credit: Getty Images)“AI could create a scenario that reduces the scarcity of high-level expertise,” says Autor. As more workers from a variety of backgrounds work with AI to quickly gain the high-level skills usually reserved for specialised experts with elite backgrounds, “it would open the door for non-traditional candidates, particular those without a four-year degree”. He continues: “If the demand for highly specialised knowledge remains elastic” – for instance, in industries such as engineering, medicine, computer science and law – “that would mean more jobs for non-traditional candidates who, assisted by AI, would be able work at a high level of expertise. It could level the playing field.”In this scenario, it’s possible the experts who were once scarce might see a dip in their wages as they see more competition in the labour market. However, it may be more likely that across industries, more workers – and a more diverse pool at that – would receive a higher salary than they might currently be making in lower skilled jobs that don’t require a college degree.Organisation and advocation Muro says this may be a challenging period for every worker, as the technology is still developing.MIT’s Acemoglu emphasises the outcomes for debates around worker pay and other AI-related workplace issues will largely depend on who is making the decisions about how the technology is developed and deployed, and what subsequent worker protections may follow.Workers may have a part to play, says Dubal. To help drive these decisions in a human-favourable direction, she suggests workplace organisation and policy advocation may help workers keep compensation stable and protect their earning potential. For instance, if workers can “sit at the table with their employers and regulators”, they can help companies understand the intrinsic value of human labour. She points to European workers advocating “for laws that limit the use of AI in certain contexts, like the AI act that's being developed”.For now, it’s not clear which type of labourers will find their pay most affected by AI – after all, some experts have said highly skilled workers are just as vulnerable to automation as their lower-skilled counterparts. But, says Muro, “nobody gets off scot-free here”.Additional reporting by Leah CarrollHow we workFeaturesArtificial intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Getty Images/fStoppart ofThe rise of artificial intelligence, explainedsee all  Rani Molla is a senior correspondent at Vox and has been focusing her reporting on the future of work. She has covered business and technology for more than a decade — often in charts — including at Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.If AI is coming for our jobs, many Americans are hoping to get out in front of it. Regular people are using AI at work, and tech workers are rebranding themselves as AI experts. And those in leadership are vying for the hottest new job title: head of AI. Outside of tech, the head of AI position was mostly nonexistent a few years ago, but now people are taking on that title — or at least its duties — at everywhere from Amazon to Visa to Coca-Cola. In the US, the number of people in AI leadership roles has grown threefold in the past five years, according to data from LinkedIn, bucking the downward trend in tech hiring overall. And while the head of AI job description varies widely by company, the hope is that those who end up with this new responsibility will do everything from incorporating AI into businesses’ products to getting employees up to speed on how to use AI in their jobs. Companies want the new role to keep them at the forefront of their industries amid AI disruption, or at least keep them from being left behind. “This is the biggest deal of the decade, and it’s ridiculously overhyped,” said Peter Krensky, a director and analyst at Gartner who specializes in AI talent management.

AI is one of the few areas where companies are actively spending money, since they see it as the inevitable future and as a way to improve their bottom line. At the same time, the parameters of the head of AI job — and even AI itself — aren’t very clear, and the pivot to the position can seem opportunistic. Remember Shingy, AOL’s Digital Prophet? The thing is that while everyone seems to agree that companies need AI stewards, the nature of new technology means many are uncertain as to what that stewardship means in practice. Furthermore, we’re not sure about who exactly should become the new stewards: the people who have been working on AI for years or those who have been introduced to AI by the latest crop of consumer products and understand how the rest of us use it. We’re also not certain just how big of a disruption AI will be and how fast that disruption will happen.Those are just some of the reasons companies are hiring heads of AI. And if they don’t already have a head of AI, most big companies will have one soon.“If I were talking to a CEO a year ago, and I was like, ‘You’d be a fool not to have a head of AI.’ They’d be like, ‘Come on, give me a break,’” said Krensky. “And now they’re like, ‘I know, that’s why I have one.’” Krensky estimates that currently about a quarter of Fortune 2000 companies have dedicated AI leadership at the VP level or above. He expects it to be about 80 percent a year from now. While the position will be more commonplace at bigger companies — especially those in banking, tech, and manufacturing — he’s also seeing it crop up at midsize organizations and in government agencies. Typically, the person taking what Kensky calls a “cool and sexy” job title — one that he says is often a “hat, not a role” — comes from an existing technology leadership position like chief data officer or chief information officer. But the accessible nature of generative AI tools and their potential use across industries and positions has meant that people in nontech roles like business and marketing are also donning the mantle.And because AI is supposed to be more transformational and more readily profitable than tech fads like Web3, experts think the head of AI is also going to stick.“This is going to be a role that will stay on for a while. It’s not a transitional role,” said Beena Ammanath, executive director of the Deloitte AI Institute. “It’s absolutely crucial.”Just what any given head of AI does varies, especially depending on the type of company. Generally, that breaks down into heads of AI at digital companies working to incorporate the technology into their products, while at nontech companies that means figuring out where and how to use existing AI technology to improve their business models, Ammanath said. Everyone, it seems, is trying to get the rest of their company to start using AI.Mike Haley, SVP of research at Autodesk, says he’s the company’s de facto head of AI, having guided the architecture and engineering software company’s AI strategy for more than a decade. In addition to steering AI usage within the company, Haley is invested in putting AI to use in Autodesk’s products in order to “dissolve the interface” between users and the software. That means AI could help people use “natural methods of expression” like English or a pencil drawing, for example, to create detailed blueprints. “Suddenly this complex tool that requires all sorts of learning and parameterization becomes way more accessible to more people,” explained Haley, who has a background in computer science and applied math. Bali D.R., head of AI and automation at IT services consulting firm Infosys, is helping clients leverage AI while also trying to use it to “amplify human potential” across Infosys, from recruitment to sales to software development.“All parts of the value chain, we are seeing how we can actually make it better, faster, cheaper,” says D.R., who moved to the AI role from another management role, and who started his career at the company 30 years ago in software development.FICO chief analytics officer Scott Zoldi has been leading the data analytics company’s AI efforts for the past seven years, although without the “buzzy” head of AI title. He’s mainly focused on incorporating AI into the company’s products, including using consumer spending patterns to help detect credit fraud or when a customer is falling for a scam. He also spends a lot of time thinking about how AI can be used responsibly so as not to run afoul of regulatory bodies, corporate governance, or consumers by, for example, using AI that’s more likely to flag a protected group of people for committing fraud.Zoldi, who says he’s written more than 100 AI patents, thinks the “head of AI” position should go to someone with a technology background. “You really have to be an expert or you’re potentially going to be setting up the organization for failures down the road because it’s very complicated,” Zoldi, who views the position as a sort of watchdog, like a chief of security. While Gartner’s Krensky estimates about 80 percent of AI leadership comes from a tech background, another 20 percent, of course, does not. That’s the case with Coca-Cola’s global head of generative AI, Pratik Thakar, who previously led the company’s global creative strategy.Thakar has been using AI to streamline and amplify the company’s advertising products. That included recently using AI to make roughly 15 percent of a commercial, which sliced the production time from a year down to two months. Conor Grennan, a dean at NYU’s Stern business school, who recently took on the additional title of head of generative AI, sees the title as more of an initiative and thinks of it as akin to a chief learning officer or chief productivity officer. In the position, he pushes people across NYU, from students to professors to administrators and recruiters, to use AI to become more efficient and better at their tasks.Grennan, who has an MBA and had previously studied English and politics, thinks it’s actually better for many organizations if their AI leadership doesn’t come from a tech background so that the person is better able to explain its benefits to a wider audience of mere mortals.“You don’t need to know the software running your iPhone, just order an Uber,” Grennan said. Instead, what’s important for the role, he says, is creativity with language and breadth.“They need to be an excellent communicator, they need to have a view of the entire firm, at least at the 30,000-foot view. And also it has to be somebody who really understands what generative AI can do,” Grennan said. “You don’t capture everything by putting it in the tech department.”Regardless of where the head of AI sits within an organization, the fact remains that it’s a new frontier that will likely change a lot as the technology and our understanding of it develop. And like with any new technology, there’s going to be a mix of genuine innovation and genuine swindling.AI is happening, and it will be a very big deal. But its full effects — and exactly what those are — will roll out over many years, so we may have time to figure things out.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

Like venture capitalists and enterprise startups—which we explored in parts one and two of this series—legacy companies are examining how the latest advances in AI might change the way we work in the future.As ChatGPT began to gain traction in February, AT&T’s team of around 300 data scientists and developers began talking to vendors, poring over blogs and forums, and experimenting to determine how this emerging form of conversational AI might help serve the wireless carrier’s business interests, according to AT&T Chief Data Officer Andy Markus.Months later, the company rolled out its own office-wide version of ChatGPT, dubbed Ask AT&T, designed to draw from internal files to answer employee questions. Markus, citing internal tests, said large language models (LLMs) have helped the company’s programmers complete coding tasks around 20% to 50% faster than they had previously. It’s also being used for tasks like translating documentation across different languages.AT&T is far from the only legacy company with a story like this. Businesses across almost every sector have worked with perhaps uncharacteristic speed to deploy the latest AI advances to their workforces. But hurdles like inaccuracy of generated information, data security, and disorganized internal databases have also limited these efforts.“[ChatGPT] knows generally about the world; it doesn’t know about AT&T, internal, or for that matter, any other company…so you have to teach it that stuff—you almost have to become a librarian for how you’re organizing that internal content,” Markus said. “The good thing is we can try to not commit some of the sins of the past, where we have multiple copies of data in different places.”More StoriesAISalesforce’s principal AI ethicist on the state of AI regulation worldwideConnectivityNew survey reveals widespread concern over online data practices Connectivity3 takeaways from the AT&T metadata breachMeeting employees where they arePart of the reasoning behind Ask AT&T was to get ahead of where employees were already headed. Even before Samsung notably banned its employees from using generative AI applications like ChatGPT at work, Markus said he figured AT&T’s employees would inevitably tap the apps, so his team decided to work with Microsoft to create a more secure, non-public alternative.“[ChatGPT] is such a great productivity [tool]; odds are people are going to start sharing information as employees—they’re going to have AT&T documents pasting and code copying. And we didn’t want that stuff to get out there in the public, per se,” Markus said. “So that’s kind of why we did it.”Markus said the key to cutting down on hallucinations has been to direct Ask AT&T to always include citations that show where it generated its answer from and prompt it to admit when it doesn’t have an answer. “You just have to tell it, ‘If you don’t really know, say you don’t know.’ That helps a lot,” Markus said.Keep up with the innovative tech transforming businessTech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech.SubscribeThe company’s next step is to roll out a generative AI-powered chatbot to help with customer service, something it has been A/B testing with a certain percentage of customers, Markus said.Overhyped in the near termAt enterprise management platform Workday, Chief Technology Officer Jim Stratton said the company has been similarly evaluating use cases both within Workday and for its clients.Use cases related to content creation and summarization will have easy applications in the near term, according to Stratton. The company is looking at ways it might be able to integrate generative AI to help with tasks like writing job descriptions and performance reviews, for instance.“Allowing people not to start with a clean sheet of paper, get them 80% of the way there and then provide them with tools to help them edit to get to the good finished product that they want,” Stratton told Tech Brew. “I think those are relatively low-hanging-fruit use cases that also provide a lot of value to the end users.”Stratton said another use case is employing LLMs as a text interface tool for navigating complex processes.“Just thinking about natural language interfaces to help you navigate through complex tasks or complex applications—that’s certainly an area that we’re investigating now that I think will have substantial dividends in terms of the usability of fairly complex applications,” Stratton said.Stratton said the technology is likely overhyped at the moment—these immediate use cases might not be as transformative as some might claim—but underhyped in the long term, as new applications that haven’t been imagined yet become possible as AI evolves.Jayesh Govindarajan, SVP of AI and machine learning at Salesforce, told Tech Brew that the enterprise giant is betting on generative AI ultimately transforming the way that offices work; the company is aiming to build generative AI tools that serve each role in a business.“Generative AI will transform how we work. What you’re starting to see is Salesforce, taking the view that we want to have an assistant for every persona that we serve today,” Govindarajan said. “What this means for the workforce is it takes away the mundane from the day-to-day.”CopyYou might also like...AISalesforce’s principal AI ethicist on the state of AI regulation worldwidePatrick Kulp / 07.18.2024ConnectivityNew survey reveals widespread concern over online data practices Kelcee Griffis / 07.18.2024Connectivity3 takeaways from the AT&T metadata breachKelcee Griffis / 07.17.2024Keep up with the innovative tech transforming businessTech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech.Try it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Simulation Work Together
July 17, 2023


July 17, 2023 — As artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and simulation revolutionize the way humans process and predict information, Ansys Chief Technology Officer Dr. Prith Banerjee explains how better, faster decisions are made possible when these transformational sciences align.

Q: How are AI, ML, and simulation related?
Dr. Prith Banerjee: AI/ML and simulation are distinct technologies that, when intersected, complement each other in some really powerful ways.
Dr. Prith Banerjee is chief technology officer at Ansys.
First, there’s AI, which creates systems that mimic human behavior that are based on rules. ML is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn the rules automatically based on training data. And then there’s simulation, which analyzes real-world products and systems through virtual models.
While they’re independent concepts, they’re continuously feeding each other. Simulations use AI and ML techniques to run models faster and easier. In turn, AI and ML use simulation to create synthetic data from a variety of industries and applications.
Q: How do AI/ML and simulation work together?
Banerjee: In the last 50 years, we’ve been using simulation to accelerate product innovation. At the same time, our partners in the AI/ML communities have been working to make technology as smart as the human brain.
Today, AI/ML is being used to make simulations faster and easier to run, while at the same time, simulation is providing AI with accurate synthetic data to make intelligent systems smarter.
When these technologies work together, they make visionary ideas possible and accessible to all.

Q: How has AI/ML influenced the evolution of simulation?
Banerjee: The most fundamental role of simulation is to make better decisions faster, and both AI and ML are critical enablers of speed. AI/ML can enable a designer to start with a high-level specification, auto-generate 10,000 design options, and then rapidly evaluate which options are the best.
Different AI/ML approaches, including bottom-up methods, top-down methods, reduced-order models (ROMs), and large language models (LLMs), enable our solvers to perform faster, more accurate predictive analysis.
LLMs such as ChatGPT can be especially beneficial in making solvers even easier to use. For example, if one of our engineers wanted to run a simulation about an electric car, they would first have to translate the specifications for different systems (e.g., battery, motor, charger, etc.) which requires a lot of time and expertise.
But with LLMs, anyone could write an English language statement that simply states the desired outcome, such as: “Design an electric car with a 2,000-mile range that goes from 0 to 60 mph in one second.” The simulation would automatically generate a multitude of solutions for the entire car, some of which the human mind might never have considered.
AI can also improve the way we write our code. When a developer needs to upgrade our software, AI can respond with the best code snippet for solving the problem. This improves developer productivity and also enhances our customer service. By reviewing the data from thousands of customer service interactions, virtual agents can quickly provide first-level support, clearing the way for our experts to apply their minds to more atypical questions.
Q: With AI/ML integrating billions of sources, how do you ensure accuracy?
Banerjee: When a human designer takes a spec of a car, they use a lot of themselves to build it — not just their knowledge, but also their ability to reason.
When an AI models a car, it will aggregate references from a variety of sources, some of which may be unreliable, or competitors, or legally protected properties. This is part of why human monitoring and techniques like explainable AI are so important.
At Ansys, we use our own intellectual property (IP) and apply the ChatGPT engine against the database we’ve built over 50 years — things we learned through thousands of interactions between our customers and our Ansys Customer Excellence (ACE) team. To ensure confidence and accuracy, we rely on our own sources.
Q: What’s next for AI/ML and simulation?
Banerjee: When Ford started building vehicles, the manufacturing technology at the time dictated what structures they could use — such as metal forming and injection molding like rectangles and cylinders. So, everything looked the same. The idea of making a car that looks like a bird would have been difficult to imagine. But now, with generative design and additive manufacturing, it is possible to build really complex objects.
Today, Ansys is working on a ML platform where you can specify the requirements of a very complex product. The result will be the ability to generate thousands of new ideas that the human designer can’t even imagine. All these designs can be rapidly evaluated using simulation, with the best option being chosen by the human designer. When simulation and AI/ML work together, so much more is possible.

At an executive leadership meeting earlier this year, we devoted a block of time to discussing ChatGPT. Leaders from our AI team demonstrated a range of capabilities, including its ability to write marketing content, generate computer code, engage in customer support dialog, and as a grand finale, to answer a very complex accounting question. At the end, our young, high achieving global corporate controller gasped “I’m going to be replaced by AI!” To which, another of our leaders, known for his logic and dry wit, responded “no, you’re going to be replaced by someone who uses AI better than you do.” That’s the question of the day. Will ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI replace entire industries, like accounting, or will they, as we like to say at Sage “elevate human work?”
To be clear, the accounting industry is already using AI extensively and to great effect. AI that can read and categorize data from business documents is entering the mainstream. Accountants are using AI to automate financial modelling and forecasting. And as a corollary to all this automation, accountants are relying on AI to identify anomalous transactions – identifying accounting errors, revealing changes in business performance, and even catching fraud.
So, what makes generative AI different? First, a little explainer. Generative AI refers to a category of artificial intelligence that can create new content or outcomes, often based on patterns or structures it has learned from existing data. This includes generating text, images, music, and even complex designs. GPT, the foundation for ChatGPT, is a form of generative AI called a Large Language Model (LLM). LLMs are machine learning models designed to understand, interpret, and generate human-like text. These models learn patterns and structures in language from massive volumes of text data, enabling them to complete prompts, answer queries, or even create entire articles in a remarkably human-like manner.
Many of you have already had your magic moment with ChatGPT or one of the other new chatbots where you realized AI has leapt forward. Mine was a very simple interaction, but the implications hit me like a bolt of lightning. I told ChatGPT a dad joke: A skeleton walks into a bar and says to the bartender, “I’ll have a beer and a mop.” Many humans don’t get this joke right away, but ChatGPT quickly responded, “Haha, that’s a good one! The joke plays on the fact that a skeleton, being made of bones with no organs or tissues, would not be able to consume the beer like a living person. Instead, the beer would simply flow through its bones and make a mess on the floor, hence the need for a mop.” After picking my jaw up from off the floor, I surmised OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, had solved two big AI limitations – an understanding of the world and the ability to reason. Whether these abilities are real or imagined is irrelevant – AI is now able to perform complex tasks with minimal instruction.
Research conducted by OpenAI in partnership with the University of Pennsylvania reveals around 80% of the workforce will have at least 10% of their work tasks impacted and the remaining 20% will have at least 50% impacted. Not surprisingly, accountants, auditors, and tax preparers are among the jobs expected to be most impacted. The research generated a lot of headlines. My favorite was a bit cheeky – “Stonemasons Should be Fine in the Brave New World"". Apparently, journalists, who are also among the jobs expected to be most impacted, use sarcasm as a natural defense mechanism.
What does all this mean for the accounting industry? Let’s start with a massive disclaimer: generative AI is moving fast and will be profoundly disruptive. I believe generative AI is as transformational as the Internet or the smart phone but is racing through the adoption curve faster than any technology we’ve ever seen. ChatGPT reached a million users in five days. It reached 100M users in two months. In the span of six months, its capability, as measured by performance on the Bar exam, improved from performing in the bottom 10% to performing in the top 10%. It is impossible to predict how this will play out, but I can give you a few likely scenarios.
AI will progress from automating tasks to automating entire workflows. I mentioned how we’re able to use AI today to read data from an invoice, categorize the expenses, and identify problems like over-billing. Today, that AI is deployed within strictly defined workflows where pre-configured rules orchestrate activity. With LLMs, we’ll be able to hand the orchestration off to “AI Agents” that can operate autonomously. These agents could own and operate a workflow with the same type of instructions you might give to an accountant: “don’t let the cash balance fall below X; make sure to pay vendors of type Y early; let me know if you see any bills with unusually large amounts.”
Digital Assistants will change the way we interact with technology. Today’s business applications guide user interaction through pre-defined menus, carefully designed data entry forms, lists for sorting and filtering records, and “canned” reports or dashboards for data analysis. These UIs are both limiting and hard to learn. LLMs promise to replace all this with simple human language interaction. Imagine working within a spreadsheet and asking a digital assistant to gather the accounting data you need to analyze. Imagine reviewing and approving purchase orders from within Teams. Tools like Excel and Teams are familiar and suited to the job to be done, enabling more accessible “serf-serve” capabilities that reduce dependency on the accounting team. Further, imagine LLMs integrated with enterprise systems enabling employees within the business to get their own answers or do their own data analysis on enterprise data via a simple chat interface. In fact, as chat interfaces become the norm, employees won’t settle for today’s crude tools.
AI will handle routine interactions with customers and vendors.  Most emails an accounting team receive fall into a small set of repetitive interactions. For instance, customers ask for tax information, ask for their latest statement, or remit payment information; vendors send invoices, ask when to expect payment, and provide compliance details. LLMs are exceptionally good at understanding the intent of these emails, determining the steps required to respond (i.e., send an invoice for processing or get an invoice from the accounting system for a customer), and generating a response email if called for.
AI will be an expert resource. Accountants will have access to an expert resource for understanding and applying accounting standards. What’s the correct accounting treatment for a complex sales contract? What does tax law say about capital asset write-offs? LLMs are also helpful data analysts. Give an LLM access to balance sheet data for the last 24 months and ask it to identify the most significant trends. Give it access to detailed ledger data and ask it to forecast future cash flow. More generally, AI will make every knowledge worker more productive. A few paragraphs ago, I was really struggling to write a concise, understandable definition for generative AI and LLMs, so I asked ChatGPT for help. Its suggestion wasn’t perfect, but it gave me something to work with and unblocked the writing process.
Of course, LLMs come with well-known risks. They’re known to hallucinate, where their responses are articulate, well-reasoned, and entirely make-believe. They can be tricked into misbehaving. There are questions about data privacy. They’ve introduced a long list of legal questions over both the content used to train the models as well as the ownership of content the models create. The technology is outpacing regulation. The situation could call for a moratorium on their use, but the genie is already out of the bottle. We need the accounting industry to guide businesses on how to leverage AI safely and effectively.
I went to New York City earlier this year to visit my friends at the AICPA. I wanted to look into the whites of their eyes for signs of fear. I saw the opposite – where most see a threat, they see opportunity. We aligned together on two overarching opportunities with generative AI: 1) solving the industry’s labor shortage, and 2) enabling accountants to deliver more strategic value. As we further discussed the risks and challenges posed by generative AI, we discovered a third opportunity I believe to be greater than the first two. As we delegate more and more tasks to technology, especially to technology that can be unpredictable, the value of human accountability will increase.
Solving the industry’s labor shortage. It’s no secret the accounting industry faces a labor shortage. Bloomberg Tax calculates that the number of accountants and auditors employed fell by 17% between 2019 and 2021. University enrollment in accounting courses fell by four percent between 2016 and 2019. According to Deloitte & Touche LLP, 82.4% of hiring managers for accounting and financial positions in public companies believe that recruitment is a “big challenge.” We can argue over how to attract more people to accounting careers, but a better answer may be to simply make accountants more productive. AI is particularly well suited to automating repetitive tasks like data entry and reconciliation. Sage customers using our AI powered invoice processing are reporting a 2X – 3X improvement in productivity, creating more capacity within their accounting teams. And this automation has a happy side-effect – automating low value, repetitive work may make an accounting career more attractive.
Enabling accountants to deliver more strategic value. In the list of “jobs to be done” by accountants, there’s no negotiating over compliance related work. The accounting team can’t postpone an audit to make time to evaluate a potential acquisition. There’s no give on tax filing deadlines. Any time and resources devoted to strategic work can only follow the required work. Automating these non-negotiables naturally frees time for more strategically valuable work. Equip accountants with LLMs, and not only will they have more time for this work, but they’ll also have an invaluable, hyper efficient research assistant that can analyze massive amounts of information and structure coherent, professional presentations of the results.
The value of human accountability. We have a maxim at Sage – we should match our investments in automation with equivalent investments in trust. Human users will only transition their work to technology if they trust the technology to do the job safely and competently. Not to be too dramatic here, but while there’s an obvious benefit to automating compliance work, the risks of non-compliance are ruined careers, or worse. We can transition the work to technology, but accountability will always reside with humans. Humans sign audit statements – not AI.
The accounting industry’s greatest contribution to society is confidence in our markets. There are various ways to put a price on that confidence. For example, the total revenue in audit fees for the global big four accounting firms in 2021 was $271B. I believe AI will drive an exponential increase in this value, in part because AI increases risk, but more importantly because a more efficient and productive accounting industry will lead to more efficient and productive markets.
Getting back to our question of the day, I’m quite optimistic. We have the opportunity with generative AI to not only elevate human work, but also to elevate the entire accounting industry. Yes, we should proceed with caution, but we should also proceed with pace and determination. The winners will be the ones who use AI better than anyone else.

All the talk about artificial intelligence these days seems to be around the jobs it could replace. But new generative AI tools might help you find one, too.


New features or tools from LinkedIn, Adzuna and Rezi claim to not only strengthen what you’re submitting in a job application, but help you make career decisions or even quit.

“AI’s being used pretty much at every step” of the career-planning process, says James Neave, head of data science at job search platform Adzuna. With the rise of technologies such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard creating an AI arms race, more career-related tools are adding AI features to their products. About half (46%) of the 2,153 job seekers surveyed by Resume Builder said they are using ChatGPT to write their resumes or cover letters.

Nitzan Pelman, founder and CEO of nonprofit Climb Hire, a platform that helps workers learn new skills and find new careers, says AI tools can be particularly useful for lower-skilled workers. “A clerk at Trader Joe’s doesn’t always know what their skills are,” Pelman says. “If they know how to tell ChatGPT about what they do, it can help them translate those things into skills” that could help them break into white-collar jobs, she says.

But some hiring managers and companies aren’t welcoming the practice. AI users should still assess the results of AI-generated content and tools, Pelman says. “You have to use your own critical thinking to then figure out: is this solid or not?” Here, a rundown of the latest offerings:
LinkedIn: AI-Powered Software To Help Draft Messages To Hiring Managers
Reaching out to hiring managers can be daunting. What should your message say? Starting in May, LinkedIn began using generative AI to help premium subscribers draft personalized messages when messaging on LinkedIn with hiring managers.

According to a post by Ora Levit, senior director of product management and head of core growth, the new feature is in addition to the job platform’s AI-powered writing tools, which help users enhance their profiles.
“Customization is still important,” Levit writes, “so take the time to review and edit the draft to make it your own and convey your voice, then send onwards to the hiring manager, getting one step closer to your next opportunity.”
NAV: ‘A Credit Score For Your Career’ 
Founded by husband-and-wife duo Heather and Howard Matalon in June, NAV uses generative AI and its algorithms to give your career or job offers a score. Users complete NAV’s online evaluation to receive the score and gain feedback on whether it’s time to leave or not.
Think of it as a credit score for how well you’re climbing the ladder, Howard Matalon says. “This is about getting the kind of advice that you would need from a human resources perspective on critical areas about your career trajectory.”
To keep things personalized, he says NAV also offers human career coaches to help users analyze their results and provide advice.
Adzuna: Let AI Help You Interview Prep
In June, the job search platform launched Prepper, an interview readiness tool that uses AI to generate questions and feedback to your responses. In its first 10 days, the tool reached more than 2,000 users per day. Adzuna is not new to AI; its resume assessment tool has used a natural language processing model since 2014.
To use Prepper, job seekers provide the large language model with the job description they’re interviewing for, and Prepper will generate company- and job-specific interview questions. Users type their responses, and the tool provides feedback on those answers, suggesting responses. (Adzuna’s Neave says the company is planning to expand its capabilities so users can answer interview questions with just their voice.)
“It acts as a confidence booster,” Neave says, which could help with pre-interview anxieties.
Cover Letter Copilot: A Free Service For A Dreaded Task
No one likes writing cover letters. Getting a service to write one for you might sound better—but that can often come with a fee.
Ben Broch’s Cover Letter Copilot, which uses generative AI and was launched in early June, is a free service. Broch, whose background is in product management, says users also don’t have to prompt the ChatGPT generator with individual answers to questions. Job hunters can upload their resume and the job description, and the tool will generate a customized cover letter.
But Broch says it serves as just a starting point. “I don't want this to just be ‘hit a button and the AI does everything,’” he says. “It really does need to feel like a copilot where you are in control.”
Rezi: Resignation Letter Generator To Help You Quit
Rezi’s GPT-powered resume builder is a popular choice among job seekers. But its new tool, launched last year, appeals to quitters instead.
The company’s new AI resignation letter builder uses machine learning to create professional, simple memos in a few seconds. All you have to do is enter the basics: company name, job title, last day of work, reason for resigning and your signature.
The tool has already seen more than 315,000 users and offers job-specific templates, such as for product managers, legal secretaries and more.

But this worry isn’t insurmountable.When Jessica’s boss recently asked whether the company she works for should be using artificial intelligence tools, she quietly panicked. As a content marketer, her major responsibilities at the Connecticut, US-based software company are writing and editing – tasks that generative AI software threatens to usurp.But Jessica’s fear isn’t exactly about losing her job.“Writing has always been my thing,” she says. “I wrote stories as a kid. I was an English major, and then a journalist before I got into content marketing. I’ve never done anything else; I don’t really have any other skill set, which is pretty terrifying.”An increasing body of research shows many workers fear artificial intelligence displacing their jobs, especially in creative industries, where tools like Open AI’s ChatGPT have already made sophisticated strides in generative learning. Some recent surveys show the worry is pervasive: workers across different generations and demographic groups report feeling threatened.Yet for Jessica, and others like her, the real threat of AI is a personal – even existential – one. Along with feeling personally out to sea, she worries about her workplace value – that her professional identity will no longer be important. She’s also fearful about what she’ll do – and, ultimately, whom she’ll be – if her job as a writer is eliminated.This, says Mindy Shoss, a professor of organizational psychology at the University of Central Florida, is understandable – and that plenty of people can relate to the feeling. “The crux of a lot of AI anxiety is about identity. Work fulfils many different identity functions,” she says. “Yes, it gives us income, but it also gives us a sense of self-worth and belonging and opportunities to develop new skills, and meaningfulness in life. When our work is threatened, all these other things get threatened with it.”Job threats aside, Shoss says the uncertainty alone is enough to cause concern. “Anxiety comes from the unknown,” she says. “The development of AI is happening so quickly that it’s really hard to keep up with. There’s so much unknown right now, and so much speculation about what AI can do, will do, might do. It’s very understandable and appropriate that people are experiencing some anxiety.”Getty ImagesAs AI will inevitably find its way into many jobs, the more people can learn about how they'll work alongside the technology, the better they may feel (Credit: Getty Images)Tech DecodedFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter. The twice-weekly email decodes the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world. Sign up for free here.This feeling of unease and existential panic can be extremely unnerving – and entirely justified in the current work landscape. But there’s reason to take a breath: as this technology finds its way into the mainstream and continues to evolve, experts say these worries don’t have to take over.Shoss says one of the best ways to handle identity-driven anxiety is to demystify the unknown.In ongoing research, she says, “we’ve found that people who tend to read more and try to learn more and develop more skills around the technology are a little bit less anxious about the impact of robots and AI in the workplace”. The threat can seem less imminent, she explains, once people understand the technology’s shortfalls and the need for human oversight.Jessica has taken this approach herself: ever since that first conversation with her boss, she’s thrown herself headlong into learning everything necessary to become her company’s resident AI expert.“I’ve immersed myself,” she says. “I’ve done a complete 180, from ignoring it out of fear to fully diving in. I need to control the AI narrative at my company, and make sure that I’m in the driver’s seat and I’m telling them what ChatGPT and these other tools can and cannot do.”Jessica feels her job is secure for now. But the technology’s evolution, she says, still feels like a relentless onslaught. Eventually, she believes AI will be able to take over many of the writing and editing tasks that make up much of her current workload. She’s trying to be proactive, working to refine skills that are tougher for AI to mimic and move into a more strategic role ­– and to find a new way to re-frame her identity.To ease identity anxiety, workers also may find it’s helpful to look at what, exactly, AI can do – and what human-led job tasks are still irreplaceable.It may actually be good if AI replaces menial tasks, says Jo Lindsay Walton, a research fellow in arts, climate and technology at the Sussex Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Sussex, UK. He points to tasks like transcription, which will become entirely automated. As this happens, he explains, workers will be able to focus not only on more essential, less robot-replicable, expertise, but also on more meaningful and satisfying work that can make them feel good about themselves.  Plus, adds Walton, it’s worthwhile to remember that today’s workers aren’t the first to experience an existential crisis over automation. Since the Industrial Revolution, people have been threatened by machines promising to usurp their jobs and the things that mean a lot to them personally. “We can learn a lot about our present and future from how people in the past thought about their future,” says Walton. But historically, those threats have been overblown, and humans have always retained an irreplaceable role in the workforce. “The high-level message is that they got it wrong,” he adds, “and we are probably getting it wrong.”How we workFeaturesArtificial intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think my work and future are under a huge question mark.""Artificial Intelligence: the Death of Art?Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)'Real art has personality'While the problems are clear, there are some ways AI tools can be used to benefit artists, according to Cardiff-based animator Harry Hambley, who is the creative force behind internet sensation Ketnipz.""I think for me the biggest thing generative art can solve is tedium,"" he said.""But it can be scary and the internet's already a wild place, and you mix AI in with that… we don't know where it's going to go.""Do I think that my job will ever be sacrificed to AI or AI will do it better than me? I don't know. I hope not.""Harry HambleyArtist Harry Hambley says the biggest problem is we do not know how far AI will goHarry said he thought there was more to art than how it looked.""At the end of the day I think that there's a bigger reason why people are invested in Ketnipz and I don't think it's just the mere aesthetics of it.""I think there's a personality behind it that I don't think someone imitating can really tap into.""'Just keep making art'James Lewis's brush control has made him a hit on TikTokArtist James Lewis, from Cardiff, creates videos of his painting technique for more than seven million followers on TikTok and Instagram. He has yet to find out if his work has been used by the tools, but said because AI has learned from billions of artworks, it would be hard to trace which artists' works have been used in each image.""If there was a way to go back and figure out who inspired this style of image that was generated, I think it would be fair for that artist to receive some sort of compensation,"" he said.James LewisJames Lewis' piece, Kaboom: ""If there was a way figure out who inspired this style of image... it would be fair to receive some sort of compensation""In the meantime he thinks artists should keep being creative.""I do have hope that as much as AI art will develop and it'll get better, but it will never be able to capture that true human essence, that true creativity that we have as people,"" he said.""You will still need your own creative ideas, your own initiative.""Sarah WangArtist Caroline Sinders says she will be exercising her copyright rightsFor artist and human rights researcher Caroline Sinders, it is for AI companies to address the problem.She said: ""Part of the argument we hear from companies is, 'we have so much data, it would be impossible for us to tell, like searching for a needle in a haystack'.""I would like to say, well, that's a 'you' problem, not a 'me' problem. ""I have a copyright on the images and I plan to enact my copyright if my images are used without my consent.""She said she was also worried about the bias that these tools created and how it meant AI art was not reflecting the real world.""Let's say we ask an image generation AI system to generate a doctor assessing care to a family,"" she said.""Most likely that doctor will be generated as male and probably as white, and the parent will probably be generated as female.What is AI and is it dangerous?AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?Can you tell the difference between AI and reality?""And this is not an example I'm randomly making up. There have been tests done by asking these sort of blanket questions without gender being in the text prompt and, more often than not, it's reflecting these stereotypes.""This extends to racial bias and also ableism, said Irene Fubara-Manuel, a lecturer at the University of Sussex.While they said they were excited about the possibilities provided by generative art, issues such as racial and gender biases in some images created were hard to overcome.""I was trying to dye my hair over the summer, and I was just looking up 'people of colour, blonde locks',"" they said.Irene Fubara-Manuel says they noticed bias when searching for images to try out new hairstyles""What I got in response was this regal, I would say, fetishised image of black people. You know, chiselled jaw lines, their skin was iridescent.""It's like, there are black people who are that beautiful, but the images that you see commonly in a lot of AI are very, very fetishised representations of people. ""You would not see people who are plus size, or people who have visible disabilities, for instance.""Artists are now calling on regulators in the UK and worldwide to take more action to protect artists and the industry.Irene said artists were not against AI but, ""the argument is against exploitation"".""But I'm hopeful that it will contribute to human creativity in general, just like how the creation of computers added more to creativity. I'm excited for its contribution,"" they said.Caroline said more regulation of the emerging AI industry in the UK would not ""stifle"" innovation.""It makes things safer and that's why we have certain laws,"" she said.""That's why right now we have seatbelts and airbags for cars and a lot of rules about them. When they were first invented, we didn't have any of that. ""So it's not at all out of step to sort of ask for, or to create, guardrails and protections.""Additional reporting by Lola Mayor.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.Elon Musk announces new AI start-upUK must be more open on use of AI, say campaignersWatch: What threats does AI pose?AI quiz: Can you tell which person is real?What is AI and how does it work?CopyrightCardiffArtificial intelligenceArtEmploymentPoland",,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-66099850,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7C4D/production/_130412813_img_2055.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As generative AI gains popularity among organizations, upskilling in this technology becomes critical for HR professionals as the technology can have huge ramifications. Check out the need for upskilling yourself and the best practices to leverage generative AI in HR.
Generative AI is becoming increasingly relevant in the HR industry. In the age of generative AI, HR professionals must upgrade their skills to deal with its ramifications successfully. They must know the principles underlying generative AI and its possible advantages and drawbacks to make wise choices. They should learn how to use AI tools to hire and train employees. To ensure ethical and objective hiring and talent management procedures, they must also develop the critical thinking abilities necessary to assess and analyze AI-generated information.
Generative AI has several applications in human resources. It may streamline and improve HR operations by automating applicant sourcing and resume screening, developing customized employee training programs, producing performance evaluation reports, and facilitating employee engagement using AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants. MarketResearch.Biz predicts that by 2032, the market for generative AI in HR will have increased to more than USD 1669.3 million, with a CAGR of 15.40%Opens a new window  between 2023 and 2032. This exemplifies the potential utility of generation AI for the development of HR.
Impact of Generative AI on HR Processes
Generative AI can revolutionize HR processes by automating tasks, enhancing decision-making, and improving employee experiences. It benefits us in several ways, as mentioned earlier. According to recent Stanford and MIT studiesOpens a new window , chatbots and other AI tools increased worker productivity at one IT company by 14%.
By automating applicant sourcing and resume screening, generative AI transforms recruiting, reducing time-consuming manual labor and increasing productivity. It can produce simulations and learning resources specifically tailored to the employee. AI-powered analytics are useful for performance evaluation, and AI-powered chatbots can help employees feel more engaged. The main issues include biases in generated material and ethical considerations, and human monitoring is required to enable ethical and responsible AI adoption.
Jane Funk, PHR, SHRM-CP, vice president of people at Armory, says, “As HR professionals, we cannot accurately predict the longstanding impact of generative AI on HR tech. However, we can proactively adopt these solutions to gauge their effectiveness in daily workflows and ensure our operations remain innovative. In other words, HR practitioners who focus on maturing their generative AI capabilities facilitate long-term success in their departments, regardless of how the market stabilizes. If you’re overwhelmed by the possibilities of generative AI, assess gaps in your current HR plan and brainstorm ways to address those issues using AI. For example, can you rely on large language models (LLMs) like Jasper or ChatGPT to generate emails, job postings, and other communication materials? Who hasn’t been stuck when starting a job description or finding the right tone for the intended audience when crafting a message? AI can assist with this persistent problem. Seasoned HR professionals should always review and revise AI-generated materials — nonetheless, they’re a powerful tool for reducing workplace toil and improving communication speed.” 
Upskilling HR Professionals for the Generative AI Era
HR professionals must build abilities in AI concepts, data analysis, and interpretation to make the most of generative AI. Further, they should emphasize critical thinking to analyze and comprehend AI-generated outputs, ensure ethical practices, and maintain a human-centric approach in HR decision-making and talent management. 
HR professionals can improve their technology skills by taking online courses, attending workshops, and working on hands-on projects. Cultivating data literacy involves learning data analysis techniques and using data visualization tools. Improving ethical decision-making necessitates remaining current on AI ethics and developing ethical principles. Creating collaborative alliances entails networking with IT professionals and working together on AI initiatives.
Talking exclusively to Spiceworks, Vivian Jiang, HR Business Partner at hireEZ, says, “Generative AI tools can help HR pros make the most use of their limited time by making administrative tasks more efficient and intensive work more effective. For example, I like using text generators to quickly create first drafts of new policies to edit them, which saves me precious time. Or, in domains like hiring and recruiting, AI can help streamline hiring processes by instantaneously generating personalized candidate outreach messages or streamline the recruiting process by analyzing resumes and social media profiles. HR pros that learn to use these tools now will be ahead of the game when generative AI is natively embedded in every system we use.”
Microsoft recently unveiledOpens a new window  the AI Skills Initiative to assist individuals and groups worldwide learn to harness AI’s power. A new grant challenge with data.org is open to businesses to develop innovative strategies for training, upskilling, and reskilling workers in generative AI as part of the new project, a component of Microsoft’s Skills for Jobs program.

Best Practices to Leverage Generative AI in HR
As per Funk, generative AI possesses powerful research capabilities. Beyond expediting and improving daily processes, these solutions can aid in strategic planning by providing a sounding board for best practices and current talent trends. HR leaders looking to simplify complex people processes, such as drafting a long-term scaling and hiring strategy, could look to LLMs as an additional tool in their tech stack for statistics and insights into other organizations’ systems and leaders’ decision-making processes. This information can provide incredible context as part of strategic decision-making.
When implementing generative AI in HR processes, HR professionals should:

Clearly define objectives and identify areas where AI can add value.
Ensure data privacy and security.
Monitor and evaluate AI-generated outputs for biases and ensure fairness.
Maintain a balance between automation and human involvement.
Provide transparency and clear communication to employees about AI integration.

When implementing generative AI, HR professionals must take ethical issues into mind. Biases must be addressed, transparency must be maintained, and fairness must be upheld as ethical considerations. Protection of employee data and adherence to rules are necessary for data privacy. Automation and human interaction must coexist harmoniously to preserve empathy and human judgment. Continuous learning and adaptation are crucial to keep current with AI developments and maximize their application in HR operations.
Jiang says, “AI can be a valuable tool in analyzing talent pools and competitors. HR professionals can gain insights into potential candidates’ skills, qualifications, and experiences by utilizing AI-powered algorithms and data analysis techniques. AI can help identify patterns, trends, and correlations in large volumes of data, providing HR professionals with a more comprehensive understanding of the talent landscape. Furthermore, AI can help HR professionals stay informed about their competitors’ talent strategies. By monitoring public information, social media profiles, and job postings, AI can provide insights into the talent acquisition efforts of other organizations. This knowledge can be invaluable for understanding market trends, identifying potential threats, and adapting recruitment strategies accordingly.”
Oracle recently addedOpens a new window  generative AI features to its human resources software, allowing it to assist in drafting job descriptions and employee performance goals. The AI assistant will generate draft text that needs to be approved by humans, with further plans to expand its capabilities.

Up until now, employers have been able to use artificial intelligence (AI)-powered hiring and promotional tools without worry about compliance with AI-specific laws. On July 5, 2023, that changed. New York City passed Local Law 144, legislation restricting employers’ use of artificial intelligence-driven employment tools.
Local Law 144 prohibits employers from using an automated employment decision tool (“AEDT”)[1] in hiring, promotion, and other employment decisions, unless the employer first ensures that the tool has been audited for bias within the preceding year. These AI-powered tools—ranging from programs that screen resumes for qualifications to those that assign scores to candidates based on mannerisms and responses in video interviews—are increasingly used by employers. However, AEDTs have generated controversy due to the potential for bias. Now, New York City employers are required to independently audit their AEDT systems for bias and publish the results on their company websites, or face fines. Local Law 144 also requires employers to provide job candidates with notice about the use of an AEDT system and offer them an opportunity to opt out. Employers found in violation of Local Law 144 face a $500 fine on the first offense and a $1,500 fine on each subsequent one. 
New York City Local Law 144 comes amid a global push to regulate the use of AI and may provide a model for auditing rules that can be adopted in other jurisdictions. However, it does not provide any legal threshold for when AI-based hiring or recruiting should be considered biased or to have a disparate impact on protected groups. The EEOC, which has publicized its intent to review AEDTs with scrutiny, has provided limited endorsement for a “rule of thumb,” which states that if a hiring test has a selection rate of less than 80% for a protected group, compared to others, then such a gap likely indicates bias.[2]
Notably, other states and jurisdictions have also enacted AI-based legislation:


In 2020, Illinois enacted the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, 820 ILCS 42, to govern the use of AI to assess video interviewees for jobs. Employers recruiting in Illinois must (1) obtain consent from applicants before using AI, after explaining how the AI works and its evaluation standards; and (2) ensure proper control of video recordings and deletion upon request. Unlike New York City’s law, however, the Illinois law does not include civil penalties.




Maryland passed an AI-employment law in 2020, B. 1202, which prohibits employers from using facial recognition technology during an interview for employment without consent. Consent requires a signed waiver that states: (1) the applicant’s name; (2) the date of the interview; (3) that the applicant consents to the use of facial recognition; and (4) confirmation that the applicant read the consent waiver. H.B. 1202 does not include a specific penalty or fine.




Many states are creating councils to oversee AI and new regulations, including Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Vermont and Washington with pending legislation to create similar entities in many more states.




On May 24, 2022, Vermont created the Artificial Intelligence Commission to support the ethical use and development of artificial intelligence in the state, relating to the use and oversight of artificial intelligence in state government. VT H.B. 410.




Similar to Vermont, Colorado passed CO S.B. 113, which created a task force for consideration of facial recognition services. This task force is directed to, among other issues, recommend whether the scope of the task force should be expanded to include consideration of artificial intelligence.


Since 2018, states have ramped up legislation directly related to artificial intelligence and the predicted advances in technology. Local Law 144 is the most comprehensive regulation to date of the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in human resources. But it is certainly not the first piece of legislation on the books governing the use of AI in the workplace. Other jurisdictions are expected to quickly follow suit given the recent media attention to ChatGPT and other AI applications. Employers that use automated decision-making for hiring and promotional decisions should start considering now whether they need to modify these tools to ensure that they do not contain bias.

Also reprinted on Law.com.
With the advent of readily accessible artificial intelligence (AI) and the breakthrough of generative AI (GAI) programs such as ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, GAI is now a staple in all facets of business. GAI programs can generate new texts, images, and content (outputs) based on textual prompts by a user (inputs). Whether prompted to write a corporate slogan, create music, generate works of art and advertisements, or summarize a book – GAI can do it all. However, its increasing popularity means that users of GAI programs face substantial intellectual property risks – particularly when businesses use GAI for marketing and other public-facing purposes.
GAI has taken the world by storm. In 2023 alone, GAI has been used to generate musical works using the voices of famous musicians such as Drake, The Weeknd, Rihanna, Ye (formerly Kanye West), and Jay-Z – to name a few. These AI-generated musical works were short-lived, however, as they were quickly removed from streaming services after record label companies threatened legal action. GAI has also been used to generate new works of art. For example, the winner of the 2023 Sony World Photography Awards used GAI to create their winning work; however, the award was later forfeited when it was found that the artist used GAI to create it. GAI programs also have been used to write substantive and pictographic books – such as the more than 200 e-books on online bookstores that list ChatGPT as an author or co-author. Users galore also produce succinct or lengthy summaries of existing authored works with GAI. This may seem beneficial, however, a recently filed copyright infringement lawsuit, Silverman et al. v. Open AI Inc., claims that to produce books and summarize others, the GAI platform must “ingest” copyrighted books to learn what they are about and to account for their writing style – something the program allegedly did to plaintiff’s copyrighted work, without her permission.
Scenarios like these raise many questions about how GAI and intellectual property rights intersect. What are the intellectual property risks a company takes when it prompts GAI to generate a unique output? Can a company use GAI to imitate the image and/or likeness of a celebrity for commercial purposes, such as a company advertisement? In this rapidly evolving area of law, it’s essential to carefully consider the intellectual property law principles at play before using GAI for your commercial business endeavors.
What’s Not Protectable Under Copyright Law
The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to “secur[e] for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive right to their . . . Writings.” Based on this power and in conjunction with the Copyright Act, Congress has afforded copyright protection broadly to “original works of authorship.” The U.S. Copyright Office’s position is that copyright protection(s) will only be afforded to a work if it is “created by a human being.” Therefore, the Copyright Office’s current policy is to reject copyright protection for AI-generated works, as they are not products of human creation. Similarly, courts have denied copyright protection to works created by nonhuman authors, such as artistic works photographed by monkeys and works created in nature.
This does not completely foreclose the possibility of copyright protection when using GAI, however, as the Copyright Office acknowledges that it is often used to assist artists in the creative process. In situations where the GAI program assists in the creative process, the user may argue that the programs are merely tools, like cameras, that a human author uses to aid in their creation of a copyrightable work. Under this view and consistent with the 1884 U.S. Supreme Court holding in Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, a user of a GAI platform may argue that just as a photo taken by a camera is eligible for copyright protection, the AI-generated output that a user arranged, composed, and edited should be eligible for copyright protection as the final product encompasses human-authored aspects. Although it has yet to be done, it is possible that an artist could modify an AI-generated work to a point that it meets the standards required for copyright protection. However, at the end of the day, only human-authored aspects of a work can be copyrighted.
Similarly, the image and likeness of a person is generally not protectable under copyright law. The right of publicity is an intellectual property right that generally protects an individual against unauthorized commercial misappropriation of their name, likeness, or other identifier of their identity, such as a pseudonym, the individual’s voice, their signature, or photograph. Issues involving rights to publicity are governed by the appropriate state’s statutory and/or common law. This is because in the United States, no federal statute or case law recognizes the right to publicity; meaning, the Copyright Act is inapplicable in publicity cases. For example, a recent case, Young v. Neocortext, Inc., involving the “Reface” deep-fake AI app, which allows users to swap their face and voice with their favorite celebrities in photos and videos, was brought under California’s right to publicity law(s) and alleged commercial misappropriation of likeness, not copyright infringement.
State Rights to Publicity Laws
Even if copyright law does not apply, it does not mean a company can start using generative AI to imitate a famous celebrity for its next advertisement. Many states have “right to publicity” laws, which protect the name, image, and/or likeness of a person from unauthorized commercial uses. However, the right of publicity is not limited to just name, image, or likeness – courts have expanded the scope of these protections to cover the commercial use(s) of “sound-alikes” and “look-alikes.” Meaning, if a company is using a look-alike or a sound-alike for a commercial purpose, merely causing a consumer to associate the look-alike or sound-alike with a celebrity, could be enough to subject the company to liability.
In addition, state laws often protect the “likeness” of a person, but the legal definition is not always defined by statute. Stated generally, likeness encompasses the visual image of a person including, among other things, the individual’s appearance, mannerisms, and gestures. And, when the definition is provided within the statute, one should be wary, as states will often have different variations of the definition. This can raise uncertainty as to which identifiers are subject to state publicity law restrictions, because each state has different framework. So, what is permitted conduct in one state may not be permissible in another. For example, some states may choose to protect the celebrity’s voice, but others may choose to protect the celebrity’s signature. In states where the right to publicity is provided by statute, plaintiffs will generally not need to show actual economic loss or damage to state a claim, whereas in other states, the plaintiff must prove that they sustained actual loss to recover from the alleged infringer. This patchy framework could be challenging to navigate, particularly for those businesses who are actively engaged in commerce across the United States. It is recommended that a business do research on the law of their state and any state in which their advertisement may be viewed before using any AI-generated work that encompasses an individual’s likeness.
How to Mitigate Generative AI Intellectual Property Risks
If you plan to use GAI for your public-facing commercial projects, keep in mind the variety of intellectual property legal considerations that come into play.


If you are creating content with a GAI program that generates an imitation of the image or likeness of a celebrity or other person, consider whether you should first obtain permission and/or a use license from that individual. In some cases, such uses might be permitted in exchange for a royalty or other fee. Otherwise, your business could be at risk of violating state publicity laws.




It’s also important to understand that works produced by GAI are unlikely to be subject to copyright protections. This means that an individual or even the company that owns the GAI program could re-use your AI-generated content for their own commercial purposes without your consent, provided there are no other prevailing intellectual property (e.g., patent and trademark law) or legal limitations.




Further, most GAI programs are trained using large amounts of publicly available data that the program then copies, stores, and learns from to make its outputs more efficient. In other words, it is entirely possible that the resulting AI-generated work has taken and used elements from works that have copyright protection(s). Without proper precautions, your company’s AI-generated work could qualify as a derivative work, and subject your company to an infringement action.




In the event your business is hiring vendors or service providers to develop projects on behalf of your business, ensure the contract terms address their possible use(s) of GAI to create work product(s). Additionally, check the terms and conditions of the GAI program being used by those vendors or service providers to ensure there are no provisions stating that the outputs the program generates are owned by the company that created the program. It’s generally advisable to contract for all work as “work for hire.”


This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the considerations for AI-generated works, but as GAI becomes more prevalent in our day-to-day lives, it’s essential to consider how it will impact your intellectual property rights and risk exposure. Not only does GAI have the ability to generate unique creative works, but it also has the ability to imitate the image or likeness of others – intentionally or not. Businesses using GAI for commercial purposes must be hypervigilant and stay abreast of the intellectual property legal developments as GAI continues to evolve.AuthorsKarl M. ZielaznickiVictoria D.

Updated November 15, 2023: To simplify the user experience and make Copilot more accessible to everyone, Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise will now simply become Microsoft Copilot. For more information: https://aka.ms/BingIgnite
At Microsoft, we are working to provide a copilot for every person in their lives and at work. Earlier this year, we introduced the new AI-powered Bing, your copilot for the web, fundamentally reinventing search as a category with complete answers, a full chat experience, and features to unlock creativity. We also introduced Microsoft 365 Copilot, which combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with your data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 apps to usher in a whole new way of working, using just your own words. Since then, we’ve seen millions of people incorporate Bing into their lives for the first time in new ways to unlock their creativity and gain a better understanding of the world.
And feedback from customers in our Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program, is that Copilot promises to be a game changer for productivity.
Today at Microsoft Inspire, we’re excited to unveil the next steps in our journey: First, we’re significantly expanding Bing to reach new audiences with Bing Chat Enterprise, delivering AI-powered chat for work, and rolling out today in Preview – which means that more than 160 million people already have access. Second, to help commercial customers plan, we’re sharing that Microsoft 365 Copilot will be priced at $30 per user, per month for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard and Business Premium customers, when broadly available; we’ll share more on timing in the coming months. Third, in addition to expanding to more audiences, we continue to build new value in Bing Chat and are announcing Visual Search in Chat, a powerful new way to search, now rolling out broadly in Bing Chat.
Bing Chat Enterprise — AI-powered chat for work 
Employees are looking to use AI tools to help them unlock creativity and productivity at work — 70% say they would delegate as much work as possible to AI according to our Work Trend Index. But using AI tools that aren’t built for the enterprise inadvertently puts sensitive business data at risk. As organizations adopt AI, they want to be confident their data is protected.
Bing Chat Enterprise gives your organization AI-powered chat for work with commercial data protection. With Bing Chat Enterprise, user and business data are protected and will not leak outside the organization. What goes in — and comes out — remains protected. Chat data is not saved, and Microsoft has no eyes-on access – which means no one can view your data. And, your data is not used to train the models. Whether researching industry insights, analyzing data, or looking for inspiration, Bing Chat Enterprise gives people access to better answers, greater efficiency and new ways to be creative.

Just like Bing Chat, Bing Chat Enterprise is grounded in web data and provides complete, verifiable answers with citations, along with visual answers that include graphs, charts and images, and is designed in line with our AI principles.
Bing Chat Enterprise is rolling out in preview today and is included at no additional cost in Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard and Business Premium. And in the future, it will be available as a stand-alone offering for $5 per user, per month. You can access Bing Chat Enterprise using your work account wherever Bing Chat is supported — Bing.com/chat and the Microsoft Edge sidebar. And, in the future, Bing Chat Enterprise will also be accessible from Windows Copilot.

Announcing Microsoft 365 Copilot pricing for commercial customers
Bing Chat Enterprise unlocks generative AI for work. And Microsoft 365 Copilot brings a whole new way of working – reasoning over all your business data in the context of your enterprise, including the ability to ask questions and get answers from the web. Microsoft 365 Copilot will be available for commercial customers for $30 per user per month for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard and Business Premium customers when broadly available.
Microsoft 365 Copilot is built on Microsoft’s trusted and comprehensive approach to enterprise-grade security, privacy, identity, compliance and responsible AI — so you know it’s enterprise ready. This means:

Copilot inherits your existing Microsoft 365 security, privacy, identity and compliance policies.
Your data is logically isolated and protected within your Microsoft 365 tenant, and always within your control.
At the tenant level, Copilot respects individual and group permission policies.

While some generative AI apps focus on a single capability, like real-time transcription or copywriting, Microsoft 365 Copilot is in a class all its own. It has all the capabilities of Bing Chat Enterprise, plus so much more. Copilot puts thousands of skills at your command and can reason over all your content and context to take on any task. It’s grounded in your business data in the Microsoft Graph — that’s all your emails, calendar, chats, documents and more. So, Copilot can generate an update from the morning’s meetings, emails and chats to send to the team; get you up to speed on project developments from the last week; or create a SWOT analysis from internal files and data from the web.
Microsoft 365 Copilot is incredible on its own, and it’s also integrated into the apps millions of people use every day. Copilot jump-starts your creativity in Word, analyzes data in Excel, designs presentations in PowerPoint, triages your Outlook inbox, summarizes meetings in Teams – whether you attended or not – and so much more.
In May, we announced the expansion of our Microsoft 365 Copilot paid Early Access Program to 600 enterprise customers worldwide, including companies like KPMG, Lumen, and Emirates NBD. We’re learning that the more customers use Copilot, the more their enthusiasm for Copilot grows. Soon, no one will want to work without it.
Microsoft 365 Copilot: Thousands of skills. All your data. Infinite possibilities. Learn more here.

Search with images — not just words — using Visual Search in Chat
In addition to unlocking the power of generative AI to people at work, we continue to deliver new features and experiences in Bing Chat to help people make the most of this technology. Part of this work is a focus on building visual features in Bing Chat. And today we’re pleased to announce we’re rolling out multimodal capabilities via Visual Search in Chat.
Leveraging OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, Visual Search in Chat lets anyone upload images and search the web for related content. Take a picture, or use one you find elsewhere, and prompt Bing to tell you about it — Bing can understand the context of an image, interpret it, and answer questions about it. Whether you’re traveling to a new city on vacation and asking about the architecture of a particular building or at home trying to come up with lunch ideas based on the contents of your fridge, upload the image into Bing Chat and use it to harness the web’s knowledge to get you answers. Visual Search in Chat is beginning to roll out now via desktop and the Bing mobile app and we are working to bring this to Bing Chat Enterprise over time.

[+] with a rapidly changing job market.getty
Results from a new survey suggest that college graduates are worried about the impact that the rapid emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT will have on their employability.


And employers also acknowledge that the hiring landscape is being changed quickly by the new technology, leading them to look for new hires that can combine so called “soft skills” like emotional intelligence, negotiation, and communication with the ability to work with the assistance of artificial intelligence.

The findings are featured in the Cengage Group’s 2023 Graduate Employability Report, based on two surveys conducted by the online platform Pollfish in June 2023.

PROMOTED



The graduate survey targeted 1,000 U.S. men and women between the ages of 18 and 65 who had completed an education program (i.e., associate, bachelor’s or graduate degree or vocational training or certification) for their perspectives on their recent experience seeking employment.
The employer survey asked 1,000 U.S. men and women between the ages of 18 and 65 with hiring responsibilities within their organization about their views on determining a candidate’s fitness for a specific role.


Key Finding For Graduates
More than half of the graduates (52%) said the growth of AI makes them question how prepared they are for today’s workforce. They were split about whether they believed their job will be replaced by AI - 46% felt threatened by the new technology, while 55% said their job could never be replaced by AI.

Six in 10 graduates (61%) said they will need to develop or strengthen their digital skills due to AI, and 65% said they were eager for more training on working with AI.
Only 41% of graduates said their program taught them skills needed for their first job, a substantial drop from the 63% who said that in 2022. When it came to the skills they believed were lacking, about a quarter pointed to soft skills instruction. More than half of graduates (58%) said employers needed to work more closely with colleges and other learning programs to develop educational courses or programs that teach students the skills they’ll need in the workplace upon graduation.

Although internships, externships and apprenticeship programs are ideal workplace experiences to help equip students with these skills, fewer than half of grads (47%) said they participated in such programs in this year’s survey, compared with 63% who did so in 2022. Of those who did participate in one of those experiences, more than a third (35%) reported they did not receive any guidance from their school in finding one.

Half of all graduates (49%) say their educational institution should be held accountable for placing them in jobs upon graduation, with graduates of degree programs more likely than non-degree grads to want their institution to be held accountable for employment connections.
Reflecting the ongoing shifts in how employers view entry-level graduates, graduates are becoming less convinced that a college degree is the best signal to employers of the skills they possess, with only 23% believing a degree is the best indicator in 2023, down from 32% in 2022.
On the other hand, the loosening of degree requirements may also be why grads are feeling more confident and qualified to apply for entry-level jobs. Only 33% felt underqualified to apply for entry-level roles in 2023, while 49% and 50% felt underqualified in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Key Finding for Employers
AI is also affecting employers’ hiring plans. More than half (57%) of employers said certain entry-level jobs – or even entire teams - could be replaced by AI, and 68% believed that many employees will need to reskill or upskill in the next three to five years because of emerging technology.
Nearly three in five employers (59%) reported that the growth of AI had caused them to prioritize different skills when hiring, and 66% said they are now looking for “uniquely human” skills in prospective employees and that previous job experience will become more important in hiring decisions.
Employers strongly agreed (79%) that employees could benefit from training on working alongside AI and other new technologies in their current roles. Additionally, 68% say many of their employees will need to learn new skills in the next three to five years – either to stay up-to-date for their existing role or a new one for those that emerging technologies are likely to make obsolete.
The search for talent remains a challenge. Half of employers (53%) reported still struggling to hire talent in 2023, which was an improvement from 2022 when 65% reported they were having difficulty. As a result of this challenge, almost half of employers (48%) said they are willing to hire individuals who they know will need later upskilling on the job.
A college degree is becoming less important.  Only 50% of today’s employers require a 2- or 4-year degree for entry-level jobs, compared to 62% who did so in 2022. More employers in 2023 say they require a skills training credential (33%) compared to 26% who said that in 2022, which also coincides with what grads say - they are seeing more job openings with no degree requirements.
Commenting on the implications of the survey in a news release, Michael Hansen, CEO of Cengage Group, said, “the workplace has changed rapidly in the last few years, and now we are witnessing a new shift as AI begins to reshape worker productivity, job requirements, hiring habits and even entire industries. With new technology comes both new uncertainties and new opportunities for the workforce, and educators and employers must do more to prepare today’s workers for these technological skills.”

Half of graduates feel threatened by AI (46%) and question their workforce readiness (52%)
59% of employers say AI has caused them to prioritize different skills when hiring, including ""uniquely human"" skills
Half of employers have dropped degree requirements for entry-level roles
BOSTON, July 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The job landscape has been completely transformed. In response to workplace transitions like The Great Resignation, Quiet Quitting and now the rise and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), employer hiring habits continue to evolve with 50% of employers now admitting they've dropped 2- and 4-year degree requirements for entry-level positions (a 32% increase over 2022) and started prioritizing softer skills and previous job experience (66%).


Continue Reading

















Data from the 2023 Cengage Group Employability Survey tracks opinions on key workforce trends among recent graduates and employers.







And while these shifts signal a move toward skills-based hiring (over degree-based hiring), it also introduces new uncertainties for graduates.

According to Cengage Group's 2023 Employability Report – the third annual report surveying 1,000 graduates who completed a degree or non-degree program in the last 12 months and 1,000 U.S. hiring decisionmakers – the growth of emerging technologies, like generative AI, have a third of grads second-guessing their career choice. Additionally, more than half (52%) of graduates say competition from AI has them questioning how prepared they are for the workforce.
""The workplace has changed rapidly in the last few years, and now we are witnessing a new shift as AI begins to reshape worker productivity, job requirements, hiring habits and even entire industries,"" said Michael Hansen, CEO of Cengage Group. ""With new technology comes both new uncertainties and new opportunities for the workforce, and educators and employers must do more to prepare today's workers for these technological shifts.""Data shows that educators still have work to do in preparing graduates. Just 41% of grads said their program taught them skills needed for their first job – down from 63% who said the same in 2022. Recent graduates report they are not getting enough preparation to develop ""soft skills,"" something employers say they will prioritize more with the growth of AI. Nearly 3 in 5 grads (58%) believe closer alignment between employers and learning institutions would help them develop important workplace skills.Additional findings include:
The struggle for talent is still very real and has forced employers to do things differently. Half of employers (53%) struggle to find talent (down from 65% in 2022), which has improved their willingness to interview candidates with experience but no degree (66%; up from 53% in 2022). Additionally, employers are more open to upskilling with nearly half of employers (48%) admitting they will hire talent with some but not all the skills needed for a role and upskill them, and 17% open to finding and upskilling talent from within the company.
Dropping degree requirements has increased grad confidence. With half of employers dropping degree requirements on entry-level job listings, grads are more confidently applying to jobs with 3 in 5 (61%) employers seeing an uptick in non-degree applicants. In fact, recent degree and non-degree graduates are feeling more confident regarding their qualifications to apply for entry-level jobs, with only one-third (33%) stating they felt underqualified, down significantly from the last two years in which roughly half of graduates felt underqualified.
There's still work to be done to connect education to the workforce. Half of all graduates (49%) say their educational institution should be held accountable for placing them in jobs upon graduation, however fewer graduates gained important workforce experience before graduating. Less than half of graduates (47%) participated in an internship, externship or apprenticeship this year, compared with 63% in 2022. Of those graduates who did, more than a third (35%) did not receive any guidance from their school in finding the opportunity.
The ""Great Reskilling"" is coming as employer priorities shift. With more than half of employers (57%) saying certain entry level jobs, teams and skills could be replaced by AI, they are calling for employees to upskill. More than two-thirds of employers (68%) say many of their employees will need to reskill or upskill in the next 3-5 years because of emerging technology and grads agree – 3 in 5 (61%) say they will need to develop or strengthen their digital skills due to AI. The good news for employers: graduates (65%) recognize that and say they need more training in working alongside new technology.
""No part of the workforce is immune to the changes AI will bring. Many workers will need to develop new skills to work alongside new technology or perhaps even find new careers as a result of AI disruption. As we collectively navigate these changes, we are laser-focused on helping people develop in demand skills and connect to sustainable employment,"" said Hansen.For more information on the 2023 Cengage Group Graduate Employability Report, click here.

Technology enables inference of subjective outcomes from routinely collected data
PALO ALTO, Calif., July 19, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Verantos today announced two peer-reviewed publications on high-quality real-world data for migraine. The manuscripts describe the use of artificial intelligence (AI) on medical records to enable access to valuable clinical information such as headache severity, comorbid depression, associated symptoms, and a composite migraine impact score.
These soft outcomes — subjective aspects of a medical condition or its management — are poorly and inconsistently captured during the course of routine care, but generation of useful real-world evidence often requires understanding them.
Migraine impacts more than a billion people globally every year, particularly women and young adults. Migraine is linked to various comorbidities, including stress, sleep disorders, and suicidal ideation.
""Breakthroughs in AI applied to rich clinical data enable life sciences organizations to understand real-world migraine care at a level that has not previously been possible,"" said Dan Riskin, M.D., CEO of Verantos. ""High-quality data and high-validity evidence can enable better collaboration with providers, payers, and regulators to refine the standard of care and benefit patients.""
By applying AI to medical records including clinical narrative data, it is possible to build and validate models of soft outcomes. In its highest form, a system can accurately develop an outcome score quantifying migraine severity at a point in time.
""Using artificial intelligence to identify patients with migraine and associated symptoms and conditions within electronic health records"" was published in BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making. This manuscript demonstrates how detailed patient characteristics (phenotype) can be identified using unstructured EHR data and AI. ""Development and validation of a novel model for characterizing migraine outcomes within real-world data"" was published in The Journal of Headache and Pain. This groundbreaking work builds on phenotyping to develop and validate a model of migraine outcomes that uses information typically available in routinely collected data.
Verantos' Migraine Pragmatic Registry applies the technology and methodology from these publications and is available today.
About Verantos
Verantos is the global leader in high-validity real-world evidence for life sciences organizations. By incorporating robust clinical narrative data and artificial intelligence technology, Verantos is the first company to generate high-validity evidence at scale across therapeutic areas with measured accuracy, completeness, and traceability. Credible evidence accelerates clinical development, market access, pharmacovigilance, and regulatory initiatives.

Legal work, well known for its long hours and heavy workloads, is being revolutionized by artificial intelligence — specifically generative AI, which is one of the most transformative technological advancements in recent history. 
A 2023 study by researchers at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University found that “legal services” is among the industries most exposed to occupational change from generative AI. Another report, published in 2023 by economists at Goldman Sachs, estimated that 44 percent of legal work could be automated by emerging AI tools.
AI in the Legal IndustryArtificial intelligence improves the efficiency of legal work by way of automation. The technology can be used to assist in legal research, perform contract analysis and even generate contracts, agreements and other legal documents.

AI tools can now handle the endless reading, summarizing, creating and filing of documents ordinarily relegated to junior attorneys or paralegals. And even if it doesn’t replace lawyers entirely, the emergence of generative AI stands to radically alter the nature of practicing law, as well as its business model.
“It’s going to have an impact. We’re already starting to see that,” Pablo Arredondo, co-founder and chief innovation officer at legal AI company Casetext, told Built In. “How exactly it plays out remains to be seen. There’s a lot of choices we all have to make as a profession that’s going to help dictate that.”
More on the Intersection of AI and WorkWhy an Automated Future Won’t Be a Jobless One 
How Is AI Used in the Legal Industry?
Legal work has been identified as a ripe target for AI disruption many times before, with warnings of artificial intelligence ousting lawyers dating as far back as 2011. But over the years, this technology has served more as an aide to lawyers rather than a replacement. Here’s some of the ways AI is being used in the legal industry.
 
Paperwork Automation
Large language models, or the underlying system of platforms like ChatGPT, are now capable of reading, analyzing and summarizing large swaths of text, and allows users to quickly sort and classify words in lengthy documents. This helps automate the bulk of paperwork lawyers, paralegals and other professionals in the industry ordinarily spend their time doing.
GPT-4, the large language model serving as the backbone of ChatGPT and several other generative AI systems, also managed to score in the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam. These results push the boundaries on not only what AI is capable of doing on its own, but what it can enable in the legal world.
“Passing the bar exam is a great illustration of some of [GPT-4’s] power and nuance, especially the fact that it could generate essays. It was sort of a vivid illustration of the progress,” Arredondo, who co-authored the GPT-4 study, said. “What really matters is attorneys can use this in their day-to-day work and get better outcomes for their clients.”
Law-focused AI software like Casetext, Latch, Harvey and others have taken GPT-4 and other language models and fine-tuned them for their specific kind of legal work. They can help lawyers research relevant case law, statutes, regulations and legal opinions, sifting through thousands of pages in a matter of minutes to not only find documents, but summarize them and highlight important passages.

E-Discovery 
In the same way AI can efficiently sort and organize paperwork, these methods can be applied to facilitate e-discovery tasks. E-discovery, short for electronic discovery, is the legal procedure of searching for and retrieving case evidence from digital formats like email, database or social media documents. By using AI tools, legal professionals can search for specific words, phrases or other written evidence within multiple data sources and digital documents at once. This ultimately speeds up the e-discovery and legal processes, plus helps catch pieces of information that may otherwise be missed through manual searches.
 
Contract Analysis and Document Generation
AI tools can also help with contract analysis (a fundamental part of the legal profession), where they review contracts and provide insights into potential risks or compliance issues. Some can even generate legal documents themselves, a process in which a lawyer inputs specific requirements or key details into the tool and the system generates a preliminary draft, which can then be reviewed and refined by human professionals.

“Generative AI deals in the stock and trade of lawyers, which is words.”

“Generative AI deals in the stock and trade of lawyers, which is words,” Ben Allgrove, an attorney and chief innovation officer at international law firm Baker McKenzie, told Built In. He predicts AI will cause a “reshuffling” of the legal industry, where the use of generative AI will be an expectation, not an experiment. 
“I think it would be negligent or unprofessional for any lawyer not to investigate how they can use technologies and advances to deliver a better product,” he added, “in the same way that if a lawyer didn’t use an electronic database to search for cases would be negligent.”
In some instances, this investigation has already begun. Several prominent law firms, as well as legal departments within major companies, are putting this technology to the test. 
In February 2023, international law firm Allen & Overy entered into an exclusive partnership with a tool called Harvey, which provides thousands of the firm’s attorneys with assistance in legal research, drafting documents and contract analysis. LexisNexis, a long-time data and analytics provider in the legal industry, announced in May 2023 that it created a new generative AI platform using GPT technology and teamed up with some of the biggest law firms in the United States, including Baker McKenzie, Foley & Lardner and Reed Smith. And several Fortune 50 companies, like Microsoft and Ford Motor, as well as top law firms like DLA Piper and Kirkland & Ellis, have tested a tool created by Casetext called CoCounsel.
This software isn’t doing anything that attorneys or paralegals can’t do themselves. It’s just able to do it faster and more efficiently than any human is physically capable of doing it — posing both time and cost-saving potential. 
“There has been a lot of waste in law, and there’s a lot of room for efficiency,” José Padilla, a corporate attorney and founder of legal AI company LegalMente, told Built In. “AI will definitely help in that.”
Related ReadingWhat Does It Mean to ‘Work With AI’? 
Will AI Replace Lawyers?
Despite AI’s offerings, it is unlikely that these tools will outright replace human attorneys — at least not right now. Providing legal advice is more than just predicting words, which is all generative AI is capable of at the moment. And beyond all the reading and rote memorization, practicing law well requires a lot of uniquely human skills.
“Being a lawyer is more than just fulfilling a task,” Allgrove said. “It’s not the law that gets the deal across the line, it’s the negotiating skills. It’s the ability to read the person on the other side of the table.” As of today, AI can’t do that.
A much more likely outcome of this generative AI revolution is a change in the business of law — namely, the billable hour, which remains the dominant business model in legal work. 
“Ultimately, it breaks the billable-hour model,” Allgrove said. “Once you get into a world where your law firms are needing to invest larger and larger in the technology to provide the product at the end of the day — not the time — then we’re going to have to find different models which enable us to get a return on our capital and our effort that is fair and that’s not based on charging for time.”

“Ultimately, [AI] breaks the billable-hour model.”

That being said, if AI was to do away with anyone, it would likely be the people working on what Hamid Kohan, CEO of legal AI company Legal Soft, calls “transactional law.” That includes tax resolution, immigration and estate planning — the sort of stuff that doesn’t require a lot of litigation. It mainly involves finding correct documents and filing paperwork, which a machine can do now for a much lower price than a human attorney.
It could also replace the “junior attorney drudgery,” Padilla said, like reading and summarizing thousands of pages of text. But these tools will likely always require a human eye.
“I think there’s always a role for a lawyer,” Padilla added. “Legal expertise is more than just what AI can offer, which is just kind of brute force legal knowledge. There needs to be expertise on top of that knowledge.”
 
Can AI Give Legal Advice?
Maybe AI won’t replace all lawyers outright. But can it still provide sound legal advice? At the moment, the answer is “not really.”
“It can approximate, and it can be very convincing,” Allgrove said. “But I have failed to see any system which can accurately apply law to a fact pattern in order to provide legal advice.”
In practice, giving reliable and accurate legal advice requires a lot of knowledge of the law, but also a nuanced understanding of the context in which the law exists, Padilla said. “As attorneys, we’re regulating human behavior. Because of that, human behavior and human interaction is a lot of what we’re about. Sometimes the legal answer is not the right answer, sometimes there’s a way to solve the problem of human interaction without the cold hand of the law.”
AI doesn’t understand that nuance, and could draw conclusions that may not produce the best result for a client.
“In law, there are a lot of gray lines. And you’ve got to make sure that the AI understands all the gray areas of the law. …It does not,” Kohan, who’s also author of How to Scale Your Stupid AI Law Firm, said. “It makes mistakes, and when you’re dealing with human lives like that you can’t make mistakes.”

Indeed, the propensity of AI to make up information — a phenomenon experts call “hallucinating” — is perhaps this technology’s biggest hurdle towards full adoption in the legal industry, a profession that hinges on finding and weighing facts.
This was made clear in 2023, when a New York attorney got in hot water for using ChatGPT to do legal research for a personal injury case. He crafted a 10-page brief, citing more than half a dozen previous court decisions. All of them turned out to be completely fabricated by the chatbot. The attorney was sanctioned by a federal judge and fined $5,000, along with a colleague.
The incident, which arose out of an otherwise obscure, run-of-the-mill lawsuit, captured the attention of both the tech world and the legal world — serving as a sort of punchline and cautionary tale of the dangers of artificial intelligence. Since then, a handful of federal judges have issued orders requiring lawyers to disclose when they’ve used generative AI to create legal documents.
Still, law firms and legal departments around the world are continuing to take advantage of a growing number of software to keep up with the demands of case management, research and the drafting of legal documents.
More on Generative AI5 Ways to Lessen the Risk of Generative AI 
Legal AI Tools
There are lots of legal AI tools on the market today. Some are meant to help attorneys streamline their research tasks and draft documents, others are designed to cut out the need for attorneys altogether. And many of them have been growing fast over the last couple years.
 
Harvey
Harvey uses a combination of data analytics, machine learning and natural language processing to automate various aspects of practicing law, including contract analysis, regulatory compliance, due diligence and litigation. The platform is built on top of GPT-4, OpenAI’s large language model, which was then enhanced for legal work. In fact, OpenAI’s Startup Fund was among several big name investors to back Harvey with a $21 million Series A round in April 2023.
Founded in 2022, Harvey has already made inroads at a couple of major firms. The company entered a “strategic alliance” with accounting giant PwC in March 2023, and entered an exclusive launch partnership with international law firm Allen & Overy in February 2023. A&O is reportedly the seventh largest law firm in the world, and has made Harvey available to some 3,500 of its lawyers across 43 offices. The technology promises to be a “game-changer” for not just the firm, but for the entire legal industry, according to David Wakeling, head of A&O’s markets innovation group.
 
DoNotPay
DoNotPay first launched in 2015 as “the world’s first robot lawyer,” initially generating the text users need to file complaints and cancel subscriptions. Over the years, the company has expanded its services, using artificial intelligence to help people register a trademark, file a police report and even sue people. In 2022, it also rolled out a chatbot that can help users negotiate bills using GPT-3 — the same large language model first used by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — engaging in back-and-forth conversations with various companies through live, text-based chats.
In 2023, DoNotPay made headlines for its plan to use its chatbot to help a person fight a speeding ticket directly in a physical courtroom. According to the company’s CEO and co-founder Joshua Browder, the intent was to have the AI “listen” to the case and then generate responses using GPT-3. The client would then hear those responses through a pair of AirPods and repeat them verbatim to the presiding judge.
The scheme received a lot of buzz — and a lot of flak, including from state bar prosecutors, Browder said in a tweet, which prompted him to “postpone” the court case amid alleged threats of jail time. The company is also facing a proposed class action lawsuit that claims the site offers “substandard legal documents” and provides “unauthorized legal services.”
 
Latch
Latch uses GPT-4 to simplify the contact review and redlining process for lawyers. It offers case management, time tracking, billing, and client communication tools, too. The software is a Microsoft Word add-in, meaning lawyers can use Latch directly from within Microsoft Word. And it integrates with various cloud storage services, making it easy for law firms to centralize their data and collaborate with each other on cases.
Latch launched in April 2023, and in just one month the startup had a wait list of more than 80 companies, co-founder Min-Kyu Jung told the Wall Street Journal. Now companies can get partial access to it within a day of signing an agreement with the startup.
 
Frequently Asked QuestionsHow is AI being used in the legal industry?Artificial intelligence is used by law firms and attorneys to assist in legal research, perform contract analysis and generate contracts, agreements and other legal documents.

Can AI give legal advice?No. At the moment, AI does not have the institutional expertise, judgment or critical thinking skills to offer sound legal advice with any reliability.

Can AI replace attorneys?While AI may replace certain aspects of the legal industry, it is unlikely it will replace all attorneys any time soon. There remain quite a few unresolved issues with AI, including data privacy and client confidentiality concerns, as well as its propensity for making up information. As such, AI is not secure enough or reliable enough to replace human attorneys.

By: Mike Vizard on July 18, 2023 At its .conf23 conference, Splunk today revealed it added a slew of capabilities to its portfolio of operational analytics tools, including an assistant that leverages generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that use large language models (LLMs) the company developed to enable IT teams to use natural language to invoke the Splunk Processing Language (SPL).In addition, Splunk is also previewing OpenTelemetry Collector, an add-on that uses open source agent software being developed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to capture metrics and traces. It is designed to enable IT teams to use OpenTelemetry alongside existing agent software that Splunk uses to capture metrics.Tom Casey, senior vice president for products and technology at Splunk, said the domain-specific LLMs that the company created enable Splunk Assistant to write or explain customized SPL queries in a way that augments rather than replaces the need for IT professionals. Splunk Assistant is designed to surface recommendations to optimize IT environments to reduce toil rather than automate entire processes, he noted.



Splunk is adding other tools infused with machine learning algorithms to its portfolio. These include the Splunk App for Anomaly Detection and an Outlier Exclusion for Adaptive Thresholding to detect and omit abnormal data points that has been added to version 4.17 of the Splunk IT Service Intelligence platform.In addition, Splunk is previewing an ML-Assisted Thresholding tool for Splunk IT Service that uses historical data and patterns to create dynamic thresholds with a single click.

The company is making available a 5.4 update to the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) 5.4 and a Splunk App for Data Science and Deep Learning (DSDL) 5.1 toolkit that provides access to additional data science tools that can extend MLTK to enable organizations to build their own custom LLMs and AI assistants.Finally, Splunk added Unified Identity to make it simpler to access Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Observability Cloud along with an update to Splunk Cloud Platform and Splunk Enterprise that make it simpler to ingest, route, search and export data.It’s still early days as far as the application of generative AI is concerned, but it’s already clear that the way IT is managed is about to be transformed. Coupled with tools such as OpenTelemetry that make it less expensive to collect massive amounts of data, the opportunity to train LLMs that streamline a wide range of processes is immense. Those capabilities won’t replace the need for humans to manage those processes, but they will most certainly cause staff realignments as many manual tasks become increasingly automated.In fact, it’s hard to imagine an IT team that would not want to take advantage of AI capabilities to simplify the management of complex IT environments that now function at a level of scale that few IT professionals can successfully manage on their own. One way or another, AI is going to be broadly applied to IT workflows. The only thing left to be seen now is the ultimate impact.

Statistics from Forbes gathered from 600 business owners reveal the following ways that companies are using or plan to use AI to improve the customer experience:

Chatbots for instant messaging: 73%
Composing emails: 61%
Product recommendations and other personalized services: 55%
Composing text messages: 49%
Personalized advertising: 46%
Long-form written content for websites, etc.:42%
Phone calls: 36%

56% of these business owners say they already use or plan to use AI for customer service.
Other top uses are cybersecurity and fraud management, digital personal assistants, and customer relationship management, coming in at 51%, 47%, and 46%, respectively. 
We are already seeing surprising use cases outside of the technology and marketing space:

The University of British Columbia and BC Cancer researchers have developed AI that predicts cancer survival with 80% accuracy by reading doctor’s notes.
According to an article published in Nature, a revolutionary AI tool can now predict the structures of 200 million proteins. Stored on a 23-terabyte database, this information could offer new possibilities for the development of drugs, which are mostly based on these protein structures.
Oxford University scientists have developed an AI that can lip-read with 400% greater accuracy than a human lip-reader.
Emotion AI, which uses natural language processing (NLP) to detect human emotions in text, could soon be used in healthcare apps to help doctors assess and monitor the emotional state of patients, especially those with neurodiverse conditions. It could also be used to offer mental health assessments and diagnose conditions, Neuroscience News reports.

How is AI Affecting Jobs and Workers?
According to Deloitte’s State of AI in the Enterprise survey, 82% of business leaders believe that AI enhances job satisfaction and performance. 
At the same time, 47% say the use of AI technology creates fear or concern.
Marketsandmarkets predicts that by 2030, AI will have reached human-level sophistication and, therefore, could be threatening many more jobs than at present.
However, Americans seem quite attuned to this risk already. In a study by Pew Research Center, “Loss of human jobs” was cited as the top reason for people feeling more concerned than excited about the growth of AI.
Younger people are more optimistic about AI in the workplace, though. 
According to data published on Statista, 42% of Americans aged 18-44 believe that AI will create many more jobs, compared to just 6% of those aged 45 and over. In fact, 48% of those in the older age group believe that AI will result in many fewer jobs for people, while only 18% of the younger age group hold this view.
Do Americans think artificial intelligence will lead to there being more jobs for people or fewer jobs?

A study published by Goldman Sachs in April 2023 predicts that AI systems will significantly increase AI jobs globally, with the potential to replace 300 million full-time roles. 
The study also noted that two-thirds of US occupations are vulnerable to AI to some degree.
The professions most at risk of automation in the US, according to the proportion of tasks that could be automated, are:

Office and administrative support: 46%
Legal work: 44% 
Architecture and engineering: 37%
Life, physical, and social sciences: 36%
Business and financial operations: 35%

Economists estimate that 60% of the current workforce is employed in jobs that didn’t exist 80 years ago. 
This equates to 85% of employment growth coming from positions created around new technology.
The AI Index 2023 Annual Report by Stanford University found that in 2022, 2.05% of US job postings required some kind of AI skill. 
This may not sound like a lot, but it’s a number that has been climbing steadily for the past few years. Canada was in second place with 1.45% of jobs requiring AI skills, and Spain came third with 1.33%. The researchers noted that in all the countries they studied, the percentage of jobs requiring AI skills had increased since 2014.

The US is not the market with the highest AI skill penetration rate. 
That crown goes to India, with a rate of 3.23, 45% higher than the US, which takes second place.

What Jobs Require AI Skills? 
The McKinsey Global Survey on AI sheds some light on this.
Software engineers came out top, with 39% of companies saying they had recruited for this position in relation to AI. Data engineers and AI data scientists came next, with 35% and 33%, respectively.
There is some hope for people without an engineering background, though, as design specialists and translators both made it into the top 10.

When it comes to specific AI skills, Python – a widely used programming language – is mentioned in 37% of AI job postings in the US, of which there were almost 800,000 in 2022, Visual Capitalist reports. 
Two other languages make the top 10: SQL is mentioned in 23% of job posts, and Java – in 17%. Computer science, data analysis, and data science also feature prominently, being cited in 33%, 20%, and 20% of jobs, respectively.
It’s no surprise that the state responsible for the most AI jobs is California, taking 17.9% of the share across the US. 
This is more than double second-place Texas, with 8.4%. However, with some companies relocating to Texas to take advantage of lower taxes and operating costs, this gap is showing signs of closing.
Artificial Intelligence and Business Stats
How much is all this AI going to cost to implement? And, just as importantly, how much are companies going to save by using it?
Industrial companies that embrace AI technology are already seeing significant cost and time savings. 
A 2022 Accenture report detailed that certain companies using AI for product design, development, and production were saving 30 times more than others through better leveraging of technologies such as automated guided vehicles and predictive supply chain management.
Cost savings and efficiencies are the top benefits for companies using AI, with 54% of organizations citing this in a 2022 IBM survey. Improvements in IT or network performance came a close second with 53%, while better customer experience took third place with 48%. 
Netflix famously reported that their AI-powered personalized recommendation system was saving them $1 billion a year. 
This is largely due to the fact that viewers engage more with personal recommendations compared to generic ‘popular’ ones. This increased engagement helps them retain satisfied customers, decrease cancelations, and plan future in-house productions. That was back in 2015, so the use and impact of AI can only have increased and improved. 
A study conducted by Harvard Business Review found that companies that pioneered the use of AI in sales reported impressive results. These included cost savings of 40-60%, call times reduced by 60%–70%, and a 50% increase in leads and sales.
The industries that are set to gain the most from AI systems are those that have conventionally been labor-intensive or capital-intensive.
A report from Accenture lists the share-of-profit increase per industry by 2035, comparing the baseline without AI to the expected profit with AI in place. The sectors that come out on top are:

Education: 84%
Accommodation and food services: 74%
Construction: 71%
Wholesale and retail: 59%
Healthcare: 55%
Agriculture, forestry, and fishing: 53%


There have also been great successes with AI-enabled supply-chain management. Early adopters of this technology saved 15% on logistics costs while increasing inventory by 35% and service levels by 65% compared to their competitors, McKinsey reports.
McKinsey also reported one of the most dramatic use cases of AI back in 2017, when Amazon acquired Kiva, a robotics company that automates warehouse picking and packing. The result was that Amazon’s click-to-ship cycle, which typically took 60-75 minutes with humans, dropped to an astounding 15 minutes with robots. Alongside this, inventory capacity increased by 50% while operating costs fell by 20%.
Despite all these positive findings, a significant number of companies still see cost as a barrier to implementing AI solutions. IBM reports that 29% of businesses are putting off adopting AI because of the price. This is second only to a lack of AI skills or expertise, which 34% reported as a hindrance.
A cost model built by Dylan Patel and Afzal Ahmad for Semianalysis estimated that ChatGPT costs around $700,000 per day to run. 
That’s equivalent to about $0.36 per query, based on figures from February 2023, when the research was published. Since then, ChatGPT has upgraded from OpenAI’s GPT-3 to GPT-4, which requires considerably more computational power. The actual cost today may therefore be much higher.
There is also the environmental cost to consider. A paper from the University of Massachusetts Amherst found that training a single deep-learning algorithm could emit 313 tons of CO2. That’s five times more than the average car emits in its lifetime.
Statistics about the Risks of Using AI in the Workplace
The Stanford University report looked at the risk of gender and racial bias when using AI technology.
Images generated with DALL-E 2 portrayed 97% of people in positions of authority (such as CEO and Director) as white men, despite the fact that these roles are occupied by 29.1% and 39.6% women, respectively.
This research also found that certain adjectives like “unreasonable”, “stubborn”, and “intellectual” were generally associated with men, whereas “compassionate”, “sensitive”, and “emotional” were more often linked with women.
This presents concerning risks if AI technology starts to be used for things like creating job profiles before the bias has been neutralized. However, this may be an uphill struggle as the models are typically trained on real-world data that inherently contain these biases.
Businesses seem quite aware of the risks that AI technology presents in their companies. According to the Stanford report, these are the top risks from adopting AI that organizations consider relevant in 2022:

Cybersecurity: 59%
Regulatory compliance: 45%
Personal/individual privacy: 40%
Explainability: 37%
Organizational reputation: 32%
Equity and fairness: 30%
Workforce/labor displacement: 28%
Physical safety: 20%
National security: 13%
Political stability: 9%

However, the report noted that “there are meaningful gaps between the risks organizations cite as relevant and those which organizations have taken steps to mitigate”.
Further to this, an IBM study found that 74% of organizations already using AI have not taken any steps to reduce unintended bias in their AI systems. 60% have not yet developed policies about the ethical use of AI in their workplace.
A survey by Forbes revealed some additional concerns that business owners have about the impact of AI:

43% are worried about becoming dependent on AI tech
33% are concerned about the potential reduction of the workforce
31% have privacy concerns
30% are apprehensive about AI providing the business or its customers with misinformation
28% are concerned about bias errors
24% believe it will reduce traffic to their websites

Uses for Artificial Intelligence Statistics
Let’s take a look at some statistics surrounding the use of artificial intelligence in our homes and everyday lives.
57% of Americans are excited about AI replacing household chores, according to Pew Research Center. 40% say the same about AI diagnosing medical conditions, and 9% are excited about AI helping them make important life decisions.

In another survey conducted by Forbes, the top uses for AI were cited as:

Responding to people via text or email: 45%
Answering financial questions: 43%
Planning a travel itinerary: 38%
Crafting an email: 31%
Preparing for a job interview: 30%
Writing a social media post: 25%
Summarizing complex or lengthy copy: 19% 

Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, seem to be one example of AI technology where consumer sentiment lags behind. The driverless car market is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 13.3%, from 20.3 million units in 2021 to 62.4 million units in 2030.
Road accidents caused 38,680 fatalities in the US in 2020, and there are approximately 1.2 million road deaths globally. According to an article published in The Atlantic, by the middle of the century, driverless cars could reduce these fatalities by 90%. This is equivalent to over 30,000 lives a year saved in the US alone.
However, Americans seem reluctant to adopt this technology. Pew Research Center conducted a survey which found that only 26% of Americans believe that the widespread use of autonomous vehicles would be good for society. This is compared to 44% who believe it is a bad idea.
Out of the main digital assistants, Google Assistant has been shown to be the most accurate at responding to queries. Data published on Statista shows that Google Assistant has 93% accuracy overall, compared to 83% for Siri and 80% for Alexa. The only category in which Siri outperformed Google Assistant was with voice commands for phone-related functions.
AI tech has been all over the news since the start of the decade. Here are some of the top AI statistics that have made the headlines:

Microsoft Bing surpassed 100 million daily users in March 2023, spurred along by its addition of an AI chatbot to its search function.
ChatGPT-4 passed the bar exam with a score that surpasses 7% of human test-takers and exceeds the passing threshold, according to research published on SSRN in March 2023.
There are around 1.8 billion visits per month to chat.openai.com, the website where ChatGPT is accessed, according to Similarweb. That’s around 60 million visits per day.
The US is the top user of ChatGPT’s generative AI tool. 12% of these visits are from the US, 8% are from India, and 4% are from Japan.
While ChatGPT is booming, one of the original AI writing tools, Jarvis (previously Jasper) is taking a hit. Traffic to the site dropped by 67% between April and June 2023, from 71.6K users/month to 23.7K.
Over half (52%) of UK adults have heard of generative AI, and over a quarter (26%) have used it themselves, according to research published in July 2023 by Deloitte.
After 10 years working for Google, computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton resigned from his role in May 2023 and warned the public of the “existential risk” that AI systems pose to mankind.

FAQs
What is artificial intelligence vs machine learning? 
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are related concepts but have distinct meanings. Artificial intelligence refers to the broader field of developing intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI aims to create systems that can reason, learn, perceive, understand, and make decisions similar to or better than humans. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. ML involves training a model on a large dataset to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions based on the learned patterns. 

Who invented AI? 
There is no one person responsible for developing AI. It has a complex history that began in the 1950s, and numerous scientists, engineers, and researchers have contributed to bringing it to its current form. John McCarthy, Alan Turing, Allen Newell, Marvin Minsky, and Herbert A. Simon were all instrumental in forming the foundations of what we now know as the field of AI.

What percentage of the population uses AI? 
The answer is that almost everyone with a mobile phone uses AI, although they may not realize it. For instance, IDAP states that 97% of mobile users have AI-powered voice assistants such as Siri activated.

How many lives are saved by AI? 
It is difficult to estimate the number of lives saved by AI, partly because there are so many ways in which this can be achieved and partly because the number is increasing all the time. One significant way that AI can save lives is through wearable devices. According to MedTech Europe, AI could be saving between 380,000 and 403,000 lives each year in Europe alone. This is predominantly through wearable devices (up to 313,000 lives), followed by use in monitoring (42,000) and imaging (41,000).

Can AI fully replace humans? 
It is almost certain that AI will never fully replace humans. Although many human jobs may be lost to AI systems, others will be augmented and created in the process. While people may become more reliant on AI to help them make life decisions and carry out routine tasks, we will always retain the ability to think critically and react to complex situations using our own intuition.

(Allison Zaucha for The Washington Post)By  Pranshu VermaJuly 19, 2023 at 4:58 p.m. EDTWhen Steven Rigsby was working as a background actor on a movie set in Atlanta in the summer of 2018, he became a digital clone.The film crew ushered him into a small black tent, where he stood on a tiny podium as cameras scanned his entire body. In just a minute, they had built his duplicate.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeAs dozens of extras waited in line for scans, Rigsby said he heard the crew talk about using the scans to add more people into a scene.“It felt a little bit disorienting,” he said. “All I could think about was how many extras they weren’t paying in order to do that.”For years, Hollywood’s biggest productions have relied on artificial intelligence along with sophisticated graphic design software for cinematic effect — it de-ages movie stars, creates realistic cartoon heroes and allows directors to tweak performances without reshooting. Body scanning technology, in particular, has been a boon for productions flush out big crowds. “Game of Thrones” and the Lord of the Rings franchise used AI to create imposing 10,000 strong armies. When the pandemic limited on-set actors, Apple TV’s “Ted Lasso” used digital software to fill out the fans in the soccer stadium.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut advancements in generative AI, a technology that can create audio, works and images, now allow companies to do more than create an invading throng: it can replicate faces and voices with eerie precision. And digital cloning has become a central tension between actors and studio executives as they face off in a strike that’s halted Hollywood.🎥Follow MoviesFollowThe quickly improving technology provides studio executives a tantalizing way to save costs and time when making movies without compromising quality, media analysts say. But actors worry that without limits, the tools could eventually chip away at their shoot days or put them out of work entirely.For Rigsby, 27, who earned a rate of about $150 a day for a 12-hour shift on his Hollywood movie, becoming a background actor was a way to learn about the movie business. If the movie industry begins using AI to replace him on shoots and use his body scans in ways he doesn’t approve, the impact will be severe, he said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It’s erasing jobs from the market, and being done so in a way that doesn’t financially compensate,” he said.AI can make movies, edit actors, fake voices. Hollywood isn’t ready.Hollywood is no stranger to artificial intelligence. The technology has made Harrison Ford look younger for his most recent “Indiana Jones” film. It gave Val Kilmer his voice back for “Top Gun: Maverick.” It made Thanos more closely resemble Josh Brolin in “Avengers: Infinity War.”But the recent rise of generative artificial intelligence, which has spawned chatbots, image makers and voice-cloning tools that can mimic human output with lifelike precision has created a stir in Hollywood, as actors, writers and directors raise alarm that it could upend the industry.Story continues below advertisementThe Directors Guild of America successfully won protections in June to prevent being replaced with AI tools. The Writers Guild of America is trying to gain similar assurances in its negotiations. The union doesn’t want AI to be considered the creator of “source” or “literary” material, two key provisions that partially determine how credit is given to script writers and how they are paid.AdvertisementFor actors, a key concern is that body scans could be used to exploit background performers — using their image for little pay and robbing them of creative control.In a statement released on Monday, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists negotiating committee said Hollywood studios want to abuse the technology to “scan a background actor’s image, pay them for a half a day’s labor” and use the likeness “forever without their consent.” SAG-AFTRA added that studios have asked for the right to “make changes to principal performers’ dialogue, and even create new scenes, without informed consent.”Story continues below advertisementStudio representatives dispute this characterization of negotiations. Scott Rowe, a spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, said in a statement the group offered a “groundbreaking AI proposal which protects performers’ digital likenesses” and includes a requirement that performer’s give consent for the creation of replicas and any digital alterations made to their performance.From airlines to Hollywood, workers are fighting to keep AI at bayCurrently, producers use the digital clones largely to make small groups of actors appear more numerous to illustrate big scenes. Matt Panousis, the chief operating officer of visual effects firm Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies, said manufacturing a crowd starts with high-resolution body scan to capture “the shape and details of real people.” From there, crowd simulation software makes digital clones come to life, and allows for the “efficient creation of large crowds without the need for extensive physical shooting.” Though some body scanning uses artificial intelligence, this specific process does not.AdvertisementBut if studios were to use these digital clones for background scenes throughout a movie, the result would eliminate a huge amount of work for low-level actors, said actress and director Justine Bateman, who has been advising the Screen Actors Guild leadership on artificial intelligence.Story continues below advertisement“Let’s say it’s a big movie, where extras would work for 30 days. They want you to work for one day and scan you, and then not use you for the other 29,” said Bateman, who has a computer science degree from UCLA.“Everything they proposed that related to AI is to eliminate paying for talent. It’s all bound up and inspired by greed,” she added. “It does not solve a problem that currently exists in entertainment. It is only solving the problem of profit margins.”Joseph Looper, a 26-year-old from Phoenix who works as a background actor in Hollywood films and aspires to leading roles, said replacing extras with digital clones would ruin a common entry-point into the business.“If you do a background role once and some studio owns your likeness — then they don’t really need you anymore,” he said. “Then you’re out of a job ... and how exactly is someone supposed to work their way to a speaking role if they don’t have any on camera experience.”Joshua Glick, a film and media studies scholar at Bard College, said the strike illustrates that Hollywood sees how powerful artificial intelligence is getting and that jobs could be at risk.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Because these technologies have gotten better, faster, week to week, month to month, there’s a real crisis point at this moment to dig in for these negotiations,” he said, adding that “at the same time, Hollywood is looking for platforms to become profitable” and know “that technology is going to play a part” in achieving that.“The intensity and the conflict of this moment, speaks to just how important these technologies are,” he said.Writer and actors guilds are on strike and demanding more pay. They also want to limit how AI is used and see it as an existential threat to their livelihoods.

Adobe Generative AI: What Is It, And How Does It Work?







Ruggiero Scardigno/Shutterstock 
By Ron Baker/July 17, 2023  7:30 am EST


Adobe's generative AI technology holds enormous potential for enhancing creative work, but for some that promise might be concealed by the newness of the technology and some confusing branding issues. At its heart, Adobe's version of generative AI is designed to take simple, plain English text descriptions and translate them into usable images and documents. It also includes tools to make images more usable by eliminating unnecessary distractions within the image or expanding images for particular uses. However, there's a lot going on here and a lot is planned, so generalizing about it quickly becomes too narrow.





The company is pitching its AI products, in part, as workflow and productivity enhancers, with an end goal of refinement. But what, exactly, does that mean? Refinement is one of those odd words with mutually exclusive meanings. It can mean a process of improvement or signal a high-quality final state. Adobe's generative AI aims to do both. Users can explore creative options quickly, then iteratively refine and polish those ideas into a usable image. Designers, art directors, and other creatives can use these tools to radically speed up both brainstorming and development processes before using the fully editable output to create a final product.
Adobe's undifferentiated mass of branding swirls around its AI efforts. Did you wake up this morning planning to use Generative Fill in Photoshop via Firefly using Sensei? Probably not, but maybe you should! So let's figure this out.









Adobe Sensei makes (almost) everything possible






Adobe 


Sensei is Adobe's umbrella term for the overall AI technology used across its products. This probably isn't a name you need to think much about since it's only something you will likely only directly use through specific instances of the Adobe generative AI tech, as featured in Adobe's Firefly. 





However, Sensei, also referred to as Sensei GenAI, will also be focused on Adobe's Experience Cloud efforts, tools designed to enhance user experiences and marketing workflows like data analysis, content management, and even commerce solutions. For enterprise organizations, this will include tools like a more flexible customer data platform, natural language tools to enhance internal and customer communication, more focused user experience journeys, and more detailed insights than ever before.
What this strategy seems to be pointing to is Adobe's intent to use AI on all sides of its business processes and practices. Need a EULA? Let Sensei draft it. Want to sell bananas to people worried about contaminated baby goods? Sensei can point you to the most likely targets. Looking for customization based on region or specific audience demographics? Sensei again. It can do anything because Adobe clearly plans to shoehorn it into everything, and there are good reasons to believe it will work.









Firefly is a standalone generative AI product you can use today






Adobe 


If you have an Adobe ID, you can sign into the Adobe Firefly Beta right now and start benefiting from the transformative impact of AI on creative industries — or at least experiencing it, as the true benefits might only come later. The beta software can't be used for commercial purposes, which rather limits its utility, but you can certainly begin to get a handle on how it fits into your creative workflow.





It could fit in a number of ways, and today Firefly is a collection of tools aimed squarely (and unsurprisingly) at image creation and manipulation. We'll touch on most of those individually below. The larger context of Firefly, though, is that it's this standalone website, it's the same technologies folded into Adobe desktop software and third-party products, and it's part of some as-yet-undefined future plan to have multiple varieties of Firefly for different uses.
Adobe puts Firefly into a more business-focused context when discussing enterprise uses for generative AI. There, the company focuses not only on the creative aspects of the software but on efficiency and productivity, return on investment, workflow enhancement, automation, and ethical use of intellectual property. One concrete difference between enterprise and other uses is that Adobe plans to allow enterprise users to train on their own content libraries to better customize the results.











Create unpredictable art with text to image






Adobe 


There's no shortage of good AI image-generation tools, but Firefly's text to image feature has (or will have) a clear advantage. Feeding it a text prompt regurgitates an image like most AI image creators, but Firefly promises complete copyright clearances for the created image. That training is somewhat limited, though, which can be good from a legal point of view and perhaps a bit stifling from a creative point of view.





At a glance, it's not immediately clear that much of the Firefly output is usable, which probably explains the beta classification. The prompt ""bicycle with turbocharger"" generates a few bizarre and geometrically impossible literal interpretations. ""Turbocharged bicycle"" gives you some stylized bike wheels but nothing else, and ""bicycle that goes really fast"" renders a few drawings of standard racing bicycles but where the riders' limbs interface with the bike's pedals and handlebars. In every case, the hands and feet are distorted nightmarishly, in the manner of new AI in general. 
The AI has clearly created an image where many such images already exist but has done it pretty badly. Somewhere along the way, the Art tag added itself to the search, and removing it from the ""bicycle that goes really fast"" prompt results in slightly less terrifying images but with the same problems — especially the one with a cyclist's left arm terminating in a calf and foot. The right arm is normal, if in an unlikely position.









Create details and context from whole cloth with Generative Fill






Adobe/Ron Baker/SlashGear 


Generative Fill is a tool that changes, extends, and potentially deep-fakes an existing image based on your description of the desired change. Add to or swap out a background, change the dress or appearance of your subjects, swap out objects — the possibilities are almost limitless. Unfortunately, today the compositing suffers a bit from some limitations that will probably work themselves out over time.





Hands-on use of the web-based version of Firefly is at times frustrating, but overall very impressive. Selection brush and image positioning tools are rudimentary compared to Photoshop, but the AI generated fills were quite good and stylistically in line with the original photos. A late '60s to early '70s photo of a man kept its character when the background was replaced with what we described as a ""busy cafe."" Adding a background to a 1980s photo of a stock car racing team with their Chevelle, Generative Fill determined the foreground without any selection and suggested backgrounds that kept the period-appropriate film quality and saturation of the original photo. 
The effects weren't perfect, but they were quite good. A layered version of either of these could be edited in Photoshop to create a perfectly convincing composite. Switching contexts and adding a ""carnival"" background to the racing photo resulted in a period-appropriate shot from (apparently) the Carnival in Rio with the original American good ol' boys and their Chevelle in the foreground, which was somehow pretty convincing.









Text Effects lets you brilliantly ruin your slideshow with, well, text effects






Adobe 


After a few decades of trying to dissuade your staff from using 17 fonts and unnecessary visual baubles, you can give up now. Not because you've finally won but because Text Effects overruns your strongholds with an endless array of decorative typography that will turn the most drab earnings report into a psychedelic experience.





In practice, it's possible to get some good results with a little patience. It's also possible to get some kooky results with no patience at all. Stylizing the letter S with vines, surely the softest of softballs, generated rather dull results. Changing the prompt to snakes rather than vines wasn't much better. Making it ""vines made of snakes"" was a bit more exciting. However, when we switched to the word softly made of bricks, things started to go a little off the rails. The bricks were there, as were inexplicable gaps in some letters and weird brick-textured shapes like type or iconography. 
Somewhat disappointingly, the word suss when translated to brick revealed three identical examples of the letter S rather than rendering a unique pattern for each. Given the letter T and various fills to generate, Text Effects struggled again with bicycles but returned a decent T made of donuts. Perhaps the best was the T made of the letter T, which wasn't what we got, but the result looked pretty good. There's a lot of room to experiment here, and odds are you'll get something cool looking — eventually.









Generative Recolor helps you stylize vector art






Adobe/Wikipedia 


Instantly make any bizarre thing you cook up with generative AI compliant with brand standards by using Generative Recolor to put everything in the officially sanctioned color palette, or close to it. Vector graphic editing has long been a specialized skill, requiring software and knowledge not often available outside of marketing departments. Whatever use cases Adobe intends, Recolor will certainly be a boon to those who typically have to queue up for overtaxed junior designers.





Feeding Recolor a random compass rose from Wikimedia Commons and the prompt ""antique working toward PMS199"" resulted in four identical, unchanged versions. ""Antique red"" had the same result, yielding four identical black-and-white graphics. The sample prompts (""salmon sushi,"" ""trippy disco lights,"" and ""lavender storm"") also failed to change the image, which must have been incompatible with Generative Recolor, so we swapped it for a different compass rose with more success. Any given prompt, including the samples, would typically return three matching images and one out of left field. Still, it did a good job of applying colors in a way that made sense.
An Adobe sample image, a randomly colored abstract landscape with a color scheme described as ""Sakura in the snow,"" seemed to come out in different random colors. Changing the prompt to ""Sakura in the flames"" yielded a slightly warmer color scheme. Workable, all in all, but no improvement over calling that guy you know in marketing.









What you can't do with Adobe generative AI






Adobe 


Try this in Firefly's text to image tool: create an image based on the prompt ""Captain tight pants eats waffles."" Now, if you need to, Google ""captain tight pants."" You won't see a lot of overlap because Sensei's tools are restricted in a number of ways that make them safe for corporate creative environments. 





Firefly isn't trained on images that Adobe can't get clear licensing for, and it will not use intellectual property that is inappropriate to its enterprise users. This means that you'll get a lot of images that originate in the Adobe Stock library or from public domain sources. You also can't reliably ask Firefly for something in the style of a given artist or photographer because Adobe considers that derivative in a way that's not commercially acceptable, which is an approach the company should be applauded for, even if it's a legal self-defense maneuver. Adobe also promises to develop a compensation model to ensure creators are paid for their contributions to AI training.
Another thing you can't rely upon Sensei for is miracles. Searching for something like ""hummingbird smoking a pipe"" returns images that look like the output of 1990s morphing software, and the pipe is as likely to be sticking out of the back of the bird's head as anything else. Other equally bizarre searches turn up serviceable mashups, and it's difficult to figure out where the failings originate. That Adobe is focusing its AI training on likely business use cases rather than 14-year-olds goofing off might explain such a limitation. 









Where you can use these generative AI tools






Adobe 


You can play with Firefly online now, as we have, and many of the tools are already folded into the current Beta versions of Photoshop, including the free trial version. Generative Recolor has been added to Illustrator, where we'd expect to see text to vector once it's released. Parts of Firefly are available in Adobe's free Adobe Express. 





Meanwhile, Adobe is aggressively integrating them with Premiere and other products, as well as licensing them for use in third-party applications like Google's Bard. Adobe says the Firefly web platform works on Chrome, Safari, and Edge browsers, although mobile and tablet support is limited. This limitation seemed to come into play when we attempted to resize the interface in the browser but got a mobile-related error message.
As we said, you can't use the images generated by Firefly for commercial purposes, and it's clear from our experimentation and some other issues that Firefly isn't yet ready for prime time. Some users report getting an ""unable to load"" error, which Adobe unhelpfully says is explained by the fact that ""Any images generated that violate the will not be viewable."" So, take care not to use prompts that might cause Firefly to violate the. 





More seriously, though, this seems to suggest that there's a layer of filtering at work post-generation. Presumably, either Adobe is putting a lot of faith in that filtering or plans to train Firefly to filter itself in the future.




What you will be able to do with Adobe Generative AI soon






Adobe 


Adobe's generative AI tools are a work in progress, as all AI tools are definitionally, so naturally there are some tools in development — they call it ""in exploration"" — that will expand what Sensei means to you. Or maybe what Firefly means to you. One of those. 





Upcoming products and capabilities include extending images like landscapes to fit your desired format, fleshing out full scenes from simple 3D models, per-user or per-corporation customization, the generation of vector art and pattern tiles from text descriptions, converting simple sketches to fully realized illustrations, and more. In addition, you'll be able to do some or all of this via an API — or have your AI assistant do it for you.
Once the features are out of beta and you can use them freely, Adobe platforms will generate metadata that marks Firefly's creations as AI-generated as part of its Content Authenticity Initiative and its Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), which are designed to address concerns about the ethical use of AI-generated images. In the future, Adobe products will also honor a ""do not train"" flag on content that creators don't want used to generate these images.





While there is still much to be done, Adobe seems to be taking important steps toward turning AI image generation into something that enterprise organizations and content creators can incorporate into their current systems. It should, at the very least, be interesting.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be a big part of the recruitment process going forward, judging by the results of a recent survey.
Overall, 80% of HR professionals have used or are considering using generative AI in the hiring process, reports Greenhouse, a provider of hiring operating systems.
And 62% believe that AI can help them hire the best candidate.









Contrasting views on AI for DEI
However, many HR professionals, and even candidates, still have contrasting views around the technology.
Among HR professionals, 37% strongly or somewhat disagree that AI will reduce bias in the hiring process, while 28% feel the opposite. Over a quarter (27%) of candidates believe that AI leads to more bias in the hiring process. 
Also, one-third of HR professionals (33%) believe that AI will help organizations reach their DEI goals, yet 31% strongly or somewhat disagree.
Around half of HR respondents (48%) strongly or somewhat agree with their company using AI to screen job applications, but one-third (33%) disagree. Similarly, over 35% of candidates disagree with the use of AI in job application screenings. However, 35% said using AI in the hiring process is fair game since companies are using AI to sort through resumes.
""While AI is a beneficial tool for automating tasks and increasing efficiency, it shouldn't be used in its present form to make human-based decisions like hiring,” said Henry Tsai, VP of product and design at Greenhouse.

“Our report found that HR professionals realize this and want to implement AI thoughtfully to ensure the hiring process is fair and equitable. As companies begin using AI, it's critical that they are clear and transparent about how they are using it while being able to monitor and identify applications that could have a biased impact on a hiring decision.”
One in five HR leaders have implemented generative AI in their work, while another 9% said they are carrying out pilots for it, according to a previous Gartner report.
Education, laws around generative AI
Amid all these contrasts, many HR professionals want more opportunities to learn generative AI, as well as policies surrounding it, found Greenhouse’s survey of over 2,700 candidates in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Ireland, and 100 HR professionals.
Over eight in 10 (84%) HR professionals believe that there should be more education and training in the workplace regarding AI tools. 
HR leaders' lack of understanding on generative AI could be the reason why the emerging technology's use across HR departments remains limited, according to a previous study.









And 62% of HR leaders believe that there should be more laws specifically governing AI tools to prevent bias in the recruitment process, reported Greenhouse.
Recently, New York City’s law regulating the use of automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) – such as AI in – making hiring decisions took effect.
Transparency around the use of generative AI is also a key issue, according to Greenhouse: over 38% of HR professionals believe that if a candidate has used AI in the application and hiring process, they should disclose that to the company they are applying to. Almost 50% of candidates say that companies should do the same.
""Educating employees not only on the scope of how AI can be used, but on the ethical considerations of it, like privacy, transparency, and bias, will be critical as we go forward with the intention of responsible and ethical AI,”said Lani Phillips, vice president of channel sales at Microsoft.
Making the most of generative AI
To get the most from generative AI, employers must educate and empower workers and evaluate its impact, said Glen Cathey, SVP and consulting principal for talent advisory and digital strategy at Randstad.









“Given the seriousness of potential harm, it is imperative that companies provide guidance on the responsible and acceptable use of generative AI while reaping its benefits,” he said.
The following tips will help employers in this regard, he said:

Provide your employees with basic knowledge and awareness of what generative AI is, how it works, what it can do, how to get the best results (for example, prompt engineering), and what the potential benefits and risks are.
Encourage your employees to explore and experiment with generative AI systems that are relevant and useful for their work.
Monitor and evaluate the performance and impact of generative AI systems on your employees, business outcomes, and customer satisfaction.
Establish and enforce clear policies and standards for the responsible use of generative AI systems by your employees.

The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market has sparked intense conversations. Some argue that AI will catalyze job loss, leading to widespread unemployment and economic instability. In contrast, others contend that AI will be a boon, unlocking new opportunities and enhancing human productivity. This article explores this topic in depth to dispel the misconceptions surrounding AI’s role in the job market. Examining both sides of the debate can provide a nuanced understanding of how AI may reshape employment dynamics.
Daya Prakash
AI as a Job Killer
Those who argue that AI will be a job killer often cite examples of automation replacing human workers in various industries. Automation has transformed workplaces for centuries, from the industrial revolution to today. The fear is that AI-powered machines will outperform humans in numerous tasks, rendering specific jobs obsolete. For instance, self-driving vehicles threaten to displace millions of professional drivers, and advanced chatbots can replace customer service representatives.
The future of white-collar jobs is a significant concern due to AI’s ability to process data and perform complex tasks rapidly and accurately. For instance, AI-powered algorithms have shown increasing proficiency in data analysis, posing a potential threat to professions such as financial analysts, researchers, and even medical practitioners. As advancements in AI continue, it is natural to question whether such progress will lead to widespread job displacement.
AI as a Job Creator
While apprehensions regarding job displacement are valid, it is crucial to consider the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate novel employment opportunities. Historical evidence has demonstrated that technological advancements, such as the internet and manufacturing automation, have resulted in job market transformations rather than eliminating jobs. AI is expected to follow a comparable path.
AI can enhance human capabilities by enabling critical thinking, creativity, and emotional
intelligence. As AI automates repetitive and monotonous tasks, employees can redirect their efforts toward more meaningful and strategic work. In this regard, AI functions as a productivity multiplier, enabling humans to achieve higher levels of output and innovation.
Moreover, the development and deployment of AI technologies necessitate a skilled workforce. Implementing AI systems requires data science, machine learning, and software engineering experts. The increase in demand for AI proficiency is accompanied by a corresponding need for professionals who possess the skills required to design, maintain, and enhance AI systems. This creates a significant opportunity for specialised job creation.
AI also has the potential to unlock entirely new industries and job categories. As AI algorithms evolve, new healthcare, transportation, and environmental sustainability applications emerge. These emerging fields will require diverse skills, creating new job opportunities for those who can adapt and upskill.
Navigating the Future: Human-AI Collaboration
Rather than framing the AI debate as a zero-sum game between job killer and creator, it is crucial to consider the possibilities of human-AI collaboration. The future of work will likely revolve around augmenting human potential with AI technologies rather than replacing humans altogether. Humans provide critical thinking, ethical judgment, and creativity in this symbiotic relationship. At the same time, AI contributes computational power, data analysis, and automation.
Organisations that embrace human-AI collaboration are poised to gain a competitive advantage. By combining the strengths of humans and AI, companies can achieve higher efficiency, innovation, and customer satisfaction. As artificial intelligence performs repetitive and data-driven tasks, employees can direct their attention toward problem-solving, relationship-building, and strategic decision-making, ultimately contributing more eminent value to their respective organisations.
The IT Industry as an Example
During the 1990s, the introduction of computers had a significant impact on the IT industry. At the time, many feared that it would lead to job losses. However, today we can see that this technology has created a 5.3 trillion USD industry, providing evidence that technological progress can actually create job opportunities and stimulate economic growth. Despite initial concerns about job loss, the IT industry experienced significant expansion, leading to a substantial increase in its revenues and contribution to the global GDP. This growth created various job opportunities, including software development, IT consulting, cybersecurity, and data analysis. It’s clear that introducing new technologies, like AI, can positively impact employment rates and economic prosperity.
Conclusion
The debate concerning whether AI is a job destroyer or a creator is simplistic. Although worries about job displacement are valid, history indicates that technological advancements are more likely to result in shifts in the job market rather than the complete elimination of employment prospects. AI has the potential to enhance human abilities, freeing up individuals to concentrate on higher-value tasks. Additionally, the development and implementation of AI will necessitate a skilled workforce, resulting in job creation in specialised fields.
Organisations must embrace the potential of human-AI collaboration to navigate the future
successfully. Businesses must recognise their strengths and limitations to utilise the potential of both humans and AI fully. This can be accomplished by fostering a culture of continuous learning, upskilling, and reskilling, enabling individuals to prosper in an AI-driven world while remaining adaptable and equipped with the necessary skills. In doing so, businesses can ensure that their workforce remains agile and prepared for new challenges.
As we move forward, we must acknowledge the transformative potential of AI to promote
productivity and innovation rather than exclusively viewing it as a job destroyer. By adopting this mindset, we can create a future where humans and machines work harmoniously, unlocking new possibilities and shaping a more prosperous society. To achieve this, we must cultivate a collaborative environment integrating AI with human decision-making and expertise, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth. Ultimately, leveraging AI to enhance human intelligence and capabilities can create a sustainable and prosperous future for all.

Different industries have already started to adapt to this game-changing technology, and the effects on the labor market are clear. &quot;Generative AI is altering the fundamental nature of our employment, transforming industries, and revolutionizing how we work..Generative AI is becoming an essential tool across various professional disciplines because of its exceptional capacity to evaluate enormous volumes of data, identify patterns, and provide intelligent outputs. For experts in multiple fields, generative AI has a multifaceted impact. Automation today makes it possible to automate time-consuming and repetitive operations, freeing up valuable time for higher-level thinking and innovative problem-solving. With the help of generative AI, professionals can now complete more work in less time and various industries. Professional success in the digital age will depend on their ability to comprehend and use the possibilities of generative AI as companies expand..The use of AI automation has dramatically improved the productivity of all departments. However, managing a scattered workforce dispersed across the country has been one of the obstacles for HR heads that is currently being significantly reduced thanks to generative AI..Employing Robots: Many areas of human resources are experiencing a paradigm shift, starting with the talent acquisition processes that content-based AI supports for generating job descriptions, sourcing and screening resumes through keyword searches, and auto onboarding for new employees..Automated Employee Communications: AI-based email mechanisms that help to reduce manual error and improve time efficiency can be used to automate HR operations that call for management and communication directed at the entire organization regarding different aspects of their employee cycle..Employee Engagement: In addition, employee engagement options like Pulse Surveys, which appear automated based on employee data and extract the workforce's opinions, are useful in surfacing issues that require serious attention, such as complaints, needs, policy feedback, etc..Data Analytics: At SAVE, we're putting AI-integrated HRMS technologies in place to improve dashboards for data analysis on important human resources mechanisms, including attrition, onboarding, recruiting, and separation..Employee Transactions: The voice/chatbot capability is also anticipated to be useful for dealing with and lowering the turnaround time necessary for regular employee transactions, including leave applications, attendance tracking, employee allowances, and cost management..Rapid developments in generative AI have the potential to fundamentally alter how humans work in organizations, notably in the area of major firms' human resources management. Instead of being a danger, generative AI presents an opportunity for improvement. Automating monotonous work using generative AI frees up staff time for higher-value jobs requiring specialization. Employees should be encouraged to upskill and reskill to cooperate with AI systems. They should picture a day when humans and AI coexist peacefully and have endless opportunities. Generative AI aims to enhance human talents and open new opportunities rather than replace people. When adopting generative AI into enterprises, there are a few conditions to consider..First, a strategic approach is required, in which CEOs must establish precise goals and integrate generative AI activities into their overarching company plan. Finding use cases that deliver measurable value and specifically solve business concerns is essential. Prioritizing data readiness comes next. Generative AI systems require enormous volumes of high-quality data for training and fine-tuning. Third, to fully utilize generative AI, it is crucial to assemble a varied team of specialists comprising data scientists, subject matter experts, and creative workers. CEOs must promote a culture of cooperation and ongoing learning to draw and keep great people. Last, deploying generative AI necessitates changing current infrastructure, procedures, and workflows. CEOs must ensure that their companies are ready for the changes on a cultural and technological level..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The Philippines is a global giant in outsourced office work. Its roughly 1.6 million workers are on the front lines for replacement by generative AI.The country’s parliament and industry are attempting to find ways to handle the technological shift without huge job losses. But finding consensus has been hard — and generative AI is moving fast. 




Bernie’s customers don’t know it, but the diplomatic charm of generative artificial intelligence has been smoothing out all of their exchanges. His bosses don’t know, either — and he would be in trouble if they did.
Bernie, who requested to be identified only by his first name as he feared retribution from his employer, works as a technical support agent in a massive IT call center in the Philippines. His customers are English speakers, often irritated and short on patience as they reach out to him while battling a malfunctioning program or network issues. Since 2022, as tools like ChatGPT and Bing exploded in popularity, Bernie has been quietly using them in the background to generate responses.
“It made my work easier. I can even get ideas on how to approach certain complaints, making [my answers] appear engaging, persuasive, empathetic. It can give you that, depending on the prompt that you input,” Bernie told Rest of World. Though he thinks he isn’t the only tech support worker using AI for this purpose, he said the “other agents have tended to be completely dependent on the AI responses, and they sometimes end up giving a response that is inappropriate to the customer’s concerns.”
Bernie now uses ChatGPT and Bing to compile all the technical information he needs for a query in less than five minutes. It’s doubled the number of customer complaints he can handle in a day. Yet, his workplace — a U.S.-based, publicly listed “customer experience” giant with employees across more than 40 countries — forbids its agents from using generative AI, according to Bernie. 
The Philippines is one of the world’s biggest centers for business process outsourcing (BPO), an industry dedicated to outsourcing entire business operations — such as customer helplines and content moderation — to other companies. Thanks to the explosion in generative AI, the industry is scrambling to find a balance between automating its roughly 1.6 million workers out of a job and losing its clients to other outsourcing centers that can offer generative AI-powered services at cheaper costs. With the multibillion-dollar industry accounting for 7.5% of the Philippine economy, political and business leaders are pushing to form a plan — often in different directions.
According to Mon Ibrahim, a former official with the information and communications technology agency that helped pioneer the Philippines’ BPO sector in the early 2000s, an official plan needs to deal with the technological shift.

7.5% Percentage of the Philippine economy that business process outsourcing represents.

“But if the government won’t do something to capacitate workers to use AI in the next five years, then I think it will leave a huge impact,” Ibrahim told Rest of World. “That’s when workers might lose their jobs.”
BPO companies began experimenting with AI tools like chatbots in 2018, he said, mainly for repetitive and rules-based interactions. Often, their responses lacked empathy and sparked frustration among customers, even while they sped up queries. With the leap to generative AI, however, that risk has reduced. 
In early May, Philippine senator Imee Marcos filed a resolution calling for an inquiry into the potential displacement of workers from the BPO and manufacturing industries.
“AI is developing faster than most people can comprehend, and is threatening to take away jobs and turn employment growth upside down,” the senator, sister of President Bongbong Marcos, warned during a session of Congress. She cited a study by Oxford Economics and tech company Cisco, which estimated that digital automation could make 1.1 million roles in the Philippines obsolete by 2028.
The senator also urged that lawmakers be educated on global developments in AI, and stressed the need for legislators to cooperate and deal with “an inevitable technological tsunami.”
Jack Madrid, president of the industry lobby IT and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP), told Rest of World call centers should be able to integrate generative AI, but that workers — like Bernie’s colleagues who sent tone-deaf replies — should also be properly taught how to use the tools. The sector, he said, is “worth defending.”
“This is a wake-up call.”
The business association recently formed an AI Council, which seeks to bring together experts, industry members, and academics to develop upskilling programs for BPO workers. These programs are aimed at enabling the workforce to perform higher-value work that’s still beyond the scope of AI.
“This is a wake-up call,” said Madrid. “I understand that there are some concerns, but I also think that the only thing we should be worried about is our inability to upskill … our workforce.”
The timeline for these programs, though, is still vague. And even as calls for clearer guidelines slow down the Philippine BPO industry’s adoption of AI, other sectors are moving ahead. One example is Navix Health, a buzzy generative AI startup that helps produce documents for medical professionals. Its app was built entirely by Filipino developers.
The company’s CTO, Colin Christie, acknowledged to Rest of World that using AI tools could mean displacing human workers. Navix Health’s AI platform, for instance, does the work that medical receptionists might normally do. But Christie said he believes that although some of the workforce might lose their jobs, new and different work could be created from the increased business that results from AI adoption.
According to those like Senator Marcos and Ibrahim, however, facing the technological shift is not about productivity, but rather, a necessity for Filipino workers’ survival. 
“We need to start [adapting] now,” said Ibrahim. “The nature of the sector is very competitive. If you’re not using AI for your projects, it will be very hard for you to compete with those who do.” 
For the Philippines, the decision may be unavoidable, he said. “Whether you like it or not, you will have to move up and look at using AI, otherwise you lose your business,” said Ibrahim. “When you do, workers will lose their 
					
						jobs.”

And the winners, so far, are San Francisco and San Jose, Calif.While that may not be surprising, the Brookings report may help to dispel the notion that smaller tech hubs like Austin, Texas, or Miami will be home to the next generation of big tech companies. If anything, it suggests the Bay Area’s hold on the tech industry could grow stronger.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBrookings researchers found that across more than 380 metro areas in the United States, a quarter of the roughly 2,200 generative A.I. job postings during the last year were in the Bay Area.“This exciting new technology may drive more clustering, and that is a problem economically, demographically and for society,” said Mark Muro, an author of the report and a senior fellow at Brookings Metro, a research unit that focuses on cities and public policy.The job postings follow a generative A.I. investment frenzy, which is heavily skewed toward the Bay Area. In addition to industry giants like Google and Meta, the nine most valuable start-ups in generative A.I. are based in San Francisco or Silicon Valley, including OpenAI, Scale AI, Anthropic, Inflection AI, Databricks and Cerebras, according to PitchBook, which tracks start-ups.Editors’ PicksSnack on This at Your Weekend Barbecue: The Etymology of ‘Pickle’ July 14, 2024Are Artificial Sweeteners Safe? July 16, 2024Oh, the Ordinary Places You’ll Go! July 19, 2024Job postings for A.I. work are not nearly as common as postings for other technology skill sets, and A.I. expertise has for years been a hot and highly paid specialty. Tech hubs outside the United States, like Toronto and Cambridge, England, have also drawn their share of A.I. researchers.The Brookings researchers analyzed U.S. job listings data gathered by Lightcast, a labor analytics firm. Postings were counted as generative A.I. jobs if they included at least one of three terms: generative A.I., ChatGPT or large language models. Large language models are used to build generative A.I. software.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTNew York ranked third in generative A.I. job postings. It is home to a high-profile generative A.I. start-up, Hugging Face, and many of the big tech companies have teams of A.I. researchers in the city.As a center for many industries other than tech, New York may offer a glimpse into how the technology will spread beyond the early work being done in the Bay Area.“Every major financial, media, advertising and consulting company is immersed in figuring out how they are going to adapt to and use generative A.I.,” said Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech:NYC, a nonprofit industry group. “And that’s happening every day here.”But the increasing number of A.I. jobs in New York, many of them high paying, does not address the challenge of democratizing the technology across the country.A series of other studies in recent months have assessed the likely economic impact of generative artificial intelligence, the technology engine behind chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard that can write business reports, computer code and poetry. That research has focused on the potential of generative A.I. to boost productivity, transform work and automate millions of jobs.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTResearch tracing hundreds of new technologies over decades shows that the pioneering hubs for development typically retain a vast amount of the wealth and skills generated from them. And the new Brookings report is essentially an update to a 2021 study on the geography of A.I., which raised concerns about the clustering of A.I.-fueled prosperity.Still, the new report does point to increased support and funding for “place-based industrial policy,” which seeks to increase economic prosperity in more places.For example, under the CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law last year, the federal government has made an initial appropriation of $500 million to set up 20 regional technology hubs. Investment in A.I. technology and training is identified as a priority for those hubs.“We need to create ecosystems of tech innovation in more communities around the country, especially those that have historically been overlooked,” Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said in an emailed statement.The National Science Foundation has established 25 A.I. Institutes across the country, working with government agencies and companies. The program’s $500 million is being disbursed in grants of $20 million each for A.I. programs, which conduct basic and applied research in fields like climate change, agriculture and education.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGrants are going to university-based institutes including ones at the University of Oklahoma, Ohio State University, Iowa State University, Washington State University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University at Buffalo and the University of California, Irvine.With artificial intelligence, there may be an opportunity for a broader geographic distribution of wealth than with some past technologies.“We’re just talking about information, bits, and we don’t have to be in the same place to work on bits,” said Michael Littman, division director for information and intelligent systems at the National Science Foundation.With the rise of A.I., Dr. Littman said, “we really need to have as many people as possible participate in this shift.”The Brookings report calls for sustaining and expanding such policies. “We’re starting to see a recognition that the geography of technology is really important for the shape of opportunity in America,” Mr. Muro, the co-author of the report, said.Steve Lohr covers technology, economics and work force issues.

The column appears every Friday) - Kavi Arya What is the outlook that we need in an increasingly uncertain future of work? This is a future with geo-political and economic uncertainty and global warming. Add to this state of flux an environment in which jobs are increasingly being taken over by automation and machines, with it being clear that Artificial Intelligence-inspired technologies are here to stay and will dramatically change our lives. This means that any low-skill jobs, be they in manufacturing, software development, and media are soon going to be taken over by machines. Newspaper reports already have stories of copywriters in America losing their jobs and ending up with alternative careers. Television channels are testing out new anchors that are totally artificially generated. With new programming tools, programmers are becoming more productive, so we need fewer programmers to do the same work. The story goes on to other spheres. Those who have used ChatGPT and other generative-AI models have discovered the science of “prompt engineering”. Designing better prompts will help us get the solution that we’re looking for. But ChatGPT still depends on human expertise to spot when it “hallucinates” and gives a wrong answer. Even prompt engineering will eventually be replaced by the skill of articulating a problem to the system for it to solve itself. ChatGPT is still really a glorious search engine that responds based on the existing realms of knowledge that it’s been trained on. Through Google searches, for example, we get thrown many answers that we need to sift through to find the one we’re looking for. However, ChatGPT gives a measured and nuanced response. AI systems will soon become intelligent to a degree that we need to develop less skills with prompts. So, future opportunities will lie in in the creation of new knowledge either by engaging in work that is original or solving problems that haven’t been solved before. In other words, engaging with life in a more entrepreneurial manner to create novel work is going to be crucial. This entrepreneurial spirit could help create products, services, intellectual property or even startups whose purpose is to fulfil as yet unmet market needs. However, the market for creating new services is limited in the contracting advanced economies of the world. In India, however, there’s a certain optimism. This is because we are a fast-growing economy with a huge appetite for new products and services for an increasingly affluent and demanding population of over 1.4 billion people. Half this population is below the age of 29 years. If we import future solutions from abroad, we pay 10x the amount required for us to make them locally. There are huge opportunities in building and delivering products and services for our own growing economy where every problem is an opportunity for a startup. The bigger the market, the bigger the opportunity. But where’s the trained human resource to build these new products and services? Our entire education system is geared towards rote learning and passing exams. Most students are still taught to believe that if they do well in exams, they’ll get a good job. There is a risk-averse attitude in our society strongly biased against entrepreneurial pursuits. However, the job market today is demanding youngsters with state-of-the-art skills and a host of other abilities. The school system and higher-education system is hard pressed to deliver young people with such skillsets and the “equipment” to “surf” modern life and its challenges. For instance, a core quality demanded by entrepreneurship is empathy and a desire to engage with societal problems. Where do we train our students to be perceptive to their surroundings? Where do we train them with critical thinking abilities? And on the ability to actually solve problems and to do whatever required - self-learn, collaborate and work with teams - to get the job done? Further, we need the knowledge of how to raise money and also specialised updated knowledge of technology to give us an edge in the market. For the lucky ones who get to the IITs, NITs or top institutions and those able to go abroad, this aspect is more or less taken care of. But what about the others? The government is making a valiant effort to change the education system through policy initiatives such as the NEP 2020. This makes a heavy demand on an educational system that has hitherto been rigid with human resources that still need to be trained in the new mold. Young people are impatient and cannot be kept waiting, so they address this by innovatively exploring the bounty of the internet. Students of all ages are going online to learn from Khan Academy, Coursera, among other ed tech resources, to prepare themselves for the future. This has boosted fortunes of a host of other companies making us believe that we have the answer. But this is not enough. We need students taking lives in their own hands and building a portfolio of skills to help them discover their passion and to direct them to their destination – whether employment, a higher degree or a startup. One good place to acquire these skills is the plethora of competitions that help one’s resume stand out from others. In India, we have various flavours, from “pure competitions” such as Smart India Hackathon (GoI) for small teams or Robocon for large teams representing colleges. Then there is e-Yantra Robotics Competition from IIT Bombay, that trains participants in futuristic technology stacks through “themes” or problem statements where both “hard” and “soft” skills are exercised in a six month long experience. The outcomes are top rate placements, the urge to higher degrees and even start-ups with the prize being a coveted six-week internship at IIT Bombay. Finally, to reiterate: the world is looking for self-assured intelligent young people with the empathy to solve societal problems, the curiosity to ask questions and ability to solve these problems.

The AI Surge: Prospect of Job Losses?






 







Share this News:FacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedInTelegramMessageKolkata, 21 July 2023: The 21st century is in the process of witnessing a remarkable and revolutionary surge in the use of Artificial Intelligence technology, which holds great promise for the advancement of humanity. While certainly one cannot neglect the benefits that AI technology carries with itself, one must also keep in mind the possibility of job losses as AI increases its penetration into diverse job sectors.
AI driven processes such as ChatGPT, CopySmith, GPT-4, Canva, PicAI have successfully entrenched themselves in numerous professional lives, and are human validated as well. Further, AI is all set for a stronger evolution in the coming years which promises to make life easier. In this context, leading companies such as Apple & Google plan to launch AI tools that directly rivals the technology used by ChatGPT.
Google is working on an AI tool that writes news copies for journalists, and has pitched the tool to The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post as a ‘personal assistant for journalists’. On the other hand, Apple’s technology known as “Apple GPT” is a form of generative AI.
These cutting-edge technologies and machine learning algorithms could well lead to the displacement of jobs in several sectors such as, data entry, customer support, and basic administrative tasks, and creative jobs such as music composition, video making, content writing and copy writing. While certainly at this point AI lacks the talent to replace human creativity and insight, one mustn’t underestimate its enormous growth in the years to come.
However, on a positive note, the rise of this technology will also lead to creation and demand of more jobs in the sectors of data science and developers who can lend their expertise in building the next generation AI tools.
While navigating the 2023 AI surge, it is crucial to note the diverse opportunities and advancements it holds, alongside the need for lifelong learning and reskilling on part of humans.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a prominent topic of discussion and a sought-after skill in today’s job market. While the media often portrays AI in extremes, either as a sci-fi fantasy or a job-stealing menace, the reality is more nuanced. It is already integrated into various aspects of our lives, and its future potential is immense. This article explores the future of artificial intelligence and its impact on jobs, highlighting its role in different industries and the evolving nature of the job market.
Impact on the Workforce
The fear that AI will render human workers obsolete is largely unfounded. The MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future released a paper suggesting a more optimistic outlook. Rather than eliminating jobs, AI is projected to drive innovation and create new sectors for growth, ultimately leading to the creation of more jobs. The unique problem-solving abilities and critical judgement of humans, known as generalised intelligence, will continue to be relevant across all sectors.
Limitations and Challenges
While it has made significant advancements, it still has limitations. AI programs typically possess specialised intelligence, capable of solving specific problems or executing single tasks. They lack the flexibility and adaptability associated with human intelligence. Furthermore, artificial intelligence requires vast amounts of data for learning, raising concerns about data availability, privacy, and security. Biases in data can also result in biassed outcomes. Efforts are being made to address these issues, such as the Algorithmic Accountability Act, which aims to investigate potential bias perpetuation.
AI’s Impact on Industries
AI is not limited to the tech world; it is becoming standard across various industries. In medicine, it has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and develop predictive models. The automotive sector is witnessing the impact of AI through autonomous vehicles and manufacturing automation. Cybersecurity relies on AI and machine learning to identify and predict threats. In e-commerce, artificial intelligence drives user experience, marketing, fulfilment, and inventory automation. These examples demonstrate that AI’s influence extends beyond tech and into diverse sectors.
AI’s Role in the Job Search
AI has also transformed the job search process. Automated applicant tracking systems (ATS) powered by AI scan resumes, with up to 75% of them being rejected before reaching human eyes. While some argue that certain AI-driven hiring practices perpetuate bias, job seekers can leverage similar technology to optimise their applications. Tools like Jobscan, Jobseer, and Rezi utilise AI to match resumes with job descriptions, enhance alignment, and improve chances of success.
Upskilling and Adapting
As artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, developing AI and machine learning skills is becoming increasingly crucial. Jobs requiring AI or machine-learning skills are predicted to increase by more than 70% in the upcoming five years. Individuals should consider taking advantage of free online courses that focus on AI, regardless of their background. Tech-savvy professionals can dive deep into it, while others should seek to understand how it functions within their respective sectors.
Embracing AI in the Future
Artificial Intelligence is here to stay, and rather than fearing it, we should embrace its potential. Adapting to the new technology landscape is essential for individuals and businesses alike. Many Media Feathers as digital marketing agency has already started to work on it. Awareness and understanding of AI will enable us to leverage its benefits, contribute to innovation, and thrive in the evolving job market.
Conclusion
The future of AI is promising, with its impact already visible in various industries such as media feathers, the social media marketing agency. While concerns about job displacement persist, evidence suggests that artificial intelligence will drive innovation, create new opportunities, and augment human capabilities rather than replace them entirely.
By acknowledging the limitations, challenges, and potential biases of AI, we can work towards harnessing its power for the betterment of society. Embracing AI, upskilling, and adapting to the changing landscape will be key to tackling the situation and using the whole scenario to your benefit rather than falling into the pit.
