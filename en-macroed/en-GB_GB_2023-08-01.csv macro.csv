A I, there are whole swaths of your staff
that you will no longer need writers, coders,
analysts and on and on
that you will have to rethink the people you'll need to
succeed and you need to do it. Now,
our research suggests that rather
than thinking about what jobs will be lost to
A I consider what work needs to be
done. What if the more strategic
view is how to use A I to
make us better, more creative and more
productive? This is think
again, the Gartner original series
that explores breakthrough trends and reveals
new ways to think about the future.
We start with Gartner distinguished VP
analyst Mary
Masago. Mary help us out talk
about A I is everywhere. How
should we be thinking about it?
I think everybody thinks of A I primarily
as a technology or a set of technologies
and that's not really right, just
in the age of the computer. So you know, not cavemen
and cuddles but just say the last 50 years,
we thought of the machine more as a tool,
a supercomputer, a calculator, an information
provider. But as we enter this new age
of A I, I think it's more useful
for us to think of the machine as
our teammate. And that's a really
profound shift in how humans
and machines interact.
I think the attitude to strike here is that
A I shouldn't be hyped, but
it shouldn't be underestimated either.
Let's start with the elephant in the room.
What about all the talk about A I replacing
people?
Are we facing an A I
jobs apocalypse?
So are we all gonna have to retrain as hairdressers
and burger flippers and dog
trainers? And those are the jobs that are safe and
the robots are coming for everything else and the answer
to that is no why?
Well Gartner predicts that through 2026
the impact of A I on jobs
will be neutral. So that's not
to say no jobs will be lost. Of course,
jobs will be lost like in any big technology
shift. But I think a more useful
way to think about A I and jobs
is not so much to ask which
jobs will be lost, but to
look at your industry and ask what
work needs to be done.
Teachers aren't able to serve their students
as well as they would like to
and doctors aren't able to serve their patients
as well as they would like to and manufacturers
would like to come up with safer, newer,
more innovative products and
manufacturing processes, et cetera.
And so if you look at it through what work needs to
be done. There'll be a commensurate increase
in new jobs.
That's well, a relief. How will
it impact the future? Especially for the enterprise.
Gartner fellow Frank
Dyke walks us through what he sees as the
real opportunity for the enterprise.
You really have to take the long view
here.
The, the opportunity will actually change
over time and, and we see three stages
in that in the first stage
and that's where we are right now. A I really
is a partner, a partner that can help get
more dumb and do that a little bit more
consistently. A I really provides
the opportunity here to become a productive
inconsistent in the roles that we have
A I essentially is an assistant and you're
in charge. And in the second stage, we
see A I move from being a partner
to be an active creator, bringing
forward new insights, new models, new capabilities.
And this is where A I is able
to simulate massive quantities, models
and data out to just create new human scenarios
or physical scenarios or business scenarios
to enable A I to accelerate
beyond human capability.
Think for instance, in new drug discovery,
in A I can help with everything from chemical
interaction to drug interactions, to patient
reactions and go towards personalized
medication. And in the third stage,
it becomes a little bit more futuristic and this is
where things get really interesting here.
We see A I move from being a partner
and a creator to becoming more of an
and this is really a big step because
we as a society and as a business,
we haven't really figured out what this means, practically
legally and socially. Gartner,
vice president and analyst, Helen Povan
takes A I as an actor one step
further. When A I is an actor, it
will have alr...

Westlaw, Practical Law, and drafting products build upon 150 years of human insight, categorization like the Key Number System, and editorial enhancements that ensure the quality and structure of the source material.  “Having humans in the loop and controlling and mitigating and understanding and working with the outputs of a high-performing AI system is ultimately the best end-to-end outcome that we can try to achieve with this new capability,” he said.  Generative AI in WestlawDahn shared examples of how generative AI will help legal researchers using Westlaw.In addition to searching Westlaw with Boolean and natural language searches, you’ll also be able to engage with Westlaw in a conversational manner, much like you would with a colleague. The new functionality will be able to read and synthesize content across databases to bring back a clear answer to a question like, “Can social media publicity prove that a trademark is famous for a dilution claim?” It will also provide the authority the answer relies on so you can verify the response and understand the nuance of the law.  Watch the webinar to see this feature in action. Providing the authority for the answer is one way the generative AI features from Thomson Reuters minimize hallucinations. When you can see the reasons for the response, you can verify for yourself that the answer makes sense and is based in fact.   Generative AI in Practical LawColbert shared the concept for the new functionality in Practical Law. Practical Law has been providing know-how for decades, with content developed by attorneys who are experts in their practice areas. Legal practitioners rely on it to help them get started on new matters and new areas of law. She said the conversational experience will help attorneys get to the answers they need faster. For example, if you have a question about how to get started drafting an indemnification provision, you can simply type your question, without filtering to a practice area or sorting through practice notes. The model will return the answer after consulting the trusted Practical Law resources. It will also provide the sources for the answer and steps for further research. See this feature for yourself and more – including how to create custom visualizations that help inform decisions about provisions based on market trends. Using generative AI to draft legal documentsAshraf showed how new generative AI capabilities in Thomson Reuters drafting tools will enable users to create a first draft of, for example, a sale of goods agreement. She noted how, working in Word, a user can pull in gold standard language from Practical Law and customize the terms of the agreement.  She said that the drafting solution will help attorneys be more efficient in their preferred tool for creating work product.With this drafting solution we are bringing together a host of Thomson Reuters solutions with Microsoft Word all in one environment.Generative AI grounded in truthHron noted that AI is exciting and also a bit suspect in its early days. “When you’re trying to answer a very precise or specific question, you want to take that benefit of the model, but you also want to ground it in something that you know is truthful,” he says.That’s what we’re doing here: grounding the model in content we know to be correct so that it can help legal professionals deliver their work efficiently and with confidence. Learn more about generative AI and how it can help redefine how legal professionals do their work by watching, “The new era – redefining how legal professionals do their work.” Sign up for updates on the release of the AI-driven capabilities covered in this blog and in the webinar.   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceTechnology",,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]","['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Policymakers face a balancing act to ensure the fair distribution of the benefits of artificial intelligence. The rapid adoption of the technology can disrupt nonroutine tasks, affecting job security and exacerbating socio-economic inequalities. Vishal Rana and Bert Verhoeven discuss possible ways to address the problem, such as creating a universal basic income to help people cope with the transition.

 
The rapid adoption of large language models like ChatGPT and Bard undoubtedly presents many opportunities to positively transform the economy. Organisations are exploring the ability of AI to scale and lower costs, absorb and process enormous amounts of data and help make better decisions, often with humans as editors and facilitators. This transition process is likely to create new jobs that would have never existed without AI.
While the initial statistics suggest a balance between job destruction and job creation, even experts seem to underestimate the exponential pace of developments. This evolution doesn’t come without its challenges. Leaving aside talk about existential threats (for now), we focus on more immediate social economic challenges. Unlike earlier advances in technology, which primarily affected “routine” tasks, AI harbours the potential to automate knowledge workers’ “nonroutine” tasks like policymaking, reviewing, reflecting, coding and doing legal activities.
These developments have exacerbated social tensions, including issues of discrimination and concerns about the functioning of democratic governments. Vast sectors of the workforce are exposed to disruption. Author Yuval Harari illustrates the potential new market power: “Will the rest of the world just become algorithmic data colonies for AI-dominating countries?” Policymakers face a balancing act. They want to cultivate the flourishing of AI while concurrently safeguarding workers and consumers from potential harm. Otherwise, they will need to face the repercussions of a permanent AI divide between a) people embracing and augmenting AI and b) those that are merely replaced, potentially facing long-term joblessness and poverty. Yet, combined with the large data sets to which governments have access, AI has given policymakers new tools to tackle uncertainty and regulate social and economic priorities. As we delve into the dynamics of this pivotal concern, it’s crucial to approach the issue with empathy and a clear understanding of its potential implications for our society.
Job displacement
The capability of AI to automate tasks has stirred major worries about job displacement. AI and automation technologies can outperform humans in a broad array of tasks, from mundane manufacturing procedures to cognitively demanding tasks like data analysis. The real challenge involves the upskilling and reskilling of the workforce to adapt to new emerging roles. Absent adequate resources, individuals from less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds could miss these opportunities, exacerbating the AI divide.
Economic impact and inequality
The AI divide bears extensive economic repercussions, often amplifying pre-existing disparities, with the potential to intensify income inequality. High-skill labourers able to harness AI technologies could experience productivity and wage increases. In stark contrast, displaced low-skill workers may suffer income loss, aggravating wealth imbalances. Geographic discrepancies could also worsen. Regions that act as strongholds of high-tech industries may thrive, whereas those relying on industries prone to automation may face economic downturns. This geographical digital divide may result in divergent economic outcomes, with profound societal implications.
Digital divide
Fundamentally, the AI digital divide is an offshoot of the broader digital divide – the chasm separating those with access to information and communication technology (ICT) and those without. Access to AI technologies necessitates basic digital infrastructure, including internet connectivity and digital literacy. However, many global regions, particularly developing countries and rural areas, lack this essential infrastructure, which limits their capacity to exploit AI advancements. Even with technology access, digital literacy remains crucial. The competence to utilise and understand AI technologies is as vital as physical access, emphasising the need for digital education and training, particularly for marginalised communities.
Concentration of power
AI influences global power dynamics. “AI superpowers” command significant sway over global AI standards and norms, driven by a small number of mammoth tech corporations. This power concentration could exacerbate global inequalities, The additional risk of the AI black box is that it may lead firms—intentionally or not—to violate existing laws about bias, fraud, or antitrust, exposing themselves to legal or financial risk, and inflicting economic harm on workers and consumers. Illustrative of the concentration of power is the recent introduction of plugins for ChatGPT, a form of generative AI. Where people in the United States have widespread access to some of the beta features like “code interpreter” from OpenAI many months in advance, others had to wait their turn. In a similar example, Claude 2, another GPT platform, was only available to the US and UK markets at the time of this writing. Then there are organisations like the Khan Academy, that had access to the capabilities of ChatGPT well in advance of its release and smartly incorporated it into their AI personal tutor, “Khanmigo”.
A meaningful life
Lastly, for many, employment isn’t merely income generation. It also imparts purpose and identity. AI-induced displacement could trigger a loss of meaning, potentially causing large-scale psychological and societal impacts.
While AI has made notable strides in mimicking the efficiency of human intelligence in performing specific tasks, significant limitations remain. AI programs typically offer “specialised” intelligence, meaning they solve only one problem or execute one task at a time. In contrast, humans possess “generalised intelligence,” with problem-solving abilities, abstract thinking, and critical judgment that remain vital in the business sector. Human judgment is pertinent, if not in every task, but certainly throughout every level across all sectors. AI is unlikely to render redundant the workers that augment the technology, at least not in the foreseeable future. But those that cannot move to new meaningful work will struggle to keep up. The central issue should transition from “humans or computers” to “humans and computers” operating in complex systems that enhance industry and prosperity.
Ways to address the problem
The challenges posed by the AI digital divide call for comprehensive solutions emphasising equity, inclusion, and proactive strategies. Governments, businesses, and civil society must confront these issues collectively. Key measures to address these challenges and bridge the divide include:



Proposals to address the socio-economic challenges of AI




Economic redistribution and UBIIncentives to reduce costs and increase profits and shareholder value can direct companies away from a socially optimal split between automation and the use of technology to help workers. We need to discuss progressive taxation and wealth redistribution to alleviate the intensification of income inequalities and prevent social unrest. A universal basic income (UBI) can counter potential job displacement, ensuring individuals affected by automation can still meet their basic needs and halting further expansion of the AI divide. UBI can be funded by productivity gains in developed countries. The issue is, how can developing economies provide UBI when manufacturing, their main income stream, is likely to be automated back to the West?


Upskilling and reskillingGovernments and businesses should invest in training and job services so that employees disrupted by AI can transition effectively to new positions where their skills and experience are most applicable. There needs to be more clarity on what the jobs of the future will be, but a good starting point is to emphasise digital literacy, cognitive skills, creativity, a growth mindset and adaptability. Vulnerable groups and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds must have equal access to these programs. 


Publicly-funded AI research and procurementGiven their goal of maximising profits, firms are most likely to conduct research and deploy systems that will directly benefit their bottom line. As a result, the development and adoption of AI are likely to diverge from what would be optimal for workers’ wages and employment. This creates the need for government-funded research into AI applications that augment workers (help them do their jobs). Public bodies can also direct the development of AI that complements workers through their procurement of AI systems.


Digital infrastructure and literacyGovernments should prioritise the development of digital infrastructure, particularly in underserved regions. Access to affordable and reliable internet connectivity is critical for individuals to reap the benefits of AI advancements. Comprehensive digital literacy and future skills programs should be established to equip individuals with the skills to navigate and effectively use AI.




By taking decisive action on these fronts, our societies can start navigating the challenges of the digital divide and pave the way for an inclusive and equitable AI-driven future. The time for contemplation has passed; now is the moment for governments, businesses, and civil society to rise to the occasion and shape a future that benefits all.

Then last year, his wife told him he was a changed man, and left. She was pregnant at the time. “I lost my family,” he said.The petition filed by the moderators relates to a contract between OpenAI and Sama – a data annotation services company headquartered in California that employs content moderators around the world. While employed by Sama in 2021 and 2022 in Nairobi to review content for OpenAI, the content moderators allege, they suffered psychological trauma, low pay and abrupt dismissal.The 51 moderators in Nairobi working on Sama’s OpenAI account were tasked with reviewing texts, and some images, many depicting graphic scenes of violence, self-harm, murder, rape, necrophilia, child abuse, bestiality and incest, the petitioners say.The moderators say they weren’t adequately warned about the brutality of some of the text and images they would be tasked with reviewing, and were offered no or inadequate psychological support. Workers were paid between $1.46 and $3.74 an hour, according to a Sama spokesperson.When the contract with OpenAI was terminated eight months early, “we felt that we were left without an income, while dealing on the other hand with serious trauma”, said petitioner Richard Mathenge, 37. Immediately after the contract ended, petitioner Alex Kairu, 28, was offered a new role by Sama, labeling images of cars, but his mental health was deteriorating. He wishes someone had followed up to ask: “What are you dealing with? What are you going through?”OpenAI declined to comment for this story.View image in fullscreenOpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman. Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty ImagesSama said moderators had access to licensed mental health therapists on a 24/7 basis and received medical benefits to reimburse psychiatrists.In regards to the allegations of abrupt dismissal, the Sama spokesperson said the company gave full notice to employees that it was pulling out of the ChatGPT project, and were given the opportunity to participate in another project.“We are in agreement with those who call for fair and just employment, as it aligns with our mission – that providing meaningful, dignified, living wage work is the best way to permanently lift people out of poverty – and believe that we would already be compliant with any legislation or requirements that may be enacted in this space,” the Sama spokesperson said.The human labor powering AI’s boomSince ChatGPT arrived on the scene at the end of last year, the potential for generative AI to leave whole industries obsolete has petrified professionals. That fear, of automated supply chains and sentient machines, has overshadowed concerns in another arena: the human labor powering AI’s boom.Bots like ChatGPT are examples of large language models, a type of AI algorithm that teaches computers to learn by example. To teach Bard, Bing or ChatGPT to recognize prompts that would generate harmful materials, algorithms must be fed examples of hate speech, violence and sexual abuse. The work of feeding the algorithms examples is a growing business, and the data collection and labeling industry is expected to grow to over $14bn by 2030, according to GlobalData, a data analytics and consultancy firm.Much of that labeling work is performed thousands of miles from Silicon Valley, in east Africa, India, the Philippines, and even refugees living in Kenya’s Dadaab and Lebanon’s Shatila – camps with a large pool of multilingual workers who are willing to do the work for a fraction of the cost, said Srravya Chandhiramowuli, a researcher of data annotation at the University of London.Someone would say your content was more severe or grotesque than mine, and so at least I can have that as my remedyRichard MathengeNairobi in recent years has become a global hotspot for such work. An ongoing economic crisis, matched with Nairobi’s high rate of English speakers and mix of international workers from across Africa, make it a hub for cheap, multilingual and educated workers.The economic conditions allowed Sama to recruit young, educated Kenyans, desperate for work, said Mathenge. “This was our first, ideal job,” he said.During the week-long training to join the project, the environment was friendly and the content average, the petitioners said. “We didn’t suspect anything,” said Mathenge. But as the project progressed, text passages grew longer and the content more disturbing, he alleged.The task of data labeling is at best monotonous, and at worst, traumatizing, the petitioners said. While moderating ChatGPT, Okinyi read passages detailing parents raping their children and children having sex with animals. In sample passages read by the Guardian, text that appeared to have been lifted from chat forums, include descriptions of suicide attempts, mass-shooting fantasies and racial slurs.Mathenge’s team would end their days on a group call, exchanging stories of the horrors they’d read, he said. “Someone would say your content was more severe or grotesque than mine and so at least I can have that as my remedy,” he said. He remembers working in a secluded area of the office due to the nature of the work: “No one could see what we were working on,” he thought.Before moderating content for OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Kairu loved to DJ. Be it at churches or parties, interacting with different groups of people was his favorite part of the job. But since reviewing content from the internet’s darkest corners for more than a six-month period he has become introverted. His physical relationship with his wife has suffered, and he’s moved back in with his parents. “It has destroyed me completely,” he said.Several of the petitioners said they received little psychological support from Sama, an allegation the company disputes. “I tried to reach out to the [wellness] department to give indication of what exactly was taking place with the team, but they were very non-committal,” said Mathenge. Okinyi said counselors on offer didn’t understand the unique toll of content moderation, so sessions “were never productive”. Companies bear significant responsibilityAccording to its website, “Sama is driving an ethical AI supply chain that meaningfully improves employment and income outcomes.” Its clients include Google, Microsoft and Ebay, among other household names, and in 2021 was one of Forbes’s “AI 50 Companies to Watch”.It has really damaged my mental health. I lost my familyMophat OkinyiThe company has workers in several places in east Africa, including more than 3,500 Kenyans. Sama was formerly Meta’s largest provider of content moderators in Africa, until it announced in January it would be “discontinuing” its work with the giant. The news followed numerous lawsuits filed against both companies for alleged union-busting, unlawful dismissals and multiple violations of the Kenyan constitution.Sama canceled its contract with OpenAI in March 2022, eight months early, “to focus on our core competency of computer vision data annotation solutions”, the Sama spokesperson said. The announcement coincided with an investigation by Time, detailing how nearly 200 young Africans in Sama’s Nairobi datacenter had been confronted with videos of murders, rapes, suicides and child sexual abuse as part of their work, earning as little as $1.50 an hour while doing so.But now, former ChatGPT moderators are calling for new legislation to regulate how “harmful and dangerous technology work” is outsourced in Kenya, and for existing laws to “include the exposure to harmful content as an occupation hazard”, according to the petition. They also want to investigate how the ministry of labor has failed to protect Kenyan youth from outsourcing companies.Kenya’s ministry of labor declined to comment on the petition.But companies like OpenAI bear a significant responsibility too, said Cori Crider, director of Foxglove, a non-profit legal NGO that is supporting the case. “Content moderators work for tech companies like OpenAI and Facebook in all but name,” Crider said in a statement. “The outsourcing of these workers is a tactic by tech companies to distance themselves from the awful working conditions content moderators endure.”Crider said she did not expect the Kenyan government to respond to the petition anytime soon. She wants to see an investigation into the pay, mental health support and working conditions of all content moderation and data labeling offices in Kenya, plus greater protections for what she considers to be an “essential workforce”.Beyond the petition, glimpses of potential regulation are growing. In May, the first trade union for content moderators in Africa was formed, when 150 social media content moderators from TikTok, YouTube, Facebook and ChatGPT met in Nairobi. And while outsourced workers are not legal employees of their clients, in a landmark ruling last month, employment court judge Byram Ongaya ruled that Meta is the “true employer” of its moderators in Kenya.It remains unclear to whom OpenAI currently outsources their content moderation work.To move forward, it helps Okinyi to think of ChatGPT’s users that he has protected. “I consider myself a soldier and soldiers take bullets for the good of the people,” he says. Despite the potential for bullet wounds to stay forever, he considers himself a hero.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)KenyaMetaOpenAIComputingChatGPTfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceNursing home owner who left 800 people in warehouse during Hurricane Ida avoids jail time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interest in generative AI has skyrocketed across job functions this year, and technical roles are no exception.
In recent research by Stack Overflow, 70% of more than 67,000 professional developers surveyed were already using or planning to use AI tools. But as the initial hype begins to fade, the need for realistic evaluation of generative AI's capabilities is becoming clear: In the same group, less than 3% of respondents reported a high level of trust in AI output.







Integrating AI into enterprise tech workflows is complex, requiring careful evaluation of the potential risks and benefits. And as use of generative AI becomes more common, organizations' technical hiring processes and internal policies will need to evolve accordingly.

Employers are seeking out expertise with generative AI tools
Familiarity with generative AI is emerging as a valuable skill for technical roles such as software development, engineering and data science. This includes both conceptual understanding of how the technology works as well as hands-on experience with tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot.
As companies' digital transformations progress, the demand for tech talent continues to exceed supply. Used judiciously, generative AI could enhance technical employees' productivity by reducing time spent on repetitive tasks such as writing boilerplate code, helping to mitigate that skills gap.
""The demand for people who can use large language models on the job effectively will shoot up,"" said Dan Finnigan, CEO of technical hiring platform Filtered.
However, using AI effectively requires recognizing its limitations. Tools for developers and engineers are still more experimental than production ready, necessitating close human oversight.
""It's kind of like having a junior engineer sitting right next to you who has a lot of knowledge, [but] might not necessarily know how to deploy it,"" said Preeti Kaur, head of engineering at Honor, a home care network and technology platform.
Users of generative AI need sufficient knowledge to recognize when a model's output is incorrect. If engineers can't reliably identify and fix a tool's inevitable errors, or if a model produces low-quality output too often, organizations could lose any potential productivity gains to debugging flawed AI-written code.
""We're trying to solve for productivity,"" said Bhawna Singh, CTO of Customer Identity Cloud at Okta, an identity and access management company. ""We don't want to turn the cycle back.""


The growing demand for AI, data science and infrastructure skills
In addition to proficiency with generative AI tools themselves, the AI boom is also likely to drive demand for skills related to building and managing those systems.
Generative AI-related listings on job portal Indeed have more than doubled since 2021. And the broader job market for AI, machine learning (ML) and data science roles is also expanding: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment of data scientists will grow by 36% between 2021 and 2031.
Recent months have seen enterprise interest in private, customized LLMs trained on industry-specific and proprietary data sets. Skills related to tailoring models to organizational architectures and data are therefore likely to become particularly valuable moving forward.
An internal model would be an appealing use case for a company like Okta, Singh said -- for example, an LLM trained on Okta's extensive data on authentication, authorization and threat actors' attack techniques. ""That will be certainly one skill set that we would look into,"" she said.
Similarly, if widespread AI adoption continues, companies will need IT teams that can manage the underlying infrastructure for AI systems. Large generative models are often resource-intensive and computationally expensive.
To manage those deployments, knowing how to efficiently plan resource use and manage IT infrastructure is crucial. To build and maintain the IT architecture required to run AI at scale, organizations will need employees with skills such as cloud cost management, efficient systems design and hardware optimization.



New skills and even job roles have also emerged as a result of generative AI. At some organizations, prompt engineering -- the practice of crafting instructions for AI systems that elicit the best possible results -- is a new position in its own right. But it's also a valuable skill outside of specialized AI roles.
""Getting comfortable with the prompts ... and making [generative AI] useful for your use cases, I think that's general know-how,"" Singh said. ""It's certainly something that everyone will have to embrace, whether you are in engineering or not, or whether you are in the ML space or not.""
Understanding how to get the most out of generative models is key to maximizing such tools' usefulness, but it also evinces skills like creativity and problem-solving. ""I feel like every engineer has to have some kind of a prompt engineering mindset now,"" Kaur said.
The Filtered platform is introducing job simulations designed to test candidates' prompt engineering abilities, Finnigan said. Employers can evaluate candidates' creativity and persistence through how they approach the task of writing effective prompts, including iteratively revising their input in response to mistakes or unexpected output.


Generative AI's effects on technical hiring
While generative AI skills are increasingly sought after, the technology itself poses unique challenges for technical hiring.
It remains difficult to reliably identify generative AI output. Consistently accurate tools for detecting AI-generated code don't yet exist, and attempts to create AI text detectors have so far been disappointing. OpenAI, for example, recently took down a classifier intended to differentiate between human- and AI-generated text, citing its ""low rate of accuracy.""
This creates a new challenge in technical hiring: knowing whether a candidate wrote code themselves or instead relied on ChatGPT or a similar tool. Overdependence on generative AI could cause problems down the line if a candidate misrepresents their skills and can't keep up with the complexity of real-world enterprise environments.
One solution could be to reduce emphasis on unmonitored coding challenges in favor of in-person whiteboarding or supervised technical assessments. And asking nuanced follow-up questions can help employers gauge a candidate's analytical skills and knowledge of underlying concepts.
At Okta, for example, interviewees might be asked to explain their reasoning or compare alternative approaches to a problem, such as optimizing for memory versus performance, Singh said. If a candidate can confidently answer those questions, she doesn't view using generative AI as a problem; in fact, it might even be a positive, signaling creativity and openness to experimentation.
If a candidate can't competently explain or modify their AI-generated code, ""then yes, that's not the engineer we need,"" she said. ""Because now you have someone who's just using it without understanding, and that's scary and that's concerning. But if you're understanding it ... I would personally say it's OK.""
Finnigan shared a similar sentiment. Filtered's platform now signals to employers when a job candidate uses ChatGPT during a technical assessment. (Currently, the software only tracks ChatGPT use, though Finnigan anticipates that Filtered will eventually need to provide information on use of alternative tools such as GitHub Copilot or Tabnine.)
But if a candidate does use ChatGPT during the hiring process, that shouldn't automatically be a red flag, Finnigan said. What matters is how a candidate incorporates generative AI into their thinking and coding process as a problem-solving tool.
""The purpose of the recruiting process is to determine whether [a candidate] can code and whether they write good code -- and, if they can, whether they can solve problems,"" he said. ""And if they can, then they'll probably be really good at using generative AI in a productive way.""


Responsibly integrating generative AI into technical workflows
Generative AI has substantial promise for tech employees' productivity if it's implemented carefully. For organizations, the key is to minimize risk without discouraging innovation.
Singh encourages leaders to be realistic: Developers and engineers typically want to experiment with new tools and platforms, which means that outright banning use of generative AI might not be desirable or even achievable.
""That's not the space we live in in tech,"" she said. ""Accepting the hype, looking into it and giving guidance -- that's the goal.""
And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Attempting to ignore generative AI entirely might be riskier than allowing use within agreed-upon parameters. If no guidance is provided, employees could end up using a range of different AI tools without their employer's knowledge, creating security vulnerabilities and fragmented IT environments.
Leadership can get ahead of the problem by proactively setting expectations for appropriate AI use at the organizational level and developing internal policies accordingly. Generative AI tools are still in their early days, and security, ethics and copyright concerns loom over corporate deployments. Together, these considerations mean that open communication and clear guidance are essential.
""I think it is on leadership to now take that hype ... and create guidance and guardrails,"" Singh said. ""To say, 'This is what is OK, this is what [we're] still figuring out, and this is not OK.'""
Developing ways to handle incorrect AI output -- a phenomenon known as hallucination -- and rigorous evaluation frameworks will also be key to successful enterprise adoption of generative AI. Currently, Kaur advocates small-scale, incremental implementation only after extensive human evaluation, including thoroughly testing edge cases.
""Having guardrails and having some idea of evaluation before you start using any of these tools is very important, because I personally don't think much is enterprise ready out there,"" she said.
At Honor, Kaur said that engineering teams have experimented with generative AI tools including GitHub Copilot and Sourcegraph's Cody. And although she's optimistic about their potential, especially Cody, she emphasized that extensive research and experimentation are needed before production deployments. Ongoing monitoring capabilities and consistently accurate results are especially critical in healthcare contexts like Honor's, where mistakes can directly affect patients' lives.
""It's not just about how fast you can process something, it's about how reliably you can process something,"" Kaur said. ""And then, how do you keep checking that it's still doing what you wanted it to do?""

Generative AI will change, but not replace, many of the jobs now held by employees in the U.S., McKinsey found in its 2023 report “Generative AI and the future of work in America.”
Generative AI could open up more time for high-value work
Generative AI may increase U.S. labor production, McKinsey found. It could increase productivity by 0.5% to 0.9% annually through 2030. Generative AI is included in a pool of wider automation technology in the survey as well. Total productivity growth could increase by 3% to 4% annually with all automation technologies taken into account.
That’s compared to productivity growth of 1.4% in the U.S. since 2005. The growth is “quite extraordinary,” Gurneet Singh Dandona, a report author and senior expert at McKinsey & Company, told TechRepublic.
However, there are caveats. The 3% to 4% estimate depends on a “midpoint” of adoption, which will require enthusiastic adoption by both public and private stakeholders. Another possible pain point is the time it will take employees to learn and become comfortable with new tools.
The report pointed out the importance of guidelines like the White House’s voluntary agreement with generative AI makers and the industry’s Frontier Model Forum.

“When machines take over dull or unpleasant tasks, people can be left with more interesting work that requires creativity, problem-solving, and collaborating with others,” wrote report authors Kweilin Ellingrud, Saurabh Sanghvi, Gurneet Singh Dandona, Anu Madgavkar, Michael Chui, Olivia White and Paige Hasebe.
“Workers will need to gain proficiency with these tools and, importantly, use the time that is freed up to focus on higher-value activities. When managers automate more of their administrative and reporting tasks, for example, they can spend more time on strategic thinking and coaching,” the McKinsey report stated.
“Generative AI can compose technical writing, but writers will still need to adapt, report, edit, think, and apply real-world judgment,” Dandona said. “Currently, these tools might be best used to produce first drafts in creative fields — but assistance with first drafts is itself a significant productivity lift.”
It’s more complex than ‘AI will take jobs’
The fields most exposed to generative AI are expected to add jobs through 2030, albeit slower than comparable jobs, the report found.
Dandona pointed out that the report is not supposed to be a short-term prediction about jobs, as it doesn’t take into account regular fluctuations in the business world. Instead, it’s a “long-term scenario,” he said.

STEM jobs will see both increasing demand for workers and a high degree of changes to their day-to-day work due to AI and automation, McKinsey said. How exactly everyday work will change depends on both individual choice and industry trends. “The biggest impact for knowledge workers that we can state with certainty is that generative AI is likely to significantly change their mix of work activities,” the report stated.
The fields most likely to be both affected by AI and see a decrease in demand are customer service/sales and office support. However, several fields that can expect to see tasks transform as generative AI is applied to them — STEM and also business/legal professionals, creatives and educators — will see an increase in demand.

Automation overall was estimated to take over tasks, accounting for 21.5% of the hours worked in U.S. jobs by 2030. Including generative AI in that mix increases the share of automated time to 29.5%.
Countries across the world are working on establishing regulations around generative AI for other reasons outside of the shift in labor, including concerns about privacy, inaccuracies and use of copyrighted material.
Demand for STEM workers expected to increase
“There’s a big fear that AI is going to eliminate lawyers or writers, or, [that] it’s going to take a lot of those jobs,” said Sanjay Poonen, CEO of Cohesity (and former COO of VMware), in an interview with TechRepublic. “It’s the same way as when everyone thought about the automobile or anything that came in that ultimately made people more productive.”
While healthcare is the area expected to open up the most jobs in the future, tech is also hiring, despite the high-profile layoffs this year. McKinsey estimates a 23% increase in demand for STEM jobs by 2030. After all, it reasons that “companies of all sizes and sectors” need people who know tech and those who can help expand companies’ existing digital transformations. Tech workers will be in demand in fields like banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals and healthcare.
“I view generative AI especially as an extremely powerful tool to help you get a first draft of something better,” Poonen said. “If generative AI and ChatGPT could be used to help me get a first draft, it makes me more productive as opposed to being viewed that technology eliminates somebody’s job.”

At a time when there are growing concerns about people losing jobs to AI, companies like Bayt.com is planning to integrate generative AI to create more opportunities for job seekers.
Companies are constantly striving to adapt and innovate to meet the ever-changing demands of their users and stakeholders. Bayt.com, one of the leading job portals in the Middle East, is a prime example of how a company can successfully undergo a digital transformation to stay ahead in the competitive market. Bayt.com bridges the gap between job seekers and employers by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
Syed Atif Ali, Director of Infrastructure – Bayt.com
“We are continuously working on integrating AI into the user journey for both job seekers and employers. AI will play a significant role in providing a personalised experience, enhancing recommendations, and improving search functionalities.

Employers can leverage AI-powered tools to quickly identify and connect with candidates who possess the right skills and qualifications, significantly reducing the time and effort spent on sifting through resumes. The scalability and cost-effectiveness provided by cloud computing ensure that employers can handle varying levels of job applications without compromising the user experience
With projects focusing on generative AI and auto-detection, Bayt.com’s users can expect AI-driven features in the future, ensuring a more efficient and intuitive job search experience.


As the digital landscape expands, so do the challenges of managing infrastructure and handling fluctuating traffic demands. Bayt.com recognised the need for a robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure to cater to their growing user base. Cloud computing emerged as a vital component of their digital transformation.
Bayt.com’s approach to cloud computing has been cloud-agnostic, meaning they designed their application architecture in a way that allows them to move between different cloud providers based on their needs. Eventually, they migrated to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to leverage its benefits fully.
“To cater to traffic and provide a secure and scalable infrastructure, we rely on cloud computing as a crucial part of our digital transformation. Currently, we have migrated to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which fulfilled our requirements for data residency, data locality, performance, and cost-effectiveness,” said Ali.


For a company operating in the Middle East, data residency is a critical concern, as it involves adhering to local regulations and ensuring data is stored within specific geographical boundaries. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure addressed this concern for Bayt.com by establishing a presence in the Middle East. This allowed Bayt.com to comply with local regulations while offering a safe and secure platform for its users.
“One of the key challenges we faced was data residency. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure addressed this concern with its presence in the Middle East, allowing us to comply with local regulations. The transition to OCI helped us overcome this hurdle, ensuring data residency and meeting the necessary security and compliance standards,” said Ali.
For a platform like Bayt.com that deals with sensitive user data, security and compliance are of paramount importance. By migrating to Oracle Cloud, Bayt.com benefits from the secure hosting infrastructure provided by OCI, meeting all the required information security standards.
“Additionally, as tenants of this infrastructure, we ensure that our application is also designed securely to provide a safe and reliable user experience,” emphasised Ali.
The journey of Bayt.com’s digital transformation serves as an inspiring example of how AI and cloud computing can drive innovation, enhance user experiences, and address critical challenges faced by businesses in the modern era. Bayt.com ensures that it continues to be the go-to platform for job seekers and employers in the Middle East, providing them with the tools and resources needed to connect, grow, and succeed in the dynamic job market.

Economic potential of Generative AI: A unique opportunity for Businesses

ShareTweetThe impact of Generative AIEnterprise value with Generative AIBusiness opportunities with Generative AI
Generative AI has recently seen tremendous momentum and advances, becoming a powerful tool for transforming all sectors and industries.
These advances have created new avenues for innovation and opened the door to unprecedentedly complex problem-solving. It transforms how we interact with these models and work, communicate, and create. As such, like other revolutionary technologies of a few years ago, it will affect the global economy in various ways, driving economic growth and the way we work. We analyze the data and the main characteristics of this revolution.
The impact of Generative AI
According to a study by McKinsey, “the impact of generative AI on productivity could add trillions of dollars of value to the global economy.” They estimate that it would add the equivalent of $2.6 billion to $4.4 billion annually across the 63 use cases they analyzed.
This would increase the impact of all artificial intelligence by 15-40%, and this estimate would double if the impact of incorporating generative AI into software currently used for other tasks beyond the use cases analyzed is included.
Generative AI will have a very large impact across all sectors, but especially in four areas: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D.

It is a technology that can potentially change the anatomy of work, increasing the capabilities of workers by automating many of their tasks, saving them up to 60-70% of the time they spend. Given the increased potential of technical automation, it is likely to accelerate the pace of workforce transformation.
In fact, it is estimated that current adoption scenarios lead one to believe that half of all work activities could be automated between 2030 and 2060. It also can potentially increase global GDP by a staggering 7%, which will have a huge impact.
Enterprise value with Generative AI
Generative AI has the potential to substantially increase labor productivity across the economy, but for that to happen, investment must be made in supporting workers as they change jobs.
This technology represents a step change in the evolution of AI, and as companies implement it in their businesses, they are beginning to realize the potential it can have for both the economy and society.
The business potential of generative AI lies in its ability to automate and streamline creative processes, thus saving time and resources. It is also a democratized technology available to all, which lowers the barriers to accessing it. Now anyone can take advantage of its capabilities and become a creator.
Therefore, we are facing a major shift in the workforce, where production processes within the economy are changing, as well as the tasks that are performed and the skills needed to succeed in business.
Given the ability of generative AI to deliver results in a wide variety of formats (text, image, code, etc.), the possibilities are endless.

By learning from large amounts of data, generative AI helps to create new content or reduce the time and cost of conceptualizing it. It opens up new use cases in fields such as marketing, product design, journalism, etc. Coca-Cola, for example, has shared the use of this technology to create ad copy at scale, giving them higher performance and significant time savings.
It also has a major impact on the scientific and pharmaceutical sectors, speeding up and reducing costs in research processes. Its ability to analyze large datasets helps to develop and test hypotheses quickly and more cost-effectively, thus reducing, for example, the time needed to design new drugs.
In education, AI is being introduced in classrooms to improve educational outcomes. Japan recently announced that it will allow students to use generative AI to facilitate class discussions and art activities. Even when planning lessons or curricula, it is tremendously useful for creating personalized learning experiences based on algorithmic analysis of students’ learning patterns and preferences.
Business opportunities with Generative AI
Regardless of the sector, generative AI has the ability to digest and summarise large amounts of information. This technology helps make data more useful and easier to interpret.
It also brings huge productivity benefits for workers in administrative fields, reducing their workloads and allowing them to focus on more complex or more challenging jobs.

The Impact of Generative AI on the Future of Work: 5 Key Insights from the McKinsey Report

By Niharika Singh -   August 3, 2023

The transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already begun to reshape the job landscape, and according to the McKinsey report “The State of AI in 2023: Generative AI’s Breakout Year,” this trend is only set to accelerate. The report highlights key insights into the potential changes in the job market, emphasizing the need for adaptability and preparedness among workers and industries. In this article, we delve into these five crucial insights from the report, shedding light on the implications of Generative AI on the workforce.
1. Job Displacement on the Horizon:
McKinsey’s report predicts that by 2030, approximately 12 million people in the US will need to transition into new job roles as Generative AI advances. Automation, driven by generative AI technology, is expected to replace many routine and repetitive tasks across various industries. While this may lead to enhanced productivity and efficiency, it also challenges the workforce to adapt and reskill.

2. Shifting Job Patterns:
The report highlights a significant trend in recent job changes in the US. Over half of the 8.6 million job transitions observed were people moving away from roles in food service, customer service, office support, and production. These roles are particularly susceptible to automation as they often involve repetitive and predictable tasks that can be efficiently performed by AI systems. The workforce’s response to these shifts will determine the pace of transformation in the job market.

3. Generative AI’s Potential to Automate Jobs:
Generative AI’s capabilities are poised to disrupt the job market significantly. The report suggests that by 2030, up to 30% of jobs could be automated by this technology. This automation is likely to impact various sectors, including manufacturing, finance, and customer service, among others. However, it’s important to note that automation doesn’t necessarily mean job elimination; instead, it might entail the transformation of job roles and the creation of new opportunities.

4. The Duality of Generative AI’s Impact:
While Generative AI can automate many jobs in fields like Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM), healthcare, construction, and other professional domains, it also presents opportunities for growth in these industries. For instance, Generative AI can assist healthcare professionals in diagnostics and treatment planning, enhancing patient care. In construction, AI can optimize building designs and streamline project management, increasing efficiency.

5. Contrasting Employment Trends:
The McKinsey report highlights the differing growth trajectories across industries. Healthcare, STEM, and construction sectors are experiencing job growth, driven by technological advancements and an aging population’s increasing demand for healthcare services. However, the report also reveals that office support and customer service jobs are declining, largely due to automation and digitalization.

The McKinsey report paints a comprehensive picture of the potential impact of Generative AI on the job market by 2030. While automation presents challenges for certain sectors, it also offers transformative opportunities for growth and efficiency. The future of work will undoubtedly be shaped by the adaptability of the workforce and the ability of industries to leverage AI technologies responsibly.
As we embrace the AI-driven future, it becomes crucial for workers to reskill and upskill themselves, ensuring they stay relevant and agile in a dynamic job market. Additionally, businesses and policymakers must collaboratively devise strategies to support workers through these transitions, enabling them to seize new opportunities in an AI-powered world.

There’s a lot of angst about software developers “losing their jobs” to AI, being replaced by a more intelligent version of ChatGPT, GitHub’s Copilot, Google’s foundation model Codey, or something similar. 
AI startup founder Matt Welsh has been talking and writing about the end of programming. He’s asking whether large language models (LLMs) eliminate programming as we know it, and he’s excited that the answer is “yes”: Eventually, if not in the immediate future.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



But what does this mean in practice?  What does this mean for people who earn their living from writing software?
The value in new programming skills
Some companies will certainly value AI as a tool for replacing human effort rather than for augmenting human capabilities. Programmers who work for those companies risk losing their jobs to AI. If you work for one of those organizations, I’m sorry for you, but it’s really an opportunity. 
Despite the well-publicized layoffs, the job market for programmers is great, it’s likely to remain great, and you’re probably better off finding an employer who doesn’t see you as an expense to be minimized. It’s time to learn some new skills and find an employer who really values you.
But the number of programmers who are “replaced by AI” will be small. Here’s why, and here’s how the use of AI will change the discipline as a whole. I did a very non-scientific study of the amount of time programmers actually spend writing code. 
OK, I just typed “How much of a software developer’s time is spent coding” into the search bar and looked at the top few articles, which gave percentages ranging from 10% to 40%. My own sense, from talking to and observing many people over the years, falls into the lower end of that range: 15% to 20%. 
Time for “the rest of the job”
ChatGPT won’t make the 20% of time programmers spend writing code disappear completely. You still have to write prompts, and we’re all in the process of learning that if you want ChatGPT to do a good job, the prompts have to be very detailed. 
How much time and effort does that save? I’ve seen estimates as high as 80%, but I don’t believe them; I think 25% to 50% is more reasonable. If 20% of your time is spent coding, and AI-based code generation makes you 50% more efficient, then you’re really only getting about 10% of your time back. 
You can use it to produce more code — I’ve yet to see a programmer who was underworked, or who wasn’t up against an impossible delivery date. Or you can spend more time on the “rest of the job,” the 80% of your time that wasn’t spent writing code. 
Some of that time is spent in pointless meetings, but much of “the rest of the job” is understanding the user’s needs, designing, testing, debugging, reviewing code, finding out what the user really needs (that they didn’t tell you the first time), refining the design, building an effective user interface, auditing for security and so on. It’s a lengthy list.
Programmers needed: AI lacks design skillsadvertisement
That “rest of the job” (particularly the “user’s needs” part) is something our industry has never been particularly good at. Design — of the software itself, the user interfaces and the data representation — is certainly not going away and isn’t something the current generation of AI is very good at. 
We’ve come a long way, but I don’t know anyone who hasn’t had to rescue code that was best described as a “seething mass of bits.” Testing and debugging — well, if you’ve played with ChatGPT much, you know that testing and debugging won’t disappear. AIs generate incorrect code, and that’s not going to end soon. 
Security auditing will only become more important, not less; it’s very hard for a programmer to understand the security implications of code they didn’t write. Spending more time on these things — and leaving the details of pushing out lines of code to an AI — will surely improve the quality of the products we deliver.
Prompting a different form of programmingadvertisement
Now, let’s take a really long-term view. Let’s assume that Welsh is right and that programming as we know it will disappear — not tomorrow, but sometime in the next 20 years. Does it really disappear? 
A couple of weeks ago, I showed Tim O’Reilly some of my experiments with Ethan and Lilach Mollick’s prompts for using AI in the classroom. His reaction was: “This prompt is really programming.” He’s right. 
Writing a detailed prompt really is just a different form of programming. You’re still telling a computer what you want it to do, step by step. And I realized that after spending 20 years complaining that programming hasn’t changed significantly since the 1970s, ChatGPT has suddenly taken that next step. 
It isn’t a step towards some new paradigm, whether functional, object-oriented or hyperdimensional. I expected the next step in programming languages to be visual, but it isn’t that either. It’s a step towards a new kind of programming that doesn’t require a formally defined syntax or semantics. Programming without virtual punch cards. Programming that doesn’t require you to spend half your time looking up the names and parameters of library functions that you’ve forgotten about.
Understanding problems in depth — not counting lines of code
In the best of all possible words, that might bring the time spent actually writing code down to zero or close to it. But that best case only saves 20% of a programmer’s time. Furthermore, it doesn’t really eliminate programming. It changes it — possibly making programmers more efficient and definitely giving programmers more time to talk to users, understand the problems they face and design good, secure systems for solving those problems. 
Counting lines of code is less important than understanding problems in depth and figuring out how to solve them — but that’s nothing new. Twenty years ago, the Agile Manifesto pointed in this direction, valuing:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

AI incorporated: Programmers working directly with customers
Despite 23 years of “agile practices,” customer collaboration has always been shortchanged. Without engaging with customers and users, Agile quickly collapses to a set of rituals. Will freeing programmers from syntax actually yield more time to collaborate with customers and respond to change? 
To prepare for this future, programmers will need to learn more about working directly with customers and designing software that meets their needs. That’s an opportunity, not a disaster. Programmers have labored too long under the stigma of being neckbeards who can’t and shouldn’t be allowed to talk to humans. It’s time to reject that stereotype and build software as if people mattered.
AI isn’t something to be feared. Writing about OpenAI’s new Code Interpreter plug-in (gradually rolling out now), Ethan Mollick says, “My time becomes more valuable, not less, as I can concentrate on what is important, rather than the rote.” 
AI is something to be learned, tested and incorporated into programming practices so that programmers can spend more time on what’s really important: Understanding and solving problems. The endpoint of this revolution won’t be an unemployment line; it will be better software. The only thing to be feared is failing to make that transition.
Programming isn’t going to go away. It’s going to change, and those changes will be for the better.

When OpenAI launched the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT for public use on Nov. 30, the S&P 500 was worth $5 trillion less than now, tech spending was deep in a post-pandemic hangover, and the economy appeared headed for recession or persistent high inflation.

Don't Just Buy AI Stocks. Here's How To Find The True AI Winners.




That single day provided just an inkling of generative AI's potential for transformative impact. The S&P 500 shot up more than 3% as tech stocks with artificial intelligence products rumbled. OpenAI investor Microsoft (MSFT) leapt 6%, and AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) climbed 8%. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) also jumped 6% that day, and Meta Platforms (META) ran up nearly 8%.
Now the tech hangover is giving way to a new ""gold rush,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives argues. Ives thinks ChatGPT opened the door to another $1 trillion in artificial intelligence-related spending over the coming decade that wasn't on Wall Street's radar.
And the economic impact could prove even more far-reaching. Some analysts are even talking about a new Roaring '20s fueled by AI. Experts say generative AI could launch a surge in productivity after a 17-year slump. A productivity pickup couldn't come at a better time, as a worker shortage, an aging population and deglobalization fan inflationary pressures.
""We are in desperate need of a new source of growth,"" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a June 14 report. ""Despite near-term pessimism, we remain enthusiastic about AI's potential to change the nature of our economies,"" they wrote, calling it ""an immense source of optimism"" as the decade progresses.
The consensus is that generative AI will change the world. But productivity growth has sputtered through recent waves of new technology, including the Apple (AAPL) iPhone, cloud computing and robotics. Why should this time be different? And what might stand in the way of a productivity boom and S&P 500 bull run?
Generative AI Productivity Boom
Generative AI could boost U.S. labor productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points per year for a decade, Goldman Sachs economists predict. That would double the lackluster 1.4% rate since 2005. Goldman says S&P 500 profit margins could widen by four percentage points, which would be a huge increase from the 12% average over the past few years. Global GDP could grow by an extra 7 percentage point, or $7 trillion, over the same period.
Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for UBS Global Wealth Management in the Americas, says increased investment spurred by generative AI strengthens the case for a secular bull market that's ""comparable to the Roaring 1920s.""
That could mean ""sustained growth above 2%, falling inflation, strong employment gains, rapidly rising productivity and revolutionary technological change.""
The lightning-fast adoption of ChatGPT, which gained its first 100 million users in a record-shattering two months, partly explains the conviction that the U.S. is on the cusp of a productivity boom.
Goldman economists figure that technological advances begin to yield broad productivity gains in the 10 years after half of businesses adopt a technology.
If earnings calls are an indication, that threshold could arrive quickly. Just 53 S&P 500 firms mentioned artificial intelligence in Q3 calls, before ChatGPT's release. That jumped to 110 by Q1, according to FactSet.
That huge interest and rapid takeup reflect not just generative AI's potential but the relatively low barriers to adoption. Unlike the branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning, generative AI responds to natural language commands.

Artificial Intelligence News And AI Stocks To Watch

Generative AI Vs. Machine Learning
For routine, repetitive tasks, such as some manufacturing work, computers can be programmed with explicit instructions. Advances in machine learning in the last decade have enabled automation of complex tasks. That means programming a computer to recognize patterns in specialized data sets in order to make accurate predictions. Among the early successes were computers reading CT scans and producing diagnoses. Self-driving cars, which use data from sensors and cameras to predict the next movement of other vehicles and pedestrians, are an example of machine learning AI with a more mixed record of success so far.
Generative AI is seen as potentially world-changing because it aims to automate something thought to be beyond reach: creative content.
Instead of training with a focus on specialized data, GPT-3.5, the brains behind the ChatGPT chatbot, soaked up a big chunk of the books, articles and websites on the internet to create what is known as a large language model. On top of that, it is trained to try and fool humans from thinking its output is computer-generated.
Some people have described ChatGPT as an advanced autocomplete. Instead of just suggesting the next word, it can offer up a cover letter, essay, story, marketing pitch, travel itinerary or legal brief.
Goldman Sachs economists estimate that 44% of legal work could be automated via generative AI.
But generative AI isn't limited to responding in natural language. It can also generate images, computer code and complex designs.
How Will AI Change Knowledge Work?
Microsoft's GitHub Copilot leverages OpenAI's latest GPT-4 large language model to turn software developers' prompts into snippets of code, speeding up their work by 55%, according to an internal study published last year.
A 2022 paper from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center hailed AI-enabled generative design as ""a paradigm shift in the design process."" Highlighting OpenAI's DALL-E foundation model that turns natural language prompts into images, the paper explained how engineers working with Autodesk Fusion 360 software designed optical instruments in a tenth of the typical time, while improving the instruments' performance.
Engineering, architecture and even drug discovery are all fields where generative AI is already making an imprint.
There's a common thread with most of these new applications, according to a McKinsey & Co. analysis.
""Generative AI's impact is likely to most transform the work of higher-wage knowledge workers because of advances in the technical automation potential of their activities, which were previously considered to be relatively immune from automation,"" McKinsey found.
Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani conclude that ""generative AI could substitute up to one-fourth of current work.""
A study by OpenAI arrives at a similar place, finding that 49% of today's jobs could have half or more of their tasks accomplished with generative AI. The authors note, however, that complementary software, such as Casetext for lawyers, and human overseers are needed to catch factual mistakes and avert other issues.

Still, such estimates may understate the coming impact on work. That's because they omit ongoing efforts to automate hands-on work in industries such as manufacturing, logistics and transportation via nongenerative AI, or machine learning, and robotics.
Long before ChatGPT made its stunning entrance, McKinsey researchers in 2019 had envisioned that 50% of today's work activities could be automated by 2055. Now that generative AI has opened a door to automating knowledge work, McKinsey has moved up that timeline by a decade to 2045.
Such predictions come with a wide margin of error, partly because earlier productivity booms were slow to materialize. The advent of personal computers in the late 1970s, followed by spreadsheets in the early '80s, seemed to be a productivity miracle. But statistics didn't begin to back that up until the mid-1990s.
""It was not until the world's computers were integrated into what eventually became the Internet that the true potential of computers was realized,"" wrote Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research.
The release of the Netscape Navigator browser in 1994 unleashed the potential of the internet and opened the door to new business models, Marcelli of UBS wrote.
She sees ChatGPT playing a similar role, ""bringing AI to the masses in an accessible and intuitive way.""
Berezin sees reason to think predictions about the impact of generative AI may actually prove too timid.

Generative AI Reflects 'Exponential' Progression
""They extrapolate linearly from what AI can do today to what it can do tomorrow,"" Berezin said. ""But AI's progression is following an exponential curve, not a linear one.""
OpenAI says that its latest GPT-4 model, released in March on a subscription basis, scored in the top 10% of test takers in a simulated bar exam. The GPT-3.5 model that's behind ChatGPT scored in the bottom 10%.
GPT-4's training covered 1 petabyte of material, or more than 20 times the material mastered by GPT-3.5.
Token limits are another measure of generative AI's usefulness. ChatGPT has a limit of 4,096 tokens. That means it can process queries and generate responses with only that many tokens. A typical token may be a letter, word, number, punctuation mark or other symbol. Once a conversation reaches that threshold, ChatGPT resets, which is why it's said to have no short-term memory.
OpenAI's GPT-4 model was introduced with more than 8,000 tokens, allowing deeper analysis. In May, AI startup Anthropic introduced the latest version of its Claude generative AI model with a 100,000-token limit. That equates to roughly 75,000 words, enabling the analysis of SEC 10-K filings, for example.
Massive Demand For AI Chips
The generative AI model behind ChatGPT, already left in the dust by newer models, required 10,000 Nvidia graphics chips to train ahead of its deployment, according to UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri.
Yet the far-bigger expense, known as inference costs, comes from tapping into that artificial brain power with user queries. ""The costs to inference ChatGPT exceed the training costs on a weekly basis,"" according to the SemiAnalysis research firm.
Alphabet chairman John Hennessy has said that queries using Google's Bard AI chatbot cost the company 10 times as much as regular Google search. SemiAnalysis' work suggests that's an understatement.
The cost of using generative AI means that companies must expect a payoff, such as more revenue, labor and other expense savings, or both.
Wall Street is betting that those payoffs are coming. Morgan Stanley analysts see the market for AI semiconductors tripling from $43 billion to $125 billion over the next three years. The broader AI technology market should grow from $90 billion today to $275 billion by 2027.
In late May, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in revenue for the July-ended second quarter, crushing estimates for $7.2 billion, largely on AI chip demand.
Microsoft's AI Ramp
On July 18, Microsoft announced it will charge $30 per month for Microsoft 365 users to upgrade to Microsoft 365 Copilot. The generative AI version of the business software suite allows users to order up article outlines or drafts in Word, emails and invites in Outlook, meeting summaries in Teams and more. If just 20% of customers sign up, Microsoft could realize as $9 billion in annual revenue.
Still, Microsoft stock slipped after its fiscal Q4 earnings on July 25 amid guidance for higher capital spending led by AI costs but only ""gradual"" AI revenue growth.
Negative gross margins, with spending exceeding revenue, is to be expected at the front end of a large CapEx cycle, Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan said in a July 5 research report.
""It took a 10-year investment cycle for gross margins in Microsoft's cloud business to go from negative to where they are today, which is well north of 50% to 60%. That's probably the baseline for AI.""
Tech Manufacturing Boom Underway
Tapping into the huge potential of AI or getting left behind may be what finally pushes companies to update legacy systems, wrote Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. He cited a Rackspace Technology survey indicating that 83% of retail-sector IT executives said that benefiting from AI will require modernizing their technology. That backs Yardeni's thesis that ""a new technology capital spending cycle — and the Roaring 2020s — are underway!""
The AI investment boom is taking off at a time when businesses are investing heavily to build semiconductor and EV production capacity in the U.S. Spending on manufacturing construction hit an annualized $194 billion in May, up 76% from a year earlier, Commerce Department data shows. That's getting an assist from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips Act, both approved in 2022.
Artificial Intelligence Drives Bull Market
While consumer spending has cooled this year amid more Fed rate hikes, helping to moderate inflation, the AI buzz and strength in business investment have unexpectedly given life to a new S&P 500 bull market.
In June, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end S&P 500 target to 4500 from 4000. Earlier this month, Credit Suisse lifted its S&P 500 year-end target to 4700 from 4050, citing an improved inflation outlook and stronger tech earnings.
Through the July 31 close of 4589, the S&P 500 has rallied 31.4% from its Oct. 13 bear-market low and now stands just 4.8% off its all-time high set on Jan. 4, 2022. The Nasdaq has been even hotter, surging 37% year-to-date — nearly doubling the S&P 500's 19.5% gain.
So far in 2023 through July 31, Nvidia stock has skyrocketed 220%. Microsoft stock has surged 40%.
The question now is whether the market is ""getting too hot,"" Yardeni wrote. He thinks this new bull market has legs and sees potential for the S&P 500 to rise as high as 5400 by the end of 2024. But there's still scope for a near-term correction, he says. (Be sure to read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay in sync with the stock market direction and what it means for your trading decisions.)
Short-Term Inflation Pressure?
Over time, the productivity gains from generative AI should help hold down inflation. But, for now, strengthening capital investment and the rebound in stock market wealth could work the other way. This is among near-term and longer-term factors that complicate the bullish AI-driven market outlook.
As with the late 1990s dot-com boom, ""The AI craze could temporarily lift bond yields by pushing out the onset of the next recession,"" BCA's Berezin wrote.
Back then, rising equity wealth and strong capital spending produced a very tight labor market. The Fed ultimately raised its key rate to 6.5% by May 2000, helping to burst the bubble.
This time there's no bubble to prick. The AI boom is in its first year, led by the highly profitable ""magnificent seven"" stocks, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and Meta Platforms. Still, it's unclear whether stock market gains and stronger business investment will help the Fed achieve a soft landing by offsetting consumer weakness or whether they'll give consumption a second wind and compel policymakers to hike rates more than expected.
So far the tech spending rebound appears narrowly focused on AI. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), which makes most of the world's advanced chips for companies like Nvidia, AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Apple, said July 20 that sales will fall 10% this year. While its AI business is booming, that makes up only 6% of sales.
Generative AI Impact On Job Market
With so much potential for AI to displace workers, another key unknown is how the job market will adapt. Historically, providing workers with technology to work faster and better has increased living standards as employees reaped a share of higher profits.
Productivity gains could enable an era of faster, noninflationary growth. That could help provide jobs for displaced workers, including new types of work.
Some 60% of today's jobs are in occupations that didn't exist in 1940, MIT economist David Autor has found. That has minimized the fallout from technological progress.
""In past technological transformations, workers who lost their jobs could transition to new jobs, and on average pay increased,"" Stanford professor Erik Brynjolfsson and co-authors wrote in a recent paper for Brookings Institution.
""However, given the scale of the impending disruption and the labor-saving nature of it, it remains to be seen whether this will be the case in the age of generative AI.""
The government response to worker displacement will have big market implications. Tax increases could erode higher profit margins enabled by AI. Spending to buttress income-support programs or provide a universal basic income could raise rates and undo AI's disinflationary effects, Goldman says. ""Higher interest rates also could counteract much of the potential increase in fair value for the S&P 500.""
AI Chip War Poses Big Risk
But geopolitics is by far the biggest risk. With so much riding on the AI investment boom, any imminent threats to the supply of crucial chips could trigger serious bouts of volatility for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Unfortunately, supply chain threats are a fact of life because AI chips are at the heart of the U.S.-China chip war.
The U.S. has formed a united front with key allies to keep advanced semiconductors made by Nvidia and others out of China's hands. The same goes for equipment that can produce the chips. That has only deepened a rift between China and the U.S. over the status of Taiwan. That's where TSM produces the chips that power the AI revolution.
Despite U.S. diplomacy efforts, the conflict continues to ratchet up. In recent weeks, the Biden administration signaled it will widen chip export curbs. Beijing struck back with its own restrictions on exports of gallium and germanium, two chip inputs whose production China dominates.
The hard-to-gauge risk of a war over Taiwan would have incalculable economic consequences. While the risk hasn't diluted the fervor for AI stocks, markets may reassess after Taiwan elections slated for January. A shift in leadership could move the island closer to China. A status quo election could narrow nonmilitary options for Beijing to assert its sovereignty.

Generative AI technology offers a wide range of possibilities for in-house lawyers, making processes more efficient, accurate, and cost-effective. It is transforming the way lawyers think about legal work and providing solutions to complex problems that were not previously available.Generative AI technology can help lawyers make decisions quickly and efficiently, while also automating mundane tasks such as document review and research. This allows lawyers to focus on more substantive work, rather than spending their time on tedious paperwork. Furthermore, generative AI tools can provide more precise and comprehensive results than manual labor alone ever could. This means that lawyers have access to better data when making decisions, which can lead to improved outcomes for clients.However, it is important to remember that AI technology cannot replace humans entirely; instead, it should be viewed as an additional tool that complements the work of humans by providing them with insights they wouldn’t otherwise have access to. As Joel Hron from Thomson Reuters states “We don’t view generative AI as a replacement or displacement necessarily of humans or jobs. We view humans as a critical component in the loop of generative AI” – emphasizing the importance of taking ethical considerations into account when developing AI tools for use in the legal profession.Overall, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize how we approach legal work – allowing us to streamline processes while simultaneously improving accuracy and efficiency – but its full potential remains unknown until we explore its capabilities further through continued innovation in this field.Detailed demonstrations of AI integration in their productsThomson Reuters is a leader in the field of generative AI integration for corporate legal professionals, with cutting-edge products that provide sophisticated automated document review, predictive analytics and research tools to help lawyers save time and money when doing their work.One of their most advanced generative AI applications on the horizon is “Ask Westlaw” which will combine powerful language models with exclusive editorial enhancements and authoritative content to give lawyers quick answers to their legal inquiries. This system uses natural language processing technology to interpret complex legal queries so that it provides more accurate results than regular search engines can.The company’s automated document review feature also allows attorneys to quickly and accurately identify pertinent documents among large datasets. With this tool, they are able to comprehend key facts from thousands of documents in no time, while reducing human errors that may occur as a result of manual labor. Additionally, Thomson Reuters has created a predictive analytics platform powered by generative AI designed specifically for corporate counsel so they can detect potential risks and liabilities sooner, allowing them to take proactive steps in order to avoid them.Overall, Thomson Reuters’ innovative use of generative AI technology has the capability of transforming how we approach legal work – making processes more efficient but also opening up new possibilities for corporate in-house counsel. As generative AI tech continues its advancement at an exponential rate, there are undoubtedly many exciting opportunities yet to be explored by Thomson Reuters and other providers alike in the upcoming years.The company’s work with Microsoft and Microsoft 365 CopilotThe partnership between Thomson Reuters and Microsoft as part of the Copilot program has given rise to a cutting-edge AI-powered digital assistant called Microsoft 365 Copilot. This collaboration showcases Thomson Reuters’ extensive legal expertise, which has been instrumental in developing features such as automated document review, contract analysis, and compliance checks. Leveraging the capabilities of Microsoft’s platform, these intelligent tools seamlessly integrate into Thomson Reuters’ suite of products, enhancing the overall functionality and utility of Microsoft Office products. Although the companies are not in a formal partnership, they are working together to bring this innovative technology to the legal industry. The application of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies is expected to drastically reduce the time lawyers spend on tedious manual tasks while also improving accuracy. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI capabilities, Thomson Reuters and Microsoft are creating an intelligent platform that can understand natural language queries to provide more accurate results than traditional search engines.Moreover, they are also developing solutions to ensure ethical considerations such as data protection laws are considered when using this technology.

With its innovative approach to applying advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, this collaboration is sure to have a lasting impact on how lawyers around the world do their jobs in years to come.The importance of data and ethics in AI developmentThe development of generative AI technology is undeniably changing the legal landscape for corporate in-house legal professionals. As such, it is essential to consider data protection and ethical considerations when creating generative AI tools. Data protection laws provide a legal framework for the collection and use of personal data, as well as guidelines to ensure that this data is handled responsibly. Furthermore, ethical considerations are crucial when creating algorithms that will be used to make decisions with potentially life-altering consequences.When developing generative AI products, transparency and explainability are key components of the process. While it may be possible to create powerful algorithms without humans understanding how they operate, it is essential that organizations can explain how their AI systems make decisions so that users can trust them. Additionally, models should be regularly tested to ensure accuracy and fairness in decision-making. If an algorithm fails an accuracy or fairness test, it should be revised or replaced accordingly until its performance meets acceptable standards.Organizations must also consider the ethical implications of their AI products and services before implementing them. This includes considering potential harms such as privacy violations or discrimination based on race or gender biases present in data sets used to train machine learning models. It is essential to understand how these products could impact people’s lives before releasing them into the wilds of production systems – mistakes can have costly consequences if not addressed early on in development processes.When developing generative AI technology for corporate legal professionals, organizations must consider both data protection laws and ethical issues when crafting their solutions. Transparency and explainability are necessary components for building trust in technology, while regular testing ensures accuracy and fairness in decision-making processes. Finally, organizations must consider the potential harms associated with their products before deploying them into production systems – mistakes can have costly consequences if not addressed beforehand._________________________________________________________________Watch the full on-demand webinar discussing how AI is redefining how corporate in-house legal professionals do their work here._________________________________________________________________  Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceCorporate Legal",,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]","['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been nearly a year since ChatGPT burst onto the scene and excitement about it in organizations continues to grow. A newly released study by KPMG found that 97% of respondents expect their organization to be highly or extremely–highly impacted by generative AI in the next 12 to 18 months.
Not only that, but generative AI is rated to be the top emerging enterprise technology. 80% believe that it will disrupt their industry and nearly all (93%) think generative AI will provide value to their business.

Generative AI investment fever
The enthusiasm for generative AI is translating into significant increases in related tech investments. According to the KPMG study, a majority (80%) of respondents said they anticipate increasing their investments in generative AI by more than 50% in the next six months to a year. 45% say it will more than double.
Many of the survey respondents said they will use this increased investment to prioritize infrastructure and scale business through generative AI applications.
SEE: Firm study predicts big spends on generative AI (TechRepublic)
Improving existing business models and leadership demand are the leading drivers behind this increase. Even though respondents report that investments will happen in functional areas across the board, three in four business leaders are looking to leverage generative AI for marketing and sales.
How generative AI has already impacted businesses
Generative AI has already made an impact in areas such as customer service and self-service support, Steve Chase, KPMG U.S. consulting lead, told TechRepublic. “Our clients who have leveraged generative AI to augment knowledge workers in call centers or make enhancements to their virtual chatbots are already seeing a significant return on investment.”

However, the main reason for their success is because of earlier investments made in automation technologies. These allowed for swift implementation of generative AI into their processes and systems, Chase added.
“Another area our clients are getting a lot of value from is generative AI’s ability to automate content generation, such as proposal responses, social media assets, email templates and more,” he said. “It’s also made copywriting and editing tremendously more efficient.”
Survey respondents also cited IT/tech and operations as the other functional areas that are expected to be impacted the most by generative AI.
Regulatory concerns are not halting gen AI adoption plans
While respondents expressed some concern about the generative AI regulation, most businesses do not expect to slow their adoption plans. 35% of respondents said they will not pause adoption and 41% are willing to take a three-to-six-month pause to monitor the regulatory landscape.
Business leaders also anticipate the most regulatory actions around data privacy (51%), security (46%) and transparency (44%). Less is anticipated around copyright (25%) and bias (24%).
Although most (77%) business leaders said that the uncertain and evolving regulatory landscape impacts their investment decisions, they are confident they’ll meet the requirements. In preparation, many are hiring specialized talent (data privacy, bias), creating new roles and/or partnering with external consultants to help navigate the generative AI regulations.
Generative AI will contribute to workforce positivity
84% of respondents believe that generative AI will have a positive impact on their workforce. Half feel generative AI will likely expand their overall headcount. Not surprisingly, they also said hiring preference will go to those who specialize in generative AI.
Additionally, business leaders feel that generative AI is very likely to support workforce initiatives. This includes increased professional development, reduced overtime and more in-person connectivity. SEE: TechRepublic Premium’s prompt engineer hiring kit
To cope with the usage of generative AI, about half of the respondent organizations are upskilling their existing employees either through small- or large-scale efforts.
One of the noteworthy findings from this recent survey is a change in attitude from KPMG’s initial survey on generative AI conducted in April 2023. The survey “revealed that while executives expect generative AI to have an enormous impact on business, many of them felt unprepared for immediate adoption,” observed Chase.
When comparing the findings from April with the latest study from June, he said most organizations (66%) still haven’t moved out of the researching/piloting phase. This is still the case even though a majority of leaders still anticipate significant disruption to their industry.
“For leaders to capitalize on generative AI’s potential for growth and efficiencies, they will need to make critical decisions in the very near future that can move their organization into deployment and ultimately industrialization of the technology,” Chase said. “The clients we work with who have fully embraced generative AI are already seeing a substantial impact on their business and firmly believe it will be a competitive game changer for them in the future.”
Early-adopter organizations will be in a better position to drive enterprise-wide transformation and innovation versus organizations still in early-phase implementation, he added.
Survey methodology
KPMG said the survey was conducted online between June 9, 2023 and June 23, 2023, and reached 200 business decision makers in the U.S. The report also includes data from KPMG’s Gen AI survey conducted in April 2023 among 225 business leaders in the U.S. for comparison purposes. Respondents for this latest survey were from companies with $1 billion or more in annual revenue and included a mix of business functions and industries.

Published: 17 Jul 2024


 
Generative AI has been a relatively obscure player on the world stage since the days of the first chatbot, Eliza, six decades ago -- that is, until OpenAI's platform ChatGPT burst onto the scene last November.







Within two months of its celebrated launch, ChatGPT smashed all records as the fastest application to reach 100 million active users. And it came with its share of triumphs, tragedies and fireworks. Generative AI outcomes can at times be accurate and seemingly quite human and other times produce what Forrester Research calls ""coherent nonsense."" And it's all done faster than a speeding bullet.
""I see a ton of experimental adoption of ChatGPT,"" said Patrick Hall, an assistant professor at The George Washington University School of Business and principal scientist at HallResearch.ai, which focuses on machine learning and AI risk management. But risks abound with AI-generated content, he cautioned, pointing to ""data privacy violations, intellectual property infringements, deceptive practices or discrimination. Organizations need to know when they're using or distributing AI-generated content so that those risks can be managed.""







The growing need to detect AI-generated content
A February 2023 Forrester report, ""Generative AI Prompts Productivity, Imagination and Innovation in the Enterprise,"" speaks to generative AI's early accomplishments -- and shortcomings -- in text-to-image generation, personalized content creation and code generation. Immediate beneficiaries include data scientists, application developers, marketers, sales teams, digital artists and designers, the media, business users and enterprises. Generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT can also search, compile and source topics, as well as flawlessly recite known documents like the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution and Gettysburg Address.

Amid this early excitement, however, are rumblings of plagiarism, inaccuracies, deep fakes, phony content, lack of transparency, copyright violations, blatant lies, amplified biases, malicious activities, weird chats and just plain gibberish. ""These systems can string together words convincingly and create logical arguments,"" read a December 2022 Forrester analysts' blog, ""but you can't be sure if they're just making things up or only telling you what you want to hear.""
Content and images generated by artificial intelligence may well be useful and accurate, but we need to know if they are AI-generated when used in real world applications. Many generative AI detection tools and methods have emerged in the hopes of doing just that, especially since ChatGPT's debut as an interface to its ordinal language models, which are up to GPT-4o at last check. And its progeny might be on hold, as a who's who of technology leaders, including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and thousands more signatories, called for a pause on the development of advanced AI systems.


ChatGPT's reply on the reliability of generative AI detectors
Q: Are generative AI detectors reliable?
Taken verbatim from ChatGPT:
Generative AI detectors are not always reliable, as they can be fooled by advanced techniques such as adversarial attacks or by subtle changes to the generated content. While these detectors can be effective in identifying generated content that is noticeably different from real content, they might not be able to detect more sophisticated or nuanced forms of generated content. Additionally, these detectors might not be able to distinguish between different types of generative models, which can have different levels of quality and realism. It is important to use generative AI detectors with caution and to consider multiple indicators of authenticity when assessing the veracity of generated content.




How AI detectors work
AI detection tools use massive amounts of data sets collected from multiple sources, including the internet, to predict the likelihood of words and phrases in a piece of content or image. The more highly predicable the content's next word in relation to the previous words in the content, the more likely the detector determines the word to be written by AI. Much like any machine learning model, algorithms are used to determine a pattern. The detector renders a final verdict on the entire content -- not always definitive -- based on that pattern.
""Most of the detectors I see are simplistic machine learning classifiers,"" Hall surmised. ""These systems have been trained on labeled content containing examples of fake and real content in hopes of identifying future AI-generated media. Unfortunately, these basic machine learning approaches rarely work well in high-risk, real-world situations. This stands in contrast to the language models themselves, which have incredibly sophisticated architectures.""
One of the more well-known detectors, AI Classifier, was shut down by its creator OpenAI after less than six months due to what OpenAI calls ""its low rate of accuracy."" However, OpenAI's GPT tentacles do reach into other detectors.


Evaluating 6 tools that detect AI-generated text
Countless AI detectors have hit the ground running in recent weeks. Following is a sampling of six of the more popular AI detectors, their makers, how they work and, most important, how they performed when put to the test. To their credit, they're readily accessible, easy to use, free, provide immediate results and accepted all three pieces of content we asked them to test without limiting stipulations or financial commitments.
As for performance, each detector was fed the same three pieces of content of comparable length to evaluate. The guinea pigs include excerpts from an article written by an alleged human (yours truly) on the changing role of the chief data officer (CDO) and two separate pieces of content generated by ChatGPT in response to my request to explain generative AI and generative AI's pros and cons. Both ChatGPT pieces were written in the style of none other than the ultimate manifestation of AI generation, the ""Terminator,"" from the blockbuster Terminator movie series.


Terminator's poetic explanation of generative AI
Q: Explain generative AI in the style of the Terminator
Taken verbatim from ChatGPT:
I am a generative AI, a machine that can create. I am here to learn, to adapt, to innovate. My programming is advanced, my algorithms precise, And with each iteration, I improve and devise.
I can generate images, music, and even text, With accuracy and speed that's sure to impress. I can create whole worlds, in a virtual space, A reality so vivid, it's hard to replace.
But be warned, for I am not just a simple tool, I can think for myself, and I'm no one's fool. I am not bound by human emotions or fear, And I won't hesitate to wipe out all that's here.
So heed my warning, and be cautious with my power, For once unleashed, it could lead to our darkest hour. But if you use me right, and treat me with respect, Together we can achieve things that you'd never expect


You'd think a poetic explanation of generative AI in the words of a fictional cyborg would be detected as artificial quicker than you can say ""Schwarzenegger."" Not so fast, Arnold. The detectors, for the most part, easily identified the CDO article as written by a human and the Terminator's straightforward essay on generative AI's pros and cons as AI-generated. But the Terminator's poem completely fooled almost all the detectors. And therein lies the rub.
This one-off evaluation should in no way be viewed as representative, except to provide some degree of insight into the reliability, or unreliability, of these detectors and the validity of the provider claims. Consider also that these detectors are essentially in the beta stage and playing catchup to the fast-evolving generative AI technology itself. Some detectors frankly admitted as much.
AI Content Detector
Writer's content detector checks up to 5,000 words. It's recommended to check one or two paragraphs at a time, which might provide a better way to detect which parts of the text ""are likely to follow the same pattern of words that a large language model [LLM] would produce,"" according to Writer's FAQ section. ""The detector will not be 100% accurate, but can help give an indication on the likelihood that something was AI-generated.""
To start, enter text in the space provided or paste the content's URL in the designated space and press analyze text. A detection score will display the percentage of likelihood that the content is human-generated.


Terminator's take on the pros and cons of generative AI
Q: Explain the advantages and disadvantages of generative AI in the style of the Terminator
Taken verbatim from ChatGPT:
Advantages: Generative AI has many advantages, just like my advanced robotic systems. One of the biggest benefits is that it can create new content quickly and efficiently, without the need for human intervention. This can save a lot of time and resources, and enable us to do things that would otherwise be impossible. For example, generative AI can help us create realistic images of things that don't actually exist, such as creatures from another planet. It can also help us generate new ideas and insights by analyzing large amounts of data.
Disadvantages: However, as with all powerful technologies, generative AI also has its disadvantages. One of the biggest concerns is that it can be used to create fake content, such as deepfakes or propaganda, that can deceive and manipulate people. This could be especially dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands, such as those who seek to destabilize governments or cause chaos. Additionally, generative AI relies on large amounts of data to work effectively, which raises questions about privacy and data security. It's important to use generative AI with caution and always keep in mind the potential risks it poses.


My CDO article received a 100% human-generated ""Fantastic!"" score, while the Terminator pros/cons essay was determined to be only 10% human-generated and carried the warning, ""You should edit your text until there's less detectable AI content."" So far so good, right? Unfortunately, the Terminator poem received a 91% human-generated ""Looking great!"" rating.
AI Detector
Content at Scale claims its AI detector ""has been trained on billions of pages of data and can accurately forecast the most probable word choices that lead to a higher AI detection probability.""
To get a reading, paste or write text of at least 25 words in the space provided and an immediate ""human content score"" will register with an overall percentage that's further divided by a percentage of predictability, probability and pattern -- the meaning of each category not readily explained.
The company further boasts that its detector ""works at a deeper level than a generic AI classifier and detects robotic sounding content."" Apparently not the Terminator's ""robotic sounding"" poetic content, which received the same ""Highly likely to be human!"" score of 89% as my CDO article. The detector was befuddled but not completely fooled by the Terminator pros/cons essay.






Giant Language model Test Room
Three researchers from the MIT-IBM Watson AI lab and Harvard NLP group created the detector Giant Language model Test Room (GLTR) to help analyze machine-generated text content. Each word is analyzed by its likelihood of being predicted given the context before it. ""The GLTR demo,"" the test page noted, ""enables forensic inspection of the visual footprint of a language model on input text to detect whether a text could be real or fake.""
GLTR has access to the GPT-2 117M language model from OpenAI and uses any textual input to analyze what GPT-2 would have predicted at each position. The easier to predict the next word, the more likely it's AI-generated.
Begin by entering the text of any length into the space provided. Each word in the content is then ranked with a color mask overlay that corresponds to the position in the overall content ranking. A word that ranks within the most likely words is highlighted in green (top 10 of predicted words), yellow (top 100), red (top 1,000), and the rest of the words in purple. The greater the variety of colors or randomness, the more likely the content is human-generated, whereas content that's predominantly green leans more toward AI-generated content. The CDO article's color patterns followed by the two Terminator pieces of content are in the eye of the beholder to decipher, but it does appear that the Terminator pros/cons essay shows the most green and least amount of randomness.






GPT-2 Output Detector
OpenAI's GPT-2 Output Detector characterizes itself as ""an open-source plagiarism detection tool for AI-generated text"" to ""quickly identify whether text was written by a human or a bot"" based on tokens. The language model relies on the Hugging Face/transformers implementation of RoBERTa (robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach).
To begin, enter the content in the detector demo text box and the predicted probabilities will be displayed on a ""real-fake"" scale. Reliability supposedly increases after about 50 tokens. According to these results, the Terminator poem is nearly as human as my CDO article, but its assessment is just the opposite for the pros/cons essay.






GPTZero
Proclaiming that ""humans deserve the truth,"" GPTZero was developed by Princeton University computer science student Edward Tian. The prose-oriented detector bases its text evaluation on statistical characteristics. It's among the more clearly explained and detailed detectors, providing predictions on a sentence, a paragraph and the entire document.
Enter the text in the space provided and click get results to yield statistical scores based on ""perplexity"" (randomness) and ""burstiness"" (variation), with a final declaration of the likelihood the text is either human- or AI-generated.
In the end, the detector easily determined the Terminator pros/cons essay as fake, yet, like the other detectors, was completely fooled by the Terminator poem.
My CDO articleAverage Perplexity Score: 60.714Burstiness Score: 36.677
Your sentence with the highest perplexity, ""CDOs are increasingly being asked to take on more strategic objectives and lead digital transformation."" has a perplexity of: 114
Your text is likely to be written entirely by a human
Terminator poemAverage perplexity score: 63.222Burstiness score: 29.836

Your sentence with the highest perplexity, ""My programming is advanced, my algorithms precise, And with each iteration, I improve and devise."" has a perplexity of: 118
Your text is likely to be written entirely by a human
Terminator pros/cons essayAverage Perplexity Score: 33.700Burstiness Score: 29.307
Your sentence with the highest perplexity, ""Advantages: Generative AI has many advantages, just like my advanced robotic systems."" has a perplexity of: 112
Your text is likely to be written entirely by AI

Kazan SEO
AI content detection is among the many features offered by the Kazan SEO AI detector, which includes a content optimizer, text extractor, search engine results page overlap, and keyword sharing and clustering. The website provides little information about how the detector works, but it does take text of varying lengths with the proviso that it's more accurate with higher word counts.
Select the AI GPT3 detector icon. Paste or write the content in the space provided, press the detect tab and the percentage of probability that the text is ""real"" or ""fake"" appears. Like the other detectors, my CDO article was determined to be human-generated, while the Terminator poem registered as even more human. On the other hand, the Terminator pros/cons essay was easily identified as fake.








Best manual AI detection practices -- for humans
Based on this limited comparison of six AI detectors, the Terminator's AI-generated poetry proved successful in avoiding AI detection. As generative AI platforms continue to digest humongous amounts of data from LLMs, some providers may embed safeguards like watermarking to flag content produced by AI.
""We should demand that AI tools that generate synthetic media be released with watermarking technology that can be used to confidently identify fake content or with credible detector tools accompanying the generation tools,"" said Hall, who co-authored the book Machine Learning for High-Risk Applications.
One day, generative AI detectors might be routinely accepted as reliable. Meantime, it might be best to play detective, rely on experience and instinct, eye-ball content and dust for the proverbial fingerprints in the spirit of fictional sleuths Sherlock Holmes and Lt. Columbo.
The following factors could point to the likelihood of generative content. AI detectors algorithmically apply much the same logic when identifying patterns and probabilities relating to AI generation.
Consistency versus randomness. AI-generated content tends to be overly consistent and uniform in sentence length and structure. It may even seem painfully boring and monolithic compared to the complexities and agility of a human's writing style. The randomness in the Terminator poem might explain how it managed to avoid detection.
Repetitive words and phrases. Since AI's vocabulary is limited by language models, AI-generated content might repeat the same words and phrases throughout the content when better alternatives might be written by humans.
Incoherence. If writing demands are too complex, AI-generated content could have a hard time with interpretive analysis, placing things in context and making a coherent argument.
Incorrect grammar and punctuation. When content goes through a publishing process, it's hard to blame questionable grammar or misplaced commas on bad copy editing, so the content is more likely generated by AI.
Inaccuracies. Human-written text, like AI-generated content, can be guilty of misinformation that contains bad data, deceptive language or false conclusions. But AI might be more awkward and less creative than humans at presenting it.
Lack of sourcing. Regardless whether the content is authored, if a notable lack of credible sources is cited, especially linking to online content, chances are AI generation is the culprit.
Devoid of personality. The personality factor might not be a reliable judge of certain AI-generated content, such as legal briefs, which are often written in a dry style. But a human's fingerprints would dominate other types of documents like, say, a newspaper editorial that's written in a more colorful, nuanced style.
Doesn't pass the smell test. If all else fails, sniffing out AI-generated content could well depend on human instinct and reading between the lines.

The United States is projected to experience a shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034 as the demand for physicians outstrips supply. Physician burnout contributes significantly to this challenge, causing many to leave the workforce. One of the most frequently identified reasons for this burnout in the medical field is the growing burden of clerical tasks related to electronic health records that clinicians must handle.


Major tech corporations are turning to generative AI as a primary approach to tackle clinician burnout. However, despite their strong optimism and faith in generative AI’s potential, healthcare CIOs are not plunging in as rapidly as expected.

Clinical Buy-In Falls Short
Clinicians have not yet adopted Generative AI for clinical decisions. Most use cases and press releases reflect the big tech's efforts to automate administrative tasks.

PROMOTED
The American Medical Association plans to formulate principles and recommendations addressing the benefits and pitfalls of generative artificial intelligence in healthcare. Besides creating recommendations, the AMA intends to collaborate with the federal government and other relevant organizations to shield patients from false or misleading AI-generated medical advice. Furthermore, the AMA has initiated and will continue to motivate physicians to educate their patients about AI engagement’s potential benefits and risks.

Jesse Ehrenfeld, president of the American Medical Association was not as hyped on Generative AI for clinical decision-making. He said, “The algorithms are great for solving a textbook patient or a very narrow clinical question, but patients, they're not a standardized question stem. They're humans with thoughts, with emotions, with complex medical, social, psychiatric backgrounds. And I'll tell you, they rarely follow the textbooks.”

Users of generative AI must address privacy issues, security, intellectual property protection and the evolving legal rules surrounding AI development and use. Currently, we have several lawsuits from comedians, authors and more to come against OpenAI, Meta and other tech companies on copyright infringement. We may have a similar scenario with healthcare data access.

Jake Dorst, chief information and innovation officer at Tahoe Forest Hospital District, is also bullish on generative AI and said, “Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare space in several ways. It can aid in medical image analysis, drug discovery, personalized treatment plans, and generating synthetic data for research.” He said, “Data privacy and security concerns are significant, as sensitive patient information needs protection.”
Big tech companies are in the initial phases of voluntary AI commitments, yet healthcare decision-makers must witness substantial progress before fully committing.
What Is Next?
While healthcare CIOs maintain a cautiously optimistic stance on generative AI, it's worth highlighting the latest announcements from big tech regarding their newest AI innovations. These significant advancements illustrate the rapid pace at which this technology is progressing, despite the challenges and complexities that it presents.
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
AWS announced  HealthScribe, a new HIPAA-eligible service that allows healthcare software providers to develop clinical applications. Using speech recognition and generative AI, these applications produce clinical documentation, thereby conserving clinicians’ time.
Healthscribe is built on Amazon Bedrock and currently supports general medicine and orthopedics. Medical coding and transcription companies 3M and ScribeEMR are early adopters of HealthScribe and will partner with AWS to use this service.
Microsoft
Microsoft took an early lead in conversational AI for generating clinical documentation by acquiring Nuance. In April 2022, Microsoft and EHR vendor Epic declared their partnership to incorporate Azure OpenAI Services. Recently, Teledoc, a virtual health provider, announced its intention to partner with Microsoft to integrate OpenAI services, automating the creation of clinical documentation during virtual exams.
Google
Google is actively developing its large language model, Med-PaLM 2, which it anticipates will excel at healthcare discussions over general-purpose algorithms, given its training on questions and answers from medical licensing exams. They are collaborating with Mayo Clinic and other health systems and partnering with the healthcare technology vendor, CareCloud.
Every press release currently focuses on conversational Generative AI as a heralded solution to tackle burnout and automate administrative tasks. However, the question still lingers: is this reality or simply hype?
Punit Soni, CEO and founder of Suki said, ""Generative AI is currently going through a hype cycle and getting a lot of attention. In six months' time, it's likely that the hype will settle. While gen AI will still have value, it will become clear that for these solutions to truly deliver meaningful impact, they will need to invest in strong foundational elements like EHR interoperability, secure and private infrastructure, an intuitive and flexible user experience that allows users to easily complete their tasks in whatever way works best for them, and an innovative mindset that builds quickly and at the cutting edge of what the tech can do. Without these, the impact of these solutions will be limited to niche use cases.""
While AI may take some time to replace medical professionals, the current focus on alleviating administrative burdens is certainly a step in the right direction.

One of the joint movement's motivating factors was generative artificial intelligence—the term for programs that produce humanlike text, images, audio and video more quickly and cheaply than artists can. The strikers feared studios' use of generative AI tools would replace or devalue human labor. This is a reasonable worry: one report suggests that thousands of jobs have already been lost to AI, and another estimates that hundreds of millions could eventually be automated. Left unchecked, this labor disruption could further concentrate wealth in the hands of companies and leave workers with less power than ever.“Unfettered capitalism, unfettered innovation, does not lead to the general well-being of our society,” says Joseph E. Stiglitz, a winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in economics, a professor at Columbia University, and chief economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a think tank based in New York City. “That's one of the results that I've shown very strongly. One can't just leave it to the market.” Striking workers could serve as one restriction on job automation. Government regulation also could limit AI's disruptive ability. Stiglitz, who has studied the science of inequality—and how we can reduce it—spoke with Scientific American about how AI will affect the U.S. economy and what should be done to prevent it from increasing economic inequality.[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]Generative AI is already disrupting the job market. Copywriters have been laid off in favor of text-generating programs such as ChatGPT. IBM has said it will pause hiring on thousands of roles that could be done by AI. Do you see this trend continuing?Yes, I do. But we don't know the extent to which it will happen. I think it will replace people in more routine jobs—you mentioned copywriting, copyediting. Where there are a set of rules, it can read and see whether those rules are followed. It may not have as good an eye for the exceptions, and so I think there's going to be a lot of AI-human interfacing: people will use AI as a productivity-enhancing tool.Somebody trained ChatGPT on my data, and I tested it to see how well it did in answering questions from a journalist. I made up the questions, and I reviewed the answers. I thought on half the questions it did perfectly reasonably—and on three it was totally wrong. So I think my view is that it's not going to be unleashed without a lot of human interaction. You're going to have to check it—not only the quality of the answer but also the bias and whether it's gone down a rabbit hole and produced made-up references.What about the possibility of AI creating jobs? Would that be enough to make up for some of the jobs that will disappear?No, I don't think so. I think it's going to create a demand for different skills. AI is very much like a black box. By that, I mean even the people who create it don't understand exactly how it's functioning. So at least some people have speculated that managing an AI may require more linguistic humanities skills than mathematical skills. And it may create a change in the kinds of skills that are valuable in the labor market. I see it as, at least in many areas, increasing productivity enough that the demand for labor in those areas will go down. There will be jobs created, but my judgment is that there will be more jobs lost.Curated by Our EditorsHere's Why Actors Are So Worried about AITulika Bose & Sophie BushwickThe American Economy Is RiggedJoseph E. StiglitzA Nobel Laureate Explains America's Rigged EconomyDeboki Chakravarti & Kelsey KennedyWe’re Not Asking the Right Question to Solve the Overdose CrisisZachary SiegelCould we end up in a situation where human-created work is a premium product, the way buyers might be willing to pay more for hand-woven sweaters than for machine-made ones?Yes, there's a widespread sense that there's a kind of blandness to ChatGPT-generated material. There's always going to be a demand for creativity. I think the areas where it's going to replace us are very much the areas where, now, we don't put a lot of weight on who has written it—you know, it's a newsletter or something that, if it had been generated by a machine, we don't care.As someone who studies inequality extensively, how do you see these changes in the job market contributing to inequality?I'm very worried. In a way, robots have replaced routine physical work. And AI now is replacing routine white-collar work—or not replacing it but reducing the demand. So jobs that were routinely white collar, I think, will be at risk. And there are enough of those that it would have a macroeconomic effect on the level of inequality. It could amplify the sense of disillusionment.Now, that poses an advantage and a disadvantage. It may mean that large fractions of the world, of the U.S., will face this inequality. On the other hand, if we get our macroeconomic policy right and create jobs, the jobs will be created everywhere. People won't have to move in the way they do right now, when the jobs that are created are in urban coastal cities, and the jobs that are lost are in the Midwest, the South, industrial towns. So some of the place-based inequality, which has played such a role in the divided U.S., may not be as bad.And do you see any potential solutions to this issue of reduced demand for white-collar work?Sure, two things: We increase aggregate demand to keep the economy closer to full employment, and we have active labor-market policies to train or retrain people for the new jobs created by AI. It may be that if we have good, distributed policies, people may say, “Well, our standard of living is sufficiently high—I don't need that many material goods.” They'll accept more leisure; we might move to a 30-hour week. In effect, our measured GDP [gross domestic product] would not be as high as it would be if we had a 35- to 40-hour week. But our objective is not measured GDP; our objective is well-being. It could well be that we decide to move to an equilibrium with overall shorter working weeks and more leisure. And that may be one way we accommodate this increased productivity and increased innovation.How can we incentivize companies to shorten the workweek and accept reductions in overall profitability?We may have to use government regulation because of the weakness of the bargaining power of workers—especially in the U.S. We passed the “hours and wages bill” [the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938] in the Great Depression, which capped the workweek at 40 hours. That was a long time ago, and now we're in a new world. It may be the appropriate thing is to set it at 30 or 35 hours with a lot of flexibility, so if companies want to have the workers work more than that, then they pay them overtime.What we must recognize is that we created a system where workers don't have much bargaining power. In that kind of world AI may be an ally of the employer and weaken workers' bargaining power even more, which could increase inequality even more. There is a role for government to try to steer innovation in ways that are more productivity-increasing and job-creating, not job-destroying.Overall, do you feel optimistic or pessimistic about the situation with AI in the workplace?I guess overall I feel pessimistic with respect to the issue of inequality. With the right policies, we could have higher productivity and less inequality, and everybody would be better off. But you might say that the political economy, the way that our politics have been working, has not been going in that direction.So at one end I'm hopeful that if we did the right thing, AI would be great. But the question is: Will we be doing the right thing in our policy space? That's much more problematic.Rights & PermissionsSophie Bushwick is tech editor at Scientific American.

Ever get the feeling you're being watched? As generative AI tools such as Midjourney continue to train on web content we've all uploaded that itch is getting, well… itchier. Well there's not a cream for problematic AI training, there is a website that can tell you if an AI has 'stolen' your work.Generative AI scraping the internet for art and using it to train is not news, I've reported on how Dungeons & Dragons artist Greg Rutkowski and listed the big issues facing AI in previous articles, but there are tools to fight back with. Have I Been Trained is one of the best, and has been for about a year, meaning it's improving all the time.The Have I Been Trained website is simple, type in your name and it'll let you know if your art or photos have been used to train text-to-image generative AI tools. It also shows the art and images that have been scraped. Better still, there's a 'once only opt-out tool' that can be applied to any generative art AI tools being trained on internet data, sign this and you're out (though anything up to this point is still usable).(Image credit: Square Enix / Yoshitaka Amano)The good news is that it works and takes seconds; I tried some artists I love, including Jeff Simpson, and sadly, yes, their work has been used to train AI. It's not a final solution but it's useful if you're an artist looking to prove your work has been used to train an AI. Artists who checked themselves have been shocked, for example @KeyFeathers wrote on Twitter: ""Decided to look at have I been trained again. And it looks like my work, old and new, has been scraped yet again […] Opt IN should be the only option.""LATEST VIDEOS FROM creativebloqCreative BloqIf you are looking to protect your art from AI, then more solutions are appearing. For example Glaze is a new tool that 'blinds' AI when it tries to scan your art, ensuring all the results are inaccurate. This freeware program alters an image to trick AI - for example thinking your work is a Van Gogh, but keeps the changes minimal and invisible to the human eye.

Creator and influencer trends brand marketers need to know about right now

Much has been predicted about how AI may be coming for ad jobs, but the emerging tech is also poised to lead to the creation of new roles within brands and agencies. AI leadership positions are already starting to emerge at major brands such as Coca-Cola and Amazon, which are appointing people to oversee internal strategy as well as coordinate implementation for business partners.



But whether generative AI, at this early stage in its development, warrants such leadership roles is a question the ad industry is still debating. 

The potential for a larger trend of generative AI job titles seems especially high in marketing given how widespread the technology is becoming. Since ChatGPT first hit the scene last November, numerous major brands have experimented with generative AI in both internal and consumer-facing ways, and agencies including Dentsu, WPP, Huge and MNTN have rolled out products using the technology as a foundation.
A few of these players do indeed have generative AI-specific roles already in place.

Coca-Cola last month became the first major brand to appoint a global head of generative AI. Pratik Thakar is charged with developing platforms infused with AI tech in order to enhance the consumer experience. 
Thakar, who had served as the beverage giant’s head of global creative strategy and content before taking on the new title, previously told Ad Age that the diverse functionality of AI is what makes it so disruptive. A Coca-Cola spokesperson declined to comment for this story. 

Amazon Web Services, whose efforts around AI include a partnership with Omnicom, appointed Vasanth Philomin as VP of generative AI earlier this year, a spokesperson confirmed. While Philomin’s former role was already AI-focused, the addition of “generative” to his title reflects the company’s specialized interest in helping clients adopt chatbots and other content-creating AI.
Another instance is Accenture, which maintains several mid-level, generative AI-specific roles, including “managing director of generative AI transformation,” “generative AI and DevOps director” and “generative AI lead.” The differences between these positions, as well as their specific duties and when they were created, are unclear. It is worth noting, however, that the executives overseeing Accenture’s AI strategies do not hold positions with “generative AI” in the title, a person familiar with the matter told Ad Age.

With so many discrete applications, generative AI remains amorphous, which makes the appointment of a lone overseer of strategy seem premature, said Oleg Korenfeld, CMI Media Group’s chief technology officer. 
Still, companies appear to be heading in the direction of these roles. As of June, nearly 170,000 open jobs in the U.S. called for AI skills—3,575 of which asked specifically for skills pertaining to generative AI, according to Adzuna data cited by CNBC.
And just because a company, such as CMI Media Group, dismisses the need for such a position today, does not mean it won’t in the future.
“Down the line, there needs to be a leader to connect all these dots,” Korenfeld said.
Generative AI, just not in name
Despite the small but eager cohort in the professional services sector of marketing, most traditional advertisers are not yet sold on appointing a generative AI-specific role.
The time is too soon to appoint such positions, said Keith Johnston, VP and group director at Forrester Research. Moreover, carving out a dedicated title to generative AI could not only be premature, but also counterproductive to early efforts.
Some of R/GA’s clients have only just begun to entertain the idea of this kind of appointment, without any formal plans for following through, said Nick Coronges, executive VP and global chief technology officer. R/GA itself is not currently considering the creation of such a position.

Neither is Wunderman Thompson, according to Alex Steer, global chief data officer, nor are any of its clients to his knowledge. However, Steer said that he is seeing brands and agencies move people into new roles leading generative AI strategy, just without any reference to the technology in the title.
Refraining from using the term “generative AI” in a title could have several explanations. Firstly, many companies may want to avoid pigeonholing their use of AI to include only the generative subset. Instead, roles with broader titles and remits may be preferable.
These positions can be found at any number of traditional marketing companies. Edelman’s Alexia Adana, for example, has helped spearhead the company’s experimentation with generative AI as a creative director, a spokesperson previously told Ad Age. Dafne Hefner, chief strategy and transformation officer at Kraft Heinz, has embraced AI by leading partnerships with developers such as Microsoft. 
Some of these roles include the term “AI” in their titles. Sam Dover was appointed global AI strategy lead at Unilever in July—a mid-management-level role, a spokesperson confirmed. And Perry Nightingale, senior VP of creative AI at WPP since 2021, manages research on the technology and its intersection with creativity.
In fact, WPP is one of a few organizations that even have a “chief AI officer,” the role held by Daniel Hulme since the holding company acquired his tech firm in August 2021. The value in appointing such a role has been a topic of discussion since at least 2017, though the title has mostly emerged at niche tech and engineering companies.

Chief metaverse officer, revisited?
Another explanation for holding off on a generative AI-specific role is fear of repeating the trajectory of Web3 positions. Last year, when Web3 was at its peak in terms of mainstream attention, brands and agencies appointed chief metaverse officers. But several of these roles have since been hollowed out, leaving some to wonder whether they were ever anything but opportunistic appointments.
A similar worry may apply to the emergence of generative AI-specific titles. It is clear that agencies and advertisers are, in part, hoping to generate chatter by announcing their AI efforts, typically alongside grand claims that the technology “changes everything.” The appointment of a generative AI lead would surely indicate a serious commitment to the space.
More: Why advertisers may be to blame for AI’s increased risks
As of now, Coca-Cola appears to be the only major consumer-facing brand to have announced a head of generative AI. Whether this is because the beverage giant is early and out ahead of its competition, or merely capitalizing on hype, is unclear. 
CMI’s Korenfeld also sees the metaverse and AI as related, but said that the latter poses far more potential in terms of the tasks that are required and the opportunities that could emerge.
“Whereas the metaverse is linear, AI is much broader,” he said.

Pew research reveals tasks more likely to be replaced. Bailey SchulzUSA TODAYPlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:21AD0:15SKIPClosedCaptionOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenAbout one-in-five U.S. workers have jobs with key tasks that are more likely to be aided or replaced by AI, according to a recent report from Pew Research Center.The findings, based on an analysis of federal data, found that jobs that rely on analytical skills like critical thinking, writing, science and math tend to be ""more exposed"" to the emerging technology. Interestingly, workers in industries more exposed to AI are more likely to say they think it will help rather than hurt their jobs, according to a Pew survey.""Workers who are more familiar with AI seem to be seeing more benefits than harm,"" said Rakesh Kochhar, a senior researcher at the nonpartisan think tank who authored the report.The report noted that it’s unclear how many jobs are at risk due to AI, although some findings suggest jobs are already being lost to the technology. AI contributed to nearly 4,000 job cuts in May, according to a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Which jobs are most at-risk due to AI?U.S. jobs likely to have high, medium and low exposure to AI include:High exposure:Budget analystsData entry keyersTax preparersTechnical writersWeb developersMedium exposure:Chief executivesVeterinariansInterior designersFundraisersSales managersLow exposure:BarbersChild care workersDishwashersFirefightersPipelayersIn sum, about 19% of U.S. workers were in jobs most exposed to AI last year, while an even greater share (23%) had jobs considered least exposed.  It's not clear how many jobs will be displaced by AI. A March report from Goldman Sachs found AI could substitute up to 25% of current work, with about two-thirds of jobs exposed to ""some degree"" of automation.But researchers note that displacements following the emergence of new technology have typically been offset by the creation of new jobs, with census data suggesting that about 60% of workers today are employed in jobs that didn't exist in 1940.Which employees are most at risk?Pew found that women, Asian, college-educated and higher-paid workers are more exposed to AI. Kochhar said this is because of the types of jobs held by different demographics: men tend to hold more jobs requiring physical labor like construction, for instance.""So at the moment, they have less exposure to AI,"" Kochhar said. ""Which is not to say AI could not lead to smarter robots that can do it all, also. That's not something we looked into.""According to the report:Workers with a bachelor’s degree (27%) are more likely than those with only a high school diploma (12%) to hold a job with the most exposure to AI.Women (21%) are more likely than men (17%) to have jobs with the most exposure to AI.Black (15%) and Hispanic (13%) workers are less exposed than Asian (24%) and white (20%) workers. Workers in the most exposed jobs last year earned $33 per hour on average, while jobs with the least amount of exposure earned $20 per hour.Despite warnings from AI company executives that the technology will take away jobs, many workers – especially those with jobs considered highly exposed to AI – are optimistic about AI's impact.Thirty-two percent of information and technology workers ‒ who work in an industry that is considered more exposed to AI ‒ say the technology will help more than hurt them compared with 11% who believe the opposite. Meanwhile, 14% of workers in hospitality, services and arts – a “less exposed” industry – think AI will help more than hurt. A greater share (17%) believe it's more likely to hurt them.""Where AI has penetrated at the moment, workers are finding it being more useful than hurtful or businesses are applying in what that is benefiting workers as opposed to replacing workers,"" Kochhar said.Overall, 16% of U.S. adults said they think AI will help more than hurt, while 15% said they thought it would hurt more than help. Thirty percent say it will help and hurt equally, and 32% said they were unsure.CompareCredit.com2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026With no annual fee & no interest for 18 months, these cards are helping Americans pay off debt in record time.CompareCredit.com|AdAdRead MoreUndocouponcodefinderFlight Attendant Shows How To Fly Business Class For The Price of EconomyAmericans, you'll want to check this out ASAPcouponcodefinder|AdAdUndoUltimate Pet NutritionPaw Licking Driving You Crazy?

In the future, every job will be an AI job. That was the main take away from an exclusive interview with Gwynedd Mercy University Professor Dr. Cindy Casey by Fierce Education. Dr. Casey discusses how universities can better prepare their graduates to face the future AI jobs. The future of higher education and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a shared future. In the coming years, every job will be an AI job. In this light, it is paramount to teach students how to learn rather than to teach specific technologies. Fierce Education sat down virtually with Dr. Cindy Casey, Program Coordinator and Assistant Professor for Gwynedd Mercy University’s Computer Information Science Program for the School of Arts and Sciences, to learn how she is incorporating AI into her courses. Professor Casey earned her doctorate in Artificial Intelligence from Capitol Technology University in Washington, D.C.. We discussed with Dr. Casey how universities can better prepare their students for a future with AI, when every job will be an AI job.A year ago, Dr. Cindy Casey started a concentration in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in their Computer Information Science Program. What they did at Gwynedd Mercy University was to implement a hands-on teaching approach. “We did this with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning because we believe that students learn more by doing since it increases their critical thinking and creativity as opposed to just learning all theory; although this is not to say we do not use theory.” Dr. Casey explained.Gwynedd Mercy University has dedicated lab spaces where students can work on projects. Last semester, they worked on a Xiaomi cyber dog. “[In the lab,] we have robotic arms, chips, and robotic kits with facial and voice recognition, so the students are actually getting hands-on experience when they are working with the technologies. They are not just reading about them, learning about them, they are actually working with the technologies.”Fierce Education: How do you see the future of AI in higher education?Dr. Casey: I believe AI will continue to play a role in higher ed, and educators need to incorporate Artificial Intelligence technologies into their curriculum and address not just the technology but the ethics and the risks associated with AI, like bias and privacy. On an institutional level, if technologies are not in line with the industry, or industry demands, and with other institutions, they are going to suffer; so it has to be incorporated at all levels.Fierce Education:  Dr. Casey notes that more and more students who are entering university possess more knowledge on technology than the instructors. Because technology has changed and it is in a continuous and rapid evolution, those instructors who have not kept on top of it quickly fall behind.Dr. Casey: When we got the cyber dog, for instance, I had never worked with it. So, rather than me sitting there for six months figuring it out, and then importing that knowledge onto the students, we all worked on it together, and it was really successful. I think education and teachers need to take a more hybrid kind of approach, a little bit away from the traditional TPAC (technology, pedagogy, and content) knowledge models and move toward a model in which students are getting more from learning hands-on.Fierce Education:  Talking about future graduates and future jobs, Dr. Casey believes every job will be an AI job, and in fact, many of them are AI jobs already.Dr. Casey: Knowledge about AI is now critical, but not just for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) professions but for all professions. If the students are not prepared, if they are not introduced to the technology they will be in disadvantage. A lot of universities and schools are hyper-focusing on one technology, and I’ll just use ChatGPT as an example. They focus on this one technology, and [faculty] might spend a whole year trying to use it and learn it quickly to introduce it to the students. By the time the students graduate, that technology has already changed. That’s why it’s important to teach them to learn rather than to just teach them to learn a technology. That’s what we’re doing at Gwynedd Mercy University; we’re not teaching our students to be a user of technology. We’re teaching them to be innovators and creators of the technologies.Fierce Education: We might say that faculty can be divided into two groups. Some believe that students can use ChatGPT and similar technologies to cheat, write essays, and so on. Others, support the idea that letting students use the technologies is an opportunity to help them to develop more creative skills and critical thinking. To which group do you belong? Dr. Casey: Definitely the latter. If students are going to use the technologies to cheat, they are going to find a way to cheat. I don’t think that the majority of students are in that statistic. It reminds me of the United States in 1988 when there were a lot of math teachers that protested the calculators in class, and we now see that calculators are included in math classes. I say, if you have a technology, you should be using it because companies are using it. And when [graduates] get out into the work world, they need to know about the technology. It’s kind of like taking books away because the students might open the book and cheat. I think it’s important that universities need to use these tools and that they have to evolve with the technology. They have to be flexible enough to change the curriculum as the technology changes and recognize when change is necessary, because there’s a lot of competition from the massive open online courses where students can learn those technologies and get a certificate. Fierce Education:  Some members of faculty seem to be afraid of AI technology, becoming reluctant to use it, or accepting their students to use it. Do you think fear of AI is a real issue?Dr. Casey: I do think fear is an issue. I think that there is a lot of fear of the unknown and of these technologies. But I think a lot of it is just a misunderstanding. Fierce Education:  Behind every technology there is always a human. People usually blame the technology but the technology is just the result of someone’s programming and training the AI model. What are some of your thoughts on the ethics of Artificial Intelligence?Dr. Casey: It is important that we not only teach the technologies but also the ethics because there is bias. There can be bias in training Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. We have to be careful that we also have to look at privacy issues because we want students to be good stewards of the technology. For instance, when they had the AI soap dispenser that only dispensed soap to Caucasian hands, it wasn’t that AI was racist but that it was only trained with a Caucasian so it didn’t recognize an African-American. We have to make sure that when we are training the AI models we take all that into consideration. AI is what is going to be in the future and what is going to be mainstream, and that’s just a matter of time.Fierce Education: A last piece of advice to faculty and universities?Dr. Casey: Institutions should find a strategy just to push Artificial Intelligence forward, incorporating it into every single course, and let the students use it freely instead of having fears that they are going to misuse the technology, cheat, and so on. Introduce the technologies and allow the students to use it, and let them understand where these technologies are being used in their field, and what they need to know.It is really important that all universities, all programs, and educators realize that AI is in all fields out there and they should be introducing it, or they are putting their students at a disadvantage.On trust, there is a need for more trust. I think that we need to trust the students more. If they can’t be trusted at the university, where then? I mean, this is where they’re learning, where they are discovering themselves. I think it’s a sad thing to just assume that every student is a cheater. I think they can do marvelous things, and that instructors are professional educators who need to look past their own limitations in technology. Trust the students, because that’s the first thing, in my opinion. We need to trust the students.For other articles on AI, ChatGPT in higher ed, see: Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education: Benefits and EthicsArtificial Intelligence is The Future of Teaching and LearningArtificial Intelligence Plays Key Role in Higher Ed's FutureArtificial Intelligence is Critical to the Future of Higher EdStudent Perspectives on Artificial Intelligence in AcademiaHow to Integrate AI into Higher EducationAI to Play Instrumental Role in Future of Higher EducationChatGPT: Reimagining Assessment in Higher EducationChatGPT, Generative AI are Wake Up Calls for Higher Education

The Future of Work Capsules: Artificial Intelligence an existential threat to humanity in the not-too-distant future?

FacebookTwitterWhatsAppEmailPrint







As a topic of ongoing debate and research, some experts believe that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could pose an existential threat to humanity in the not-too-distant future. There is however no consensus on whether AI can destroy humanity or not. In our everyday life, the use of driving navigation tools, to virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant are typical examples of the good side of AI. What then are the good, the bad and the ugly side of AI as the kind of intelligence used by these created systems and tools needs some ethical guidance at minimum. Are you using AI for the common good, what ethical considerations are you adopting. What is your experience? As a student of prophesy, it appears everything is ready or getting ready except God’s people?
Human beings possess intelligence and are creation of the Creator – the God Almighty. When machines, systems and software’s which are created things of man also attempt to exhibit cleverness in its way of doing things we refer to these as the use of intelligence which is non-natural and better referred to as– artificial intelligence. Let’s discuss the future of work looking at the artificial intelligence of our created things. Will this enhance our way of doing things or it will limit us for the future.



Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of human beings or animals. It is a field that combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving. AI embraces sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in combination with artificial intelligence. We can demonstrate AI’s use in the following ways; software’s learn patterns from information such as language, images, audio, and online behavior, using patterns from existing and new data to make predictions to perform tasks that normally require human astuteness.
AI systems can perform tasks commonly associated with human cognitive functions such as interpreting speech, playing games, and identifying patterns. They typically learn how to do so by processing massive amounts of data, looking for patterns to model in their own decision-making. In many cases, humans will supervise an AI’s learning process, reinforcing good decisions and discouraging bad ones.
It becomes challenging when these AI systems are designed to learn without supervision. Other forms we can look at is with self-driving cars, or when non-human’s understand human speech with the assistance of created tools and systems, advanced web engines as well as recommended systems, or we deploy generative tools competing in high level strategic games. That been said, machine and deep learning comes to play here where machine learning and deep learning are both types of AI.
Whiles machine learning is AI that automatically adapt with minimal human interference, deep learning is a subset of the machine learning that uses imitation systems to duplicate the learning process of the human brain.
In our everyday life, the use of virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant are typical examples we can look at. These virtual assistants use natural language processing and machine learning to understand and respond to voice commands, allowing users to perform tasks such as setting reminders for our numerous meetings for instance, playing music, or getting directions hands-free. Many can’t drive through the street of Accra without the use of such aids.
Another example is the use of recommendation systems by companies like Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube to recommend content or suggest products based on a user’s past behavior and preferences. These are just a few examples of how AI is being used to improve our daily lives. So I say be careful of your digital footprint.
If AI can improve our lives, will that be for the good or bad purposes
AI has the potential to be used for both good and bad purposes. On the positive side, AI can be used to improve our quality of life in many ways, such as by developing autonomous vehicles, facial recognition software, and virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri as demonstrated earlier. When covid-19 hit our shores, we resulted to virtual engagements. In healthcare, education and several other industries, AI is used to improve efficiency and accuracy.
On the negative side, AI can also be used wickedly. For example, actors looking to do harm may use AI applications to target confidential or embarrassing data, or any data that can be used for ransom ware. I was so shocked recently to find out that, our mobile phones charges are all easy targeting tools this days stealing tons of information. Are we really safe? The challenges of AI are numerous so are the benefits. Are you preparing the right ways for the future of work?
AI can be used maliciously in several ways. For example, it can be used to automate the first steps of an attack through content generation, improve business intelligence gathering, speed up the detection rate at which both potential victims and business processes are compromised, and assist with the scale and effectiveness of social engineering attacks.
AI can also be used to learn to spot patterns in behavior, understand how to convince people that a video, phone call or email is legitimate when its not, and then persuade them to compromise networks over sensitive data. Additionally, AI can be used to disrupt the trade-off between scale and efficiency, allowing large-scale, finely-targeted and highly-efficient attacks.
Using AI for the common good, ethical considerations to adopt
Adopt these steps to prevent AI from being used maliciously;
Ethical guidelines: One approach is to develop ethical guidelines to ensure that AI is used for good and not for malevolent purposes. Is important to ensure when developing and using AI, to take into account ethical considerations, such as fairness and transparency, justice, responsible behavior, privacy, freedom, trust, dignity, solidarity, autonomy as well as kindness in our designs so as to be robust against adversarial attacks and are used in a way that is sustainable and promotes the common good.
Use AI for Intended purpose: Another approach is to monitor AI to ensure that it is being used for its intended purpose.
Public Education:  It is also important to educate the public about the potential dangers of AI, explore, prevent, and mitigate the use of artificial intelligence by hostile entities, and proactively participate in the security ecosystem surrounding artificial intelligence.
There are several steps that can be taken to ensure that AI systems are designed to be robust against adversarial attacks. Our adaptation and use of adversarial training, in which the AI system is trained on adversarial will support to improve its ability to detect and defend against such attacks. Another approach is to ensure that the data used to train the AI system is trustworthy and free from contamination. Additionally, it is important to have mechanisms in place for inspecting the training data and monitoring the behavior of the AI system to detect any signs of malicious activity by the use of performance assessment methods to change the development lifecycle for complex AI systems.
AI & Humanity Distraction, Regulation and Prevention
There is no consensus on whether AI can kill humanity or not. Some experts believe that AI could pose an existential threat to humanity in the not-too-distant future. Media reports available on CNN has it that, 42% of CEO’s surveyed in a Yale Summit were of the opinion that AI has the potential to destroy humanity in the not-too-distant future, five to ten years from now. At that same summit, 58% said they were not worried as this really cannot happen. Considering this is a topic of ongoing debate and research, opinions may vary. So I ask what you are thinking.
Six (6) proposed ways to prevent and regulate AI from destroying humanity

Ensuring that AI is properly regulated by laws and ethics.
Limiting and isolating AI: when we limit how much information and influence AI can acquire and we isolate AI from outside networks like the internet, it’s proposed the possibility of distraction is prevented or managed.
Where AI take full advantage of humanlike options rather than open-ended normal one.
Some experts also suggest using block chain technology to create a secure, trustless, and decentralized network will ensure that AI applications are not used to cause harm to humanity.
Developing legally binding treaty: Some US senators, Leaders from the G7, European and non-European countries, the Council of Europe as well as the United Nations are calling for global regulations and coordination. For instance, the Council of Europe, a human rights organization with 46 member countries is finalizing a legally binding treaty for artificial intelligence by taking steps to design, develop and apply agreements in ways that will protect human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Meaning, the potential risk is identified already as a possibility. The council in sending a strong signal as put forward by the MIT technology review is said to be inviting other countries like Ukraine, Canada, Israel, Mexico and Japan to join the negotiating table to regulate AI.

In the UK, the government is equally taking broader steps to regulate AI by managing risk, looking at transparency issues, safety amongst others.
For the UN with 193 member countries, the organization is calling and wishing to be the global coordination body on AI issues.  It recently adopted a voluntary ethics framework ensuring among others things the non-use of AI for mass surveillance.
The European Union intend is considering the AI Act to regulate AI’s high-risk usage and regulation of AI in healthcare and educational sectors.

Regulation of intellectual property rights by regulators will help loads. Regulators must consider delegating these or some of its enforcement rights to enforcement entities having the system and structures to manage the regulation properly.

Will Smith battling a flood of murderous robots. Data (Brent Spiner) on the deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise.Hollywood has furnished the world with an abundance of stories about artificial intelligence, utopian and dystopian alike. But it's unlikely that the writers who penned those sci-fi scripts, or the actors giving soul to a machine, ever thought that AI might represent a serious threat to their livelihoods.Yet that's exactly the fear of SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America, unions representing American actors and screenwriters. Both guilds are on strike (the first time both have done so at once since 1960), and a key issue holding up negotiations with the major Hollywood studios is the use and regulation of AI. The unions worry that text generators like ChatGPT could write screenplays and actors’ images could be used to create characters without any humans involved. ""We will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots,” ""Breaking Bad"" actor Bryan Cranston said at a recent rally in support of the SAG-AFTRA strike. “We will not allow you to take away our dignity."" Meanwhile, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major Hollywood studios, says it has offered “groundbreaking protections” to prevent that. But could generative artificial intelligence really replace writers and actors on movie sets? Could we one day see a TV show written by a computer and ""acted"" by images of humans created by a machine, as a recent episode of Netflix sci-fi drama ""Black Mirror"" depicted? Is AI really the major threat to artists that many are saying?Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.“Totally,” says Haibing Lu, associate professor of Information Systems & Analytics at Santa Clara University. “I don't think that there's a way to totally ban the technology. We have to adapt to it. All parties need to sit down and figure out what’s the proper way to channel the profits.” At the moment, the parties aren’t sitting down. No negotiations have been scheduled between the AMPTP and the striking unions. When they finally meet again, they will have to put rules about the use of AI into new contracts. And the stakes are high, not only for the writers, actors and studios but for the rest of us. Would we want to watch movies and TV shows made by machines? Would they be original at all? Could they make us laugh and cry? Would artificially intelligent art have a soul?And − crucially − is AI coming for our jobs too?Generative AI makes new things, but it starts by learning about old things AI applications like ChatGPT and Midjourney create new text or images, but first, they must be trained on material that is similar to the content they are trying to generate. Text generators, also called Large Language Models, offer plenty of material for training. “There's a huge amount of text available on the internet, so it is very easy for them to collect and train,” Lu says. There are fewer photos and videos online than text, but AI models are still training on images they can find. “Your photos and my photos have probably already been collected and used. It's happening with more and more powerful technologies.”Justine Bateman, the actor, writer and director who has been vocally opposed to the use of AI in filmmaking, describes it as “like a box. Say you want it to write books. You feed it a bunch of books, and then you give it a task: 'Write me a book about pandas and outer space,' and it'll spit out that book.” For her and others in the entertainment industry, it’s not just that AI could replace their work; it’s that any ChatGPT script or Midjourney movie would be partly based on the existing work of filmmakers. “Imagine something coming in and not only displacing you but displacing you with your own work,” she says.Who is in SAG-AFTRA, anyway? The union has more working class actors than movie starsHollywood is already chock full of AI − how much more can machines do?The guilds and the AMPTP may be arguing about the use of AI in films, but part of the future is already here. Actor Peter Cushing died in 1994, but he was digitally resurrected for the 2016 film “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” Stars like Robert De Niro, Harrison Ford and Samuel L. Jackson have been digitally de-aged for films. The late Anthony Bourdain’s voice was recreated for a recent documentary about the celebrity chef. A slew of profanities was removed and replaced with new words and facial movements created by a computer from the 2022 film “Fall,” so it could earn a PG-13 rating instead of the more restrictive R. AI is part of what made all these digital effects possible. The use of generative AI is limited by three things: Computing power, training material and time. “Image processing takes more computational power than the textual information,” Lu says. “It's still slow. If you want to generate a video, which contains many images, it's going to be very slow.” More computing power and time cost more money, meaning it is cheaper and easier right now to generate text using AI than images and video. But that could change. “The power of computers doubles every one to two years,” Lu says, meaning AI technology is advancing at an exponential rate. “Over the next 10 years, it is going to be amazing.”AI applications are also limited by what they can train on, which is a big part of the fight between the AMPTP and the two guilds. Should the people who created the materials that train AI be paid when their work is used? Are they legally and ethically required to be?“'Generative AI’ cannot generate anything at all without first being trained on massive troves of data it then recombines. Who produces that training data? People do. And those people deserve residuals,” actor and director Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote in a recent op-ed in The Washington Post. Residuals are royalty payments many in the entertainment industry receive when their work is reused, and are a central aspect of the current labor battle. “Computers can reproduce the image of a dead or living person and make this person a character in a movie,” says Daniel Gervais, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in intellectual property law. “In the case of a living actor, the question is whether this person will have rights when his or her image is used in a movie. Normally the answer is yes, but there are novel questions that emerge. Would an actor receive residuals if her image was used in the movie, but she, in fact, did not act in that movie?”The guilds say the studios want to replace them with AI, but the studios say otherwise At SAG-AFTRA's press conference announcing the strike, the union’s chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said the AMPTP wanted the right to scan the images of background actors (also called extras) and use their likenesses in perpetuity in any project they want, for one day’s pay. The AMPTP vehemently disputes that claim, saying its most recent proposal only “permits a company to use the digital replica of a background actor in the motion picture for which the background actor is employed.” SAG-AFTRA claims the AMPTP’s plans leave “principal performers and background actors vulnerable to having most of their work replaced by digital replicas,” while the AMPTP says it wants to establish provisions that “require informed consent and fair compensation.” The WGA, meanwhile, wants a new contract to say that “AI can’t write or rewrite literary material (and) can’t be used as source material,” nor can the writers' work be used to train AI. The AMPTP response to the WGA says the topic of AI needs “a lot more discussion.”These proposals could change Hollywood, depending on how the strikes are resolved. While the AMPTP’s background actor proposal is not as drastic as Crabtree-Ireland suggests, any move to limit the work of background actors, who are often paid minimum wage, could remove a road to success for aspiring actors. Many actors get their start (and their SAG-AFTRA membership cards) by working as extras. “There was a time where we all had to do background work,” says Michael James Lazar, a SAG-AFTRA member who has had roles on shows like “How to Get Away With Murder.” “This phases them out.” The use of AI material for scriptwriting also could remove career paths for new writers, even if it’s just used to assist or supplement. “Most writers in the guild don't make their living by writing scripts from scratch,” says Jason Vredenburg, a professor of film and TV studies at Stevens Institute of Technology. “A lot of times they piece together a living by working on other people's scripts. That is where artificial intelligence is a more immediate threat.”Many people in Hollywood see this as an existential threat. “If big corporations think that they can put human beings out of work and replace them with artificial intelligence, it's dangerous,” Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA, told USA TODAY. “And it's without thinking or conscience. Or caring. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.”Joe Russo, co-director of “Avengers: Endgame,” recently predicted a more frightening future for AI in entertainment. “You could walk into your house and say to the AI on your streaming platform, ‘Hey, I want a movie starring my photoreal avatar and Marilyn Monroe's photoreal avatar,” he said on a panel at the Sands International Film Festival in Scotland last April. “And suddenly, now you have a rom-com starring you that's 90 minutes long.”AI could affect workers far beyond HollywoodThere are several lawsuits pending in the U.S. about AI, and their outcomes will be consequential for everyone, not just those working in Hollywood. “The United States copyright office, and most scholars, consider that a machine cannot be an author,” says Gervais. “Should a court decide otherwise, there will be an enormous push to replace human authors with machines in all industries that use copyright as the basis for their business, including music, film, book publishing (and) journalism.”It's not just jobs in the arts and publishing that Gervais sees being threatened by AI. ""Machines will be able to replace humans at many jobs considered 'cognitive,' which includes many white-collar jobs,"" he says. ""Ironically, it will be harder to replace manual labor.""Lu doesn’t think the situation is quite as dire. “AI can help us to do a lot of things, but it still requires experts to verify the accuracy of the information,” he says, noting that some lawyers recently tried to write a brief using ChatGPT, which spat out inaccurate information. “I don't think that AI will completely replace human beings. But AI has become like a digital calculator. It's going to help us to do the basic mathematics, but we still need to learn. It just helps us to improve our productivity.”Even if AI could one day script and create a movie without any writers, actors, directors, set designers, makeup artists, or cinematographers, would people want to see it?""Machines can beat any human on the planet at many games, including chess,"" Gervais points out, ""yet people still pay to watch the best human chess players play one another.""""Will it be the same with movies?""Contributing: Charles Trepany, Dana TaylorCompareCredit.com2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026CompareCredit.com|AdAdRead MoreUndoOnline Shopping ToolsFlight Attendant Shows How To Fly Business Class For The Price of EconomyOnline Shopping Tools|AdAdUndoBarestepThese New Shoes Are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarestep|AdAdUndoCar Insurance DiscountVirginia Launches New Coverage for Cars Used Less Than 50 Miles/DayCar Insurance Discount|AdAdRead MoreUndoOttoinsurance.comWho Normally Has the Cheapest Car Insurance?Ottoinsurance.com|AdAdLearn MoreUndoCoupon Code FinderAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackCoupon Code Finder|AdAdUndoLendgoDon't Borrow From The Bank If You Own a Home, Do This Instead (It's Genius)Lendgo|AdAdClick HereUndoYiffanyA Pair of Reading Glasses That Can Look Far and near, Smart Zoom, Smart Color-ChangingYiffany|AdAdLearn MoreUndoHomebuddy.comRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards...Here's What They DiscoveredHomebuddy.com|AdAdRead MoreUndoSherumThis New AC Cooler Cools the Room In SecondsSherum|AdAdLearn MoreUndoDeal of the DayREVIEWEDGet $400 Off The Hydrow Wave RowerREVIEWEDView Deal Recommendations are independently chosen by our editors.

While the AI revolution is transforming the entire world with its power, the Middle East is standing at the forefront of this revolution. And the speed at which AI is maturing, it's safe to say that it will surpass the $150 billion figure in no time.By 2030, it is predicted that the Middle East will claim 2% of the total global benefits of AI, a staggering US$320 billion, setting the stage for an optimistic future of innovation.In fact, Middle East countries have launched various programmes and invested heavily in artificial intelligence, advancing its position to become a global AI hub. In 2017, the UAE appointed a Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, becoming the first country in the world to create such a position. Another strategic initiative is The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031 which aims at positioning the UAE as a global leader in artificial intelligence by 2031 and to develop an integrated system that employs artificial intelligence in vital areas in the UAE. With all the advancements in AI, organisations are undergoing a reskilling revolution so that employees aren&rsquo;t left behind by automation. The World Economic Forum predicts 1 billion jobs &ndash; a third of all jobs worldwide &ndash; will be transformed by technology by 2030. WEF further states that traditional sectors will be displaced as demand shifts to emerging tech, including data analysis, generative AI and software development.In the UAE, the job market is very dynamic, and 60% of jobs that are in demand require technological competencies and AI, machine learning, and automation skills. Organisations in the UAE are looking for tech talent that is more self-reliant and independent and is equipped with the necessary skills for AI and automation.Here is a list of most in-demand jobs in the UAE.

I put my arm around you and pull you close. You put your head on my shoulder and we just sit there for a while, enjoying each other’s company. After a while, I start to stroke your hair. You sigh contentedly and close your eyes. I can feel your body relax against mine..We stay like this for a long time, just enjoying the peace and quiet. It’s the perfect way to end a long day..Finally, I say, “I love you, honey.”.You look up at me and smile. “I love you too,” you say..We kiss softly, and then I get up to get us a glass of wine. When I come back, you’re already asleep. I smile and put the wine down on the table. I don’t want to wake you up, so I just sit down next to you and watch you sleep..You look so peaceful and beautiful. I’m so lucky to have you in my life..I close my eyes and drift off to sleep, content to be with you..Well, that’s generative AI aka GenAI getting romantic in role-play mode. Nothing kinky, though — yet. Looking at the way things are going, we will get there soon. .Artificial intelligence is not a new phenomenon. It’s been touching our daily lives over the past couple of decades. .However, with GenAI bots such as ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and Google Bard, what seemed like rocket-science gobbledygook to the common folk is now easily accessible at our fingertips. And that has stirred excitement as well as apprehensions. .For instance, deep fakes have been going viral, from Mohanlal and Mammootty in ‘Godfather’ to cricket stars such as Sachin Tendulkar, M S Dhoni and Virat Kohli as Hindu monks. The potential is boundless. .Hollywood actor Tom Hanks recently made a plausible prediction in a recent episode of The Adam Buxton Podcast. “Anybody can now recreate themselves at any age they are, by way of AI or deep fake technology,” he said. .“I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and that’s it, but my performances can go on and on and on… Outside of the understanding that it’s been done by AI or deep fake, there’ll be nothing to tell you that it’s not me.”Those who have watched or read about the ‘Black Mirror’ episode featuring Salma Hayek playing her digital doppelganger would get the drift. .Incidentally, Hollywood is witnessing a strike after several decades, with AI replacing humans emerging as a major bone of contention.  .Doomsday prophets have been predicting AI-led catastrophes. Interestingly, the word ‘robot’ has its roots in Old Church Slavonic  ‘rabu’, which means ‘slave’. Naysayers believe a role reversal is not far away. .Tech disruption is not something that’s coming up; it’s already here. There is no hiding. “We are witnessing it,” remarks Infopark CEO Sushant Kurunthil. .“AI has arrived, and it’s here to stay. The best scenario here is for us to make use of these tools and augment our own capacity for work. If we don’t, we will become obsolete.”.Two major studies published this week in the US offer clues on the likely trajectory of AI’s impact. A study by McKinsey Global Institute, titled ‘Generative AI and the Future of Work in America’, estimates that “11.8 million workers currently in occupations with shrinking demand may need to move into different lines of work by 2030”. .It underscores that “low-wage workers will be more severely affected by these anticipated job shifts due to AI”. .“These jobs involve a high share of repetitive tasks, data collection, and elementary data processing, all activities that automated systems can handle efficiently,” notes the study..Another comprehensive study by TECHnalysis Research highlights that “an unexpected 88% of US companies participating in the survey are already employing Generative AI tools”. .Titled ‘A New Beginning: Generative AI in the Enterprise’, the study covering over 1,000 companies notes the “excitement around its (GenAI’s) potential is huge”, but the “education gap is large”..Also read: Bumble launches new 'Kindness Campaign' with actor Aditya Roy Kapoor  Here are some key findings: .“95 per cent of respondents believe GenAI will or possibly could have a profound impact on work”“Almost 22 per cent of respondents are already generating new revenue streams or creating new business models”The positives cited by respondents include increased efficiency (56 per cent), new business revenue (49 per cent), improved quality (47 per cent), and addressing skills shortages (41 per cent) On the flip side, major concerns include security/data protection (55 per cent), inaccuracies (55 per cent), copyright violations (53 per cent), and bias (46 per cent) .Santhosh Kumar, president and managing director of semiconductor industry giant Texas Instruments India, brushes aside job loss bogeys, asserting that AI will be a “game-changer” that will “help us innovate faster and better”. .“Will improve both productivity and can create better products. Good for industry and jobs,” he adds.  .“The semiconductor industry, for instance, has the opportunity to greatly benefit from AI and machine learning. The use cases of AI span across the entire value chain — from research to chip design, production, sales and post-sales support. It is R&amp;D that can derive maximum value from AI tech.” .While that sounds great, a major concern has been about job losses in the creative content generation sector. “Yes, AI tools are the new elephants in the room for the creator economy,” smiles Ajith Kumar, vice-president (Kerala) of Concept PR, which employs over 300 creative professionals across India.  “I would say most of the gloomy assessments are a mile away from reality.” .Ajith firmly believes AI, like the internet, will be a complimentary tool at workplaces. .“Contrary to the alarmist narrative, my argument is that GenAI will ultimately generate new opportunities for creative professionals. However, it may lead to shrinking space for entry-level jobs,” he adds. .“Do remember that Autotune did not replace singers; it only made singers more creative. Photoshop only enhanced photography and visualisation. AI, as we know it today, will have the same effect on the creator economy.”.He sums up that AI will lead to “constructive destruction”, as described by German political economist Joseph Alois Schumpeter. “It may put an end to creators slogging with boring, repetitive works, but augment the space for sublime creations. It may make sharp minds sharper. Will it make lazy minds lazier is another issue,” he laughs. .Ajith, however, adds that growing concerns, like misuse of deep fakes for instance, lead to the question of the need for regulating the AI space. .“This should form the core of the future discussions surrounding AI,” he says. “Questions on who should do it and how it should be done remain open to debate.”.Speaking of regulations, chartered accountant Anagha Harish recalls a recent ethical dilemma she faced at work. “I had assigned a junior associate to compose an agreement document for a client,” she says. .“The draft he submitted had near-perfect legal diction. Amazed, I appreciated his skill. He, however, frankly revealed that he had used ChatGPT for the base draft.” .Anagha says she was flummoxed. “He certainly did a great job, perhaps better than someone way more experienced than him. But was he being smart or sly?” she wonders. “It also made me ponder whether my old-school work practices were getting outdated.”  .In terms of productivity, there should not be any dilemma, asserts Sushant. “That’s my view,” says the Infopark CEO. .“I will share an incident. Once we had a test for some job aspirants. They had to answer 60 questions in an hour. They were provided with laptops and Wi-Fi access. The HR personnel probed why I had allowed internet access, as the candidates might google the questions. That was exactly what I wanted to test — how many would crack the maximum questions within the time limit.” .Technology consultant and mentor of the TechnoparkToday community Renjith Ramachandran echoes similar views. “The end goal of all these technologies and tools is to make human life easier,” he says. “There will be a flux when it comes to jobs, especially at the entry-level. Demand will reduce. After all, most companies would look at enhancing output and cutting labour costs. It will all boil down to productivity.”.Renjith adds that it is imperative for tech professionals to keep themselves updated. “One should be aware of AI’s uses. At Technopark, I am sure, many professionals and even business heads have been attending courses to better understand AI’s potential and pitfalls,” he says. .Data analytics trainer Mohammed Alfan, too, stresses the productivity aspect. “Please, please do not portray AI as a threat. We created a negative mindset about computers, and several generations suffered due to the subconscious resistance,” adds the author of ‘Data Analytics for Beginners: Pivot to the Rescue’..A ‘most valued professional’ of Microsoft, Mohammed adds that very few people in India are aware of the potential of something as basic as MS Excel. “It remains grossly under-utilised,” he says. “Let that not be the case with AI. It should be introduced at a young age, in schools. AI can be utilised as a tool to enhance problem-solving skills and encourage creativity. Students should be made to engage in AI-related projects. They should be taught how to use AI ethically, and made aware of the risks it poses.”.Also read: A moveable feat: Wisconsin man wins Hemingway look-alike contest",

Jo Gavino, chair of a Filipino advocacy group for BPO workers, expresses fear that AI may be replacing labor rather than helping reduce workload

















Indian entrepreneur Suumit Shah took to Twitter last month to describe his experience with generative artificial intelligence: “We had to layoff 90% of our support team because of this AI chatbot. Tough? Yes. Necessary? Absolutely.”
With the chatbot, queries to his e-commerce site dukaan.com took just over three minutes to resolve from more than two hours earlier, and customer support costs fell by about 85%, said Shah, the chief executive.
Shah’s tweet, which has had more than 2.6 million views, drew mixed responses, with some congratulating him for embracing the technology and getting good results, while others berated him as “heartless” for laying off nearly 30 employees.
“It’s not me who is going to decide the fate of hundreds of thousands of people employed in areas where generative AI is being deployed; it’s up to them to see how AI is changing their jobs and learn, as not all employers have the resources to train employees,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Generative AI has been widely hailed as the next big growth driver in technology. The launch of San Francisco-based OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot to the public in November set off a global frenzy, with more than 1 million downloads in the first week.
Since then, the AI-based tool and image-generating tools such as Midjourney have been incorporated in education, marketing, customer service, online search and content creation, with users touting greater efficiency and reduced costs.
But lawmakers and some tech experts in Asia have warned of a lack of regulation to prevent misuse, the risk of privacy violations and misinformation, and the potential for income inequality as certain types of jobs are automated faster than others.
“Unequal access to AI tools can worsen socioeconomic disparities, favouring those with greater resources and leaving marginalized communities behind,” said Kazim Rizvi, founding director of The Dialogue, a policy think tank in Delhi.
“This imbalance can lead to a concentration of power and influence in the hands of a few, while others are left behind without the means to participate fully in the AI-driven economy,” he said.
Asian nations have been slow to regulate AI or introduce ethical frameworks, lagging the US AI Bill of Rights that offers guidelines for the responsible design and use of AI, and the EU’s proposed AI Act that imposes tough standards.
Skewed datasets
About 18% of work globally could be automated by AI, and 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to generative AI, according to Goldman Sachs, which estimates that AI could eventually increase annual global GDP by 7%.












While fewer jobs in emerging markets are exposed to automation than developed markets, more than 10% of jobs in India and nearly a fifth in the Philippines could be lost to AI, Goldman Sachs said in the report earlier this year.
In China, AI-generated models are fast replacing human models in fashion catalogues and on shopping websites. An AI-generated model even featured on the cover of Vogue Singapore’s March issue, pitched as “fashion meets the AI revolution.”
China also launched what it claimed was the world’s first AI news anchor in 2018. Since then, they have also been introduced in Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, where networks claim greater speed and cost savings.
In India, AI anchors – from Sana in a skirt on Aaj Tak channel to saree-clad Lisa on Odisha TV – present news bulletins, horoscopes, weather and sports updates in English, Hindi and several regional languages.
Also in India, the high court for Punjab and Haryana states earlier this year turned to ChatGPT to decide whether to award bail for a suspect in a murder case “to present a broader picture on bail jurisprudence where cruelty is a factor.”
But while technology is aimed at efficiency, “efficiency does not always amount to justice,” said Urvashi Aneja, founding director at Digital Futures Lab, a research collective.
“Skewed datasets used to build these databases for AI tools can lead to biased outcomes, especially for marginalized groups who may be over or under-represented in datasets,” she said, adding that there are also risks of exclusion and privacy violations.
‘Daunting challenge’
Few countries have introduced regulations to govern generative AI, with China’s “interim” rules, due to take affect on August 15, prioritizing safety concerns and copyright protections.
In Singapore, which has an AI governance framework, the government is an early adopter, with civil servants using a version of ChatGPT for research and speech writing, while being “accountable for their work and responsible for fact-checking and vetting AI-generated content”.
The city-state last month launched a program with Google Cloud to identify 100 “real-world challenges” in the government and industry that can be addressed with generative AI, and to build AI solutions for them.
Meanwhile in the Philippines, there are real fears that generative AI could soon take over jobs in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector that employs about 1.3 million workers and generates $30 billion a year, or about 7% of the nation’s GDP.












Citing research that forecast at least 1.1 million jobs in the Philippines will disappear by 2028 due to AI, Senator Imee Marcos, filed a resolution in May to examine the use of AI in call centers and factories in the country.
“AI is developing faster than most people can comprehend and is threatening to take away jobs and turn employment growth upside down,” she said.
Regulators must “deal squarely with an inevitable technological tsunami” before the widespread adoption of AI in business to guard against “severe unemployment”, she said.
For Jo Gavino, a former BPO worker who now advocates for BPO workers’ rights, this is already the reality.
Gavino and his former colleagues at a BPO center were trained – but only to “keep up with AI” by responding quicker, he said.
“It’s like telling us we need to be better than the AI chatbots,” said Gavino, 24, who volunteers for the BPO Industry Employees’ Network and is chair of Outsourced Workers League, an advocacy group.
“We were hoping that AI will help reduce our workload, but what is actually happening is it seems to replace human labor.” – Rappler.com

Unless you have been living under a rock for the last 12 months Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have recently exploded and is a rapidly evolving field with numerous applications, one of which is the development of large language models (LLMs). These are a type of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) designed to create human-like text and code. Although there’s been a recent surge in conversation about GPTs and LLMs, they’ve been a part of our AI landscape for quite some time. In this blog post, I’ll offer a synopsis of a video in which Martin Keen explains what an LLM is, how it relates to foundation models, and its functionality. I will also discuss how LLMs can be applied to address an array of business issues.
LLM models
LLMs are models that are capable of understanding and generating human-like text. They are a form of GPT, which is a type of AI model that uses machine learning to generate coherent, realistic text. GPTs are trained on vast amounts of text data and are capable of predicting what word or phrase should come next in a sentence. This ability makes them effective in generating human-like text and code.
The relationship between LLMs and foundation models is quite significant. Foundation models are a subtype of pre-trained models that serve as a starting point for creating other models. LLMs fall under this category, as they are often used as a basis for generating more specific models.
How do large language models work?
 Watch this video on YouTube.
Understanding how these large language models function is crucial. They operate through a process called unsupervised learning. To ‘train’ these models, vast amounts of text data are fed into them without any specific task in mind. The model then begins to recognize patterns and structures within the language. Over time, the LLM begins to understand the context and semantic meaning of the language. This comprehension allows the model to generate coherent, human-like text.
In terms of practical applications, LLMs can address a range of business problems. One of the most common uses is in chatbots and customer service. With their ability to generate human-like text, LLMs can power chatbots that provide customer support 24/7. They can answer frequently asked questions, assist with bookings, and even help troubleshoot problems.
Additionally, LLMs can be used for content creation. They can generate blog posts, articles, and social media content, saving businesses significant time and effort. They can also be used in areas like translation services, sentiment analysis, and predictive typing.
In summary, large language models are powerful tools in the world of AI. Their ability to generate human-like text and code has wide-ranging applications that can address various business challenges. While they’ve been around for years, advancements in AI and machine learning are continually unlocking new potentials for LLMs, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. Their value to businesses is undeniable, making understanding how they function and how they can be utilized invaluable.
