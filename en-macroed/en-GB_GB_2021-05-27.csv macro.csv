The European Commission recently published a proposal for a regulation on artificial intelligence (AI). This is the first document of its kind to attempt to tame the multi-tentacled beast that is artificial intelligence. 
“The sun is starting to set on the Wild West days of artificial intelligence,” writes Jeremy Kahn. He may have a point.
When this regulation comes into effect, it will change the way that we conduct AI research and development. In the last few years of AI, there were few rules or regulations: if you could think it, you could build it. That is no longer the case, at least in the European Union. 
There is, however, a notable exception in the regulation, which is that is does not apply to international organizations like the United Nations.
Naturally, the European Union does not have jurisdiction over the United Nations, which is governed by international law. The exclusion therefore does not come as a surprise, but does point to a gap in AI regulation. The United Nations therefore needs its own regulation for artificial intelligence, and urgently so.
AI in the United Nations
Artificial intelligence technologies have been used increasingly by the United Nations. Several research and development labs, including the Global Pulse Lab, the Jetson initiative by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , UNICEF’s Innovation Labs and the Centre for Humanitarian Data have focused their work on developing artificial intelligence solutions that would support the UN’s mission, notably in terms of anticipating and responding to humanitarian crises.
United Nations agencies have also used biometric identification to manage humanitarian logistics and refugee claims. The UNHCR developed a biometrics database which contained the information of 7.1 million refugees. The World Food Program has also used biometric identification in aid distribution to refugees, coming under some criticism in 2019 for its use of this technology in Yemen.
In parallel, the United Nations has partnered with private companies that provide analytical services. A notable example is the World Food Programme, which in 2019 signed a contract worth US$45 million with Palantir, an American firm specializing in data collection and artificial intelligence modelling.

No oversight, regulation
In 2014, the United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded a US$20 billion-dollar contract to Palantir to track undocumented immigrants in the U.S., especially family members of children who had crossed the border alone. Several human rights watchdogs, including Amnesty International, have raised concerns about Palantir for human rights violations.
Like most AI initiatives developed in recent years, this work has happened largely without regulatory oversight. There have been many attempts to set up ethical modes of operation, such as the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ Peer Review Framework, which sets out a method for overseeing the technical development and implementation of AI models. 
In the absence of regulation, however, tools such as these, without legal backing, are merely best practices with no means of enforcement.
In the European Commission’s AI regulation proposal, developers of high-risk systems must go through an authorization process before going to market, just like a new drug or car. They are required to put together a detailed package before the AI is available for use, involving a description of the models and data used, along with an explanation of how accuracy, privacy and discriminatory impacts will be addressed.
The AI applications in question include biometric identification, categorization and evaluation of the eligibility of people for public assistance benefits and services. They may also be used to dispatch of emergency first response services — all of these are current uses of AI by the United Nations.

Building trust
Conversely, the lack of regulation at the United Nations can be considered a challenge for agencies seeking to adopt more effective and novel technologies. As such, many systems seem to have been developed and later abandoned without being integrated into actual decision-making systems.
An example of this is the Jetson tool, which was developed by UNHCR to predict the arrival of internally displaced persons to refugee camps in Somalia. The tool does not appear to have been updated since 2019, and seems unlikely to transition into the humanitarian organization’s operations. Unless, that is, it can be properly certified by a new regulatory system. 
Trust in AI is difficult to obtain, particularly in United Nations work, which is highly political and affects very vulnerable populations. The onus has largely been on data scientists to develop the credibility of their tools. 
A regulatory framework like the one proposed by the European Commission would take the pressure off data scientists in the humanitarian sector to individually justify their activities. Instead, agencies or research labs who wanted to develop an AI solution would work within a regulated system with built-in accountability. This would produce more effective, safer and more just applications and uses of AI technology.

This article is part of ""The age of surveillance,"" a special report on artificial intelligence.
Clocking in? Take a selfie. 
That's how Uber drivers have to tell the ride-hailing app that they've signed on. Should the facial verification software the company uses decide the driver is lying about their identity — even when they’re not — they’re banned until further notice.

Uber’s algorithm also monitors workers’ performance and ranks them on a five-star basis. Consistently low ratings also mean they get kicked off the app.
This isn't exceptional. Companies are developing and purchasing an increasing number of workplace tools, many powered by artificial intelligence, to monitor and analyze their employees. Policymakers and workers say many of the tools are intrusive, discriminatory, and in some cases illegal.
With millions of workers forced to work from home during the coronavirus pandemic, companies say they need tools that ensure productivity and appropriate behavior when a corridor-strolling supervisor isn't around.
“Our Real-Time ID Check is designed to protect the safety and security of everyone who uses the app by ensuring the correct driver or courier is using their account,"" said an Uber spokesperson, who added that ""manual human reviews"" take place prior to any decision to block an Uber driver from the app, and that anyone removed from the platform can appeal the decision with the company.
In February, Amazon started tracking its drivers with cameras featuring biometric feedback indicators that monitor when drivers look away from the road or go past the speed limit. An Amazon spokesperson pointed to ""remarkable driver and community safety improvements"" as a result of the indicators, which led to a 48 percent decrease in accidents.
""Don’t believe the self-interested critics who claim these cameras are intended for anything other than safety,” the spokesperson said, adding that the company's use of surveillance tech in its workplaces is ""in line with local laws and conducted with the full knowledge and support of local authorities.""

The testing ground
While workplace surveillance continues to grow across sectors, the gig economy in particular has become a testing ground for AI-powered surveillance, according to the European Commission’s Jobs and Social Rights Commissioner Nicolas Schmit — and the technology is “quickly spreading” to other forms of work.
Companies were already beginning to lean on workplace analytics in a bid to boost productivity and efficiency, but those trends got a massive boost from the pandemic. Ford required some of its workers to wear wristbands with trackers to ensure social distancing at its plants. Amazon is planning to use AI to monitor which muscles employees use, which it says will ""decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from [musculoskeletal disease] risks.""
A report by the U.K-based Trades Union Congress (TUC) suggests that surveillance tech is on the rise. Fifteen percent of workers it surveyed said they had experienced new performance and productivity monitoring technology since the onset of the pandemic. 
AI systems are well-qualified for worker surveillance. They are efficient at counting and identifying the words typed in and websites visited; the number of emails sent; the number of steps taken in a warehouse; the number of bathroom breaks; their length — everything needed to monitor an employee's behavior on or offline.
U.S. tech company Sapience Analytics, which produces workplace surveillance software, says its products increase ""employee engagement,"" resulting in ""stronger productivity and higher career satisfaction.""
It drives ""transparency"" and objective decision-making, the company says, and is used by more than 90 companies in 18 countries. Sapience Analytics CEO Bradley Killinger has said that in using the company’s own surveillance software, he’s been able to see a number of employees operating at 145 percent capacity for six straight weeks.

“It’s to the point that I’m ordering people to just take three days, do something else,” he said.
But those kinds of tools have received pushback. 
The British bank Barclays has been under investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office — the country's privacy watchdog — since last August, over allegations it used Sapience Analytics' surveillance software to spy on staff.
The bank has since switched to only tracking anonymized data through the software, following critical media coverage. 
Meanwhile, Microsoft’s popular 365 office software suite has been criticized for workplace surveillance because it created “productivity scores” that allowed managers to track how actively employees email or collaborate in shared files.
It has since backtracked, also anonymizing such data so employers are no longer able to monitor individual workers.

""At Microsoft, we’re committed to both data-driven insights and user privacy,"" it said in a statement. ""We always strive to get the balance right, but if and when we miss, we will listen carefully and make appropriate adjustments.""
Experts warn that what looks like increased productivity may come at the cost of a greater risk of burnout, stress and mental health issues. According to a report commissioned by the European Parliament’s employment committee, surveillance technologies “reduce autonomy and privacy, lead to greater work intensification, and blur the boundaries between work and personal/family life.”
Can I speak to the manager?
The problem is that much of workplace surveillance is not regulated, according to Aída Ponce Del Castillo, a senior researcher at the European Trade Union Institute. 
“We don't have a law that says to the employer … you don't go beyond private life. We don't go beyond emotions. [Companies] don't trust the intimacy, privacy and dignity of a human worker,” Ponce Del Castillo said.
The Commission says it recognizes the severity of AI-powered surveillance in workplaces. Schmit said algorithmic management — the term given to the digital tools and techniques used to manage workers remotely — “leaves the workers with few means to challenge unfavorable decisions.”
The tech represents a “fundamental challenge for the future world of work in democratic societies,” Schmit said.

The Commission is currently working on an initiative to improve working conditions for platform workers, which is, in part, expected to address algorithmic management.
The bloc also introduced an AI law, which regulates “high-risk” uses of the technology. In the Commission’s proposal, workplace surveillance qualifies as a high-risk use, which means AI providers will have to meet certain standards, such as human oversight, to legally operate.
Countries including France, Germany and Italy limit how tech tools can be used to monitor workers at the workplace.
Rage against the machine
One line of defense for workers is the EU’s stringent data laws, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, which says workers have the right not to be “subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling.”
This seems to have some bite. In 2020, Hamburg’s data protection authority fined Swedish clothing giant H&M €35 million for profiling employees in records that included data about religious beliefs, details of health conditions and family problems. 
In a win for data and workers' rights campaigners, Spain passed a new law regulating online delivery platforms like Uber and Deliveroo, which requires them to inform labor unions of how algorithms affect their working conditions and includes provisions about algorithmic transparency.

Ponce Del Castillo said workers need to get AI-savvy to protect themselves. 
“It doesn't mean that they have to become AI experts or computer scientists, but they can well understand the impacts and the risks of this emerging technology at the workplace and in the tasks they produce,” she said.
Trade unions are also waking up to the risks presented by AI in the workplace.
“Technology has been the cornerstone of why trade unionism in Europe came out, because the Industrial Revolution initiated automation. And that's exactly what we're seeing today. It’s the same automation but for things we don't see,” she said.

This article originally appeared in the April edition of IT Pro 20/20, available here. To sign up to receive each new issue in your inbox, click here.Artificial intelligence (AI) is now part of our everyday lives. Many of us now wake up to our lights turning on automatically with the temperature of our home set just how we like it, and that's before we begin interacting with tools such as digital assistants and IoT doorbells, and even automation-powered services that write our emails for us.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, automation technologies have also become more widely used in the enterprise too. Some 73% of organisations worldwide are now using automation technologies, two-thirds of business leaders used automation to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a quarter of workers have seen a change to their role and ways of working because of the implementation of these technologies, according to research from Deloitte on robotic and intelligent automation.However, while we've long heard about the benefits of AI for businesses, from the fact that it can enable companies to save time and money by automating and optimising routine processes and tasks as well as increase productivity and operational efficiencies, some believe the technology could be making us lazy.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProDumbing it downIn 2015, Nigel Barber PhD, a biopsychologist and author, wrote in Psychology Today that much like how after the Industrial Revolution people became less physically active and began to gain weight as machines replaced manual workers, reliance on automation could make people less intelligent.The future of AI in the legal industry""AI is embedded in many features of modern life for the simple reason that intelligent machines can already outperform humans, including some aptitudes where there was once thought to be a human advantage, such as playing chess or recalling trivia in a game of Jeopardy,"" he said. ""In the future, the electronic assistant will develop to the point that it serves similar functions as a real living butler, fulfilling requests such as: 'Organize a dinner party for six on Thursday, Jeeves, and invite the usual suspects.""""At that point, our long struggle with challenging technologies is at an end. We can take it easy knowing that the hard work of planning and organising is being done by a better brain – the electronic assistant. Starved of mental effort, our brains will regress. The future is an aristocratic fog.""Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

""For example, most famously, in 2009 an Air France plane crashed into the Atlantic en-route from Brazil to France,"" Putoni tells IT Pro. ""The cause of the tragedy was the pilot's inappropriate response following the disengagement of the autopilot system during a storm.""Second, we need to avoid becoming complacent. In many situations, human supervision and vigilance remain crucial to ensure all runs smoothly and to step in where necessary to avoid error. For example, the first death in an accident involving the Tesla autonomous driving system was due to a combination of the system mistaking a white truck for the sky and the driver's complete lack of attention.""Putoni also warns that even when tragedy is not involved, AI technologies can create discomfort when it prevents individuals from exerting effort and practising skills that they care about.""For example, we show that people for whom cooking is an important part of their identity tend to dislike an automated cooking machine when this is presented with the purpose of taking over the cooking responsibilities completely,"" he adds. ""However people's responses became less negative when the same product was presented as still enabling the user's involvement, allowing collaboration between people and technology. Sometimes more automation is not better.""Work-shy AISome believe, too, that AI has the potential to make us lazy in the workplace – particularly if the implementation of the technology isn't well thought out.Jeet Mukerji, lead AI product manager at Beamery, tells IT Pro: ""AI has the potential to make us lazy in the workplace if we agree on three things. The first is that the original work, now done by AI, is worth mastering by humans. We choose to not do this, however, so will eventually lose this skill set – empathising, or doing mental maths, for example.""Secondly, we choose to consistently spend the time and energy, freed up by AI, in lower value moments such as deciding to scroll social media without an aim rather than read a book or to learn a new skill.""Finally, we choose to not understand the limits of AI we are using, expect too much of it, shirk our responsibility fully on it and don't engage the outputs of the AI correctly – by this I mean we think it is incapable of error, so don't sense check the outputs.""Machine learning vs AI vs NLP: What are the differences?Mukerji believes that we can prevent AI from making us lazy, but to do so we need to make the right choices: We need to understand the technology's limitations by engaging with it correctly and be proactive and curious enough to learn how to improve and add further value.""A further important point here is that this has nothing to do with AI, but is more focused on general training on how to be a productive human,"" Mukerji adds.AI don't agreeOthers, however, believe that AI is not making us lazy and suggest it's having the opposite effect: Giving us more headspace to spend on productive and enjoyable tasks at work.James Coombes, CEO of vector.ai, an AI startup for enterprise operations, tells IT Pro: ""It's still surprising today that employees continue to manually reconcile and organise documents and email communications. It's a waste of human talent. The good news is this is a problem AI can solve. There is so much value to be had by adding an intelligent layer that can do the more basic cognitive tasks and give us all our headspace back.""By automating monotonous tasks like 'answer that email', 'key in that data' and 'find that piece of information', employees can spend their time on delivering great customer service, learning new skills, increasing business development and pursuing passion projects. Not only will this lead to a better and more profitable business but a happy workforce freed from process pain.""This is a viewpoint shared by Rachel Roumeliotis, vice president of Data and AI at O'Reilly, an online learning platform focussing on digital skills, who tells IT Pro that AI will only make us lazy if businesses use it in a lazy way. She says that if the technology is used correctly, it should allow people to be more creative and use their time doing tasks that can make a palpable difference to the business.The future of AI in manufacturing""For example, AI can be used to take on the burden of repetitive, administrative tasks, such as reporting. This is work which is often necessary, but which can take a long time and is more of a tick-box exercise than anything else,"" she says. ""The onus, however, is then on businesses to encourage and enable their employees to replace that work with something more engaging and strategic.""In some instances, this will be easy for businesses. Those hours spent on administrative tasks can be replaced by brainstorms or extra hours of content production. For others, it might require some restructuring of the business. Either way, training should be at the very heart of it. The time saved on performing admin tasks can instead be used by employees to learn new skills and impact the business in a new, innovative way.""AI shouldn't be making us lazier, it should be enabling greater creativity and a greater sense of fulfilment within work.""Dr Lindsey Zuloaga, chief data scientist at HireVue, also believes that the benefits of utilising AI in the workplace far outweigh the potential downsides – particularly as a result of the COVID pandemic, which has caused workers to suffer from increased workloads and depleted resources over the past 12 months.""In hiring, for example, recruiters are able to spend less time on scheduling and more time on candidate engagement and personalised interactions, as well as streamlining communication between recruiters, hiring teams and candidates,"" she tells IT Pro.""All of these elements facilitate a faster turnaround time for new hires. This is far from laziness, but a modern way of driving efficiency and focusing your staff's time on tasks that hold greater value.""

Energy communities will play a key role in building the more decentralised, less carbon intensive, and fairer energy systems of the future. Such communities enable local prosumers (consumers with own generation and storage) to generate, store and trade energy with each other -- using locally owned assets, such as wind turbines, rooftop solar panels and batteries. In turn, this enables the community to use more locally generated renewable generation, and shifts the market power from large utility companies to individual prosumers. 
Energy community projects often involve jointly-owned assets such as community-owned wind turbines or shared battery storage. Yet, this raises the question of how these assets should be controlled - often in real time, and how the energy outputs jointly-owned assets should be shared fairly among community members, given not all members have the same size, energy needs or demand profiles.
It turns out that we can use Artificial Intelligence not only to use more renewable energy and protect the lifetime of expensive assets (such as batteries), but also to devise fairer ways to divide joint gains.
A paper recently published in Applied Energy: doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116575  by researchers from the Smart Systems Group (SSG) at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland (UK), has shown that tools from distributed AI (specifically multi-agent systems)  and cooperative game theory can be efficiently used to answer these questions. 
Their work develops new algorithms for smart control of community energy assets (such as local wind turbines and batteries), both to use more locally generated electricity, and to extend the lifetime of energy assets. They compare the case when individual households invest in their own home battery vs. investing in a larger community energy storage unit, and show the benefits of a pooled storage approach. Next, they propose several practically applicable and computationally efficient mechanism to share the outputs of these assets between homes in a fair way. Their works makes use of the key concept of marginal value - borrowed from coalitional game theory and distributed AI, looking at what each member contributes to (and costs) the local community. 
The authors were motivated in their work by real case studies from communities in the Responsive Flexibility (ReFLEX) project - the UK's largest smart energy demonstration project running on Orkney Islands in Scotland. In ongoing work, they also aim to explore the use of their methods for energy communities in India, in the framework of the CEDRI project (Community Energy Demand Reduction in India), a project led by researchers Heriot-Watt University in Scotland and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi, India.
Sonam Norbu, the PhD student leading the work from the SSG group said: ""This work is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to integrate a battery depreciation model in community energy optimization modelling. Data-driven monitoring of battery state of health is crucial for economically viable integration of local renewable generation, and the community energy model provides a very attractive application. Moreover, for researchers interested in cooperative game theory application in energy (which is a growing research area), the proposed model is one of the first to use such concepts in a community energy setting. Specifically, we propose a redistribution model for benefits in a community based on marginal value, a key concept in cooperative game theory.""
Dr. Valentin Robu, Co-Director of the Smart Systems Group added: ""This work, led by our PhD student Sonam Norbu, who joined us from Bhutan 3 years ago, demonstrates an excellent mix of top-level scientific impact and practical contribution. The contribution of the Responsive Flexibility project on Orkney Islands, one of the largest smart energy demonstration and ""living lab"" projects in the UK. I was delighted that Sonam's work was recently recognised by a nomination for the Young Professional Green Energy Academic Award, awarded yearly by Scottish Renewables, to top industry body for the renewable energy industry in Scotland.""

Therefore, Analytics Insight has listed the top 50 business use cases of artificial intelligence in diverse sectors..HERE ARE THE TOP 10 TED TALKS ON AI THAT ARE A MUST-WATCHTRANSFORMING THE WORLD WITH HIS LATEST AI INVENTIONS: ELON MUSKHUMILITY IN AI: CREATING PRINCIPLED AND RELIABLE AI DEVICES.Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare.Predictive analytics to validate the need for surgery.Predictive analytics is a gift to healthcare. Sometimes, we come across patients who say they underwent an unnecessary surgery due to a lack of predictions on what was coming. Fortunately, artificial intelligence is changing the fate of such burdensome risks and avoidable surgeries. By using artificial intelligence and predictive analytics, healthcare professionals can identify if the patient needs surgery or not. The technology will assist doctors to evaluate whether the operation is actually necessary or if there is an alternative with far less risk involved..Machine learning to diagnose infectious disease.Over the past one and a half years, medical experts have been whining that if the government knew the impact and influence of coronavirus, then they should've taken immediate action to control it. The repeated statement we hear is 'no one was aware of Covid-19's seriousness. Therefore, artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies could be used to detect future pandemics. Machine learning and big data can help change the way we diagnose infectious diseases. Using a proprietary database and ML algorithms, doctors can run genetic testing to see if the disease is infectious or not..Healthcare apps as medical assistants .Besides the actual medical services at hospitals and healthcare centers, artificial intelligence is helping patients in their daily care, be it at home or workspace. The tremendous amount of healthcare apps blooming on the App Store and Play Store, which could keep track of the patient's health conditions. Powered by voice assistant technology, the healthcare applications indicate patients to take medications and check their health performance. They also send alerts and education materials to keep the patients on their heels all the time when it comes to taking care of their health..AI-powered wearables track health conditions.Most of the time, follow-ups post a health condition are very mandatory. Unfortunately, we, humans, are very careless about keeping track of our health conditions. Some healthcare facilities offer such follow-ups or life coaching services, which are extremely expensive. However, AI-powered wearables can help patients in keeping track of their health issues. For example, when a patient wears an AI-powered watch, the device captures their real-time healthcare data and gives suggestions on required medication, exercise, activities, and even habits that could help them maintain their body..Early detection of dementia.Dementia is seen as an expensive disease. Serious conditions of dementia cost up to US$500 billion worldwide for patients. However, with early predictions, the patients can escape the haunting expenses and save up to US$118,000. Fortunately, the early detection of dementia is turning out to be possible with artificial intelligence. A sensitive diagnostic tool can compare the way patients answer questions and validate their accuracy, speed, and image properties. The tool can further say if they are likely to get dementia or not..Intelligent robots in surgery.Owing to the increasing global population and demand for doctors, robot surgeons are a must for the 21st century. Besides filling in for human surgeons, robot surgeons can actually do better in most cases. Surgery procedures require utmost patience and precision, and the skill of medical surgeons does not falter even when they operate without pause for hours and hours. Therefore, robotic assistants in surgeries can further help the surgeon achieve a new level of precision even for the most minute movement..AI in drug discovery and production.Drug and vaccine discovery is a very lengthy process. Generally, it takes up to 10-12 years for a pharmaceutical company to discover a vaccine or a drug that is fully effective on people. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for the rapid discovery of a vaccine. Pharmaceutical companies across the globe used artificial intelligence, especially, machine learning technology to detect the right base components that could work well in creating immunity against the virus. They also used data analytics to fast-track the trial process..Converting doctors' unstructured notes with NLP.Whether you agree or not, doctors' notes are beyond recognition in most cases. However, they are very important for diagnostic and tracking purposes. They define a patient's health condition, improvement or deteriorating situations, etc. Fortunately, natural language processing can unlock unstructured data directly from doctor's notes, and convert it to structure data. This helps reduce errors and speed up the transfer of information..Image analysis for medical diagnostics.However well trained and experience a physicist is, they are likely to end up missing something or the other in medical diagnostics. Fortunately, with the help of image analysis, doctors can get help from technology to analyze many of the medical images such as MRIs, X-rays, and CT scans. Besides, the technology can also provide feedback on what the human eyes miss out on..Automating the administrative tasks.Healthcare institutions are a big hub for data. On a daily basis, many patients come in and go out. Even though many don't need follow-ups, it is the responsibility of the healthcare workers to keep a record of patients' medical data. Therefore, they use AI to automate administrative tasks. It is expected that by implying AI in automating administrative tasks, healthcare institutions can save up to US$18 billion. Machines can also help doctors and nurses save time on labor-dense works..Artificial Intelligence in Banking and Finance.NLP to detect the risk of insurance.Insurance companies rely highly on data. They check for the applicants' background before processing the insurance procedures. Insurance companies sort through vast sets of data to identify high-risk cases and lower the risk. Using Natural language processing, insurance companies can analyze large volumes of text and identify key considerations affecting specific claims and actions..AI in fraud detection.Banking and financial institutions are highly prone to fraudulent transactions. Unfortunately, human employees can't keep track of all the transactions and mind malicious content or suspicious payments. But machine learning algorithms can analyze thousands of data points in real-time and flag suspicious or plain-right fraudulent transactions, stopping many fraudulent claims in the process..Machine learning helps in investment.As technology evolves, banking and financial institutions are employing artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies in their working system to do predictive tasks. One such predictive work is identifying the best investment plan or place. Machine learning-enabled technologies give advanced market insights allowing the fund managers to identify specific market changes much earlier as compared to the traditional investment models..AI-powered apps provide financial advice.Budget management apps are mushrooming like never before in the digital world. These apps powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning technology offer customers the benefit of highly specialized and targeted financial advice and guidance. They allow customers to track their spending daily using these apps and also help them analyze the data to identify their spending patterns.Customization of services.In the digital era, financial institutions are using AI-powered mobile applications to track user behavior and provide valuable personalized suggestions to them. Besides, banks are leveraging the facility for consumers to do unlimited transactions from their smartphones. Banks are also tying up with financial transaction platforms and are rolling out services, offers, and insights based on users' search patterns..Artificial Intelligence in Automobile .AI Application in Enhancing Design .Artificial intelligence (AI), programmable shading, and real-time ray-tracing are heavily used in transforming the traditional design process of the product.

Online exam proctoring company ProctorU will have humans review AI reports of possible student misconduct on tests before forwarding them to colleges and universities, it said this week.

Online exam proctoring company ProctorU announced earlier this week that it will no longer send artificial intelligence-generated reports of potential student misconduct to institutions without ProctorU staff members first reviewing the footage -- a development raising more questions than it answers about higher education’s use of the technology.
ProctorU, like many companies offering remote proctoring services, employs AI technology to monitor student movement during tests and flag activity that might indicate a student is cheating. Typical behavior that may be flagged by the AI includes students getting up from their seats, not looking consistently at their screens or talking out loud.
Previously, as part of its cheapest proctoring package, ProctorU sent AI-generated incident reports to instructors without staff members reviewing them first. The company offered this package on the condition that any AI-generated reports would be reviewed by instructors. But that wasn’t happening, said Jarrod Morgan, founder and chief strategy officer of ProctorU.
“It’s not appropriate for AI to be making decisions, and it’s unfair to expect faculty to do that work,” Morgan said.
The company will continue to use AI, but two ProctorU staff members will now review webcam footage to try to ensure that students are not penalized inappropriately for innocent actions. This is particularly important for students granted special accommodations, Morgan said.
Finding a way to ensure that there is human oversight over academic integrity decisions is something that ProctorU has been discussing for a long time, Morgan said. During the pandemic, when use of remote proctoring software exploded, it became undeniable that the proctoring services were not being used as intended, he said.
Some institutions use online proctoring simply as a deterrent and rarely proceed with disciplining students when AI flags suspicious behavior. But others do not understand the AI is fallible and may act on reports without reviewing them, said Shea Swauger, a librarian and researcher at the University of Colorado at Denver who is critical of instructors’ reliance on online proctoring tools.
This can be a problem, because companies avoid responsibility for making the call on what is and is not cheating.
“It’s pretty standard for all proctoring companies that are offering AI-assisted or fully AI monitoring services to encourage faculty to review any flagged behavior before making any academic integrity judgements,” Swauger said. “That’s kind of the main way that these proctoring companies are sidestepping accountability when it comes to discrimination. No company is saying that they determine if there is cheating. They all say that they flag suspicious behavior, then it’s up to individual institutions to determine if there’s cheating.”
The potential to discriminate against students with disabilities, students who are neurodivergent, students of color and even caretakers and parents is high when remote proctoring services rely on AI and not human judgment, Swauger said.
Even with human judgment, there is room for implicit biases and discrimination, Swauger said. If you’re a faculty member and you’re constantly being alerted that students with disabilities or medical conditions and students of color are suspected of misconduct, there is a possibility that will change how you interact with those students, he said.
“Even if you never have a finding of academic misconduct, that repeated suspicion could trigger implicit biases and discriminatory responses from faculty,” said Swauger.
It is positive that there may be fewer instances of students being accused of cheating when they did nothing wrong, said Amelia Vance, director of youth and education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum. Still, she sees potential for things to go wrong when people are involved in making judgments. She wants to know more about the training that ProctorU staff members receive.
By making such a public statement about its change of heart, ProctorU hopes to differentiate itself from its competitors and deflect some of the negative press that online proctoring companies have recently received. But Swauger says he feels the move is little more than a PR stunt.
“I’d describe it as ethics-washing,” Swauger said.
ProctorU’s competitors do not appear to be ready to follow in the company’s footsteps by imposing similar limits on the use of AI technology in online proctoring.
“It’s a bit funny they chose to lob grenades over their shoulders as they exited the room,” said Jodi Feeney, chief operating officer of online test monitoring company Respondus, in an email. The vast majority of online proctoring sessions in higher education use automated systems instead of human proctors because they are much more cost-effective, she said.
“I don’t think ProctorU was committed to cannibalizing their lucrative human proctoring service,” Feeney said. “A typical university using Respondus Monitor spends less than 25 cents per proctoring session. Live, human proctoring often costs $25 per exam. The price points and services are entirely different.”

The pandemic-induced acceleration of technology adoption has led many sectors, both private and public to leverage AI for their advantage and growth. In the last few years, AI has enabled many innovations and driven the proliferation of technologies like IoT, robotics, analytics, and voice assistants. According to a report, AI topped the patent filings in 2020. This is not new, AI has been securing a large number of patents in the last few years..AI and its Impact.Artificial intelligence has had huge impacts in the healthcare sector, especially since the pandemic last year. AI and other disruptive technologies powered a patient-centered healthcare system. This new care scenario is all digital and highlights the importance of data and analytics. Predictive analytics, machine learning, and AI played a pivotal role in drug discovery and vaccine development. In the coming years, the use of these advanced technologies will become the norm, and easily accessible electronic medical records will simplify diagnostics. AI will enable healthcare systems to track and monitor patients in real-time, gain genetic data, and each person's lifestyle. Algorithms will take up the charge of diagnosing health conditions and prescribing suitable treatments.The combination of AI and human intelligence will lead to the development of sophisticated cybersecurity innovations in the future. AI will enable an efficient battle against the rising cyberattacks and crimes.AI has a lot to offer to the transportation and manufacturing sectors. In the coming years, we might witness the perfect evolution and commercialization of smart and autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars are already available today, but by the next two to three decades, the world will witness more people using them. The manufacturing sector will also gain benefits from AI. Increased use of robots in factories and predictive analytics in the sector will enhance the quality of products and streamline the logistics and supply chain..Other potential impacts of AI would be in elder care systems, education, finance and business,  customer services, media, space exploration, smart cities, and smart homes..Will AI Dismantle the Human Workforce?.This fear has always been looming on artificial intelligence. Experts and tech giants like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawkings have warned humans against the adverse consequences and threats of the technology. One of the widely claimed consequences is AI taking over the human workforce and causing massive job losses. This claim is highly overblown and researchers agree that although AI might displace humans from some job roles, it will not replace the whole workforce. AI is likely to replace routine jobs and repetitive tasks like picking and packaging goods, separating and segregating materials, responding to repetitive customer queries, etc. Even today some of these functions are still done by humans and AI will take over these tasks in the future..Thus, the human workforce engaged in these simple and routine jobs should be upskilled and trained to perform new skills. As we are very far from reaching artificial general intelligence, the current technology cannot augment human intelligence fully. This is the reason people should be trained to do high-skilled tasks like programming, coding, and others that are essential for the future. The transition from the old to the new job should be smoothened to reduce the massive impacts..The Future of AI- Should We Fear Apocalypse?.Recently, a paper published by researchers at AMOLF's Soft Robotic Matter group, exhibited how self-learning robots can easily adapt to changing circumstances. These small robotic units were connected to each other for them to learn on their own to move..The future will harness the hidden capabilities of AI and encourage the creation of self-learning robots. Reinforcement learning and training algorithms based on Generative Adversarial Networks will be explored. AI will also prove a flagbearer for sustainable technologies and will be used against fighting climate change by reducing pollution levels and encouraging green AI research..Artificial intelligence is highly criticized for its bias and privacy infringement concerns. Many companies and research firms are thus trying to develop ethical AI approaches and algorithms that are unbiased. We can expect that this will become possible in the coming years..Another threat posed by AI is the violation of human rights by impacting privacy. For example, voice assistants like Alexa and technologies like facial recognition have been blamed for invading the privacy of humans and probably eavesdropping into their lives. These technologies are feared to be used by the powerful state and federal authorities against specific minorities and will curtail the freedom of speech and expression. Thus, AI needs to evolve much to move ahead of these criticisms and enable an ethical and trustworthy system in the future..Apart from these critical issues, AI is not going to cause an apocalypse as Hollywood Science-Fiction portrays. The AI we are using today is known as narrow AI and for it to be able to create on its own, there needs to be a huge evolution. This evolved AI is named artificial general intelligence (AGI). We are still very far from achieving AGI and its future is still hypothetical. To reach this advanced phase, AI should be able to fully comprehend and augment the complex human brain, which is a far-fetched thought right now..Hence, AI as such might not become a threat to human existence. However, there are chances that humans might misuse the capabilities of the technology for causing harm. The scenario of war robots being used to feed harmful motives through their algorithms can be an example. Therefore, in the years ahead, it is necessary to develop an ethical AI ecosystem without human biases and this might alleviate the potential risks of AI in the future..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
