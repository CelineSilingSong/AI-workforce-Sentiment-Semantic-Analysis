But that doesn't mean we should ignore the human side of work – skills in areas that robots can't do so well. I believe these softer skills will become even more critical for success as the nature of work evolves, and as machines take on more of the easily automated aspects of work. In other words, the work of humans is going to become altogether more, well, human.
9 Soft Skills Every Employee Will Need In The Age Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Adobe Stock

With this in mind, what skills should employees be looking to cultivate going forward? Here are nine soft skills that I think are going to become even more precious to employers in the future.

1. Creativity

Robots and machines can do many things, but they struggle to compete with humans when it comes to our ability to create, imagine, invent, and dream. With all the new technology coming our way, the workplaces of the future will require new ways of thinking – making creative thinking and human creativity an important asset.

PROMOTED
2. Analytical (critical) thinking
As well as creative thinking, the ability to think analytically will be all the more precious, particularly as we navigate the changing nature of the workplace and the changing division of labor between humans and machines. That's because people with critical thinking skills can come up with innovative ideas, solve complex problems and weigh up the pros and cons of various solutions – all using logic and reasoning, rather than relying on gut instinct or emotion.
3. Emotional intelligence
Also known as EQ (as in, emotional IQ), emotional intelligence describes a person's ability to be aware of, control, and express their own emotions – and be aware of the emotions of others. So when we talk about someone who shows empathy and works well with others, we’re describing someone with a high EQ. Given that machines can’t easily replicate humans’ ability to connect with other humans, it makes sense that those with high EQs will be in even greater demand in the workplace.

4. Interpersonal communication skills
Related to EQ, the ability to successfully exchange information between people will be a vital skill, meaning employees must hone their ability to communicate effectively with other people – using the right tone of voice and body language in order to deliver their message clearly.

5. Active learning with a growth mindset
Someone with a growth mindset understands that their abilities can be developed and that building skills leads to higher achievement. They're willing to take on new challenges, learn from their mistakes, and actively seek to expand their knowledge. Such people will be much in demand in the workplace of the future because, thanks to AI and other rapidly advancing technologies, skills will become outdated even faster than they do today.

6. Judgement and decision making
We already know that computers are capable of processing information better than the human brain, but ultimately, it's humans who are responsible for making the business-critical decisions in an organization. It's humans who have to take into account the implications of their decisions in terms of the business and the people who work in it. Decision-making skills will, therefore, remain important. But there's no doubt that the nature of human decision making will evolve – specifically, technology will take care of more menial and mundane decisions, leaving humans to focus on higher-level, more complex decisions.
7. Leadership skills
The workplaces of the future will look quite different from today's hierarchical organizations. Project-based teams, remote teams, and fluid organizational structures will probably become more commonplace. But that won't diminish the importance of good leadership. Even within project teams, individuals will still need to take on leadership roles to tackle issues and develop solutions – so common leadership traits like being inspiring and helping others become the best versions of themselves will remain critical.
8. Diversity and cultural intelligence
Workplaces are becoming more diverse and open, so employees will need to be able to respect, understand, and adapt to others who might have different ways of perceiving the world. This will obviously improve how people interact within the company, but I think it will also make the business’s services and products more inclusive, too.
9. Embracing change
Even for me, the pace of change right now is startling, particularly when it comes to AI. This means people will have to be agile and cultivate the ability to embrace – and even celebrate – change. Employees will need to be flexible and adapt to shifting workplaces, expectations, and required skillsets. And, crucially, they'll need to see change not as a burden but as an opportunity to grow.

Bottom line: we needn't be intimated by AI. The human brain is incredible. It's far more complex and more powerful than any AI in existence. So rather than fearing AI and automation and the changes this will bring to workplaces, we should all be looking to harness our unique human capabilities and cultivate these softer skills – skills that will become all the more important for the future of work.

Intelligent algorithms are used to create paintings, write poems, and compose music. According to a study by an international team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the Center of Humans and Machines at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, whether people perceive artificial intelligence (AI) as the ingenious creator of art or simply another tool used by artists depends on how information about AI art is presented. The results were published in the journal iScience.

          The ""Portrait of Edmond De Belamy"" was created by the French artists' collective Obvious with the help of artificial intelligence. In 2018, the Christies auction house sold it for more than 430,000 US dollars. A scientific study has now examnied who should be considered the creator of the painting.

In October 2018, a work of art by Edmond de Belamie, which was created with the help of an intelligent algorithm, was auctioned for 432,500 USD at Christie’s Auction House. According to Christie's auction advertisement, the portrait was created by artificial intelligence (AI). The media often described this as the first work of art not created by a human but rather autonomously by a machine. The proceeds were not given to the machine but instead to the French artists’ collective Obvious. This collective had fed an algorithm with pictures of real paintings by human painters and trained it to create images autonomously. They then selected a certain picture, printed it, gave it a name, and marketed it. However, the programmers who developed the artificial neural networks and algorithms used were not mentioned, nor did they receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the painting.“Many people are involved in AI art: artists, curators and programmers alike. At the same time, there is a tendency – especially in the media – to endow AI with humanlike characteristics. According to the reports you read, creative AI autonomously creates ingenious works of art. We wanted to know whether there is a connection between this humanization of AI and the question of who gets credit for AI art”, Ziv Epstein, PhD student at the MIT Media Lab and first author of the study, explained.Recognition for the artistsTo this end, the researchers informed almost 600 participants about how AI art is created and asked who should receive recognition for the work of art. At the same time, they determined the extent to which each participant humanizes AIs. The individual answers varied greatly. But on average, people who humanized AI and did not perceive it merely as a tool also felt that AI should receive recognition for the AI art and not the people involved in the creation process. When asked which people deserve the most recognition in the process of creating AI art, recognition was initially given to the artists who provided the learning algorithms with data and trained them. Only then were curators named, followed by technicians who programmed the algorithms. And finally, the “crowd” (i.e. the mass of Internet users who produce the data material with which AIs are often trained) was mentioned. Respondents who humanized the AI gave more recognition to the technicians and the crowd, but proportionally less to the artists. A similar picture emerges when respondents are asked about who is responsible, for example when an AI artwork violates copyright. Here, too, the ones who humanized the AIs placed more responsibility on the AIs.Language influences our view of AIA key finding of the study is that it is possible to actively manipulate whether people humanize AIs by changing the language used to report on AI systems in art. The creative process can be described by explaining the fact that AI, supported only by an artistic collaborator, conceives and creates new works of art. Alternatively, the process can be described by explaining the fact that an artist conceives the artwork and that the AI executes simple commands given by the artist. The different descriptions changed the degree of humanization and thus also to whom the participants attributed recognition and responsibility for AI art from among the human actors.“Because AI is increasingly penetrating our society, we will have to pay more attention to who is responsible for what is created with AI. In the end, there are humans behind every AI. This is particularly relevant when the AI malfunctions and causes damage – for example, in an accident involving an autonomous vehicle. It is therefore important to understand that language influences our view of AI and that a humanization of AI leads to problems in assigning responsibility”, says Iyad Rahwan, director of the Center for Humans and Machine at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and co-author of the study.

Across the country today, it is widely acknowledged that access to mental healthcare is just as important as clinical care when it comes to overall wellness.







Mental health conditions are incredibly common in the US, impacting tens of millions of people each year, according to the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH). However, estimates suggest that only half of people with these conditions receive treatment, mainly due to barriers like clinician shortages, fragmented care, and societal stigma.
For the many individuals suffering from anxiety and depression, these existing barriers – coupled with the current healthcare crisis – can significantly interfere with the ability to carry out life activities.
“The prevalence of mental health disorders – particularly depression and anxiety – is high. If anything, the prevalence of these conditions has only increased as a result of COVID-19. The need is greater than ever now,” Jun Ma, PhD, Beth and George Vitoux Professor of Medicine at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) department of medicine, told HealthITAnalytics.



Jun Ma, PhD


To broaden mental healthcare access for people with moderate depression or anxiety, UIC researchers are testing an artificial intelligence-powered virtual agent called Lumen. The team will train the tool to provide patients with problem-solving therapy, a structured approach designed to help people focus on learning cognitive and behavioral skills.
The two-phase, five-year project is funded by a $2 million grant from NIMH.
“The goal is to meet the many challenges of people who don’t have ready access to proven psychotherapy, which has been a longstanding issue,” said Ma.
“Over the years, my research team has done clinical trials testing the effectiveness and dissemination of different behavioral and psychosocial interventions. The results of that work, combined with the gaps that exist in practice and patient access, have really catalyzed the idea for this project.”
Using the same technology as Amazon’s Alexa, researchers will develop an app that will act as a virtual mental health agent, talking through steps and strategies with patients following a validated treatment protocol.
“If we prove this way of delivering problem-solving treatment is a safe and effective, once we put it into production anyone with access to Alexa would be able to access the program. We're very early in the development phase, so it will probably be another few years before it’s widely available,” said Ma.
“We're making good strides. We’re starting to conduct a user study on a small scale. And the immediate next step after this initial user development and the user testing phase will be a small scale randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which we'll enroll patients with depressive symptoms and/or anxiety.”
Individuals will complete eight one-on-one counseling sessions over 12 weeks. In each session, participants will identify a problem they view as affecting their life and as a source of emotional distress, and the counselor will help them define goals and possible solutions. Solutions are then compared, and counselors and patients work to make an action plan to implement the chosen solution.
Researchers will program Lumen using the Alexa Skills Kit to act as the virtual counselor working with participants, taking them through problem-solving steps and encouraging them to engage in meaningful and enjoyable activities to improve their emotional well-being.
During the first phase, 80 study participants who report elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms will test the Lumen tool, with the potential for wider use going forward.
The researchers hope that the project will increase access to mental healthcare for those who need it most.
“One of the main advantages of using AI as a platform to provide therapy is the ability to scale and reduce significant barriers to access, as well as sustainability of proven psychotherapy such as problem-solving treatment,” said Ma.
“The technology can also be quite adaptable to individuals depending on when they need it and how they want to access it, and can potentially reduce barriers due to stigma.”
Despite the serious potential for these tools to broaden the availability of mental healthcare, Ma also noted that the use of AI in this area comes with several concerns – just as the technology does in any part of healthcare delivery.
“Like any novel treatment in early development, it's unknown at this point what the effectiveness and the sustained impact of AI in psychotherapy. It's certainly very worth exploring, as we are doing now,” she said.
“Patient privacy is a very important area that warrants not only additional research, but also additional legislation and regulation. Additionally, AI and the underlying algorithms are trained using existing data and information, and there could be unintended consequences due to implicit or explicit bias. It’s very important to have transparency in how the models are trained, as well as to ensure the data used to train such models is representative of the population.”
Ma’s statements align with those of other industry experts, who consistently highlight the necessity of safety, data privacy, and health equity when building and using these tools.
In a recent viewpoint published in JAMA, authors noted that chatbots and other AI-powered virtual agents are still relatively new, and much of the data available comes from research rather than widespread clinical implementation. For these reasons, healthcare leaders must continually evaluate the capacity of these tools to improve care delivery, the authors stated.
In the development stage of the Lumen tool, Ma’s team at UIC plans to do just that.
“If the small-scale RCT proves promising, then we'll go on to a larger-scale RCT in which we'll recruit 200 patients, again with that depressive symptoms and/or anxiety, to further test the potential impact and effectiveness of Lumen,” Ma said.
Ultimately, the success of these tools in healthcare will depend on the industry’s ability to weigh possible risks and rewards.
“Given the potential concerns, it's worth emphasizing the importance of balancing excitement for such novel treatments with caution. It's a fine line between ensuring protection of patient privacy and confidentiality and not restricting the innovation in this area,” Ma concluded.

Fifteen years ago, one may have not recognized many of the career choices that are emerging today — such as cloud marketing manager, or data scientist. So, just imagine what job titles we might see fifteen years from now.


The authors of a report out of Citrix did just that — visualizing the workplace of the year 2035, and the types of professionals who will be making the economy tick. These new-age jobs will be tied into technology initiatives such as AI and related technologies.

The Citrix workplace study was the result of a year-long series of surveys and interviews with 1,800 business leaders, along with thought leaders from academia, think tanks, multinational boards, and leading authorities on the future of work. Here are examples of new jobs that will be created:

PROMOTED



Robot/AI trainer
Virtual reality manager
Advanced data scientist
Privacy and trust manager
Design thinker
Chief of artificial intelligence


Interestingly, business leaders are more inclined to see the potential of these new types of jobs than rank-and-file employees, the study finds. For example, while 82 percent of executives see their companies bringing in robot and AI trainers over the next 15 years, compared to only 44 percent of employees.

Business leaders see artificial intelligence as taking a prominent role within their organizations. More than half of those surveyed (57 percent) believe AI will make most business decisions and potentially eliminate the need for senior management teams. In fact, 75 percent think most organizations will have a central AI department overseeing all areas of the business.

There are mixed reactions to the impact AI will be having on productivity. Executives see AI boosting productivity, but their employees are skeptical. “Business leaders believe that technology and AI will bring a major boost to productivity, but employees are much more uncertain,” the study finds. Almost nine in 10 business leaders (89 percent) envisage AI-powered digital workspaces increasing worker performance and productivity in their organization by 2035, compared to just 55 percent of employees who share this view.
Almost three quarters of business leaders (73 percent) believe that technology and AI will make workers at least twice as productive by 2035, while only 39 percent of employees share this vision, the researchers also find. Almost two-thirds of employees (65 percent) are unclear on how their organization will gain a competitive advantage from using AI when it is being used by every business, compared to just 16 percent of business leaders who believe the advantages are unclear.
Ironically, employees see AI usurping management roles, something executives don’t expect. Employees are much more likely than business leaders to predict that by 2035, the leadership team will be partially or completely replaced by technology (33 percent of employees versus seven percent of leaders), while most business leaders (74 percent) predict only a partially augmented leadership team in 2035.

If you could play god to an emerging artificial intelligence, would you? Or better: Should you?That’s the moral dilemma at the heart of Agence, an interactive “dynamic film” that blends virtual reality, gaming, and cinematic storytelling to let audiences influence a handful of evolving, three-legged AI creatures, known as agents. The project, which recently debuted at the Venice International Film Festival, is a co-production between Toronto-based indie studio Transitional Forms and the National Film Board (NFB) of Canada. Think of it as Tamagotchi for the 2020s, but with real consequences on the development of digital life. “I think the core artistic vision of this is to cause people to question humans’ role in artificial intelligence,” says Pietro Gagliano, creator of Agence and founder of Transitional Forms, “both in its creation and interaction right now. These are virtually living creatures that are learning. They’re learning from us and we’re teaching them. This is a moment that I hope that we look back on in time as, you know, we made the right choices. And we decided to empathize with these creatures that didn’t ask to be born.”Empathy is a key element of what makes Agence so impactful to the viewer, and why many will find themselves returning to its infinite world: It’s one thing to hold a plastic keychain in your hand with a screen depicting a digital creature you need to nourish and care for, and quite another to be present in their world where they can observe, interact, and learn from you.

“I love VR because it puts you in the same liminal space as the AI agents. We can actually develop relationships. Agence does that in a very basic way. I imagine VR being very important for studying and developing AI in the future because you can actually share the same space as these creatures, as these beings,” says Gagliano.
“These are virtually living creatures that are learning. They’re learning from us and we’re teaching them.""

At the start of every “visit” to Agence, as Gagliano calls each experience, the viewer is greeted by a vast realm of planets, but is then quickly transported as an omnipresent entity to a planet inhabited by five agents. There is no gameplay goal here; there are no skills to level up or points to gain. You can either observe the agents as they coo in their baby-voiced computer gibberish or you can interfere in their world as an agent of change, picking them up to calm them and break up fights, or casting them off into the void below as punishment. All of which impacts their development.“Agence is a simple story, but I think it’s a powerful one,” says David Oppenheim, the NFB creative producer who helped co-develop the project alongside Gagliano. “This social dilemma of introducing an object of desire into their world where you can cause chaos or you can help to create balance.”

That object of desire is what I’ve come to call a “hypnoflower,” but which the team internally refers to as a MacGuffin because of how it advances the story. Once planted by the viewer, this flower has the potential to entrance and visibly intoxicate the curious agents, ultimately leading to their potential doom or survival. And that ending has everything to do with how you, the viewer, meddles. You can either let the curious agents discover and “consume” the dangerous flower, which then grows and upsets the gravity of the world, or you can somehow save them from it. This is in addition to managing the limited emotions and quirky habits of the agents, some of which can be quite aggressive and kick one another.

“These creatures that are in the film...they’re probably not even as smart as insects,” Gagliano says. “But they’ll evolve over time with our work and hopefully the work of future collaborators, if people are into this idea.”

The agents Gagliano’s referring to fall under the category of reinforcement learning AI and thus have “brains” (unlike Tamagotchi which ""grow"" based a pre-determined set of user inputs), though game AI is also present within Agence to help move the story forward. It’s these reinforcement learning agents, in particular, which will be shaped over time by millions of visits (that's no exaggeration — my last visit indicated that nearly 2.5 million agents had ""died in the making of this film""), and the eventual training of a community of outside engineers and enthusiasts using machine learning tools like Google’s open-source TensorFlow and Unity’s ML-Agents. 




This little creature, who goes by the name of Trinny, has a ""brain.""

To accomplish this lofty goal, Gagliano and Oppenheim intend to release an open-source tool kit post-launch.“We will make that available to a small subset of engineers,” explains Oppenheim. “We’re working with some of the leading minds in reinforcement learning right now. That’ll allow people to train agents and review their brains. And for those brains to go back into the film. You could decide to train an agent, for example, where they’re rewarded for every collision they have with another agent; Their characteristic or their personality will be one of aggression. They’re trained with millions and millions of steps…millions of iterations.”
“These creatures that are in the film [...] they’ll evolve over time with our work and hopefully the work of future collaborators, if people are into this idea.”

Upon entering Agence’s world, viewers will initially be presented with a mix of four gaming AI and one reinforcement learning AI, though this is customizable via a menu option that allows you to assign brains to all or some of the agents. “Because they’re pretty dumb, we just keep it to one [agent], but the user can go in and turn on more. There’s a little info button to say who trained the brain that you’re watching. So if we have collaborators, we can credit them there,” says Gagliano.But opening up Agence’s toolkit to the engineering public is just one way Gagliano and Oppenheim intend for their little agents to grow. The pair also plan to create and foster a community through a dedicated channel on Twitch, the Amazon-owned live streaming platform, and a regular schedule of programming. Essentially, this would be like a window into a digital zoo of sorts, granting curious onlookers the ability to observe these AI creatures as they progress through their training, and chat with the development team.“I think it has the potential to become this crowdsourced evolving film,” admits Oppenheim.




Get away from that flower!

Indeed, the continued evolution of these endearing AI agents rests heavily on the community reaction to Agence, and it’s for that reason Gagliano and Oppenheim have opened the gates wide and considerably lowered the cost barrier to entry. Agence releases today on Steam, Oculus Store, and Viveport for $2.99. And though it hinges on VR as an empathic key, a headset is not required to visit. Agence will also be available as a 2D PC experience through Steam, in addition to a $1.99 mobile version for iOS and Android, so most everyone can have a hand in shaping these creature’s growth. “If we can continue our efforts and have other people involved with training reinforcement learning brains, then…this is very unconventional for me as a director to say, but I want those creatures to mess up the film,"" says Gagliano. ""I want them to go in there and surprise us and do things that we never [expected], especially when you turn all five brains on and we can see little ecosystems forming and whatnot. And they’re far too dumb to do that right now.”

Professor Zhu Songchun, an award-winning expert in computer vision at the University of California at Los Angeles, has joined Peking University to lead its Institute for Artificial Intelligence, the university said in a statement last Friday.
The university said it was working with Beijing city and the central government to set up a new and separate AI research institute in collaboration with other leading Chinese universities. Zhu will be involved in the setting up of the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence, but the statement did not give further details.
Born in 1968 in Ezhou, Hubei province, Zhu obtained his PhD at Harvard University in 1996 after graduating from the University of Science and Technology of China in Anhui province. He joined UCLA in 2002 after a brief stint at Stanford and Ohio State universities.
How artificial intelligence makes travel safer during Covid-19
Zhu is an expert in computer vision, cognitive science and other interdisciplinary studies. At an AI conference held in Chengdu in May last year, Zhu said that “70 per cent of the human brain’s cerebral cortexes are used for processing vision. Research into computer vision opens the gateway to artificial intelligence.”
One year after he joined UCLA, he received the highest honour in computer vision, the Marr Prize, with other researchers for their study of the process of decomposing images into visual patterns, also known as image parsing.
Last year, his team published a research paper establishing the potential for robots powered by artificial intelligence to earn the trust of humans in a project funded by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency.
Zhu and his researchers looked at “explainable AI” that allow robots to explain their behaviour effectively when performing complex tasks and earn people’s trust.


According to a study earlier this year by MarcoPolo, a US think tank affiliated with the Paulson Institute in Chicago, China is the largest global source of top-tier AI talent. However, 88 per cent of those who completed graduate studies in the US have chosen to stay and work there, helping America lead the way in the field.
Chinese AI researchers accounted for the largest share of international researchers working at US-based companies and institutions.
But as the technological war between the US and China unfolded, Washington heightened its scrutiny of Chinese researchers and stepped up its visa controls, casting a shadow on global flow of AI talent into the US, the MarcoPolo study concluded.
Another Chinese AI expert in the US and a long-time acquaintance of Zhu, Microsoft’s former head of artificial intelligence and research Harry Shum, was also appointed by Peking University in August to chair the academic committee of the Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
US has ‘modest’ lead over China in artificial intelligence but gap has narrowed, American think tank says
Rumours about Zhu’s return surfaced in Chinese media earlier this month, with initial speculation that he might join another leading AI institution at Tsinghua University, which traditionally has enjoyed an advantage in sciences and engineering.
Zhu said he had long-time friends and work partners at both Peking and Tsinghua, but it was Peking University’s edge in humanities and social sciences that attracted him.
“The development of AI could not be separate from philosophical exploration,” the university statement quoted Zhu as saying, adding that there would be more emphasis on interdisciplinary research at Peking University.
Beijing’s deputy mayor Sui Zhenjiang recently told a forum that the capital city would strive to become a global leader in AI innovation in the coming decade and try to attract global talent as well as nurture local experts.

RIYADH: The finalists have been announced for the AI Artathon, a first-of-its kind international event designed to highlight the creative potential for humans and machines to work together to create art.

More than 2,000 people from more than 50 countries — including artists, graphic designers, experts in artificial intelligence, and programmers — applied for the competition, which was organized by the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) as part of the Global AI Summit.

After a qualifying round in Riyadh in January during which the participants competed to create initial AI-based artworks, 300 of them were selected to progress to the next stage. They formed 20 teams that took part in a boot camp, during which they were taught by experts to use in their work machine-learning algorithms and generative adversarial networks (a framework for machine learning in which two neural networks compete against each other).

The 10 teams that have reached the final were announced on Tuesday during a live-streamed online event that showcased the artworks created by the teams using AI tools and techniques. The top three, who will share a $133,000 prize fund, will be announced on Oct. 22, the second and final day of the Global AI Summit.

The online event will bring together key decision-makers from government, academia, business and technology to discuss global issues and challenges, and the ways in which AI can benefit humanity and shape the new normal.

“SDAIA is proud of these high-quality artworks created by the finalists of the AI Artathon,” said Abdullah Al-Ghamdi, president of SDAIA and chairman of the organizing committee of the Global AI Summit. “I am very pleased to see artists and AI developers collaborating to utilize the capabilities of advanced AI to create these innovative artworks, despite the novel coronavirus pandemic. I look forward to announcing the final winners during the Global AI Summit.”

The final 10 teams competing for the top prizes are:

Saudi Picasso

The idea for their artwork came from the question ‘what if Picasso had been Saudi?’ The team created a database of works by Picasso and Saudi artists that the AI technology used to create an artwork highlighting the depth, richness and diversity of Saudi art.

Emergent Typographies

In an effort to reflect the beauty of the nature in the Kingdom, the artists used geographic and topographic images, along with existing lines and shapes, to train the AI to combine them and create a digital artwork based on new patterns and inspirations.

Maruem — The Chimera Ant Queen

Inspired by popular manga and anime series “Hunter x Hunter,” and in particular characters called Chimera Ants, this project combines digital graffiti with other artworks and concepts to create a unique new piece that traces the development of a Chimera Ant from single cell to birth.

AI Authentic Clay

The development of personality is usually the result of accumulation of knowledge, including, for example, awareness of culture, religion and civilization. The members of this team decided to express their deep feelings about the authenticity of their culture, presenting an experience that combines and reorganizes shapes and patterns through the use of AI.

Esoteric & Energetic “Heya”

Words can have a number of meanings, energies and inspirations. For example, “heya,” which translates as “she” in English, can have many meanings: “she” might be a daughter, a sister, a mother, a hard worker, or many other things. This artwork is inspired by the energy, feelings and strength conveyed by “heya.” The team collected selfies of diverse women and drawings reflecting the word “she,” and AI technology was used to analyze and link them to create a new digital work of art.

The Beauty of Belonging

Architecture is a fundamental characteristic of any cultural production that enhances the sense of belonging, so this artwork aims to shed light on the richness and variety of architecture in Saudi culture. Different architectural styles and patterns are combined and integrated using AI algorithms to produce an artwork with a new color and style, creating an abstract visual experience.

Museum of GANs

What if we could depict the emotional states and impressions of a character based on portraits? And what if we could create new artworks based on differing emotional states? This work tries to answer these questions by collecting and classifying a large number of well-known portraits according to their emotional states and impressions, which the machine used to create the artwork.

Machine Mythology

As humans, when we read a text there are always intertextualities and associations to perceptions, figures and so on in our minds. To create this artwork, the team developed a model that enables the machine to read these associations using AI. A random text generator was used to create stories that are used to transform the textual into the visual.

Ultimate Pattern

Different architectural shapes and styles have developed over time in the Arab world that are used in buildings, mosques and other landmarks to create characteristics unique to Arab art. The team combined many different patterns to develop a single aesthetic pattern that offers the best comprehensive picture. Patterns were processed using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks, which classified, connected, developed and redrew shapes the machine used to create a new work of art.

Novel2Art

What distinguishes digital art created using AI is its limitless capabilities to recognize and translate human creativity. Taking the novel as a crucial element of literary creativity, this work is the result of an attempt to inspire the computer to create art by reading a novel using linguistic programming, extracting its concepts, and then transforming those concepts into photos and shapes.

Artificial intelligence programs are gradually becoming part of the perfume development process. In what way does perfumers’ work engage with these new methods? How can we reconcile this rational, mathematical approach with a creative process requiring sensitivity and subjectivity? Is the future of perfumers at risk? Jean-Christophe Hérault, senior perfumer at IFF, explains the implications of what is sometimes referred to as a revolution, while reminding us of the importance of human intuition.



What do artificial intelligence programs used in fragrance creation consist of? 
They are super-algorithms created by our engineers, capable of complex calculations from a database: raw materials, formulas, consumer data, etc. These tools can be useful because they go beyond the capacities of the human brain, in terms of both the amount of data they process and the complexity of analysis. 
What can they bring to perfumers’ work? 
We’ve been using artificial intelligence at IFF since 2006, and I must say that it can produce some astonishing results. For example, I fed our program a creation that had been tested on consumers. The idea was to improve the performance of certain attributes in regard to the panel. I followed the program’s exact instructions, and the reworked version did indeed achieve better results than the original in terms of how the targeted attributes were perceived. The most startling thing about it was that the recommendations were very different from what, on principle, I would have decided to do. The value of artificial intelligence lies chiefly in its ability to provide a different perspective on a formula and trigger the use of new ingredients. 
As these programs develop, will we still need perfumers? 
As a perfumer, naturally I’m both judge and jury, but I think we will. The name is misleading: there’s no artificial ‘intelligence’ per se. What does exist, for the moment, is an illusion of intelligence. It’s a case of managing data that’s input into the algorithm – data that comes from human creations. The machine is not involved in pure creation: what we have is augmented formulation rather than augmented creation. It serves perfumers as a guide, a form of assistance, that complements their knowledge and expertise without replacing them. Additionally, the artificial intelligence program at IFF is supported by in-house experts who work with the perfumers. 
What does that mean in practice?
To create a first-rate formula, you need a vast amount of knowledge about the history of perfumery, as well as sensibility, vision and belief, but you sometimes also need an unconscious or random intervention – everything that artificial intelligence currently can’t offer. Pierre Bourdon, who trained me, confessed to me that when he was working on Cool Water for Davidoff in 1988, he decided to revisit the fougère genre by intentionally omitting coumarin, one of its standard components. He destabilised his structure, shifting it towards greater freshness. What went into it was true creative intent, but also a dash of intuition: he told me he used an ingredient – which I won’t mention so I don’t reveal his secret – without consciously knowing that it would allow him to boost the fragrance’s green aspect. It was only years later that he understood exactly what it had contributed. Pierre also needed a great deal of belief to create his perfume, because he submitted the formula to several projects. His concept made it to the final few several times but always lost out because it stood out too much from the other fragrances. Nevertheless, Pierre believed in his formula, and in the end Cool Water was a remarkable success. This is why creating fragrances always requires the human brain. But artificial intelligence opens up new possibilities, encapsulated by the term ‘augmented formula’.
