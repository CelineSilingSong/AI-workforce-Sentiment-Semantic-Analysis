It is based on data from more than 2 million LinkedIn members in Ireland.The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) defines generative AI as “a machine-learning model that is trained to create new data, rather than making a prediction about a specific data set”. Examples of the technology include ChatGPT.The report said 60 per cent of “Generation X” workers – those born between 1965 and 1980 – have occupations where generative AI can “complement or transform the work they do, freeing up their time for more value-added and creative work”.READ MOREIs it cheaper to visit Center Parcs abroad rather than stay in Longford? CrowdStrike tech outage: How can we stop the next catastrophe? Aer Lingus holds its breath on deal for industrial peaceHow to ... clean up your Threads feedMillennials (1981-1996) were also identified as having a “significant opportunity” to leverage generative AI, with 56 per cent in jobs where generative AI can “complement or transform” their role.For “Generation Z”, which refers to those born from 1997-2012, this number drops to 52 per cent, with the remaining 48 per cent currently working in roles whose core skills are “less able” to leverage generative AI.According to the report, technology, information and media is the sector with the “greatest potential” to harness generative AI tools and technologies.“An AI-enabled workforce is now critical to transforming our enterprise base and supporting future investment to Ireland,” said Mr Lohan.“With AI set to transform a wide range of industries and occupations, leaders will need to be proactive in upskilling their workforce to develop the AI skills and knowledge necessary to leverage the technology.“By continuing to invest in upskilling opportunities, we can unlock the true potential of Ireland’s workforce and ensure we remain a highly attractive location to do business well into the future.”Microsoft Ireland site lead James O’Connor said: “Generative AI is a transformative technology that has significant potential to empower our workforce, enhance productivity and unlock exciting new business opportunities.“These findings point towards the need for Ireland to move to a skills-based labour market.“As generative AI becomes more prolific in the workplace, it is crucial that industry continues to collaborate with Government and academia to empower the current and future generations with the AI skills and knowledge to take full advantage of the technology.”LinkedIn Ireland head Sue Duke said the skills that professionals need to thrive in an AI-powered world of work are “dramatically changing”.“We expect to see a 73 per cent change in skills needed in the Irish workforce by 2030, up from a 54 per cent change expected before the rise of generative AI,” she said.“By policymakers, companies and professionals focusing now on building the right skills in the workforce to adopt and complement generative AI, we have the opportunity to be at the forefront of this transformation and maximise its potential for Ireland’s economy.”Sign up for Business push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phoneFind The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to dateOur Inside Business podcast is published weekly – Find the latest episode here",https://schema.org,NewsArticle,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'postOfficeBoxNumber': 'PO Box 74', 'streetAddress': '24-28 Tara Street', 'addressLocality': 'Dublin 2', 'addressRegion': 'County Dublin', 'addressCountry': 'Ireland', 'postalCode': 'D02 CX89'}","[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Customer Support', 'email': 'services@irishtimes.com', 'telephone': '+353 1 9203901'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Sales', 'email': 'mediasolutions@irishtimes.com', 'telephone': '+353 1 5320978'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'News Desk', 'email': 'newsdesk@irishtimes.com', 'telephone': ''}]","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': '', 'width': 1024, 'height': 547}",The Irish Times,"['https://www.facebook.com/irishtimes/', 'http://www.linkedin.com/company/the-irish-times', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/IrishTimes', 'https://twitter.com/IrishTimes']",https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/04/12/critical-need-for-irish-workforce-to-embrace-artificial-intelligence-ida/,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The Irish Times', 'url': 'https://www.irishtimes.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': '', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Colin Gleeson', 'url': 'https://www.irishtimes.com/author/colin-gleeson', 'sameAs': 'https://www.irishtimes.com/author/colin-gleeson'}]","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://schema.org/WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/04/12/critical-need-for-irish-workforce-to-embrace-artificial-intelligence-ida/'}",2024-04-12T09:32:34.898Z,2024-04-12T09:32:34.898Z,‘Critical’ need for Irish workforce to embrace artificial intelligence - IDA ,Business,"['https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/WUHWAMQUYBHBPFCJ37NJM65LVI.jpg?auth=894b07d059d8b822cfd8e45118fb4831120a7b0f242bf9c2e1d21bc1939ded2b&smart=true&width=1600&height=900', 'https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/WUHWAMQUYBHBPFCJ37NJM65LVI.jpg?auth=894b07d059d8b822cfd8e45118fb4831120a7b0f242bf9c2e1d21bc1939ded2b&smart=true&width=1600&height=1200', 'https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/WUHWAMQUYBHBPFCJ37NJM65LVI.jpg?auth=894b07d059d8b822cfd8e45118fb4831120a7b0f242bf9c2e1d21bc1939ded2b&smart=true&width=1600&height=1600']",,False,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Photo: Ty Wright/Bloomberg NewsGenerative AI is reshaping the conversation around hiring at many companies as they realize that one way the pricey technology will pay off is if it helps them employ fewer people to do more work. While early wins from using generative AI don’t necessarily portend future layoffs, they hint at the need for companies to hire less, chief information officers say. This observation comes as business technology leaders seek returns for their increased spending on AI. “We’re looking at a lot of interesting tools and they have a lot of promise—but then when you look at the cost of the tool you say, ‘Am I really going to realize that productivity internally or am I just going to increase my technology cost?’” said KeyBank CIO Amy Brady.Newsletter Sign-upWSJ | CIO JournalThe Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team.PreviewSubscribeBrady said she sees AI playing a role in workforce size to the extent that if it does make workers more efficient, companies will ultimately save money by doing more with smaller workforces. KeyBank deployed a conversational AI tool that is helping reduce the volume of calls coming to the customer service contact center, said Brady. “We probably hired less because we have less call volume,” she said. Anupam Khare, senior vice president and CIO of specialty vehicle maker Oshkosh Corp., also sees generative AI changing the workforce conversation, with employee productivity gains reducing the need to hire, even in the case of backfilling as people are promoted up in the organization.“Three years ago we were a $7 billion company and now we are a $10 billion company—much larger, but our number of people are not increasing in that proportion,” said Khare, who added that Oshkosh has identified 40 potential generative AI use cases and already has a couple in pilot, including code generation.It is too early to see expectations of reduced hiring materialize nationally. U.S. job growth has remained strong, with employers adding a seasonally adjusted 303,000 jobs in March, more than the 200,000 economists expected. Separately the IT job market is expected to shrink, driven in part by declining demand for non-AI skills.  Nationwide Chief Technology Officer Jim Fowler. Photo: NationwideAt insurance company Nationwide Chief Technology Officer Jim Fowler has guided the creation of a tool that analyzes the cost of a given generative AI use case across several different available proprietary large language models. The tool has been helpful, he said, in determining the cost efficiency of each AI model, based on parameters such as the number of requests and the length of inputs and outputs. It has also helped Nationwide determine whether it was more cost effective to stick with a traditional process. For example, in its property and casualty business, Fowler said the company decided not to move forward with a use case that looked for answers on specific customer questions related to claims. But even those results didn’t sway him from a belief that the company will be able to grow without having to hire proportionally more clerical workers. “Our goal is really to allow our associates to do the higher-order thinking work and to take the clerical work away so that we don’t have to add more people as the company grows,” Fowler said.Advertisement

The adoption of generative AI is set to transform the nature of work, with tools replacing certain tasks and reshaping traditional work profiles in various industries.
However, many jobs remain “uniquely human” — sector by sector, the impact of artificial intelligence will be felt differently.
According to consulting firm McKinsey, generative AI’s ability to identify patterns across enormous sets of data and generate new content is “an ability that has often been considered uniquely human”.
With its ability to create, GenAI can “be used to write code, design products, create marketing content and strategies, streamline operations, analyze legal documents, provide customer service via chatbots, and even accelerate scientific discovery.”
This may be great for progress, but it is not so great for people who make their salary in roles that are now under threat.
McKinsey adds that GenAI can be used to automate processes completely or as a tool with “humans in the loop” —which is currently more common “given its current level of maturity”.Advertisements




While some jobs may become partly or even fully automated, some jobs — especially those requiring personal care— cannot be easily replaced by algorithms.
And having skills in the use of AI will create new opportunities for some workers.
In this deep dive, we explore and predict the industries and jobs that may be at risk from — or safe from — the rise of the machines.

Key Takeaways

AI in the workplace continues to grow, with 53% of firms using it in 2023 and 24% planning for 2024.
Despite job concerns, 91% of companies intend to hire — but they do value AI skills in prospective employees.
Roles with social interaction or complex decision-making are less prone to AI replacement, and healthcare, skilled trades, education, and social services show resilience.
As retail and communication sectors undergo a tech transformation, they do create new roles.

AI Job Loss Statistics:  How GenAI May Affect Sectors




An LLM Cannot Drive a Truck or Build a House




Luckily, Some Skills are Uniquely Human




The Bottom Line









AI: State of the World
According to a survey of 750 businesses by Resume Builder, around 53% of companies were using AI in 2023, and 24% plan to start in 2024.
While 44% of companies that use or plan to use AI in 2024 said that employees may be laid off, 91% said they would hire new employees, and 96% said it would be “very beneficial” (65%) or “somewhat beneficial” (31%) for potential candidates to have AI experience.
They added that employees with AI skills are more likely to have job security than those without.
Julia Toothacre, ResumeBuilder’s resume and career strategist, said:
“I would advise employees to consider all parts of their position and what could possibly be taken over by AI.
“Figure out what part of your position can’t be taken over by AI or where AI might need human intervention and become the go-to person for those tasks.
“Employees need to find ways to grow their skills and stay relevant in their field.”
Which jobs will likely see the most and the least impact from AI?
AI Job Loss Predictions: Risky and Safer Sectors
The evolving landscape of the workforce, particularly in the context of AI’s rise, is a topic of intense debate.
Clearly, roles that involve significant social or emotional interactions — such as social workers, healthcare professionals, and teachers — will be less susceptible to being replaced by AI-facilitated automation.
High-level management jobs that require complex decision-making may be less likely to be displaced, as human reasoning will remain important to the process. And customer-facing roles that require relationship-building will also remain in demand.
Anna Tavis, a clinical professor in human capital management at New York University, commented on this shift:
“There is a heightened anticipation surrounding the potential labor cost efficiencies from adopting AI.
 
“While it is believed that AI might replace some jobs or parts of jobs currently performed by human workers, it is important to note that these expectations might be ahead of their time. Nevertheless, given AI advancements, companies are preparing for a major organizational shift.”
The research conducted by Hiring Lab for employment agency Indeed suggests a shift in the impact of technological advancements. While past innovations in computing and robotics mainly displaced manual labor, the rise of generative AI is expected to primarily affect ‘knowledge workers.’ As the technology continues to learn specific skills associated with certain roles, genAI can augment or transform some roles but not others.
Based on their latest AI job loss predictions, 19.8% of jobs face the highest potential exposure, while 34.6% face the lowest potential exposure.
According to monthly reports from employee outplacement services and coaching firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, AI has been cited as the reason for hundreds of US job cuts so far this year, either because employers were pivoting to developing AI or because it replaced tasks and roles.
“The impact of rapidly advancing artificial intelligence adoption is beginning to be felt from a jobs perspective, particularly in Media and Tech, but truly across sectors. That said, companies are not outright blaming AI for many layoff decisions,” said Challenger.
AI Job Loss Statistics:  How GenAI May Affect Sectors
By analyzing the number of skills listed in various job postings, Hiring Lab identified thematic skillsets that help define the occupations that are most and least exposed to potential change driven by AI.
So, what jobs will AI replace?

Indeed’s research shows that AI algorithm-driven tools are the most proficient in software development, IT operations, helpdesk support, and mathematics. In contrast, they perform poorly in various manual and interpersonal tasks.
Source: Indeed
AI proficiency scores poorly in these skills — so job security may be safe for a while yet:

Driving
Beauty and wellness
Personal care and home health
Nursing
Childcare
Food preparation and service
Veterinary
Construction

Similarly, McKinsey predicts that by 2030 the adoption of automation enabled by the acceleration of generative AI will see growth in labor demand for health professionals, aides, and technicians, as well as Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) professionals.
However, as the global labor market continues to adjust to the rise of remote working, the more likely a job can be done remotely, the higher the chance for a job loss due to AI.
Office support, customer service and sales, and food services roles could decline.
An LLM Cannot Drive a Truck or Build a House
Among the 25 most common jobs posted on Indeed, 20 face a lower potential exposure than the average job posting. Truck driving roles face the least potential exposure to generative AI, only rated as “good” or “excellent” at 15% of truck driver skills.
The study concluded:
“Jobs with the least potential exposure to genAI (including driving, cleaning & sanitation, and beauty & wellness) are also those with the lowest ability to be done remotely.
 
“The higher the odds are that a job can be done remotely, the greater its potential exposure is to genAI-driven change.”
“Historically, these are not the kinds of jobs that have been subject to disruption through automation, more evidence that this round of technological evolution will affect different workers in different ways than in the past.
The study showed that while GenAI is relatively good at technical skills (and jobs), it is pretty bad at skills (and jobs) that require intuition, reasoning, and/or in-person, manual work.
This distinction may be somewhat obvious — given how generative AI works. For drivers, a large language model (LLM) of the type that powers many generative AI tools can plan a route on a map but not turn a steering wheel – although it is worth noting that other forms of AI will enable self-driving vehicles.
For software developers, however, job loss due to AI is much higher. LLMs are likely to be able to replace much of the human work that goes into writing an efficient line of code or preparing and summarizing technical documentation.
Source: Indeed
In the meantime, Cliff Jurkiewicz, vice president of global strategy at Phenom, an HR technology company, added to the perspective:
“The retail and communications industries are going through massive technology upgrades. AI is driving expansion in tech. Like disruptive technologies before it, it is creating new roles and new skill requirements for existing roles.
 
“Tech professionals have an advantage. Their skill sets are highly marketable to the tremendous opportunities for tech roles in other industries. They also have the background and ability to simplify upskilling for the new AI-based roles. And these new AI roles are just the beginning, with others not far off on the horizon.”
Luckily, Some Skills are Uniquely Human
Broadly, the careers least likely to be affected by AI are those that require human empathy or manual dexterity and precision:


Healthcare: While AI has vast potential in the healthcare sector – from drug discovery, assisting with diagnosis, remote surgery, and treatment to administrative tasks – it is unlikely to replace healthcare professionals. Doctors, nurses, therapists, and counselors rely heavily on interpersonal relationships and emotional intelligence, making many roles resilient to automation.
Skilled trades: Skilled trades, such as electricians, plumbers, and mechanics, require a combination of manual dexterity, problem-solving, and adaptability. These professions often involve working in unpredictable environments, which AI struggles to navigate. Additionally, carpenters, blacksmiths, and glassblowers are highly skilled in their crafts, often producing unique, customized items unlikely to lead to AI job loss.
Education: AI can assist in developing educational content and providing personalized learning and grading, but teachers, coaches, and other educators provide irreplaceable mentorship, guidance, and emotional support.
Social and community services: Professions in social work, community outreach, and advocacy rely heavily on human relationships, empathy, and understanding. These jobs involve complex decision-making and problem-solving based on the unique needs of individuals and communities. AI tools can provide data and support, making these roles more efficient, it cannot replace the personal connections and judgment calls made by human professionals.
Creative professions: The role of AI in generating creative content is highly controversial – fueling writers’ and actors’ strikes in Hollywood in part to limit the extent to which studios can replace them with AI-generated scripts and audio and video footage. But while AI can assist in generating content, it lacks the depth that human experience and emotional connection bring to creative output.

The job roles that fall in the middle of Hiring Labs’ analysis are the most interesting cases to study when determining the potential impact of generative AI on the future of work.
While retail jobs contain skills AI can perform well, such as developing strategies, algorithms cannot complete the person-to-person skills necessary for retail success.
Source: Indeed
The Bottom Line
AI has the potential to automate tasks across a range of industries, but some careers are more resilient to this disruption. The findings around the fields most and least exposed to potential generative AI-driven change indicate that this technological revolution will pose different challenges than earlier industrial and commercial automation stages.
Deep, expert and uniquely human knowledge will likely stay in high demand. Instead of viewing AI as a threat to employment, individuals should focus on adapting and developing these uniquely human skills that are difficult for AI to replicate.
Alex Kotran, the CEO of aiEDU, expressed his understanding regarding the common apprehensions about AI, particularly in the context of job security: “Everything is changing fast, and when your livelihood could be impacted, that causes real worry.”
However, Kotran emphasized the potential of AI to enhance job satisfaction when combined with appropriate training and preparation: “With the right training and preparation, AI can actually empower people to do more fulfilling work – it’s a tool that will help professionalize various professions.”
“The key is ensuring employees have basic proficiency to effectively collaborate with AI systems rather than be impacted by them. We want to give people the confidence, skills, and agency to see AI as a force multiplier, not a robot coming for their job.”

If you’ve been on LinkedIn for any period of time over the last 18 months, you’ll have read thought leadership on how integrating artificial intelligence into the workforce will help unlock major opportunities for companies.
Despite employer fervor over artificial intelligence — the number times “AI” has been mentioned in fourth-quarter earnings calls has increased dramatically — the average U.S. adult is mostly mixed about the broader impact they think the technology will have on jobs. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t integrating it into their roles. Many workers are using AI for work, and that exposure looks to be swaying perceptions of the technology.
Millennials and those with post-grad degrees are more likely to think AI has a positive impact in the workplace
Just over 2 in 5 employed U.S. adults (44%) said they use AI for work, with even higher shares of millennials and those with post-grad degrees saying the same (both 56%). Research has shown that exposure to AI in the workplace is directly proportional to the level of education of the worker, and our own past research shows that millennials are more likely to show high interest in all kinds of AI applications, not just those used in the workplace.
Mirroring those trends, millennials and those with post-grad degrees are also most likely to say that industries investing in the use of AI in the workplace will have a positive impact than a negative one.
Employed Adults Are More Likely to Find AI Positive Than NegativeRespondents on the impact AI will have in the workplaceMorning Consult LogoSurvey conducted Jan. 17- 20, 2024, among 6,625 U.S. adults, including 3,389 employed adults, with an unweighted margin of error of +/-1 and +/-2 percentage points, respectively.Gen Z, usually the cohort to stand in contrast with other generations, is feeling a bit more mixed, likely as lower shares of them are currently in the workforce and thus currently less exposed to AI on the job. They are also the generation a little bit more likely than others to say that AI will have no impact on work (23%).
Workers using AI are incorporating it into many aspects of their jobs
When workers who use AI were asked how they used it in their work, the majority of respondents said they often or sometimes used all the tested options, showing that AI use is not confined to certain highly specific tasks.
More Millennials Use AI Across A Range of TasksAmong AI users, respondents who often or sometimes use it to complete the following tasksMorning Consult LogoSurvey conducted Jan. 17- 20, 2024, among 6,625 U.S. adults, including 1481 workers who use AI, with unweighted margins of error of +/-1 and +/-3 percentage points, respectively.The most commonly cited uses include crafting emails, ideation and data analytics. Atop Gen Z’s AI use cases, answering customer/client questions is more highly ranked, though the cohort — newer to the workforce — in general slightly under indexes on using AI applications at work. (Gen Zers are equally as likely to say they use AI for fun.) Millennials, on the other hand, are more likely to say they use all the tested applications than the average worker. This is likely because millennials are more likely to simply report using AI, for both business and pleasure.
The variety of tasks workers are using AI for today shows the technology is broadly applicable to the workforce, not just highly technical jobs. Companies should note that positive sentiment and usage of AI doesn’t mean that Americans are entirely bullish on the technology; consumers are least interested in applications that could be used to replace humans entirely. That said, employers investing in more AI technology should think big when rolling out the technology — it’s likely they’ll find many use cases, and a wide range of workers, open to incorporating it into their existing workflows.

But that doesn’t mean they aren’t integrating it into their roles. Many workers are using AI for work, and that exposure looks to be swaying perceptions of the technology.Millennials and those with post-grad degrees are more likely to think AI has a positive impact in the workplaceJust over 2 in 5 employed U.S. adults (44%) said they use AI for work, with even higher shares of millennials and those with post-grad degrees saying the same (both 56%). Research has shown that exposure to AI in the workplace is directly proportional to the level of education of the worker, and our own past research shows that millennials are more likely to show high interest in all kinds of AI applications, not just those used in the workplace.Mirroring those trends, millennials and those with post-grad degrees are also most likely to say that industries investing in the use of AI in the workplace will have a positive impact than a negative one.Gen Z, usually the cohort to stand in contrast with other generations, is feeling a bit more mixed, likely as lower shares of them are currently in the workforce and thus currently less exposed to AI on the job. They are also the generation a little bit more likely than others to say that AI will have no impact on work (23%).Workers using AI are incorporating it into many aspects of their jobsWhen workers who use AI were asked how they used it in their work, the majority of respondents said they often or sometimes used all the tested options, showing that AI use is not confined to certain highly specific tasks.The most commonly cited uses include crafting emails, ideation and data analytics. Atop Gen Z’s AI use cases, answering customer/client questions is more highly ranked, though the cohort — newer to the workforce — in general slightly under indexes on using AI applications at work. (Gen Zers are equally as likely to say they use AI for fun.) Millennials, on the other hand, are more likely to say they use all the tested applications than the average worker. This is likely because millennials are more likely to simply report using AI, for both business and pleasure.The variety of tasks workers are using AI for today shows the technology is broadly applicable to the workforce, not just highly technical jobs. Companies should note that positive sentiment and usage of AI doesn’t mean that Americans are entirely bullish on the technology; consumers are least interested in applications that could be used to replace humans entirely.

Artificial Intelligence Interview Questions for Experienced
1. What is Q-Learning?
Q-learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to find the optimal policy for an agent to follow in an environment. The goal of Q-learning is to learn a function, called the Q-function, that maps states of the environment to the expected cumulative reward of taking a specific action in that state and then following the optimal policy afterwards.
The Q-function is represented as a table, with each entry representing the expected cumulative reward of taking a specific action in a specific state. The Q-learning algorithm updates the Q-function by using the Bellman equation, which states that the value of the Q-function for a given state and action is equal to the immediate reward for taking that action in that state, plus the maximum expected cumulative reward of the next state.
2. Which Assessment is Used to Test the Intelligence of a Machine? Explain It.
This is one of the most frequently asked AI questions. There are several ways to assess the intelligence of a machine, but one of the most widely used methods is the Turing test. Essentially, the Turing test measures a machine's ability to exhibit human-like intelligence. 
The test works by having a human evaluator engage in a natural language conversation with both a human and a machine, without knowing which is which. If the evaluator is unable to consistently distinguish the machine's responses from those of the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing test and is considered to have human-like intelligence.
3. What is Reinforcement Learning, and How Does It Work?
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions in an environment by interacting with it and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. To maximize its cumulative reward over time, the agent must learn a policy that maps environmental states to actions.
4. Explain Markov's Decision Process.
A mathematical framework called the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is used to describe decision-making in circumstances where the result is partially determined by chance and partially controlled by the decision-maker. MDPs are widely used in the field of reinforcement learning as they provide a way to model an agent's decision-making problem.
An MDP is defined by a set of states, a set of actions, a transition function that defines the probability of going from one state to another, a reward function that defines the immediate reward for being in a particular state and taking a particular action, and a discount factor that determines the importance of future rewards.
5. Explain the Hidden Markov Model.
A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that is often used in machine learning and pattern recognition to model a sequence of observations that are generated by a system with unobserved (hidden) states. HMMs are particularly useful for modeling time series data, such as speech, text, and biological sequences.
The basic idea behind an HMM is that there is a sequence of hidden states that are not directly observable, but generate a sequence of observations. Each hidden state has a probability distribution over the possible observations, and the sequence of hidden states changes over time according to certain probability transition rules.
6. What is the Difference Between Parametric and Non-parametric Models?
In statistics and machine learning, a parametric model is a model that has a fixed number of parameters. These parameters have specific meanings and can be estimated from the data using a method such as maximum likelihood estimation. Once the parameters are estimated, the model can be used to make predictions or estimate the probability of certain events.
Examples of parametric models include linear regression, logistic regression, and Gaussian mixture models. These models have a fixed number of parameters, and the estimation process involves finding the best set of parameter values that fit the data.
On the other hand, non-parametric models do not have a fixed number of parameters. They are often more flexible than parametric models and can adapt to a wide range of underlying data distributions.
Examples of non-parametric models include decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. These models do not have a fixed number of parameters, and the estimation process usually involves a direct estimation of the underlying probability density function or the conditional probability density function of the data.
7. What is Overfitting?
This is one of the next important AI questions. Overfitting in AI occurs when a machine learning model becomes too complex and starts to fit the training data too closely, to the point where it memorizes the training data rather than learning the underlying patterns and relationships. This means that the model performs very well on the training data, but poorly on new, unseen data.
Overfitting can occur in any machine learning algorithm, and it can happen when the model is too complex relative to the amount and quality of training data available. In some cases, the model may even start to fit the noise in the data, rather than the underlying patterns. This can result in poor performance and accuracy when the model is used for prediction or classification tasks on new data.
To prevent overfitting, it is important to use techniques like regularization, cross-validation, and early stopping during the training process. These techniques can help to prevent the model from becoming too complex and help to ensure that it generalizes well to new, unseen data.
8. What are the Techniques Used to Avoid Overfitting?
Cross-validation: This is a technique where the data is split into multiple subsets, and the model is trained and tested on different subsets. This helps to prevent the model from memorizing the training data and generalizing poorly to new data.
Regularization: This is a technique where a penalty term is added to the model's objective function, which discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any single feature. This helps to prevent the model from fitting to noise in the training data.
Early stopping: This is a technique where the training process is stopped before the model's performance on the training data starts to decrease, this is useful when the model is trained with multiple iterations.
Ensemble methods: This is a technique where multiple models are trained, and their predictions are combined to create a final prediction. This helps to reduce the variance and increase the robustness of the model.
Pruning: This is a technique where the complexity of the model is reduced by removing unimportant features or nodes.
Dropout: This is a technique where a random subset of the neurons is dropped out of the network during training, this prevents the network from relying too much on any one neuron.
Bayesian approaches: This is a technique where prior information is incorporated into the model's parameters.
9. What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence and computer science that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans in natural language. NLP involves using techniques from computer science, linguistics, and mathematics to process and analyze human language.
10. What is the Difference Between Natural Language Processing and Text Mining?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining are related fields that focus on the analysis and understanding of human language, but they have some key differences.
NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans in natural language. It involves using techniques from computer science, linguistics, and mathematics to process and analyze human language. NLP tasks include speech recognition, natural language understanding, natural language generation, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.
Text Mining, on the other hand, is a broader field that involves the use of NLP techniques to extract valuable information from unstructured text data. Text Mining often used in business, social science, and information science. It includes tasks such as information retrieval, text classification, text clustering, text summarization, and entity recognition.
In summary, NLP is a field of AI that deals with the interactions of computers and human languages, while Text Mining is a broader field that deals with the extraction of insights and knowledge from unstructured text data using NLP techniques.
11. What is Fuzzy Logic?
You canno skip fuzzy logic once it comes to AI questions. Fuzzy logic is a type of logic that allows reasoning with imprecise or uncertain information. It is an extension of classical logic and allows for partial truth, rather than the traditional binary true or false. This means that propositions in fuzzy logic can have a truth value between 0 and 1, representing the degree of truth.
12. What is the Difference Between Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors?
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are related mathematical concepts that are used in linear algebra and have applications in many fields, such as physics, engineering, and computer science.
An eigenvalue is a scalar value that represents the amount of stretching or shrinking that occurs when a linear transformation is applied to a vector. In other words, it is a scalar that is multiplied to a non-zero vector by a linear operator (often represented by a square matrix) to give the same vector but scaled.
An eigenvector, on the other hand, is a non-zero vector that, when multiplied by a linear operator, results in a scaled version of itself. In other words, it is a non-zero vector that when multiplied by a square matrix, gives the same vector but scaled by a scalar, that scalar is the eigenvalue.
13. What are Some Differences Between Classification and Regression?
Classification and regression are two types of supervised machine learning tasks that are used to make predictions based on input data.
Classification is a type of supervised learning in which the goal is to predict a categorical label or class for a given input. The output is discrete and finite, such as ""spam"" or ""not spam"" in an email classification problem. The input data is labeled with a class, and the model learns to predict the class based on the input features.
Regression, on the other hand, is a type of supervised learning in which the goal is to predict a continuous value for a given input. The output is a real value, such as the price of a house or the temperature. The input data is labeled with a continuous value, and the model learns to predict the value based on the input features.
14. What is an Artificial Neural Network? What are Some Commonly Used Artificial Neural Networks?
Artificial neural networks are developed to simulate the human brain digitally. These networks may be used to create the next generation of computers. They are now employed for complicated studies in a variety of disciplines, from engineering to medical.
15. What is a Rational Agent, and What is Rationality?
A rational agent is a system that makes decisions based on maximizing a specific objective. The concept of rationality refers to the idea that the agent's decisions and actions are consistent with its objectives and beliefs. In other words, a rational agent is one that makes the best decisions possible based on the information it has available. This is often formalized through the use of decision theory and game theory.

Following the launch of the AI center of excellence in Riyadh, Microsoft and PwC Middle East will train cohorts of local engineers in batches every two months.Competition for places in the bi-monthly cohorts is stiff, with the bulk of participants expected to be drawn from leading universities in the country.Rather than focusing only on AI training, the AI center will explore other emerging technologies, including cloud capabilities, to support Saudi’s global push toward digitization.“Skilling the workforce to take advantage of cloud and AI technologies is crucial to unlocking the full potential of these transformative technologies, and we are proud to play a role in this important endeavour,” noted Microsoft Arabia President Turki Badhris.The center will involve collaborative learning, featuring inputs from the public and private sectors, to produce well-rounded professionals to fill the ranks of AI companies.The new AI experts from the excellence center will provide manpower for Saudi Arabia’s growing AI ecosystem. Already, a handful of local firms have begun operations in the Gulf nation, with global players seeking to set up shop in the Middle East.“By investing in local talent, PwC is set to pioneer a new era of technological excellence that will not only serve the Kingdom but also the wider region,” said PwC Middle East CTO Ali Hosseini. “In partnership with Microsoft, we are proud to launch a platform that nurtures and develops next-generation AI talent, carefully selected from the Kingdom’s premier universities.”Building on a solid foundationMicrosoft and PwC’s foray into Saudi Arabia’s AI ecosystem is expected to build on existing foundations put in place by the country. The Gulf nation is currently eyeing a $40 billion AI investment fund via its Public Investment Fund to power in-house chip manufacturing and support the growing local AI firms.A high-profile purchase of Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NV) latest range of chips is a strong indicator of Saudi Arabia’s intent to play the long AI game in the Middle East. With a massive AI education initiative underway, Saudi firms are bracing themselves with advanced AI integration strategies, but fears of government repression continue to trail the plans.In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

Generative artificial intelligence — the technology upending many industries with its ability to produce and crunch new data — has landed on Wall Street. And investment banks, long inured to cultural change, are rapidly turning into Exhibit A on how the new technology could not only supplement but supplant entire ranks of workers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe jobs most immediately at risk are those performed by analysts at the bottom rung of the investment banking business, who put in endless hours to learn the building blocks of corporate finance, including the intricacies of mergers, public offerings and bond deals. Now, A.I. can do much of that work speedily and with considerably less whining.“The structure of these jobs has remained largely unchanged at least for a decade,” said Julia Dhar, head of BCG’s Behavioral Science Lab and a consultant to major banks experimenting with A.I.

The software, being deployed inside banks under code names such as “Socrates,” is likely not only to change the arc of a Wall Street career, but also to essentially nullify the need to hire thousands of new college graduates.Top executives at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other banks are debating how deep they can cut their incoming analyst classes, according to several people involved in the ongoing discussions. Some inside those banks and others have suggested they could cut back on their hiring of junior investment banking analysts by as much as two-thirds, and slash the pay of those they do hire, on the grounds that the jobs won’t be as taxing as before.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The easy idea,” said Christoph Rabenseifner, Deutsche Bank’s chief strategy officer for technology, data and innovation, “is you just replace juniors with an A.I. tool,” although he added that human involvement will remain necessary.Representatives for Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and others said it was too early to comment on specific job changes. But the consulting giant Accenture estimated that A.I. could replace or supplement nearly three-quarters of bank employees’ working hours across the industry.Goldman is “experimenting with the technology,” said Nick Carcaterra, a bank spokesman. “In the near term, we anticipate no changes to our incoming analyst classes.”This week, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, wrote in his annual shareholder letter that A.I. “may reduce certain job categories or roles,” and labeled the technology top among the most important issues facing the nation’s largest bank. Mr. Dimon compared the consequences to those of “the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the internet, among others.”ImageJamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, compared the consequences of A.I. to those of “the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the internet, among others.”Credit...Carly Zavala for The New York TimesInvestment banking is a hierarchical industry, and banks typically hire young talent through two-year analyst contracts. Tens of thousands of 20-somethings (both from undergraduate and M.B.A. programs) apply for some 200 spots in each major bank’s program. Pay starts at more than $100,000, not including year-end bonuses.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIf they persevere, they move up the ranks to associate, then director and managing director; a handful end up running divisions. Although grueling, the life of a senior banker can be glamorous, involving traveling around the globe to pitch clients and working on big-money corporate merger deals. Many who get through the two-year analyst program have gone on to become business titans — the billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Stephen Schwarzman began their careers in investment banking — but a majority will leave before or after their two years are up, bank representatives said.There are jokes among junior bankers that the most common tasks of the job involve dragging icons from one side of a document to another, only to be asked to replace the icon over and again.

Behind the JournalismOur business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Here’s more on our standards and practices.“One hundred percent drudgery and boring,” said Gabriel Stengel, a former banking analyst who left the industry two years ago. Val Srinivas, a senior researcher for banking at Deloitte, said a lot of the work involved “gathering material, poring through it and putting it through a different format.”Gregory Larkin, another former banking analyst, said the new technology would start “a civil war” inside Wall Street’s biggest firms by tilting the balance of power to technologists who program A.I. tools, as opposed to the bankers who use them — to say nothing of technology giants like Microsoft and Google, which license much of the A.I. technology to banks for hefty fees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“A.I. will enable us to do tasks that take 10 hours in 10 seconds,” said Jay Horine, co-head of investment banking at JPMorgan, describing analyst jobs. “My hope and belief is it will allow the job to be more interesting.”A.I.’s impact on finance is simply one facet of how the technology will reshape the workplace for all. Artificial intelligence systems, which include large language models and question-and-answer bots like ChatGPT, can quickly synthesize information and automate tasks. Virtually all industries are beginning to grapple with it to some degree.Deutsche Bank is uploading reams of financial data into proprietary A.I. tools that can instantaneously answer questions about publicly traded companies and create summary documents on complementary financial moves that might benefit a client — and earn the bank a profit.Mr. Horine said he could use A.I. to identify clients that might be ripe for a bond offering, the sort of bread-and-butter transaction for which investment bankers charge clients millions of dollars.Goldman Sachs has assigned 1,000 developers to test A.I., including software that can turn what it terms “corpus” information — or enormous amounts of text and data collected from thousands of sources — into page presentations that mimic the bank’s typeface, logo, styles and charts. One firm executive privately called it a “Kitty Hawk moment,” or one that would change the course of the firm’s future.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThat isn’t limited to investment banking; BNY Mellon’s chief executive said on a recent earnings call that his research analysts could now wake up two hours later than usual, because A.I. can read overnight economic data and create a written draft of analysis to work from.Morgan Stanley’s head of technology, Michael Pizzi, told employees in a January private meeting, a video of which was viewed by The New York Times, that he would “get A.I. into every area of what we do,” including wealth management, where the bank employs thousands of people to determine the proper mix of investments for well-off savers.Many of those tools are still in the testing phase, and will need to be run past regulators before they can be deployed at scale on live work. Bank of America’s chief executive said last year that the technology was already enabling the firm to hire less.Among Goldman Sachs’s sprawling A.I. efforts is a tool under development that can transfigure a lengthy PowerPoint document into a formal “S-1,” the legalese-packed document for initial public offerings required for all listed companies.The software takes less than a second to complete the job.Read by Rob CopelandAudio produced by Patricia Sulbarán.Rob Copeland is a finance reporter, writing about Wall Street and the banking industry.

			Artificial Intelligence May Not Disrupt The Legal Profession For A While

Ever since ChatGPT roared onto the scene over a year ago, everyone has been talking about how the world will change due to advances in artificial intelligence. Many commentators have singled out the legal industry as a sector that will be particularly impacted by artificial intelligence, since much of the rote work performed by associates can presumably be handled by artificial intelligence in the coming years. Initially, I also believed that artificial intelligence would have a huge impact on the legal profession in the short term, but it now seems that the legal profession will not be materially affected for at least several years, if not longer.
In recent months, a number of vendors have released artificial intelligence tools directed at legal professionals. I have had the chance to try a few of these artificial intelligence applications myself. In some very specific contexts, the applications can be helpful. These tools can suggest revisions that might be made to documents and provide feedback that is useful when reviewing a long document.

However, in many contexts, artificial intelligence is not that helpful with document review and other automated legal tasks. I frequently face a situation in which artificial intelligence suggests deal terms that clearly would be rejected by the other side, and the tool has no sense of what would be acceptable and what would be rejected by an adversary. At other points, the artificial intelligence suggests silly edits that do not make sense when considering the larger picture involved in a given transaction.
Sometimes, I actually waste time reviewing the feedback provided by artificial intelligence tools and rejecting the edits! At best, most artificial intelligence applications are tools and not replacements for most of the work lawyers do. The work of artificial intelligence definitely needs to be reviewed by a lawyer since the artificial intelligence tends to make mistakes and because the artificial intelligence and the lawyer together can possibly create a better work product than can be produced independently by either.
Another reason why I do not believe that artificial intelligence will be disruptive to the legal profession in the short term is due to the versatile nature of the legal sector. In my own career, I have seen swaths of lawyers become obsolete due to technology, and I have seen how the legal profession shifted to absorb many of the lawyers who no longer had jobs.




For instance, earlier in my career, it was common to have numerous attorneys perform document review projects for law firms. Sometimes, in-house staff attorneys performed the work, and other times, law firms hired outsourced attorneys to perform document review tasks. In many instances, lawyers would review numerous documents to determine if they were responsive to document demands made in litigation. If the documents were responsive, lawyers might see if a privilege or protection could prevent disclosure of materials and help write a privilege log for materials that were withheld.
Around a decade ago (or a little longer), much of that work dried up because of predictive coding and other technologies that ensured law firms did not need to hire the same amount of document review attorneys. These days, it is rare to see a job posting for document review attorneys, even though this had been extremely common not that long ago. Indeed, this website had a column written by a document-review attorney dedicated to the happenings of similar professionals. However, the legal profession has seemingly adapted to this shift, and I assume that many of the people who formerly worked as document-review attorneys now work in other parts of the legal profession.
Of course, every lawyer should keep an eye on recent developments in artificial intelligence to ensure that they use all tools that can help them effectively serve clients. However, the legal profession will likely not suffer a widescale disruption due to artificial intelligence for a while, even though many commentators seem to have a contrary view.

The cloud software firm Salesforce published a report Wednesday showing that the overwhelming issue technology professionals experience when trying to implement artificial intelligence in the public sector comes down to a shortage of skills.
In surveys of public- and private-sector professionals, 46% of respondents said lack of skills hampered their ability to implement AI in their work. That figure jumped to 60% among public-sector respondents.
“Training and skills development are critical first steps for the public sector to leverage the benefits of AI,” Casey Coleman, senior vice president of global government solutions at Salesforce, said in a press release. “By investing in new skills like prompt development, public sector leaders can empower their workforce to use AI to increase productivity, build deeper relationships with constituents and improve the quality of public services.”
Other AI roadblocks public-sector IT workers face include data quality and security issues, an increasing cost of programming and general ethical concerns. Thirty-four percent of public-sector respondents said the focus on AI is slowing down other IT projects.

Sixty-eight percent of respondents who worked in public or private media and entertainment considered themselves experts in effectively using AI – the highest of any professional category in the survey. More than half of respondents in business services, manufacturing and health care considered themselves AI experts. Only 28% of those working for the government considered themselves experts at using AI, according to the survey results.
Although the skills gap is impacting AI adoption in the public sector, IT professionals reported optimisism about how the technology may be used to improve their work. Survey respondents said that the top three benefits to implementing AI in the public sector are the ability to automate routine tasks, reduce risk and improve customer experiences.
To help public sector workers develop their AI skills, more than 500 officials from 200 state and local governments recently joined to form the GovAI Coalition, a group that shares resources on how to responsibly use AI. Since forming last fall, the group has published documents that governments can use to draft policies and is now helping agencies adopt those policies.

Personally, I...",N/A,N/A,N/A,"lifeArtificial Intelligence and the Future of Workby Harvey MackayHarvey Mackay | April 15th, 2024Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. Personally, I view AI as a tool that, when used wisely, can enhance our capabilities and improve our efficiency.AdvertisementWe are already using AI in many aspects of our daily lives, often without even realizing it. Whether it is asking Siri for directions, using Google to search for information or relying on smart home devices like Alexa to play music or set reminders, AI has become an integral part of our routine.Forbes Magazine says, “By 2025, an estimated 95% of customer interactions will be supported by AI technology.”It is important to remember that AI is a tool created by humans to serve humans. The goal is not to replace the human touch but to augment it. AI can handle repetitive tasks, analyze large data sets and even assist in complex problem-solving. Artificial intelligence can automate routine tasks, thereby reducing errors. This frees up human workers to focus on more complex and creative endeavors. But AI cannot replicate the creativity, empathy and intuition that humans bring to the table.Ginni Rometty, former CEO of IBM said, “Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence.”With its ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data, AI can uncover insights and patterns that might be missed by humans, aiding in more informed decision-making. AI can drive product development and innovation, helping businesses to stay competitive in a rapidly changing market.Artificial intelligence can also provide personalized experiences for customers, from chatbots that offer instant customer service to recommendation systems that tailor content to individual preferences.AI opens the door to new technological advancements and business models, driving innovation across various industries. The initial investment of AI technology can be significant, and not all businesses may have the resources to implement and maintain these systems effectively. However, by automating tasks, AI can help reduce labor costs and operational expenses, reducing the need for manual intervention in certain processes.Artificial intelligence, however, can be a double-edged sword. While it offers all the benefits I listed above, it also presents certain challenges that we must navigate carefully.Susan Sly, a two-time AI startup founder who was voted as one of the top 15 women in the world in real-time AI in 2024, spoke to my Roundtable group, explaining: “AI is like a toddler right now. It will grow up to be a teenager, and you know what teenagers like to do -- rebel. They do what you tell them not to do.”The impact of AI on the job market will be severe. A McKinsey report suggests that 400-800 million jobs worldwide could be displaced by 2030 due to automation and AI. Also, an overreliance on AI could lead to a loss of certain skills and a diminished ability to perform tasks without technological assistance.During her presentation, Susan listed some of the jobs that will likely be going away, such as therapist, accountant, analyst, executive assistant, translator, medical assistant, fashion designer, paralegal, radiologist, teacher, journalist, editor, architect and influencer.On the flip side, Susan said the people who work with their hands will have the most money and power in the future -- construction workers, electricians, plumbers, surgeons and pilots. Good industries to be in include food preparation, transportation, fishing and farming.This is a stark reminder that we must adapt and learn to work alongside these technologies. Those who embrace AI and improve their skills to complement machine capabilities will likely find themselves at an advantage.Artificial intelligence systems can raise ethical questions, especially regarding privacy, surveillance and the potential for bias in decision-making processes. AI systems can be vulnerable to hacking and other security breaches, which could have serious implications if they control critical infrastructure or sensitive data. I suspect that’s what frightens people the most.As we look to the future, the key is to approach AI with a mindset of collaboration rather than fear. By understanding its capabilities and limitations, we can harness its power to create a more efficient and innovative world while also safeguarding the qualities that make us uniquely human. The point is to team up with AI to multiply your own intelligence.Artificial intelligence can be your best business ally or your worst nightmare. It all depends on how you integrate it into your strategy.Mackay’s Moral: Artificial intelligence is where data meets destiny.View Comments",https://schema.org,Article,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'UExpress', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://uexpress.com/images/logos/uexpress_logo_400x100.svg'}}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Harvey Mackay'}","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.uexpress.com/life/harvey-mackay/2024/04/15'}",2024-04-15,2024-04-15,Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experts expect that Apple might offer some cloud-based AI features powered by Google&#039;s Gemini or another provider.&nbsp; It is believed that Apple has reportedly held discussions with companies such as Google, OpenAI and China&#039;s Baidu about potential generative AI partnerships. However,&nbsp; iOS 18 is not expected to include Apple&#039;s own ChatGPT-like chatbot. It is believed that Gemini&nbsp; and other chatbots can be directly integrated into iOS 18. The big idea! During the question and answer section of ‘Power On’ newsletter, “As the world awaits Apple&#039;s big AI unveiling on June 10, it looks like the initial wave of features will work entirely on devices,” Mark Gurman said. “That means there&#039;s no cloud processing component to the company&#039;s large language model, the software that powers the new capabilities,” Gurman added further. What’s next? Critics argue that iOS 18 might have new generative AI features for the iPhone&#039;s Spotlight search tool, Siri, Safari, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages and&nbsp; Keynote, among others. Earlier Gurman is expected to have mentioned that generative AI has the potential to improve Siri&#039;s ability to answer more complex questions.
