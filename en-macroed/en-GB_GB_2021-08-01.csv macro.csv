Data is certainly the fuel for AI. Yet there is a source of valuable data that usually does not garner much attention. It is from mainframe systems. They hold enormous amounts of data—which go back decades—for mission critical operations.


But then again, there are difficulties working with mainframes and AI. “The biggest challenge is the lack of compatibility of emerging technologies,” said Chida Sadayappan, who is the Cloud AI/ML Offering Leader at Deloitte Consulting LLP.

But the benefits of AI are too important to ignore. So what can be done? Well, one strategy is for leveraging cloud platforms outside of the mainframe environment. 

“New approaches to cloud migration replace the traditional ETL (extract, transform, load) approach with a more modern ELT (extract, load, transform) approach that moves mainframe formatted data directly to any object storage target before using the target platform to transform it for use in AI applications,” said Gil Peleg, who is the CEO of Model9. “This pioneering method adds mainframe data to data lakes quickly, easily, and securely so leaders can maximize the ROI of their cloud BI and analytics applications.”

PROMOTED
But like any IT effort, there needs to be a clear-cut plan and the goals must be achievable. The reality is that AI efforts can take considerable time to generate ROI.
“Companies should be aware that these types of initiatives don’t always cut costs,” said Sudhir Kesavan, who is the Global Head of Cloud Transformation at  Wipro FullStride Cloud Services. “They may have the opposite effect, so having them be business-led can help overcome the challenge of business benefits seeming less tangible to start.”
IBM Mainframes and AI
The capabilities of mainframes have been evolving quickly. For example, IBM has been retooling its Z system for AI and this has involved the integration with many common open source platforms like Spark, PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow.

“We are enabling our clients to embed AI into their mission critical enterprise workloads and core business processes with minimal application changes and giving them the ability to score every transaction while meeting even the most stringent SLAs (Service Level Agreements),” said Elpida Tzortzatos, who is an IBM Fellow and the Chief Technology Officer of z/OS.

Leveraging AI For Mainframe Environments
The power of AI for mainframes does not have to be about creating projects. For example, there are emerging AIOps tools that help automate the systems. Some of the benefits include improved performance and availability, increased support speed for application releases and the DevOps process, and the proactive identification of issues. Such benefits can be essential since it is increasingly more difficult to attract qualified IT professionals.
According to a recent survey from Forrester and BMC, about 81% of the respondents indicated that they rely partially on manual processes when dealing with slowdowns and 75% said they use manual labor for diagnosing multisystem incidents. In other words, there is much room for improvement—and AI can be a major driver for this.
“Mainframe decision makers are becoming more aware than ever that the traditional way of handling mainframe operations will soon fall by the wayside,” said John McKenny, who is the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intelligent Z Optimization and Transformation at BMC. “The demand for newer, faster digital services has placed increased pressure on data centers to keep up as new applications come online, the volume of data handled continually increases, and workloads become increasingly unpredictable. In today's fast-paced digital economy, this creates a perfect storm of higher customer expectations, faster implementation of an increasing number of digital services, and a more tightly connected mainframe supported by a less-experienced workforce.”

Don Draper in the TV show Mad Men sipping a cocktail? Or perhaps trendy people swapping catch phrases in a converted warehouse?'Well, more of the creative work these days is not being done by humans at all.When Dixons Carphone wanted to push shoppers towards its Black Friday sale, the company turned to Artificial Intelligence (AI) software and got the winning line ""The time is now"".Saul Lopes, head of customer marketing at Dixons Carphone, thinks it worked because it didn't have the words Black Friday in it.His human copywriters had produced dozens of potentially successful sentences but they all mentioned Black Friday. It was technology that broke this chain of thought.PhraseeParry Malm wanted to add some science to the art of advertisingThe software in question is from Phrasee, whose boss is Parry Malm, a Canadian who moved to the UK in 2006. Working in marketing he assumed the technology existed to boost human creativity. He describes himself as ""flummoxed"" that this wasn't available. Phrasee, the company he set up in 2015, is the product of Mr Malm's perplexed reaction.""Getting the right message had been left to the Mad Men type characters. But I wanted to apply scientific rigour to those messages,"" he explains.Standard copywriting takes place through a process of editing, argument and approval. Mr Malm says Phrasee does the same thing using a technique called Deep Learning, a vast network of parameters and pre-set limits that guide the programme in the right direction. This allows it to bounce a slogan around, ranking its impact against raw data gleaned from many sources.Getty ImagesHow many of these adverts in Time Square, New York, will eventually be generated thanks to AI?At Rapp, an agency that packages products and services into messages and videos that appeal to the public, Phrasee absorbs a million emails that have been fired off over the years. Then it reassembles those sentences into new messages while adding guidance from Rapp's own writers, technologists and social media experts. Phrasee builds up models that generate words appropriate to each product and the target audience of consumers. Language that has featured in previous campaigns is poured into the Deep Learning model which applies values based on factors such as the look, feel or taste of a product.Mr Lopes knows that in an age of information overload consumers are becoming harder to reach as online sales patter diminishes their appetite for any message. As Phrasee comes armed with a terrific linguistic arsenal and is divorced from the individual points of view that shape the words of human copywriters he thinks it suits our jaded eyes.Dixons Carphone still employs agencies and copywriters, but they come up with an idea which Phrasee then adapts, finessing the human perspective.For a recent Dixons Carphone campaign Mr Lopes used Phrasee to create variations on messages derived from a decade of sales campaigns. ""What surprises me is that we still see wild cards leaping out from the list of messages it generates."" Festival of MarketingThe human brain can't process thousands of options says Saul Lopes, head of customer marketing at Dixons CarphoneThat Black Friday message was one such wild card. Working online, Dixons Carphone gets rapid consumer feedback and quickly saw how well ""The time is now"" was going down with the public.   Copywriters shouldn't fear that AI is about to take their job, says Mr Lopes, because they are still needed to get the ball rolling. ""But the human brain can't look at thousands of options. Our writing team sets out the strategy for the messages, we haven't replaced them."" He's convinced about this AI future. ""Combining creative people with AI is the next step for the agencies. It's not AI versus the human, it generates creative thought.""More Technology of BusinessWhat is solarpunk and can it help save the planet?The fungus and bacteria tackling plastic wasteCan more tech make video meetings less excruciating?What does a future-proof home look like?The little tech firm gunning for an airspeed recordThis might come as a relief to Ogilvy, the agency founded by advertising legend David Ogilvy. His name invokes brilliant and witty campaigns that inspired generations of copywriters, and today Ogilvy bills itself as the ""teaching hospital of advertising"". It boasts a behavioural science practice ran by its vice-chairman and veteran copywriter Rory Sutherland. He's a fan of new thinking, but only if it doesn't dampen the spark of creativity that sets consumers' desires alight. ""AI can't hurt if it generates interesting suggestions,"" Mr Sutherland concedes, ""but it's like satnav in a car. Great for directions but you don't allow it to drive the car!"" Dolly ClewOgilvy vice-chairman and veteran copywriter Rory SutherlandHe worries that AI will be steered into agencies by ""bean counters"" and has railed against an ""alliance between technology and finance"" that uses innovation as a cost-cutting tool regardless of the opportunities that get lost in the process. ""These things tend to be viewed through an efficiency lens."" Advertising, Mr Sutherland declares, ""is about producing something distinctive. It's not a production line."" Programmes like Phrasee can mirror a copywriter's work on an industrial scale. This, a digital factory for ads, is Mr Sutherland's worst nightmare. ""My only reservation about using AI is that people will afford it more power and influence than it deserves in an attempt to automate things, to realise the Fordist dream of multiple copies rolling off an assembly line."" In support of the creative human element he cites great advertising slogans that have been fine-tuned by critical voices from beyond the copywriter's desk. After 30 years as a copywriter Mr Sutherland is always ready to listen to someone who spots that a word or image may have the wrong connotation in another culture. If AI can be that third party source of constructive criticism it has a home in his world. But he definitely won't allow it a deciding vote. ""As a stimulus, suggesting ideas, it has a great future. As a source of judgement it's dubious."" Back at Dixons Carphone, Mr Lopes and his team keep trying to outsmart the software. They hold competitions to see who can guess what the winning line from Phrasee will be. ""It's an internal game, we do it just before we push every new message out,"" he says. ""And we always lose to the computer!""Artificial intelligenceAdvertising","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0F3B/production/_119799830_gettyimages-607654776.jpg'}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'By Michael Dempsey'}]",Why artificial intelligence is being used to write adverts,2021-08-05T23:06:00.000Z,2021-08-05T23:06:00.000Z,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0F3B/production/_119799830_gettyimages-607654776.jpg,,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57781557,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But despite what is a first in India, the decision is likely to be challenged, according to the other co-author




 
 
  For the first time ever in India, the copyright office has recognised an artificial intelligence tool – RAGHAV Artificial Intelligence Painting App – as the co-author of a copyright-protected artistic work. 
  Ankit Sahni, an IP lawyer who owns the AI-based app, is the other author and is registered as the copyright owner. He commissioned the painting in question, ‘Suryast’ (see image below), and even believes that India might be the first country to have acknowledged AI-authorship in a copyrighted work.

DABUS: legal team reveals winning strategy and long-term hopes


  Sahni had filed two copyright applications for two AI-generated artworks, claiming himself as the owner. The copyright office rejected the first application, which listed RAGHAV as the sole author. The second application, on which both Sahni and the AI were named as co-authors, was granted registration in November 2020.







  The copyright registration was a part of classified submissions made by Sahni to the Indian Parliamentary Standing Committee on “protecting AI-created work as well as AI itself”.  
  Sahni has now decided to speak to Managing IP as the committee published its report on July 23, even though it did not reveal details of the registration.
  RAGHAV stands for robust artificially intelligent graphics and art visualizer, and is named after Raghav Gupta, a machine learning engineer who developed the app in 2019 in a funded project for Sahni.
  In an exclusive interview with Managing IP, Sahni lauded the steps taken by the copyright office as bold and forward-looking.
  “While the existing legislation has its own set of limitations, the act of granting recognition to an AI program as co-author of an artistic work marks the beginning of an era of change that governments across the world will be working on.”
  However, he anticipates that the registration may be challenged in court due to ambiguity in the legislation and jurisprudence.
  Several jurisdictions worldwide do not yet recognise AI authorship under copyright law. In India, the provisions of the Copyright Act are unclear about who can claim authorship of an AI-created work that did not involve any human input, said Sahni.
  RAGHAV is trained in various art styles and used Vincent van Gogh’s painting ‘Starry Night’ and a photograph taken by Sahni as base datasets to create the copyrighted painting. 
  Gupta believes that AI-delivered output is often on par with, if not better than, human creations.
  “Rendering protection to creations by AI will go a long way in recognising and protecting the interests of those who develop such AI applications, and will ensure that they are appropriately incentivised.”
  In its report, the Parliamentary Standing Committee recommended a review of the existing Patents Act and Copyright Act to incorporate AI and AI-related inventions.
  The news comes just a week after South Africa became the first country to issue a patent designating an AI tool – DABUS – as the inventor.

The typical Australian will change careers five to seven times during their professional lifetime, by some estimates. And this is likely to increase as new technologies automate labor, production is moved abroad, and economic crises unfold.
Jobs disappearing is not a new phenomenon – have you seen an elevator operator recently? – but the pace of change is picking up, threatening to leave large numbers of workers unemployed and unemployable.
New technologies also create new jobs, but the skills they require do not always match the old jobs. Successfully moving between jobs requires making the most of your current skills and acquiring new ones, but these transitions can falter if the gap between old and new skills is too large.
We have built a system to recommend career transitions, using machine learning to analyze more than 8 million online job ads to see what moves are likely to be successful. The details are published in PLOS ONE.

For more information check out TNW's Privacy Policy.*Our system starts by measuring similarities between the skills required by each occupation. For example, an accountant could become a financial analyst because the required skills are similar, but a speech therapist might find it harder to become a financial analyst as the skill sets are quite different.
Next, we looked at a large set of real-world career transitions to see which way around these transitions usually go: accountants are more likely to become financial analysts than vice versa.
Finally, our system can recommend a career change that’s likely to succeed – and tell you what skills you may need to make it work.
Measure the similarity of occupations
Our system uses a measure economists call “revealed comparative advantage” (RCA) to identify how important an individual skill is to a job, using online job ads from 2018. The map below visualizes the similarity of the top 500 skills. Each marker represents an individual skill, colored according to one of 13 clusters of highly similar skills.

The similarity between the top 500 skills in Australian job ads in 2018. Highly similar skills cluster together.
Once we know how similar different skills are, we can estimate how similar different professions are based on the skills required. The figure below visualizes the similarity between Australian occupations in 2018.
Each marker shows an individual occupation, and the colors depict the risk each occupation faces from automation over the next two decades (blue shows low risk and red shows high risk). Visibly similar occupations are grouped closely together, with medical and highly skilled occupations facing the lowest automation risk.

The similarity between occupations, colored by technological automation risk.
Mapping transitions
We then took our measure of similarity between occupations and combined it with a range of other labor market variables, such as employment levels and education requirements, to build our job transition recommender system.
Our system uses machine learning techniques to “learn” from real job transitions in the past and predict job movements in the future. Not only does it achieve high levels of accuracy (76%), but it also accounts for asymmetries between job transitions. Performance is measured by how accurately the system predicts whether a transition occurred, when applied to historic job transitions.
The full transitions map is big and complicated, but you can see how it works below in a small version that only includes transitions between 20 occupations. In the map, the “source” occupation is shown on the horizontal axis and the “target” occupation on the vertical axis.
If you look at a given occupation at the bottom of the map, the column of squares shows the probability of moving from that occupation to the one listed at the right-hand side. The darker the square, the higher the probability of making the transition.

Artificial intelligence-powered job recommendations
Sometimes a new career requires developing new skills, but which skills? Our system can help identify those. Let’s take a look at how it works for “domestic cleaners”, an occupation where employment has shrunk severely during COVID-19 in Australia.

New occupations and skills recommendations made by the Job Transitions Recommender System for ‘Domestic Cleaners’ – a ‘non-essential’ occupation that has experienced significant declines during the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia.
First, we use the transitions map to see which occupations it is easiest for a domestic cleaner to transition to. The colors split occupations by their status during the COVID-19 crisis – blue occupations are “essential” jobs that can continue to operate during lockdown, and red are “non-essential”.
We identify top recommended occupations, as seen on the right side of the flow diagram (bottom half of the image), sorted in descending order by transition probability. The width of each band in the diagram shows the number of openings available for each occupation. The segment colors represent whether the demand has increased or decreased compared with the same period of 2019 (pre-COVID).
The first six transition recommendations for are all “non-essential” services, which have unsurprisingly experienced decreased demand. However, the seventh is “aged and disabled carers”, which is classified as “essential” and grew significantly in demand during the beginning of the COVID-19 period.
Since your prospects of finding work are better if you transition to an occupation in high demand, we select “aged and disabled carers” as the target occupation for this example.
What skills to develop for new occupations
Our system can also recommend skills that workers need to develop to increase their chances of a successful transition. We argue that a worker should invest in developing the skills most important to their new profession and which are most different from the skills they currently have.
For a “domestic cleaner”, the top-recommended skills needed to transition to “aged and disabled carer” are specialized patient care skills, such as “patient hygiene assistance”.
On the other hand, there’s less need to develop unimportant skills or ones that are highly similar to skills from your current occupation. Skills such as “business analysis” and “finance” are of low importance for an “aged and disabled carer”, so they should not be prioritized. Similarly, skills such as “ironing” and “laundry” are required for the new job but it is likely that a “domestic cleaner” already possesses these skills (or can easily acquire them).
The benefit of smoother job transitions
While the future of work remains unclear, change is inevitable. New technologies, economic crises and other factors will continue to shift labor demands, causing workers to move between jobs.
If labor transitions occur efficiently, there are significant productivity and equity benefits for everyone. If transitions are slow, or fail, it will have significant costs for both individuals and the state and the individual. The methods and systems we put forward here could significantly improve the achievement of these goals.

What better time for a “next-generation” version of art to come crashing into the art world than 2021? After all, this is the unprecedented year that saw an explosion of demand and sales of NFTs or non-fungible tokens, which are inextricably tied to crypto-currency and blockchain technology. Specifically, we’re now talking about art created by “artficial intelligence”… yes, the machines are taking over art too.
In 2018, Christie’s sold Portrait of Edmond de Belamy (2018), the first-ever original work of art created using artificial intelligence to come to auction (it sold for $432,500 against a high estimate of $10,000), Inspired by reports of the sale, Ben Kovalis and two like-minded childhood friends from Israel, Eyal Fisher and Guy Haimovitz, launched the Art AI Gallery one year later, in late 2019. It involves collections of curated work made using an algorithm that was created over the course of six months and then refined over the next year and a half.
The Christie’s auction “was amazing to us because we are enthusiastic about art but also tech savvy,” Kovalis told Artnet News in a phone interview from London. He and his friends were stunned first by the fact that AI could create art and then by the fact that it could garner the type of price it did, he said.
“We were enthusiastic. We were already speaking about opening a startup company together—which is the dream of every Israeli guy between the ages of 20 and 30,” he said with a laugh.
Last month, the group introduced Artifly, which takes its algorithm development work a step further. Customers scroll through a selection of artwork and click the designs they like, in order to “show Artifly your style.” Then, the user clicks a button reading “Make My Art,” Artifly (the name of which is meant to evoke the phrase “Art on the Fly”) becomes familiar with your selections—and then near instantly, in about a minute, it creates a brand-new personalized artwork. The user then has the option, though not the obligation, to buy a bespoke piece of AI art.
Obvious Art’s ??? ? ??? ? ?? [??? ? (?))] + ?? [???(? − ?(?(?)))], Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, Generative Adversarial Network print on canvas (2018).This genre of AI-created art is arguably far less challenging to wrap one’s head around than some other recent digital art trends, Whereas collectors been paying tens of millions of dollars for extremely difficult-to-understand blockchain-based digital assets at auction recently, Artifly’s prices are quite modest (as low as $29 for a stretched unframed canvas) and you are at least getting a tangible art object to own and hang on the wall. In addition, Artifly gives each buyer a certificate of authenticity which is registered on the blockchain via Verisart, a tech company that provides art certification services.
At the time of the 2018 auction of Obvious, Fisher was working on image processing and analysis for his PhD in mathematical genomics at Cambridge University. He was inspired by the headlines about the Christie’s sale to start working on algorithms.

“He thought that he could create an algorithm that would make way more beautiful and very engaging art,” says Kovalis. “The idea is not to create a single one and sell it for $100,000 but to create thousands and tens of thousands of them and still keep them one of a kind, so anyone can enjoy them.” 
Kovalis has extensive background in e-commerce, having formerly been a VP in the high-tech sector, managing large international operations.
The company founders say that the most common question they face is, “so you want to replace human artists with robots?” Kovalis has a readymade response: “Definitely not—first of all because we don’t think that it is possible to replace artists. This is simply something that enhances art.” He also emphasizes just how much human effort is still required for the process. “You need a lot of sweat, and tears and human involvement to make an AI algorithm that creates something beautiful.”

He compares the use of AI to musicians starting to use synthesizers in the 1980s to create a new type of music. “Not everyone liked the synthesizer. Many did, many didn’t, but it developed into something that helped create pop music. Today, music is the same music that we know and love, it just has some technology in it. This is the same thing that we’re doing with art.”
As for cost, the prices of the works hover around a few hundred dollars at most. It remains to be seen whether a secondary or resale market develops based on the individual certificates of authenticity that can accompany such transactions. And it also remains to be seen whether or not values begin to creep up as they do over time for works sold by galleries and auction houses.

For many people, Kovalis says, there is a learning curve when it comes to becoming comfortable with AI-created art. “People can be a bit scared at first. They know about self-driving cars, but seeing an AI that creates art is the wild frontier.”

Artificial intelligence is probably the less accurate of all.When the founding fathers of AI met in 1956 to find a name for the field, the objective they had in mind was creating a machine with human-like intelligence, behavior, and even sentience. An artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, at that time neither hardware, software, nor data science were mature enough to achieve that goal. They were naive into thinking AGI was easily attainable.Nowadays, the promises of AI and the dreams and desires of its founders are largely forgotten. We’re creating effective systems that are good at extracting patterns from data to make predictions. But we’re not aiming at building AGI anymore (at least most of the research and projects aren’t). Yet, the field is still called artificial intelligence.It’s a catchy concept.

Oregon Health & Science University is part of a new National Science Foundation-funded institute to develop artificial intelligence systems to help people live independently as they age. (OHSU)

Oregon Health & Science University is one of five universities nationwide to form a new National Science Foundation-funded institute to design and build intelligent systems to help people age in place.
The five-year, $20 million grant will support the creation of an AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups, or AI-Caring. The institute will develop artificial intelligence systems that work for aging adults, including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and their caregivers.
Most older adults prefer to remain in their own homes. But safety concerns, medication schedule and isolation can all make it difficult for them to do so.
The work builds on a model OHSU established more than a decade ago through its Oregon Center for Aging and Technology, or ORCATECH. In this research, participants agree to permit the ORCATECH system to collect unique life data in their homes, using an array of sensors to assess changes in gait, sleep and overall activity. It also includes a “MedTracker” electronic pill box as well as a scale to measure weight, body fat and pulse.
“Our project is focused on assisting people to age independently and in particular people who might develop cognitive impairment later in life,” said OHSU site leader Jeffrey Kaye, M.D., director of the OHSU Layton Aging & Alzheimer’s Disease Center. “ORCATECH has unique datasets that will allow the new institute to develop and create advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to help people age in place.”
OHSU has developed terabytes of privacy-protected data that will be useful for the new institute.
“We’re very honored and pleased to be partners in this national effort,” Kaye said. “We look forward to collaborating with other investigators, who will help advance our home assessment platform and the artificial intelligence. The goal is to make better diagnoses and ultimately mediate disabilities in aging.”
Given the staggering costs of long-term care services for people who can no longer live independently, estimated to top $1 trillion by 2050 to care for those with Alzheimer’s disease, Kaye said the new institute is an important step toward developing solutions.
“Our goal is to create systems that help people take care of people,” said Beth Mynatt, director of the Institute for People and Technology at Georgia Tech, the lead institution for the new project. “Care can be a complicated task, requiring coordination and decision-making across family members managing day to day demands.”
Aside from OHSU and Georgia Tech, the institute will include faculty from Carnegie Mellon University, Oregon State University and the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Amazon and Google are industry sponsors.

Like all merger and acquisition lawyers, Wei Chen spent much of her formative years on due diligence patrol — mining thousands of contract pages to find the few clauses needed for legal analysis.
“The process hasn’t evolved since I started practicing over 20 years ago: it’s time-consuming, mind-numbing, and prone to errors,” Chen laments. “Two years ago, with the success of artificial intelligence (AI), I kept asking myself, ‘If my iPhone can find cat pictures from my photo albums, why can’t AI find the most favored nation or exclusivity clauses in my piles of contracts?’” 
Senior vice president and associate general counsel at Salesforce, Chen soon realized that the secret to AI success lies in the volume and quality of training data. “For AI to perform better on contract review, lawyers were needed to tag contracts and make them publicly available for free,” she says. 
But given that highly trained legal minds are needed for such a task — and that most contracts are confidential and proprietary — how to open source them through skilled lawyers willing to tag contracts for free? 
Berkeley Center for Law and Business Executive Director Adam Sterling ’13
Chen found her answer after conferring with Adam Sterling ’13, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Business (BCLB), where she serves on the advisory board. Sterling connected her with a dozen eager Berkeley Law students, leading to an experimental pilot program that launched the Atticus Project (opens in a new tab) — a nonprofit that harnesses AI’s power to accelerate accurate and efficient contract review — in summer 2020. 
“The Atticus Project is defining the future of technology in the legal profession and I was so excited for the opportunity to allow Berkeley Law students to be a part of that,” Sterling says. 
Working under the supervision of experienced attorneys, the students released a beta dataset of 200 commercial contracts in October 2020. Sterling subsequently introduced Chen to two UC Berkeley AI researchers, which opened the floodgates.
“With their help, we were able to open source a training dataset in March 2021 with over 13,000 clauses across 510 commercial contracts, corresponding to 40 types of clauses,” Chen says. “We hope this dataset will be a catalyst for legal AI innovations and move the industry forward for all.”
The Atticus Project team tags the contracts’ key clauses, exports them into a csv file (similar to a spreadsheet) computers can read, and downloads the full contracts into txt files. The team wrote a user’s manual and datasheet explaining what the dataset contains, how to use it, and what limitations and biases it may have, and posted the package on its website and for free public download.
A broader reach 
Recently, The Atticus Project partnered with BCLB and the LexLab at UC Hastings Law to launch two programs — one for experienced attorneys and the other for law students. 
The former gives lawyers the chance to design a project to solve data-related legal challenges, create training programs, teach at participating law schools, and mentor law students. The latter offers law students and non-legal professionals the chance to learn vital legal concepts and find them in legal documents under experienced attorney supervision. 
“Unless lawyers get their hands dirty to create training datasets, legal AI will never get to an accuracy level that we need,” Chen says. “There’s already a huge divide between the AI performance in areas such as law and medicine where skilled labor is scarce versus areas where training datasets are abundant or cheap to obtain, like image and voice recognition or Wikipedia. Unless the legal industry catches up quickly, legal will continue to live in the Stone Age while other areas take off.”
The Atticus Project has trained over 60 law students and 15 high school students on contract review skills and AI knowledge, including six from Berkeley Law this past summer. Experienced attorneys from approximately 10 leading law firms and several public company in-house legal departments served as volunteer lecturers and reviewers, discussing complex legal topics that students encounter during their contract review.
With the law students’ help, The Atticus Project developed a comprehensive reservoir of high-quality training materials. Students start their learning journeys by taking a self-paced online course on Berkeley Canvas that contains over 50 training modules with presentations and videos by practicing attorneys and AI researchers. 
Chris Gronseth ’22
That learning is then reinforced by over 20 self-graded quizzes and a 200-plus page handbook created by the attorneys. The students are then tasked with finding the key concepts in contracts and tagging them using an online tool. The process includes individual student review, group peer review of the work product, and attorney supervisor oversight and feedback. 
Students also had access to office hours for questions, career talks, and OCI interview preparation to establish meaningful conversations with the supervising attorneys beyond contract review.
“I had previously only heard ‘artificial intelligence’ and ‘machine learning’ as buzz-wordy terms used to describe a dystopian future of work,” says Chris Gronseth ’22, who worked with the Atticus Project in summer 2020. “ I was excited to get hands-on experience in learning more about what AI really entails and how it might be a positive and useful tool in legal work. The fast-paced, startup dynamic at Atticus provides a lot of room for creativity and initiative.” 
Chen’s team is busy creating a new training dataset of legal contracts that she plans to open source in early 2022. She foresees AI extending into more areas of legal research and consumer protection, such as scanning a credit card agreement for predatory clauses or scouring a privacy policy to assess compliance with the law.
“AI can enhance and supplement an expert’s knowledge by leaps and bounds,” Chen says. “Knowledge that requires years of training and apprenticeship can be obtained within a few short months. In the very near future, a lawyer not knowing how to leverage AI would be the same as a brain surgeon not aided by CT-scan or a farmer not having access to weather reports.”

Artificial Intelligence on the Battlefield
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making systems and conventional solutions of the military is no longer surprising. What is eye-opening, however, is the possibility of using it without human supervision. When Deep Blue computer won a chess game against world champion Garry Kasparov in New York City in 1997, most experts perceived this event as a sign that AI is catching up with human intelligence.

Wall-Defender is a computer game that only older readers or die-hard fans of retro games may remember. Created in 1983 for the Atari 2600 platform, the game allowed the player to take on the role of a fortress defense commander. An 8-bit processor, 128 bytes of RAM, and technical limitations related to graphics display left a lot of room for the player’s imagination. Today’s computers, equipped with incomparably more powerful processors and graphics chips can do much more. A “Wall-Defender” in 2021 does not display a bunch of pixels simulating an enemy, leaving the battle with a virtual opponent to the player. The “Wall-Defender” in 2021 fights a real enemy in real-time.
Operation Guardian of the Walls began after unrest in Jerusalem led to rockets being fired from Gaza into Israeli cities. The first firing of 38 missiles occurred on April 23 and 24. Between May 10 and 18, more than 3,440 rockets were fired toward the cities of Sderot, Ashkelon, Ashdod, and Jerusalem. The Iron Dome defense system intercepted more than 90% of the rockets that were heading towards the inhabited areas. It was designed to detect as well as destroy rockets and 155 mm artillery shells. The Iron Dome is effective against missiles fired from up to 43 miles away. Using AI algorithms, the system analyzes whether a detected series of short-range rockets and missiles threatens the population or critical infrastructure of the country. If the AI system identifies such a threat, it automatically sends a command to launch an interceptor missile that neutralizes the threat at high altitude or in an uninhabited safe area. The system is also operational in the US since 2021 – the US Army has recently activated two Iron Dome defense batteries at Fort Bliss, TX. They are planned to be used in military exercises later this year and become fully operational in 2023. 
Operation Guardian of the Walls was not only about using the existing defense system – during the conflict the Israeli army used numerous innovative solutions. Consequently, many experts [5] claim that the fight turned into the world’s first AI-led war. Israel planned its attacks on Gaza with the use of AI. Huge amounts of data collected from open-source intelligence (OSINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and human intelligence (HUMINT) were analyzed in order to carry out the so-called precision attacks. On the basis of satellite images, information from sensors, radars, UAVs, and other sources, the Israeli army was able to obtain accurate 3D images of the Gaza Strip as well as identify the locations of rocket launchers installed by Hamas. Moreover, the AI identified the types of weapons at the enemy’s disposal and, on the basis of the acquired data, determined, in real-time, the safest routes for ground troops operating near the front line. “For the first time, artificial intelligence was a key component and power multiplier in fighting the enemy,” an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Intelligence Corps senior officer said in a commentary, a part of the Jerusalem Post article.
Additionally, this report highlighted the importance of the work of soldiers in Unit 8200, who authored the algorithms and code for advanced programs called “Alchemist,” “Gospel,” and “Depth of Wisdom,” which were developed and used during the combat. “Gospel” helped the IDF military intelligence division to improve intelligence recommendations and identify key targets, which were then passed on to the air force to carry out attacks. The Israeli military says that AI helped to shorten the duration of battles as well as increase the effectiveness and speed of detecting targets of the attacks thanks to the super-cognition technology (recognition carried out by AI). According to it “Israel had managed to achieve more in 50 hours of fighting than in the 50 days of the war in 2014.”
Indeed, the 2021 Israel-Palestine crisis can be called the first AI-led war, but it is worth noting that AI has long been present on the battlefield. UAVs, fire-control systems (FCSs), drone swarms; means of reconnaissance, data exchange, and aggregation – these and multiple other elements are effectively used not only on the training grounds, but also during actual clashes. The conflicts in Syria or Ukraine could serve as an example. 
The use of AI in decision-making systems and conventional solutions of the military is no longer surprising. What is eye-opening, or rather intimidating, is the possibility of using it without human supervision. When Deep Blue computer won a chess game against world champion Garry Kasparov in New York City in 1997, most experts perceived this event as a sign that AI is catching up with human intelligence. Subsequent scientific analyses have played down the significance of this event, trying to prove that Kasparov lost because he played the game “uncharacteristically badly.” What is more, the intellectual value of chess as a game was questioned, arguing that the computer can plan it by using brute force algorithms (checking every possible solution). Another clash in 2020 showed that humans are no longer a worthy opponent for well-trained AI.
In a simulated F-16 dogfight between a US Air Force pilot, a graduate of the F-16 instructor course at the Air Force Weapons School with over 2,000 hours of flight experience, and an AI developed by Heron Systems, the human pilot lost 5-0 in five different maneuver scenarios. 
Everything indicates that AI will play an increasingly significant role during armed conflicts. There is no doubt about it. Therefore, the limitations that decision makers have to place on AI systems are extremely important. Their growing autonomy requires taking appropriate precautions and, above all, prudence from the designers and operators of such systems.

Artificial-intelligence researcher Joy Buolamwini dons a white mask in the film Coded Bias to make herself visible to facial recognition software.Film still by 7th Empire Media

























One of the more startling and instructive documentaries of the recent past is 2020’s Coded Bias, which explores a thorny dilemma: in modern society, artificial-intelligence systems increasingly govern and surveil people’s lives—algorithms now routinely make decisions about health care, housing, insurance, education, employment, banking, and policing—yet racial and gender biases are deeply embedded in many of these AI systems (for more background, read “Artificial Intelligence and Ethics,” January-February 2019, page 44).
The film, which premiered at Sundance and is now streaming on Netflix, begins with MIT Media Lab researcher and MIT doctoral candidate Joy Buolamwini recounting an experience from her first semester there in 2015: working on an art project that used AI facial-recognition software, she was confused at first when the computer didn’t seem to register her face. (Since then, a growing body of research, including by Latanya Sweeney, Paul professor in the practice of government and technology, has shown that AI facial recognition programs do not accurately see dark-skinned faces.) During a striking moment early in the documentary, Buolamwini, who is African American, demonstrates the problem: holding a white mask over her own face, she turns toward her computer, which trills and lights up in response; when she lowers the mask, the computer sits eerily silent. 
The documentary presents a damning portrait of AI’s flaws and the efforts under way to improve them, weaving together research and interviews of those who study the field, including several with Harvard connections: Berkman Klein faculty associate Zeynep Tufekci, former Nieman visiting fellow Amy Webb, data scientist Cathy O’Neil, Ph.D. ’99, author of Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy (2016). Buolamwini herself is a former Adams House tutor (and performed her spoken-word poem, “AI, Ain’t I A Woman?” at a Harvard conference in 2019). 
Central to the film’s account of AI’s history is Meredith Broussard ’95, a data journalist and software developer who in 2018 published Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World. Broussard, who has called algorithmic bias “the civil rights issue of our time,” is a journalism faculty member at New York University, research director of the NYU Alliance for Public Interest Technology, and an advisory board member of the Center for Critical Race and Digital Studies. Most people don’t realize the “massive datafication of everyday life,” she said during a recent interview, and the extent to which algorithms, often hidden from view, “are being used to make decisions on our behalf. And because most people don’t know this, they don’t understand that there is enormous bias and discrimination inside these automated systems that are being used to judge us.”  
One contributing problem, which she examines in Artificial Unintelligence, is what she calls “technochauvinism”—the belief that technology is always the superior solution, which has warped people’s relationship to computers and to each other and the world around them. “Social fairness and mathematical fairness are not the same thing,” Broussard explained. “And mathematical fairness is not always what’s called for….We have to be specific about context. We can’t pretend that it’s going to be adequate to use mathematically fair solutions for social problems. We have to think about what is the right tool for the task.” 
Broussard is now working on a second book, about how technology intersects with race, gender, and ability. “I’m writing about machine fairness and the justice system,” she said, and algorithms in policing—an area where racial bias in facial-recognition surveillance tech carries especially pernicious implications. “I’m also looking at AI in cancer diagnosis, and how algorithms are used to assign imaginary grades to real students.” As the mother of a school-aged child, Broussard said, she has “a personal understanding of how my kid is going to be judged by algorithms in the future.” 
One essential pathway toward fixing AI’s flaws is to build a more diverse pipeline to tech careers, one that includes women and people of color. Coded Bias makes clear just how white and male the field remains, from its earliest conception among Dartmouth computer scientists in the 1950s to Silicon Valley programmers today. And how that narrow perspective has shaped the industry’s culture, and, by turn, its output. “A really small and homogeneous group of people got to decide what they thought intelligence was, and therefore what computational intelligence was,” Broussard said, “and it turns out they were wrong about it in a lot of ways.”
Broussard herself was once in the pipeline to a tech-industry career: arriving at Harvard College in 1991, she initially studied computer science, one of only six undergraduate women in that concentration. She knew two of the other women; the remaining three, she writes in Artificial Unintelligence, “felt like a rumor.” She never met them. “It was really exciting to be there at that time—I started college right when the Web started—but it was also deeply alienating, because there just weren’t a lot of other people like me.” As a black woman, “I also couldn’t look ahead and see anybody who looked like me or who I wanted to model my career on. You need role models. And there weren’t any.” 
Broussard left computer science and graduated with a degree in English, having also taken courses in African American studies. Afterward, she took a job as a software developer at AT&T Bell Labs, building automated testing systems for the telecommunications network and working on AI projects. But eventually, unable to shake the same loneliness and alienation she’d felt at Harvard, she left computer science for journalism.

The patterns that pushed her out of the field persist, with sporadic improvements, especially in education. Women made up 38 percent of the 502 computer-science concentrators at Harvard in 2019-20; and 15 percent were students from underrepresented minorities: black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, or American Indian. Both those figures are above the national average, however, and women’s representation in computer careers has actually decreased in recent decades—from 34 percent in 1990 to 25 percent today, according to analysis from the Pew Research Center. This has happened even as women’s employment in other STEM fields—particularly the life sciences—ticked upward during the same period. Blacks and Hispanics combined make up 15 percent of employees in computer jobs today.  
These disparities run parallel, Broussard said, to AI’s broader problems with bias. And it is important and necessary that those problems be solved, however complicated or difficult they are. “Right now, there is a class differential at work,” she explained, citing Cathy O’Neil’s research. “If you’re rich, you still get judged and evaluated by humans; if you’re poor, you get judged by algorithms.” So for the moment, the wealthy don’t experience the problem as sharply. “Rich people tend to think, ‘I’m still fine, my kids are still fine, my family’s fine, so I’m not going to worry about it.’ But the thing is, the algorithms are coming for everyone—rich people, too—and they’re going to be just as unfair. This issue of algorithm bias is one that affects all of us.”

With decreasing power of the brain to hold concentration for longer periods of time, QC inspectors tend to commit errors in the process, which is mundane and repetitive.Organizations that are using AI-based technologies for enhancing quality control and detecting faults in products or components are seeing better results in terms of the quality, speed and production output.  AI-based tools are also used to track raw materials and parts besides automating warehouse inventory.AI-enabled machines can identify and capture faults with higher levels of accuracy and speed than humans.In addition to detecting errors, AI-based technologies and tools enable preventive and predictive maintenance tasks by reporting manufacturing issues in real time. Manufacturing teams are now alerted of faults that could emerge in future, by revealing them in advance. By leveraging insights that may affect the quality of products, quality inspectors are able to take corrective actions.Furthermore, unplanned downtime can be reduced significantly with risks and vulnerabilities eliminated.  Granular aspects of defects cannot be identified by conventional tools, and AI-based analytics undoubtedly increases the testing efficiency and delivers improvement in risk management with the prioritization of critical aspects.  With AI, Cohots can be reprogrammed and supported in increasing production speed.  AI can be used in machine vision to spot defects in products and handle quality control.The other advantages of using an AI-platform include, assurance of higher quality products, increase in throughput, cost-optimization and higher revenues with increase in the level of customer satisfaction.The pandemic-induced lockdown and scarcity of manpower in 2020 saw accelerated adoption of the AI-based technology and tools to re-establish manufacturing processes. The new system leverages data and deep learning to enhance quality inspection on the shop floor and keeps production lines up and running with much higher efficiency.  With the manufacturing sector’s new QC requirements, and its ask for 100% inspection, there is an increasing appetite for digitization and automation where the traditional machine vision approach is no longer found efficient.The China +1 policy is driving Indian manufacturers to scale-up several levels to meet the growing demand from markets across the globe. Manufacturers now have the option of using AI-based processes to address the shortage of manpower on the shop floor, thereby fueling demand for new age technology and tools.The gains in manufacturing are achieved with minimal manual intervention across the entire process.With numerous benefits achieved by leveraging AI-re-invented manufacturing, workers can now be positioned better with training to perform higher order tasks. They can be re-assigned to perform tasks that bring higher value, increase overall employee engagement and deliver the much required work satisfaction. The jobs can vary from configuring, overseeing and managing AI-driven QC processes.The World Economic Forum Report says by 2025, 85 million jobs will be disrupted globally across large enterprises and SMEs.However, the report also predicts, with shifts in employment, 97 million new roles will be created in the areas of AI, ML, Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, Big Data and Analytics and Robotics among others.  There is an urgent need for manpower with such specialized skills, as repetitive and mundane tasks will be taken over by AI and automation.Other skillsets such as, identifying and solving a problem, analytical reasoning, creative and critical thinking abilities also have to be acquired to deliver value in the age of automation.Organizations, including manufacturing businesses have to ensure their employees undergo appropriate training and get up-skilled to remain employed, perform well in altered roles and become future-ready.  Businesses that work at upgrading their employee skillsets have a competitive edge over others.Korn Ferry, a consulting firm predicts there will be a talent deficit of 85.2 million workers by 2030. It is all the more critical for Organizations to ensure re-skilling and up-skilling of labor force to oversee and manage these new technologies that deliver accuracy, reliability and higher quality yields, besides increase in productivity.(The author Sekar Udayamurthy is Co-founder and CEO of Jidoka Technologies, a Chennai-based company that works in the field of automated cognitive inspection, delivering cutting-edge engineering solutions.

AI Academy Partners with Booz Allen Hamilton To Help Veterans, Transitioning Service Members Grow Skills in Artificial Intelligence

August 5, 2021

Booz Allen Hamilton, a global technology consulting firm with expertise in analytics, digital, engineering and cyber technology, has partnered with NC State’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Academy to train their employees to meet a growing demand for talent in the area of artificial intelligence.
The AI Academy is a nationally registered apprenticeship program funded by a $6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor and designed to train individuals to assume roles within the area of artificial intelligence. Carla C. Johnson, Ph.D., a professor of science education in the NC State College of Education, is the principal investigator on the grant and the executive director of the program. 
The program began in March 2020 with a 12-month planning period in which industry leaders worked alongside Johnson and collaborators from NC State’s Department of Computer Science, including Collin Lynch, Ph.D., Thomas Price, Ph.D., Min Chi, Ph.D., and Noboru Matsuda, Ph.D.
The four-course, 40-week workforce development program has set a goal of upskilling 5,000 individuals to enter the artificial intelligence pipeline, with a specific focus on recruiting veterans, underrepresented workers, underemployed workers, informational technology employees and those seeking an opportunity to move into a different career.
Booz Allen’s workforce is roughly one-third military-connected, including veterans, Guard members, Reservists and military spouses. While transitioning service members come to the firm with relevant skills based on their military career, the apprenticeship offered as part of the AI Academy will allow these employees to use their military experience while training them for future-focused careers and gaining skills in critical areas. 
“Data analytics and machine learning skills, coupled with mission understanding from our military veterans, are critical to the future of our nation’s defense and much of modern industry,” said Greg Wenzel, executive vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton, leader of the firm’s Army business, Global Defense CTO, and executive sponsor of Booz Allen’s Mil/Tech Workforce Initiative. “Companies like Booz Allen need a constant influx of talent in order to help keep America at the forefront. But many of these skills require experiential learning to be useful, so an apprenticeship that combines classroom learning with on-the-job training is really ideal.”
Johnson said there are currently too few qualified individuals in the artificial intelligence workforce and a high demand for workers with relevant skills. The AI Academy aims to remedy this gap by providing a streamlined approach to upskilling that is coupled with on-the-job training and mentoring within an employee’s existing workplace and by giving companies like Booz Allen an opportunity to select employees from their existing talent pool to invest in through training. 
“The NC State AI Academy is pleased to partner with Booz Allen Hamilton as we share similar missions focused on providing career pathways for transitioning military and veterans into much needed and highly skilled career opportunities. It is so important to support the thousands of individuals who have given so much to our country and we are excited to have Booz Allen Hamilton as our collaborator on this program,” Johnson said. 
Booz Allen’s Mil/Tech Workforce Initiative, a series of coordinated efforts to support extended transition from active duty to a civilian career, seeks out innovative programs like the AI Academy and connects transitioning military personnel with them while educating them about skills that are critical for roles in sectors like artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Booz Allen and the AI Academy have further engaged in helping to prepare transitioning service members for careers in the artificial intelligence sector during the Veteran Transition to Tech Networking Event at the North Carolina Military Business Center in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Aug. 4.
AI Academy Program Director Stacey Smith, Ph.D., spoke during the event, which was co-hosted by Booz Allen and attended by transitioning service members, veterans and military spouses.  “Our work in the region requires a well-prepared workforce and local installations like Ft. Bragg and Camp Lejeune represent a huge opportunity to help transitioning service members stay in the area while creating a path to future-focused careers,” said Jay Dodd, vice president at Booz Allen and a leader in the firm’s Fayetteville office. “We love working with partners like NC State who know the region and are familiar with transitioning military talent, and we are excited for this and future engagements in the region in order to continue building a strong local tech talent pipeline.”

Search engines scan the internet to find what you’re looking for, or what you don’t know you’re looking for. Social media platforms surface content you might want to read. And the latest iPhones recognize your face in a split second to unlock your phone.






As the artificial intelligence industry grows, the consequences of lacking a diverse workforce can pose major challenges that threaten to ripple into everyday life. Women and minorities are underrepresented in the AI workforce, according to a Stanford report on diversity in AI. More than 83% of AI tenure-track faculty at top universities are male, while over 46% of Ph.D. students in the United States studying AI are white.
This is the challenge that Stanford’s AI4ALL program was designed to address. The summer program, operated by Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, introduces the theory and application of AI to students, many from underrepresented backgrounds in AI, across the world.
“Having diverse teams of people that bring in different perspectives and that bring in understanding of different human populations or different groups of people really can only enrich the development of the technology,” said program director Juan Carlos Niebles.
The AI summer program targets ninth grade students who demonstrate mathematical maturity. According to Niebles, the goal of the program is to inspire students of diverse backgrounds to consider AI as a career option.






“We are looking for students that have a strong leadership potential, students that have the potential to really come to the field and become the future stars of AI technology,” Niebles said.
The program, which ran from June 28 to July 16, was entirely virtual because of the pandemic. Niebles and his team worked to preserve most, if not all, of the program and its academic engagement in the virtual setting.
The AI4ALL summer program originated from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory’s Outreach Summer Program. In 2017, the program was rebranded with its new name. As of this year, it has expanded to 15 college campuses across the nation, including Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon University.
Throughout the program, students attend lectures, engage in hands-on activities and gain skills in design and presentation. Program participants also work in teams of eight on AI projects spanning topics such as transportation, health, satellite imagery and analyzing tweets.






Joanna Liu, a 2017 AI4ALL alumnus, worked on a project programming autonomous cars.
“The whole goal of the project was essentially to aid in disabilities, like people with disabilities, and get from Point A to Point B without having a person at the wheel,” Liu said.
This year, 32 students participated from the U.S. and other countries. Although it was challenging to replicate the same sense of community, Niebles reported that the program became more accessible because students could attend from all around the world without having to travel.
Although the program lasts only three weeks each summer, Liu, like many other alumni of AI4ALL, has continued to pursue AI.
Along with her friends Anne Li and Taylor Fang, who also attended AI4ALL, Liu started Allgirlithm, a website providing a 20-week computer science and AI curriculum for free. According to Liu, the curriculum is being used to teach nearly 4,000 students.
“We have some amazing students who have succeeded in being successful in research very early on,” said program co-founder Rick Sommer. “We’ve had high school students do research projects that have won awards and gotten attention and have found their ways into top universities where they are continuing to work in AI.”






While most students’ access to AI is currently restricted to enrichment programs like AI4ALL, Sommer envisions the integration of AI education into the normal coursework at schools. But he said that it may take time for the school curriculum to evolve.
“There are many barriers to introducing a new curriculum and in schools,” Sommer said, explaining the difficulty of finding suitable teachers and integrating new curricula into what is already being taught in classrooms.
According to Sommer, as AI4ALL alumni are still young, the program’s effect on diversity in the AI workforce has yet to be realized. 
“We want to make sure that when the technology evolves and it is applied to all these different domains,” Niebles said. “All humans have a voice of representation in the development of that technology, and we want to make sure that we get to that point.”
