These systems are often trained on images of predominantly light-skinned men. And so, I decided to share my experience of the coded gaze, the bias in artificial intelligence that can lead to discriminatory or exclusionary practices. Altering myself to fit the norm—in this case better represented by a white mask than my actual face—led me to realize the impact of the exclusion overhead, a term I coined to describe the cost of systems that don’t take into account the diversity of humanity. How much does a person have to change themselves to function with technological systems that increasingly govern our lives?We often assume machines are neutral, but they aren’t. My research uncovered large gender and racial bias in AI systems sold by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon. Given the task of guessing the gender of a face, all companies performed substantially better on male faces than female faces. The companies I evaluated had error rates of no more than 1% for lighter-skinned men. For darker-skinned women, the errors soared to 35%. AI systems from leading companies have failed to correctly classify the faces of Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and Serena Williams. When technology denigrates even these iconic women, it is time to re-examine how these systems are built and who they truly serve.Joy Buolamwini, Algorithmic Justice LeagueThere’s no shortage of headlines highlighting tales of failed machine learning systems that amplify, rather than rectify, sexist hiring practices, racist criminal justice procedures, predatory advertising, and the spread of false information. Though these research findings can be discouraging, at least we’re paying attention now. This gives us the opportunity to highlight issues early and prevent pervasive damage down the line. Computer vision experts, the ACLU, and the Algorithmic Justice League, which I founded in 2016, have all uncovered racial bias in facial analysis and recognition technology. Given what we know now, as well as the history of racist police brutality, there needs to be a moratorium on using such technology in law enforcement—including in equipping drones or police body cameras with facial analysis or recognition software for lethal operations.See the 2019 Optimists issue, guest-edited by Ava DuVernay.We can organize to protest this technology being used dangerously. When people’s lives, livelihoods, and dignity are on the line, AI must be developed and deployed with care and oversight. This is why I launched the Safe Face Pledge to prevent the lethal use and mitigate abuse of facial analysis and recognition technology. Already three companies have agreed to sign the pledge.Joy Buolamwini, Algorithmic Justice LeagueAs more people question how seemingly neutral technology has gone astray, it’s becoming clear just how important it is to have broader representation in the design, development, deployment, and governance of AI. The underrepresentation of women and people of color in technology, and the under-sampling of these groups in the data that shapes AI, has led to the creation of technology that is optimized for a small portion of the world. Less than 2% of employees in technical roles at Facebook and Google are black. At eight large tech companies evaluated by Bloomberg, only around a fifth of the technical workforce at each are women. I found one government dataset of faces collected for testing that contained 75% men and 80% lighter-skinned individuals and less than 5% women of color—echoing the pale male data problem that excludes so much of society in the data that fuels AI.Joy Buolamwini, Algorithmic Justice LeagueIssues of bias in AI tend to most adversely affect the people who are rarely in positions to develop technology. Being a black woman, and an outsider in the field of AI, enables me to spot issues many of my peers overlooked.I am optimistic that there is still time to shift towards building ethical and inclusive AI systems that respect our human dignity and rights. By working to reduce the exclusion overhead and enabling marginalized communities to engage in the development and governance of AI, we can work toward creating systems that embrace full spectrum inclusion. In addition to lawmakers, technologists, and researchers, this journey will require storytellers who embrace the search for truth through art and science. Storytelling has the power to shift perspectives, galvanize change, alter damaging patterns, and reaffirm to others that their experiences matter. That’s why art can explore the emotional, societal, and historical connections of algorithmic bias in ways academic papers and statistics cannot. And as long as stories ground our aspirations, challenge harmful assumptions, and ignite change, I remain hopeful.See the 2019 Optimists issue, guest-edited by Ava DuVernay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AI in law
Depositphotos enhanced by CogWorld





What is the law but a series of algorithms? Codified instructions proscribing dos and don’ts—ifs and thens. Sounds a lot like computer programming, right? The legal system, on the other hand, is not as straightforward as coding. Just consider the complicated state of justice today, whether it be problems stemming from backlogged courts, overburdened public defenders, and swathes of defendants disproportionately accused of crimes.

So, can artificial intelligence help?
Very much so. Law firms are already using AI to more efficiently perform due diligence, conduct research and bill hours. But some expect the impact of AI to be much more transformational. It’s predicted AI will eliminate most paralegal and legal research positions within the next decade. Could judges and lawyers share the same fate? My coauthor Michael Ashley and I spoke to experts about AI’s impact on the legal system for our upcoming book, Own the A.I. Revolution: Unlock Your Artificial Intelligence Strategy to Disrupt Your Competition.
“It may even be considered legal malpractice not to use AI one day,” says Tom Girardi, renowned civil litigator and the real-life inspiration for the lawyer in the movie, Erin Brockovich. “It would be analogous to a lawyer in the late twentieth century still doing everything by hand when this person could use a computer.”
PROMOTED
There are many reasons to believe AI could benefit the legal industry in ways as meaningful as the personal computer. Currently, the legal system relies on armies of paralegals and researchers to discover, index, and process information. For law firms at present, this reliance can be expensive, driving up the rates they charge. And in understaffed public defender offices, investigators can only spend a few minutes interviewing each of their clients, greatly diminishing the service they can provide.

However, for just a fraction of the time and expense, AI could be used to conduct time-consuming research, reducing the burdens on courts and legal services and accelerating the judicial process. There are also situations where using AI might be preferable to interacting with a human, such as for client interviews. For instance, it’s been demonstrated people are more likely to be honest with a machine than with a person, since a machine isn’t capable of judgment.
Of course, AI can’t replace all means of collecting information. There are instances in which depositions would be more conducive to fact-gathering. Still, when preparing for a cross-examination of an expert witness, AI could be effectively deployed to determine every case in which a particular witness testified, what his/her opinions were, and how juries reacted, much faster and more thoroughly than any human investigator ever could.

Such effectiveness is great, but will lawyers panic when they can’t bill as many hours? Not according to Girardi. He believes those firms willing to adopt AI will possess a strategic advantage. “It’s a lawyer’s job to solve a problem as quickly and inexpensively as possible,” Girardi explains. “AI will be a godsend because it’ll give lawyers the information they need to resolve conflicts faster.”
Yes, AI-wielding lawyers wouldn’t be able to technically bill as many hours since the AI would work much faster than they ever could; however, according to Girardi, these attorneys’ enhanced effectiveness would likely garner repeat business and lead to more clients. “If a lawyer can use AI to win a case and do it for less than someone without AI, who do you think the client will choose to work with next time?” says Girardi. Accordingly, the promise for law firms using AI is that they will still be able to generate the same amount or even more revenue while expanding their client rosters. Conversely, firms too slow to adapt to AI and automation will suffer a competitive disadvantage.
While conventional wisdom still suggests job security for lawyers and judges is more secure than other professions, there have been calls to relieve our backlogged court system by outsourcing minor cases to AI. To this end, some courts are even considering using AI to determine eligibility for bail by detecting behavioral patterns indicating flight risk — a decision flesh-and-blood judges traditionally made in the past.
Courtrooms are likely to transform in other meaningful ways due to technological advances. Girardi believes courts might one day welcome AI technology to aid with jury selection. “If a civil dispute concerns a matter of fact—Did the doctor cut off the wrong leg?—today, it’s largely settled out of court,” says Girardi. “However, if a case concerns the interpretation of the law—Did he or she wait too long before performing a procedure? Did a doctor make a bad judgment call?—the case can go to trial, which is why the philosophical makeup of a jury is so important.”
AI could be valuable in a trial setting because it could predict such philosophical makeups. Adept at rapidly collecting important information, it could gather data about potential jurors, including their accident history, if they have served before, the verdicts of those trials, and a juror’s political and charitable affiliations. AI could also be used to analyze facial reactions and body language indicating how a potential juror feels about an issue. Before a potential juror even answers a question, the movement of his or her eyes, a change in skin coloration, or a shift in body positioning could nonverbally communicate an emotional response demonstrating a positive or negative bias. Such data could be used for optimal jury selection, facilitating greater fairness.
In spite of such developments inside the courtroom, it’s nonetheless hard to imagine how trial lawyers might be replaced by artificial intelligence. For now, a human’s unique ability to create empathy with jurors and judges alike makes them indispensable to legal deliberations. But what if judges were one day replaced by robots? After all, we know humans are fallible creatures, prone to prejudices and biases.
Song Richardson, Dean of the University of California-Irvine School of Law, worries about just this possibility. “Why does someone become a lawyer or judge? It’s certainly not to become a cog in the wheel of an assembly line system of justice. The fact that we have backlogs resulting in a failure to give people the individualized attention they deserve tells us there’s something fundamentally wrong with our justice system. Expediting the mass processing of people using AI isn’t the answer. It’s the opposite of justice.”
Richardson believes AI can benefit the legal profession, yet she cautions us to be careful how we implement it. Even the best AI needs to be taught, which means it can only be as objective as the people who teach it. “People often view AI and algorithms as being objective without considering the origins of the data being used in the machine-learning process,” says Richardson, who specializes in the dangers of unconscious bias. “Biased data is going to lead to biased AI. When training people for the legal profession, we need to help future lawyers and judges understand how AI works and its implications in our field.”
In spite of these concerns, Richardson still believes the net impact of new technology will be positive. Lawyers and judges are only as good as the information they receive, and AI has the potential to significantly increase the quality of information. Still, no matter how sophisticated the technology becomes, she and Girardi both agree it will never be a substitute for the judgment and decision-making only humans can provide. “AI isn’t going to replace the need for critical thinking. We still need to prepare students to think like lawyers, and I don’t think that’s ever going to change,” says Richardson.
Though no consensus exists yet as to how AI will ultimately shape the legal profession, we do know AI is poised to transform nearly every facet of our lives, and the new technologies it’s powering will create a host of unprecedented legal issues, including ownership, liability, privacy and policing. For a taste of what’s coming, just consider this: when self-driving cars start getting into accidents, who will be deemed responsible? The car owner? The manufacturer? The software designer? The very fact these are complicated issues soon to be exacerbated by unprecedented technology reveals the need for more lawyers, but not just any kind of lawyers. We need those capable of making sense of our rapidly evolving society.
“What worries me is that we won’t have lawyers who understand algorithms and AI well enough to even know what questions to ask, nor judges who feel comfortable enough with these new technologies to rule on cases involving them,” says Richardson. In light of such valid concerns, it is becoming increasingly clear our law schools must prepare tomorrow’s lawyers to use the new technology. But even this isn’t enough. We also need today’s practicing counsel and judges to grasp AI and all it promises to better serve and protect our fellow humans.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Neil SahotaFollowingFollowNeil Sahota (萨冠军) is an IBM Master Inventor, United Nations (UN) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Advisor, Professor at UC Irvine, and author of the book:... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/02/09/will-a-i-put-lawyers-out-of-business/,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Forbes', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/', 'ethicsPolicy': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/forbes-editorial-values-and-standards/', 'logo': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/i-forbesimg/media/amp/images/forbes-logo-dark.png?format=png&height=455&width=650&fit=bounds'}",,2019-02-09T22:43:00-05:00,,2019-02-09T23:38:25-05:00,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/cognitiveworld/files/2019/02/AIinLaw-F-1200x799.png?format=png&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', 'width': 542.79, 'height': 304.6}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Neil Sahota', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilsahota/', 'description': ""Neil Sahota (萨冠军) is an IBM Master Inventor, United Nations (UN) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Advisor, Professor at UC Irvine, and author of the book: Own the A.I.

To demonstrate the technology in their smartphones, Huawei set themselves the challenge of finishing one of the most famous incomplete works in musical history
Schubert's Symphony No.8 was started in 1822, but for reasons that have never been understood, Schubert never completed the work. The first two movements are complete – and this two-movement piece is one of the composer's most famous works – but there are only fragments of the final two movements. Chinese technology company Huawei decided to try and use AI to complete the work – with the help of composer Lucas Cantor. Huawei used the AI in its Huawei Mate 20 Pro smartphone to create the new melodies. Engineers fed music, in the form of data, into the phone's dual Neural Processing Unit – so the AI had information about the timbre, pitch and meter that Schubert liked to use in his melodies. The AI then created melodies from that information, and composer Lucas Cantor chose his favourites. He then orchestrated those melodies and turned them into the final two movements to complete Schubert's 'Unfinished' Symphony. The new completion was performed on 4 February, in London at Cadogan Hall, in an even presented by Myleene Klass.

Speaking ahead of the world premiere, Cantor said that working with the AI was ""like having a collaborating who never gets tired, never runs out of ideas"". 





But, he added, having his music performed immediately after Schubert's was slightly nerve-wracking: ""It's a bit like being a comedian and having the greatest comedian in the world go on before you."" In a statement Walter Ji, the president of Huawei Consumer Business Group, Huawei Western Europe, said: ""At Huawei, we are always searching for ways in which technology can make the world a better place. So we taught our Mate 20 Pro smartphone to analyse an unfinished, nearly 200 year old piece of music and to finish it in the style of the original composer. We used the power of AI, to extend the boundaries of what is humanly possible and see the positive role technology might have on modern culture."" More information about Huawei's 'Unfinished' Symphony project can be found here. It's not the first time Schubert's Eighth Symphony has been 'completed' – in 1928 Columbia Records held a competition to mark the 100th anniversary of the composer's death, asking people to complete the symphony. More recently, in 2011 Cambridge University professor and composer Robin Holloway used the fragmentary sketches that Schubert left to complete the third movement Scherzo.

The new completion was performed on 4 February, in London at Cadogan Hall, in an even presented by Myleene Klass.  Speaking ahead of the world premiere, Cantor said that working with the AI was &quot;like having a collaborating who never gets tired, never runs out of ideas&quot;. But, he added, having his music performed immediately after Schubert&#x27;s was slightly nerve-wracking: &quot;It&#x27;s a bit like being a comedian and having the greatest comedian in the world go on before you.&quot; In a statement Walter Ji, the president of Huawei Consumer Business Group, Huawei Western Europe, said: &quot;At Huawei, we are always searching for ways in which technology can make the world a better place. So we taught our Mate 20 Pro smartphone to analyse an unfinished, nearly 200 year old piece of music and to finish it in the style of the original composer. We used the power of AI, to extend the boundaries of what is humanly possible and see the positive role technology might have on modern culture.&quot; More information about Huawei&#x27;s &#x27;Unfinished&#x27; Symphony project can be found here. It&#x27;s not the first time Schubert&#x27;s Eighth Symphony has been &#x27;completed&#x27; – in 1928 Columbia Records held a competition to mark the 100th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s death, asking people to complete the symphony. More recently, in 2011 Cambridge University professor and composer Robin Holloway used the fragmentary sketches that Schubert left to complete the third movement Scherzo.

Following Christie’s tremendously successful and much-debated inclusion of an AI artwork in an auction last October—selling it for 43 times its estimate—the auction house’s archrival, Sotheby’s, is now preparing to test these uncanny waters by selling a work powered by artificial intelligence too. Heading to auction in Sotheby’s day sale in London on March 6, the occasion reaffirms a brave new fact of the art market: AI art is not going away.
This time, the artwork in question is an installation by Mario Klingemann, an early adopter of the field in which computer technology meets art—a movement the artist dubs “neurography.”
Klingemann’s installation, titled Memories of Passersby I (2018), consists of a wooden console table containing the AI computer’s “brain” and two framed screens. The machine works in real time to spit out unsettling portraits of imagined male and female faces onto the screens. It is estimated to sell at £30,000-40,000 (or $39,000-52,000).
Unlike previous AI artworks that have been sold, which have been human-curated final products, Klingemann’s machine is unique as it creates its portraits while you’re looking at it. The installation gives viewers the unique chance to, as Sotheby’s contemporary art specialist Marina Ruiz Colomer put it in a statement, “watch an AI brain think in real time.” 
The unreal images conjured by the neural network are based on its training on a database of portraits from the 17th to 19th centuries, which share Klingemann’s own bias towards surrealistic work. Many of the generated portraits end up taking on a anxiety-inducing quality Klingemann calls the “Francis Bacon effect,” referring to the alienated paintings of the great 20th-century artist. 



Klingemann was a pioneer in experimentation with neural networks and art, and was instrumental in creating many models now used by other artists working in the field. Speaking to artnet News, the artist says it “feels good” to finally be recognized by the official art world through the inclusion in the Sotheby’s sale, adding that he “honestly did not see it coming.”
The technology used in the artwork heading to auction is cutting-edge, as no one else has been able to create a machine that can work to create portraits at such speed and at such a high resolution (and that can also fit into a small box to boot).
“I guess I have to thank everyone who plays computer games,” Klingemann says. “Thanks to the high demands of games, graphics cards have become extremely powerful and versatile.” He likens the power consumption of the system to the energy needed to run a fridge. That said, the real-time aspect and the high resolution took “quite some time” to perfect, according to the artist. All in all, he says, he spent about three months training the models, writing the code, and designing the installation. 
Klingemann has chronicled his experiments over the past three years on his Twitter feed.

There are three editions of the work that is being sold at Sotheby’s, as well as two artist’s proofs—although as each edition constantly works to create unique portraits, no two will ever be the same. Klingemann notes that the AI within the work itself is “encrypted and protected, so you will not be able to copy them out of the machine or look at them to learn my little production secrets.”
The auction house discovered Klingemann’s work after one of its specialists spotted it at a private museum in Spain. “One edition of Memories of Passersby I is in the private museum of Coleccion Solo in Madrid,” the artist explains. “After that, one discussion led to another, and here we are!”
Sotheby’s is presenting the piece as a breakthrough. “It is the nature of Contemporary Art to push boundaries,” Sotheby’s Colomer said in the statement. “AI art is the latest innovation winning its place in art history books, and Klingemann’s work stands on the precipice of an exciting new era in our field.”

For now Klingemann, a self-avowed “control freak,” is in for a nerve-racking wait. “An auction is a very public space, so the idea that my work, and people’s reaction to it, will be ‘out there’…it’s a bit like waiting for your grades after a school exam,” he says.
The artist recently accepted the RE:HUMANISM prize for work created with artificial intelligence at the National Gallery on January 23, and was also a recent recipient of the Lumen Prize for Art and Technology. His work has been shown in institutions including MoMA, the Met, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. In May, Klingemann will feature in the Barbican’s new exhibition “AI: More Than Human.”

Rather than the clean break she had hoped for, she found herself being bombarded with hateful messages on social media from her ex-boyfriend’s friends. One even urged her to kill herself.“I withdrew a lot. The messages made me so depressed and led to me taking an overdose,” says Mattocks. She is just one of millions of people around the world who have found themselves the victim of bullying. Even in our modern, progressive society, it is too often overlooked and commonly dismissed as a rite of passage, but bullying affects between a fifth and a third of children at school. Adults suffer similar rates of harassment at work.You might also like: • The signs of disease no one can see • How your voice betrays a doomed romance  • What single word defines who you are?Yet research has shown that bullying can leave a lasting scar on people’s lives, causing long-term damage to their future health, wealth and relationships. And the increasing amount of time we spend online exposes us to forms of bullying that, while faceless, can be just as devastating. Young people subjected to cyberbullying suffer more from depression than non-victims and are at least twice as likely to self-harm and to attempt suicide.Luckily for Mattocks, her break up and the subsequent cyberbullying occurred just as she was about to start university. In this new environment she was able to make new friends who helped her.“It [cyber bullying] changed my outlook,” she says. “It  made me a kinder, stronger person.” Mattocks now works as a mental health campaigner, helping others who face bullying. She believes more needs to be done to curb bullying online.  Getty ImagesSocial media has provided bullies with a new way to target their victims, but often those who they attack do not report these incidents (Credit: Getty Images)But while our access to technology is increasing the potential for bullying – 59% of US teens say they have been bullied online – it could also help to stamp it out. Computers powered by artificial intelligence are now being deployed to spot and deal with cases of harassment.“It is nearly impossible for human moderators to go through all posts manually to determine if there is a problem,” says Gilles Jacobs, a language researcher at Ghent University in Belgium. “AI is key to automating detection and moderation of bullying and trolling.”His team trained a machine learning algorithm to spot words and phrases associated with bullying on social media site AskFM, which allows users to ask and answer questions. It managed to detect and block almost two-thirds of insults within almost 114,000 posts in English and was more accurate than a simple keyword search. Still, it did struggle with sarcastic remarks.Abusive speech is notoriously difficult to detect because people use offensive language for all sorts of reasons, and some of the nastiest comments do not use offensive words. Researchers at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, are training algorithms to detect hate speech by teaching them how specific communities on Reddit target women, black people and those who are overweight by using specific words.The tool was able to pinpoint less obvious abuse, such as words like &ldquo;animals&rdquo; which can be intended to have a dehumanising effect“My findings suggest that we need individual hate-speech filters for separate targets of hate speech,” says Haji Saleem, who is one of those leading the research. Impressively, the tool was more accurate than one simply trained to spot keywords and was also able to pinpoint less obvious abuse, such as words like “animals” which can be intended to have a dehumanising effect.The exercise in detecting online bullying is far from merely academic. Take social media giants like Instagram. One survey in 2017 found that 42% of teenage users have experienced bullying on Instagram, the highest rate of all social media sites assessed in the study. In some extreme cases, distressed users have killed themselves. And it isn’t just teenagers who are being targeted – Queen guitarist Brian May is among those to have been attacked on Instagram.“It’s made me look again at those stories of kids being bullied to the point of suicide by social media posts from their ‘friends’, who have turned on them,” May said at the time. “I now know firsthand what it’s like to feel you’re in a safe place, being relaxed and open and unguarded, and then, on a word, to be suddenly be ripped into.” Instagram is now using AI-powered text and image recognition to detect bullying in photos, videos and captions. While the company has been using a “bullying filter” to hide toxic comments since 2017, it recently began using machine learning to detect attacks on users’ appearance or character, in split-screen photographs, for example. It also looks for threats against individuals that appear in photographs and captions.Getty ImagesOnline bullies can target people from behind a veil of anonymity provided by the internet while victims can face hatred from complete strangers (Credit: Getty Images)Instagram says that actively identifying and removing this material is a crucial measure as many victims of bullying do not report it themselves. It also allows action to be taken against those who repeatedly post offending content. Even with these measures, however, the most scheming bullies can still create anonymous “hate pages” to target their victims and send hurtful direct messages.But bullying exists offline too, and in many forms. Recent revelations of sexual harassment within major technology firms in Silicon Valley have shone a light on how bullying and discrimination can impact people in the workplace. Almost half of women have experienced some form of discrimination while working in the European tech industry. Can technology offer a solution here too?A timestamped record of an incident around when it occurred could make it harder to cast doubt upon evidence later drawn from memoryOne attempt to do this is Spot – an intelligent chatbot that aims to help victims report their accounts of workplace harassment accurately and securely. It produces a time-stamped interview that a user can keep for themselves or submit to their employer, anonymously if necessary. The idea is to “turn a memory into evidence”, says Julia Shaw, a psychologist at University College London and co-creator of Spot.A time-stamped record of an incident around when it occurred could make it harder to cast doubt upon evidence later drawn from memory, as critics of Christine Blasey Ford attempted to do after she gave testimony against Brett Kavanaugh.Another tool named Botler AI goes one step further by providing advice to people who have been sexually harassed. Trained on more than 300,000 US and Canadian court case documents, it uses natural language processing to assess whether a user has been a victim of sexual harassment in the eyes of the law, and generates an incident report, which a user can hand over to human resources or the police. The first version was live for six months and achieved 89% accuracy.“One of our users was sexually assaulted by a politician and said the tool gave her the confidence she needed and empowered her to take action,” says Amir Moravej, Botler AI founder. “She began legal proceedings and the case is ongoing.”Getty ImagesRevelations about sexual harassment and discrimination at high profile technology companies in Silicon Valley have triggered protests and walk outs by staff (Credit: Getty Images)AI could not only help to stamp out bullying, it could save lives too. Some 3,000 people around the world take their own lives each day. That’s one death every 40 seconds. But predicting if someone is at risk of suicide is notoriously difficult.While factors such as someone’s background might offer some clues, there is no single risk factor that is a strong predictor of suicide. What makes it even more challenging to predict is that mental health practitioners often have to look at evidence and assess risk in a five-minute phone call. But intelligent machines could help.The algorithms were able to predict whether a patient would attempt to end their life in the week following an instance of self-harm“AI can gather a lot of information and put it together quickly, which could be helpful in looking at multiple risk factors,” says Martina Di Simplicio, a clinical senior lecturer in psychiatry at Imperial College London in the UK.  Scientists at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Florida State University trained machine learning algorithms to look at the health records of patients who self-harm. The algorithms were able to predict whether a patient would attempt to end their life in the week following an instance of self-harm, with an accuracy of 92%.“We can develop algorithms that rely only on data already collected routinely at point of care to predict risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours,” says Colin Walsh, assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, who led the study.While the study offers hope that mental health specialists will have another tool to help them protect those at risk in the future, there is work to be done.“The algorithms developed in this study can fairly accurately address the question of who will attempt suicide, but not when someone will die,” say the researchers. “Although accurate knowledge of who is at risk of eventual suicide attempt is still critically important to inform clinical decisions about risk, it is not sufficient to determine imminent risk.”Getty ImagesAlgorithms that can search for the signs of bullying on social media can help to highlight perpetrators so they can be stopped (Credit: Getty Images)Another study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was able to identify individuals who were having suicidal thoughts with 91% accuracy. They asked 34 participants to think of 30 specific concepts relating to positive or negative aspects of life and death while they scanned their brains using an fMRI machine. They then used a machine learning algorithm to spot “neural signatures” for these concepts.The researchers discovered differences in how healthy and suicidal people thought about concepts including “death” and being “carefree”. The computer was able to discriminate with 94% accuracy between nine people experiencing suicidal thoughts who had made a suicide attempt and eight who had not, by looking at these differences.“People with suicidal ideation have an activation of the emotion of shame, but that wasn’t so for the controls [healthy participants],” says Marcel Just, director of the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging at Carnegie Mellon University. He believes that one day therapists could use this information to design a personalised treatment for someone having suicidal thoughts, perhaps working with them to feel less shame associated with death.While such tailored treatments might sound futuristic, search and social media giants are trying to identify people in crisis. For example, when someone types a query into Google related to attempting suicide, the search engine offers them the help line of a charity such as The Samaritans instead of what they were looking for.Facebook last year began to use AI to identify posts from people who might be at risk of suicide. Other social media sites, including Instagram, have also begun exploring how AI can tackle the sharing of images of self-harm and suicide-related posts.In serious cases, Facebook may contact local authorities and has worked with first responders to carry out more than 1,000 wellness checks so farFacebook trained their algorithms to identify patterns of words in both the main post and the comments that follow to help confirm cases of suicidal expression. These are combined with other details such as whether messages are posted in the early hours of the morning. All this data is funnelled into another algorithm that is able to work out whether a Facebook user’s post should be reviewed by Facebook’s Community Operations team, which can raise the alarm if it thinks someone is at risk.Getty ImagesSocial media posts and mobile phone data can identify mood changes that could help to predict if someone might try to take their own life (Credit: Getty Images)In serious cases, Facebook may contact local authorities and has worked with first responders to carry out more than 1,000 wellness checks so far.“We’re not doctors, and we’re not trying to make a mental health diagnosis,” explains Dan Muriello, an engineer on the team that produced the tools. “We’re trying to get information to the right people quickly.”Facebook is not the only one analysing text and behaviour to predict whether someone may be experiencing mental health problems. Maria Liakata, an associate professor at the UK’s University of Warwick, is working on detecting mood changes from social media posts, text messages and mobile phone data.“The idea is to be able to passively monitor… and predict mood changes and people at risk reliably,” she says. She hopes that the technology could be incorporated into an app that’s able to read messages on a user’s phone.While this approach could raise privacy concerns, thousands of people are already willingly sharing their deepest thoughts with AI apps in a bid to tackle depression, which is one predictor of suicide. Mobile apps like Woebot and Wysa allow users to talk through their problems with a bot that responds in ways that have been approved for treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy.In the same way, machines may also be able to help intervene and stamp out bullying too. But until AI perfects a way of detecting the most subtle and cunning bullying tactics, the responsibility will still lie with us.“It can’t just be computers doing the whole fight,” says Nikki Mattocks.Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

  Don’t Let Artificial Intelligence Pick Your Employees



A Stanford GSB scholar shares why algorithms aren’t sophisticated enough to make these strategic decisions ... yet.

In 2014, Amazon launched a new recruitment algorithm to help it find the best job candidates. A year into the experiment, the company saw that the tool was biased against women and quietly shut the program down. When Reuters broke the story last October, John Jersin, the product leader for LinkedIn Talent Solutions, offered his thoughts on the general landscape of algorithmic hiring: “I certainly would not trust any AI system today to make a hiring decision on its own,” he said. “The technology is just not ready yet.”
Implicit in his comment is the notion that, someday, these systems will be ready. But work by Adina Sterling, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business, questions this optimism, linking it to a deep — and deeply problematic — misconception of hiring’s strategic role.
In a new paper coauthored with Daniel W. Elfenbein of Washington University in St. Louis and published in Strategy Science, Sterling articulates how smart hiring is inextricable from long-term corporate strategy; she also explains why delegating the responsibility of hiring to machines, at least in the near future, is likely to undermine its strategic potential.
“With technology increasingly stepping into this role, we’re at a moment in which these questions of higher-level strategy ought to be of great importance,” she says.
From Monster.com to Algorithmic Hiring
The use of machines in hiring became widespread roughly a quarter-century back, when career platforms like Monster.com emerged on the web. These websites allowed companies to speed up the pace and expand the scale of recruitment. Job posts that once might have fielded 20 applicants were suddenly flooded with 200 in a matter of minutes. “The vast majority of the work since then has been focused on this sourcing side,” Sterling says. “It’s been about filling up the pool with applicants that you think you need and separating them from the ones you don’t.”
Today, between 65% and 70% of all job applications are touched first by a machine. After an initial culling, the best-fit candidates are then, in most cases, handed off to a human. And while computers are getting better at understanding information, and while the availability of information is exploding from our online footprints, the relatively strict filtration offered by most sourcing algorithms creates a problem. “It’s becoming much harder to find unusual talent, given these candidates don’t fit squarely into one category,” Sterling says. Consider somebody with a background in improv comedy applying for a sales job: A hiring manager might recognize potential; a computer likely wouldn’t.

At the same time, the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence is slowly expanding its purview from sourcing into actual selection. While not widespread, the development of this practice at-scale is on the horizon. “And yet handing sourcing and selection off to machines is a fundamental problem if we start to understand hiring as truly strategic,” Sterling says. “There is still a lot that human beings do that has to do with strategy, and scholars need to think through what strategic managers should be doing in the context of hiring.”
Hiring as Strategy
To claim hiring as strategic, Sterling and Elfenbein first define what they mean by this term. A decision is strategic, they say, when it meets four criteria:
Irreversibility: Irreversibility means that once a decision is made the stakeholders are committed to each other, choices available to competitors are irrevocably changed, and some options are necessarily foreclosed while others are opened.
Interdependency: This implies that the benefit of one decision is contingent on relative alignment or complementarity with other decisions made elsewhere in the company. In this regard, interdependency places a premium on knowledge sharing and coordination among decision makers.
Competition: Competition means that competitors’ responses influence the value of different alternatives. Decision makers must thus put themselves in the shoes of these competitors and forecast how they might react to each alternative across many imagined futures.
Learning under uncertainty: Companies account for the uncertainty inherent in hiring; they hire not just to execute a new job, but also with an eye to learning new knowledge and getting connected to new people, communities, customers, and suppliers.
After conducting a series of interviews with hiring managers, AI and machine learning experts, and personnel-technology start-up executives, Sterling and Elfenbein argue that each of these conditions applies to hiring, and so it ought to be considered strategic. “And things that you can program or automate — in other words, what machines are already doing in hiring — are not the strategic aspects of hiring. The strategic aspects encompass attending to those four elements,” Sterling says.
Hiring strategically thus means thinking not just about any one applicant’s skills — the “best athlete” approach — but about how to holistically and consistently source talent and integrate it into the organization. It also means sticking with this human capital strategy over the long term, since these are commitments that cannot be reversed without cost.
In short, hiring is not a one-off search for the most suitable candidate for a specific job, but a process akin to filling a roster. Hiring demands a global view of the company and its direction within a shifting market. Computers do not possess such a view.
The Role of AI
This is not to say that hiring algorithms should be discarded. But their role within any HR department, says Sterling, needs to be squared with the strategic centrality of deciding whom a company employs. This means two things.
First, hiring managers need to take a careful look at what’s under the hood of the algorithms they have in place. “There are a lot of filters that any given applicant pool has gone through that managers may have no idea about,” she says. “And while algorithms are efficient, they often lose nuance that may have been present 10 years ago when AI was not as prevalent.” Consider, again, the sales candidate who excels at improv.
Second, after determining whether these filters need to be adjusted, managers should think about the concrete value of their hiring algorithm. Yes, it sorts résumés quickly. But what else does it do? And what does it not do? They should then fit these insights into broader consideration of the company and its strategic trajectory. How might a blind algorithm support or hinder this movement?
“I would love managers to have the sense that they’re held accountable for what algorithms are doing,” Sterling says. “They should, at the very least, understand that this is a responsibility of theirs.”

Titled Memories of Passersby I, Mario Klingemann’s groundbreaking installation comprises a wooden console table which hosts an AI computer ‘brain’, and two framed screens upon which the machine’s output – disquieting portraits of imagined masculine and feminine faces – blur hypnotically into focus. Differing from the finalised human-curated products of AI which have previously been exhibited or sold at auction, this is the first complete AI model, and only the second ‘AI artwork’, ever to appear on the market.

A remarkable technological feat, the interminable flow of images presented does not follow a predefined choreography, but is instead the result of the AI interpreting its own unique output in real-time; the machine contains all the algorithms that enable it to generate a new and never-repeating combination of portraits for as long as it is running.



The autonomous AI computer ‘brain’ consists of a system of neural networks very similar to those of the human brain. The neural network is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements (neurones) which cannot be programmed to perform a specific task, but instead learn by example.
Neurography
Klingemann has been exploring the potential of what he calls “neurography” for many years. Many of his recent creations have been made with a technique called generative adversarial networks (GANs) which place two algorithms in competition with one another.
On one side of the algorithm is the Generator, which makes a new image based on photographs of portraits from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. On the other side is The Discriminator, which tries to spot the difference between the human-made image and images created by the Generator. The aim is to fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real.
Portrait of a Man 3 – image © Sotheby’s/Mario Klingemann
There are three editions of the work and two artist’s proofs, but as each edition is constantly working to envisage unique portraits, no two will ever be the same.



Having previously drawn comparisons to the work of Francis Bacon, the conjured faces have been influenced by portraits from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, as well as by Klingemann’s own penchant for surrealist works by figures including Max Ernst. Describing the work, the artist explains:
“Memories of Passersby I houses a very powerful machine which creates paintings while you look at them, which I think is quite magical. Neural networks are involved, and you could say that they are the brushes that I’ve learned to use. The machine is in a cycle where it continuously creates new faces that start changing and fading away – it observes itself and creates a feedback loop. Of course, it’s hard for me let it out into the world without me by its side, but I trust that it’s ready to keep creating new portraits forever, as I always hoped it would do. I hope that when people sit and watch these fleeting faces pass by, they will get the same feeling I do”.

Marina Ruiz Colomer, Contemporary Art Specialist and Head of Sotheby’s Contemporary Art Day Auction, says:
“In seeking to subvert more traditional processes of creation, Klingemann’s work presents a truly amazing opportunity to watch an AI brain think in real time, as the machine creates brand new portraits pixel by pixel. To offer a cutting edge piece of technology such as this, which has the power to generate haunting portraits reminiscent of past Masters, is truly unprecedented. It is the nature of Contemporary Art to push boundaries – boundaries which have been, and will continue to be, redefined for centuries. AI art is the latest innovation winning its place in art history books, and Klingemann’s work stands on the precipice of an exciting new era in our field.”
Memories of Passersby I will be part of the Contemporary Art Day Auction on 6th March 2019, and carries an estimate of £30,000-40,000.

From major advancements in medicine to transforming the way business is conducted, machine learning shows great potential to improve the quality of our lives in a variety of ways. A behind-the-scenes look into different companies’ AI ventures shows that certain aspects of machine learning even aid in making the world a safer place.Manufacturing problems can have serious negative impacts on a business. From cars to home appliances, product safety is of utmost importance when it comes to customer satisfaction. Products that cause safety concerns as a result of poor manufacturing or maintenance can lead to extremely negative publicity, and even cost a company millions in lawsuits and legal issues.It is a manufacturer’s legal duty to sell products that are not defective, and the United States has laws in place to protect consumers from negligent manufacturing. The Levin Firm states that products can be defective in three primary ways: defective design, defective assembly, or failure to warn. If any of these cause serious injury to a consumer, the manufacturer can be found negligent and will likely be deemed responsible for any losses the victim incurs.Top 4 Most Popular Ai Articles:1. Are you using the term ‘AI’ incorrectly?2. Six AI Subscriptions to keep you Informed3. TOP 100 medium articles related with Artificial Intelligence4. Making a Simple Neural NetworkImproving Product SafetyThe many advancements in AI are proving useful to reduce manufacturing negligence, and produce safer products for consumers.Automobile manufacturers are also using analytics for indicators to improve vehicle safety. As stated by Amit Saha, Watson Solution Architect for IBM, “Auto manufacturers can now isolate and pinpoint the cause of safety issues through data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through basic out-of-the-box analysis tools.” This data is publicly available, and data-driven approaches can lead to “faster issue detection, problem resolution, competitive advantages, and improved product design.”In the energy sector too, AI is making waves when it comes to improving safety. According to the Forbes article referenced above, Global energy leader BP is using technology to drive new levels of performance, as well as improve the safety and reliability of oil and gas production and refining: “From sensors that relay the conditions at each site to using AI technology to improve operations, BP puts data at the fingertips of engineers, scientists and decision-makers to help drive high performance.”Predictive MaintenanceManufacturing and ongoing maintenance is a huge expense for companies. These expenses have a critical impact on the bottom line for any asset-reliant production process. As quoted from an article on CIO, “studies show that unplanned downtime costs manufacturers an estimated $50 billion annually, and that asset failure is the cause of 42 percent of this unplanned downtime.”Fortunately, AI technology can lower these costs. AI makes “predictive maintenance” of products very possible. Predictive maintenance uses AI to form predictions about asset malfunction. this allows for reductions in unplanned downtime, and more importantly, extends the remaining useful life of production machines and equipment. Subsequently, companies are able to manufacture safer and longer-lasting final products.One such example is Volvo’s use of AI, as stated in a Forbes article. They use data generated by its cars to predict when parts will fail or when a certain vehicle needs servicing. Volvo also is able to monitor vehicle performance during hazardous conditions. In this way, the company has maintained an impressive safety record.AI-Assisted Product Marketing & DesignFrom a product’s inception to the way it is marketed, AI tools can be used to streamline processes and improve both company efficiency and customer satisfaction. Pepperdine University explains how automation changes the focus of marketing efforts: “Creative work, personal communication, and delivering value to customers through content will take greater importance as automation increases in functional ability.”Because marketers are free to focus on creating genuine connections with consumers, personalization (and even hyper-personalization) has begun to play a much larger role in digital marketing. This enables companies to devote more resources to product safety and to tout new safety features in their marketing efforts.AI also allows for products are also able to be designed better. Designers and engineers to to input detailed briefs that include restrictions, material parameters, available production methods, budget limitations, and many other variables into an AI algorithm. The algorithm then explores every possible permutation before suggesting the best and most viable solution based on the brief details.To gain even more insight, the proposed solutions can be tested to determine which design works best. Through a process of repetition, the use of AI algorithms in design ensures that an optimal product design solution is reached, reducing the likelihood of unexpected safety issues cropping up at a later time.Transforming Customer ServiceLast but not least, the role AI plays in customer service also contributes to product safety. One of the most widespread uses of AI is in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants. In fact, AI excels at meeting a customer’s needs both efficiently and accurately. Virtual assistants can mimic our brain’s cognitive functions — especially those that deal with learning and solving problems.Experts at HelpOnClick write, “This allows virtual assistants to categorize information and narrow down correct answers for each customer query.” Virtual assistants and live chat capabilities have made it possible to greatly scale up customer service and produce honest consumer insights. This means, that as a consumer, one is able to lodge a complaint, give feedback, or point out a safety issue at any time from anywhere in the world.Unlike humans who are limited by work hours and time zones, virtual assistants and live chats can provide assistance 24/7, ensuring that a consumer is well attended to. If used properly and in conjunction with maintenance processes, the data gained from virtual assistants allows for consumer-realized safety concerns to be promptly addressed and subsequently prevented in future production.Unfortunately, even with all it’s benefits, AI is often misunderstood. There are many skeptics and cynics out there who believe that AI is just a fad or, even worse, out to completely replace humans. On the contrary, AI has the potential to augment current human processes and thus improve our livelihood. As evidenced from the examples above, by fully and correctly embracing AI into our lives, we can surely make the world a safer place.Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",https://becominghuman.ai/how-ai-can-improve-product-safety-820d391775d3,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",https://becominghuman.ai/how-ai-can-improve-product-safety-820d391775d3,2019-02-08T14:35:41.471Z,2019-02-08T14:35:41.471Z,2021-12-07T10:57:05.956Z,,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*GeSPJfdUq2VqL4xGL_3ObQ.jpeg'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Noah Rue', 'url': 'https://becominghuman.ai/@nyrue24'}",How AI Can Improve Product Safety - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,,,,['Noah Rue'],,820d391775d3,,,

Artificial intelligence (AI) in business is rapidly becoming a commonly-used competitive tool. Clearly, companies are past debating the pros and cons of AI. From better chatbots for customer service to data analytics to making predictive recommendations, deep learning and artificial intelligence in their many forms is seen by business leaders as an essential tool.
That puts AI in the short-list of technologies that your company should not just be watching, but actively exploring how to take advantage of. It joins leading emerging technologies like Machine Learning, cloud computing and Big Data.
If you aren’t convinced that AI is ready to handle a growing number and range of tasks, consider IBM’s Watson’s 2011 winning performance on Jeopardy. Or consider the various ways you are likely already using AI-enabled devices and services in your personal life, like smart assistant apps or devices like Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri. Not to mention other AI-supercharged apps, such as whatever GPS app you use while driving.
Here’s a quick look at how your competitors are already using AI in their business, and some advice on how to get on board.

Results of a recent survey indicate that artificial intelligence can assist businesses in areas ranging from customer support to personalization.
 Examine How Your Competitors are Using AI
Odds are you can’t just call up your competitors and ask how they are using AI in their company. But thanks to the Internet, you can find out a lot of what they have said. For example, web-searching “how is Staples using AI” yields informative results from about how that company is putting artificial intelligence technology to work for itself.
Next, check your competitors’ web sites and social media presences (notably LinkedIn and Facebook). Browse their press releases, news coverage, and blogs. You might even go old-school, and get any hardcopy newsletters, annual reports or other literature from the past year that might not be available online.
Then cast a wider net, with an industry search, like “how are hospitals using AI,” “how are grocery stores using AI,” or even a more general search.
For example, when I did a search for “using AI in my business,” I got various hits talking about  business uses for AI including:

Improve customer decision management


Improve QA for software and manufacturing


Write code


Read medical imaging such as head CT scans.

Another suggestion: research how other parts of your supply chain – parts, shipping, support, and the like – are using AI.
Don’t forget other IRL (In Real Life)/non-digital avenues. If you are going to an industry event, look for AI-related sessions. Chat up whoever you’re standing or sitting near. And, of course, you could always read a book or two – although, by definition, that advice will be at least six to twelve months out of date.
If you know anybody at one or more competitors who’s informed and amenable, buy them a lunch and pick their brain.

Businesses have high hopes that AI can help them predict a wide array of activities. 
 Decide what AI Can Do for Your Business
Based on your research, you should be able to build a list and frame a sense of what AI can do for businesses in general, and for companies in your industry and of your size.
You’ll find several major key areas:

Types of AI technology, like machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and cognitive computing. Understanding what these are and the different types of data and tasks each is good for should help you get a better grasp on AI, and understand the requirements and limits of various goals.


What kinds of processing AI can do used for, such as image and speech recognition, predictive analytics. This will help give you a general sense of what AI is being put to use for, not just by businesses, but also government, education, science and other researchers, and others.


Use Cases: what specific tasks these capabilities can help with, such as smart agents (for phone, chatbots, and more), optimizing inventory orders, anticipating machine or system failures, identifying computer threats, spotting fraudulent customer activity.

Based on this list, your next step is to come up with a short list of how artificial intelligence can help your business – specific tasks and use cases.
To help make this list:

Decide what kinds of benefits you are looking for – improved employee productivity? faster workflow? improved product productivity? Reducing costs?


Target time frame.

Then, prioritize that list based on a mix of estimated costs, time to implement, risk/benefit, and overall value.
In parallel, select one or two smaller tasks for trying artificial intelligence for your business. This could be a small piece of a larger task. Important: start with a task that is not business-critical. Another quick tip: Start with tasks that aren’t customer-facing.
 Search for and Compare Vendors
Now it’s time to identify potential technology vendors. There is no shortage of top artificial intelligence companies.
In order to find and compare vendors, you first have to assess how you might add artificial intelligence capabilities to your company’s IT, which in turn depends on factors like:

Size and depth of your IT staff (and budget). Do you already have any AI expertise in-house? Are there developers (along with QA and Ops) who can add AI chops? Does your IT staff have the time and resources to add AI to your existing business IT? To research, propose, and develop new AI-based business initiatives?


Do any of your IT providers offer AI extensions, modules, tools, features, etc.

Vendors for AI capabilities spans several categories:

Vendors that have added AI capabilities to their offerings. This includes everyone from Amazon, Apple and Google to IBM, Intel, and SalesForce, so you’ll need to decide whether you are planning to do this with hardware you own/buy, or cloud resources (or both).


Vendors of specific AI capabilities, accessed through APIs or other methods.

For some of the AI you’re looking for, your current vendors may already offer. In other cases, you may outsource. For still others, you may end up doing internally. It all depends on what you want, how much developer bandwidth you have in-house, and how you provision your IT operations.
Your best bet will be to find one or more AI experts, either internally, or outside consultants. For the latter, start with ones who aren’t part of a vendor… unless the vendor is offering AI that is a match for your criteria.
 Implement the AI Project
Once you have identified your initial AI projects the real fun begins: implementation. Essential milestones:

First, you need to put together a plan, stating the specific and general goals, milestones scheduling, estimated hard and soft costs, and the resources needed, including people skills, hardware and software.


Identify who will be impacted, including existing resources, suppliers, users/customers. Be aware of who should benefit, along with including possible negative impact during implementation.


Set goals for the project’s benefits. This includes determining how to measure results, and, if possible, how to A/B compare the AI-enabled approach and the prior methodologies.


Don’t forget to include talking to the stakeholders, including users/customers. Ask their thoughts, preferences and suggestions, along with plans for training documents and sessions as the trials and operational versions become ready.

Key: Be ready to revisit constantly.
Just because you have AI projects out of development and testing, and contributing to your business, that doesn’t mean you’re done. Just as provisioning infrastructure or updating your company’s web and social presence is never done.
In addition to tracking your selected AI vendors for improvements, new features you want to stay on top of other AI developments. For example, what new capabilities have become available? What improvements in infrastructure performance or price make existing or new AI offerings now viable?
And, of course, you want to keep up with what others in your industry, and the AI vendors serving your industry, are doing or have on their road map.
 Challenges and Pitfalls to Avoid
Adding AI your company’s operations and business is a big change, and likely a big transformation. Here’s some quick advice to lessen the challenges:

Understand how the AI you’re buying works. What are its strengths? Weaknesses?


What kind of IT environment does the AI require? More RAM? Newer hardware-level virtualization? Different memory or I/O, like moving to NVMe, or hyperconverged infrastructure?


Are you feeding your AI apps too much data? Too little? The wrong data? Are you asking them the right questions?


Look for AI tools that will give clear, actionable alerts or other results, rather than endless pages of mostly-unimportant findings.

Plus, focus on AI that’s available as a supported product/service, rather than something still in development.
 Future Trends to Watch
Although AI as an area within computer science dates back to the 1950’s, it’s only been within the past decade that many types of AI have become available to companies of all sizes.
This is thanks to factors like continuing hardware price/performance improvements, cloud computing, and advances in AI techniques. At the same time, computing trends like big data, IoT, self-driving vehicles, and speech and image recognition are generating more “targets” to point AI tools at.
In particular, Keep an eye on cloud costs and capabilities, along with what the various players are doing or talking about, AI-wise. Like nearly everything involving computer technology, many of the next cool capabilities can’t be anticipated or predicted. Bottom line: talk to professionals in your field – nothing will help you quite as much.
