The recent launch of ChatGPT, a chatbot created by Open AI for public use, has underscored the growing reach of digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) in working life.As with most technological revolutions that affect the workplace, chatbots can potentially create winners and losers and will affect both blue-collar and white-collar workers.To maximize economic gains and minimize the potential negative impact on workers, policymakers need to act in the interests of all of society. And those in developing countries need to step up the pace in preparation for such technologies or risk falling further behind.ChatGPT shows the promise of AIChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) tool that allows users to interact with the GPT-3 model using natural language. The model is trained on a massive amount of data, which allows it to generate human-like responses to a wide variety of inputs.You can ask this bot to perform various tasks. Some of the paragraphs in this article, – while still needing some editing – were written by the chatbot, using requests such as “What is ChatGPT?” and “What are the potential uses and benefits of technologies like ChatGPT?”.Technologies like GPT-3 still have limitations. These include incorrect responses, lack of updated information and access to the internet – and the potential for bias in algorithms on issues such as race and gender.For example, we asked the chatbot its suggestions to mitigate some of the limiting factors, and the results show instances where AI does not go beyond commonplace solutions (see the table below).   Limitations of AI technologies and mitigation steps suggested by ChatGPTLimitations of AI technologiesPossible mitigation measuresPossible mistakes and inaccurate or inappropriate responsesDevelop and implement regulations and guidelinesRequires technological infrastructure and expertiseInvest in education and training programmesEthical concernsDevelop and implement regulations and guidelinesMay exacerbate existing inequalities and the digital divideFoster collaboration and partnerships among businesses, organizations and individuals to share knowledge, expertise and resourcesSource: Table generated by ChatGPT on 14 December 2022.Work will never be the sameDespite limitations, this type of AI can greatly benefit the productivity of skilled workers.Chatbots offer the possibility to automate tedious and time-consuming tasks, such as writing standardized reports, meeting minutes and emails. Workers could therefore be freed to focus on more critical and creative tasks. A chatbot virtual personal assistant could guide skilled workers through different projects or production processes. It can also generate original content and ideas, and potentially help to research and develop new products and services.Moreover, tools like ChatGPT are an appealing and cost-effective choice for businesses and individuals looking to use the capabilities of AI without the need for additional, costly equipment.Siri (developed by Apple), Alexa (by Amazon) and Google Assistant are three well-known human-like AI assistants that often require a slew of related products, such as an iPhone, echo dot or google devices. Despite not having voice processing capabilities, ChatGPT is more affordable: access to the internet and basic literacy are sufficient to make it work.Potential winners and losersBut tools such as ChatGPT presents a real risk of skilled and semi-skilled workers losing their jobs.For example, chatbots can be developed to train employees in an organization, resulting in the redundancy of human trainers.Previous waves of technological change have created both winners and losers. Workers who are quicker to adjust to technological change will gain by increasingly taking on tasks complementary to AI while abandoning automated ones. And the great potential for the creation of new jobs is in innovation using tools like ChatGPT to bring new goods and services to the market.For example, several new jobs associated with frontier technologies emerged in the past few years, from social media managers to drone pilots. But these adjustments will take time, and the breakneck speed of changes that can come with cheap AI personal assistants may significantly impact office workers.Barriers for developing countriesThis technology’s impact is not restricted to work in advanced economies.With gig work and digital transformation, the expectation was that some skilled workers in developing countries were getting ready to compete for more skill-intensive jobs around the world as “telemigrants” in jobs such as accountants, legal clerks, software developers, or even X-ray analysts. The risk is that these jobs will be taken by the ChatGPTs of the world.Moreover, most firms and workers in developing countries may not be able to take advantage of this personal use of AI to increase productivity.Most high-income countries and some upper middle-income countries have the highest potential to benefit from these AI technologies, given that they are above average in the availability of high-skilled labour and internet download speed, as a proxy of the quality of digital infrastructure (see the graph below). On the opposite end of the spectrum, low-income and most lower middle-income countries are in the worst situation to take advantage of these technologies, given their low share of skilled workers and relatively slow download speed.Your browser does not support JavaScript!Developing economies generally lag in the adoption of digital technologies and risk repeating this pattern with the latest frontier technologies.An UNCTAD readiness index that assesses countries’ abilities to use, adopt and adapt frontier technologies highlights the leading position of developed economies, showing that developing countries still struggle with issues like digital skills and infrastructure, and research and development.The way forwardUltimately, developing countries need to prepare to benefit from AI by promoting the technology's use, adoption, adaptation and development. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy on how this could be done. But generally, it requires actions in four main areas.First, we need to continue preparing the workforce for work in the twenty-first century. This means developing digital skills and building and strengthening complementary skills such as complex problem solving, critical thinking and creativity.Second, we need to take care of those who will lose in the transition to new forms of work. Reskilling programmes should be part of government policies and programmes to address job loss due to new technologies. Life-long learning initiatives, involving the training and re-training of workers, are increasingly the joint responsibility of governments, employers and workers.Third, we need to promote inclusiveness and broadly share the benefits of this powerful technology. For this, we need to promote an open innovation approach for AI, in which inputs, methods and results of the innovation are shared openly with different people who could use them for further innovation. And fourth, the impact of frontier technologies will be felt by all, but not all are participating equally in defining the path that frontier technologies like AI will follow. It is critical to establish ethical frameworks and regulations for these technologies.

Thinking about using ChatGPT at work? Proceed with caution.

ChatGPT's beta launch exceeded 1 million users in less than a week, attracting the attention of almost everyone in the entire tech ecosystem. I read articles about it in the New York Times, the Financial Times and The Atlantic, three top media sources in my books.


The AI garners work-place buzz under the possibility that its generation is so effective, it might pose a threat to human jobs such as copywriting, answering customer service inquiries, writing news reports, and creating legal documents.

In actuality, there’s more nuance to how we consider the potential applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), and generative AI like ChatGPT to the workplace—especially where the reliability of information is paramount.

PROMOTED
I met with the executive team at Hebbia AI, a startup leading research efforts on LLMs, to dig in. I connected with the company’s CEO George Sivulka, and Lainie Yallen, a former student of mine at McGill who is leading product, to share their perspective on ChatGPT's recent attention and discuss how it can be used in conjunction with other machine learning algorithms for workplace applications. 
When considering applying ChatGPT or any other generative model to work-related activities, it’s important to consider a fundamental limitation:
Generative AI models generate responses, they do not read sources, or cite their work. Thus, their output has no guarantee of reliability.

To use a generative model in the workplace, it is critical to feed these models with facts and cited information so that answers are based on research and not inference.
Semantic search models apply Large Language Models (LLMs) to actually read and retrieve sources.
While one application of LLMs is generative AI such as ChatGPT, LLMs can also be applied to semantic search like Hebbia.
In the semantic search context, the models function as ""neural"" search engines, retrieving answers based on the semantic meaning of a query, rather than simply matching keywords as traditional search engines do.
For example, an analyst searching for “trends"" would expect to find facts related to the industry, customers, competitors, and growth in a 10-K report. Only a semantic search engine like Hebbia could support that behavior. Keyword search might yield results about company valuations.
Discriminative AI systems, like semantic search, can find meaning in questions and answers, and cite factual evidence and data.
When applying generative AI to search in the workplace, it ought to be coupled with semantic search to be used credibly.
Generative models can and should leverage semantic search ""memory"" in order to address the shortcomings of generative models alone. When semantic search and Generative AI work together, they can improve the accuracy, trustworthiness, and ease of keeping research up to date.
When generative AI and semantic search are used together, you can ensure that generative AI chatbot responding to a customer query is providing correct company information, and that responses being provided to answer a critical client question is based on the most up-to-date competitor information.
Put simply, semantic search improves the question-and-answer application of generative AI because:


Models can be primed with relevant primary sources
All sources and answers can be properly cited
These sources can be easily kept accurate and up to date via an index (without retraining models)


The future of work will have generative AI at its center. Companies who are able to leverage this technology appropriately will meaningfully improve their workflows by increasing speed of decisions and reducing costs of research.
Those who are too slow to adapt or choose to adopt generative AI alone without the technology needed to make it suitable for work (e.g., semantic search) will struggle to compete.
If you’re interested in generative AI and semantic search in your workplace, reach out to Hebbia and learn more about what they do. I believe they bring a critical dimension to this important conversation the world is jumping into.

He comes back to the store a week later complaining that it cuts down only two trees a day when he was told it would cut down 20. The service person says, “Well, let’s see what the trouble is,” and starts it up. The mountain man jumps back and asks, “What’s that noise?” (He’d been sawing without the engine on.)I feel like that mountain man when it comes to ChatGPT, the powerful new artificial intelligence chatbot that seemingly everyone is experimenting with. I got mediocre results from ChatGPT because I didn’t try very hard to use it properly. Other people have gotten amazing results because they’re smarter and more purposeful about how they use it — they yank its pull cord and get its engine going.I confess that my first idea was to figure out what ChatGPT could not do rather than what it could. It won’t offer opinions. It’s not up on anything that’s happened since it was trained last year. It doesn’t have a body so it has never been to Ireland. (One of my questions.)

On 24 November 2022, the European Committee on Legal Co-operation (CDCJ) approved the publication of a comparative study examining the interplay between artificial intelligence and administrative law, prepared by Prof. Dr. Johan Wolswinkel (Tilburg University, the Netherlands).
The study examines, on the basis of responses from 24 member States of the Council of Europe, the state of legislation regulating artificial intelligence (AI) in administrative decision-making, identifying general patterns and different approaches. Resort to AI in the public sector raises, a number of legal issues, including whether the existing rules and principles of administrative law are sufficient to regulate this new form of decision-making.
This study contributes to the work undertaken by a limited working group of the CDCJ (CDCJ-ADMIN-AI), and is aimed to support the reflections on future work of the Committee in this area, as well as the revision of the handbook “The Administration and You” .

Extracting information from textual data has changed dramatically over the past decade. As the term natural language processing has overtaken text mining as the name of the field, the methodology has changed tremendously, too. One of the main drivers of this change was the emergence of language models as a basis for many applications aiming to distill valuable insights from raw text.
Language Model DefinitionA language model uses machine learning to conduct a probability distribution over words used to predict the most likely next word in a sentence based on the previous entry. Language models learn from text and can be used for producing original text, predicting the next word in a text, speech recognition, optical character recognition and handwriting recognition.
In learning about natural language processing, I’ve been fascinated by the evolution of language models over the past years. You may have heard about GPT-3 and the potential threats it poses, but how did we get this far? How can a machine produce an article that mimics a journalist?
 
What Is a Language Model?
A language model is a probability distribution over words or word sequences. In practice, it gives the probability of a certain word sequence being “valid.” Validity in this context does not refer to grammatical validity. Instead, it means that it resembles how people write, which is what the language model learns. This is an important point. There’s no magic to a language model like other machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, it’s just a tool to incorporate abundant information in a concise manner that’s reusable in an out-of-sample context.

What Can a Language Model Do?
The abstract understanding of natural language, which is necessary to infer word probabilities from context, can be used for a number of tasks. Lemmatization or stemming aims to reduce a word to its most basic form, thereby dramatically decreasing the number of tokens. These algorithms work better if the part-of-speech role of the word is known. A verb’s postfixes can be different from a noun’s postfixes, hence the rationale for part-of-speech tagging (or POS-tagging), a common task for a language model.
With a good language model, we can perform extractive or abstractive summarization of texts. If we have models for different languages, a machine translation system can be built easily. Less straightforward use-cases include answering questions (with or without context, see the example at the end of the article). Language models can also be used for speech recognition, OCR, handwriting recognition and more. There’s a whole spectrum of opportunities.
 
Types of Language Models
There are two types of language models: 
Probabilistic methods.
Neural network-based modern language models
It’s important to note the difference between them.
 
Probabilistic Language Model
A simple probabilistic language model is constructed by calculating n-gram probabilities. An n-gram is an n word sequence, n being an integer greater than zero. An n-gram’s probability is the conditional probability that the n-gram’s last word follows a particular n-1 gram (leaving out the last word). It’s the proportion of occurrences of the last word following the n-1 gram leaving the last word out. This concept is a Markov assumption. Given the n-1 gram (the present), the n-gram probabilities (future) does not depend on the n-2, n-3, etc grams (past).
There are evident drawbacks of this approach. Most importantly, only the preceding n words affect the probability distribution of the next word. Complicated texts have deep context that may have decisive influence on the choice of the next word. Thus, what the next word is might not be evident from the previous n-words, not even if n is 20 or 50. A term has influence on a previous word choice: the word United is much more probable if it is followed by States of America. Let’s call this the context problem.
On top of that, it’s evident that this approach scales poorly. As size increases (n), the number of possible permutations skyrocket, even though most of the permutations never occur in the text. And all the occuring probabilities (or all n-gram counts) have to be calculated and stored. In addition, non-occurring n-grams create a sparsity problem, as in, the granularity of the probability distribution can be quite low. Word probabilities have few different values, therefore most of the words have the same probability.
 
Neural Network-Based Language Models
Neural network based language models ease the sparsity problem by the way they encode inputs. Word embedding layers create an arbitrary sized vector of each word that incorporates semantic relationships as well. These continuous vectors create the much needed granularity in the probability distribution of the next word. Moreover, the language model is a function, as all neural networks are with lots of matrix computations, so it’s not necessary to store all n-gram counts to produce the probability distribution of the next word.

Evolution of Language Models
Even though neural networks solve the sparsity problem, the context problem remains. First, language models were developed to solve the context problem more and more efficiently — bringing more and more context words to influence the probability distribution. Secondly, the goal was to create an architecture that gives the model the ability to learn which context words are more important than others.
The first model, which I outlined previously, is a dense (or hidden) layer and an output layer stacked on top of a continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) Word2Vec model. A CBOW Word2Vec model is trained to guess the word from context. A Skip-Gram Word2Vec model does the opposite, guessing context from the word. In practice, a CBOW Word2Vec model requires a lot of examples of the following structure to train it: the inputs are n words before and/or after the word, which is the output. We can see that the context problem is still intact.
 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are an improvement regarding this matter. Since RNNs can be either a long short-term memory (LSTM) or a gated recurrent unit (GRU) cell based network, they take all previous words into account when choosing the next word. AllenNLP’s ELMo takes this notion a step further, utilizing a bidirectional LSTM, which takes into account the context before and after the word counts.
 
Transformers
The main drawback of RNN-based architectures stems from their sequential nature. As a consequence, training times soar for long sequences because there is no possibility for parallelization. The solution for this problem is the transformer architecture.
The GPT models from OpenAI and Google’s BERT utilize the transformer architecture, as well. These models also employ a mechanism called “Attention,” by which the model can learn which inputs deserve more attention than others in certain cases.
In terms of model architecture, the main quantum leaps were firstly RNNs, specifically, LSTM and GRU, solving the sparsity problem and reducing the disk space language models use, and subsequently, the transformer architecture, making parallelization possible and creating attention mechanisms. But architecture is not the only aspect a language model can excel in.
Compared to the GPT-1 architecture, GPT-3 has virtually nothing novel. But it’s huge. It has 175 billion parameters, and it was trained on the largest corpus a model has ever been trained on in common crawl. This is partly possible because of the semi-supervised training strategy of a language model. A text can be used as a training example with some words omitted. The incredible power of GPT-3 comes from the fact that it has read more or less all text that has appeared on the internet over the past years, and it has the capability to reflect most of the complexity natural language contains.
 
Trained for Multiple Purposes
Finally, I’d like to review the T5 model from Google. Previously, language models were used for standard NLP tasks, like part-of-speech (POS) tagging or machine translation with slight modifications. With a little retraining, BERT can be a POS-tagger because of its abstract ability to understand the underlying structure of natural language. 
With T5, there is no need for any modifications for NLP tasks. If it gets a text with some <M> tokens in it, it knows that those tokens are gaps to fill with the appropriate words. It can also answer questions. If it receives some context after the questions, it searches the context for the answer. Otherwise, it answers from its own knowledge. Fun fact: It beat its own creators in a trivia quiz.

Future of Language Models
Personally, I think this is the field that we are closest to creating an AI. There’s a lot of buzz around AI, and many simple decision systems and almost any neural network are called AI, but this is mainly marketing. By definition, artificial intelligence involves human-like intelligence capabilities performed by a machine. While transfer learning shines in the field of computer vision, and the notion of transfer learning is essential for an AI system, the very fact that the same model can do a wide range of NLP tasks and can infer what to do from the input is itself spectacular. It brings us one step closer to actually creating human-like intelligence systems.

As this technology is transforming our lives, it should be in all of our interest to become informed and engaged.By: Max RoserDecember 15, 2022Cite this articleReuse our work freelyWhy should you care about the development of artificial intelligence?Think about what the alternative would look like. If you and the wider public do not get informed and engaged, then we leave it to a few entrepreneurs and engineers to decide how this technology will transform our world.That is the status quo. This small number of people at a few tech firms directly working on artificial intelligence (AI) do understand how extraordinarily powerful this technology is becoming. If the rest of society does not become engaged, then it will be this small elite who decides how this technology will change our lives.To change this status quo, I want to answer three questions in this article: Why is it hard to take the prospect of a world transformed by AI seriously? How can we imagine such a world? And what is at stake as this technology becomes more powerful?Why is it hard to take the prospect of a world transformed by artificial intelligence seriously?In some way, it should be obvious how technology can fundamentally transform the world. We just have to look at how much the world has already changed. If you could invite a family of hunter-gatherers from 20,000 years ago on your next flight, they would be pretty surprised. Technology has changed our world already, so we should expect that it can happen again.But while we have seen the world transform before, we have seen these transformations play out over the course of generations. What is different now is how very rapid these technological changes have become. In the past, the technologies that our ancestors used in their childhood were still central to their lives in their old age. This has not been the case anymore for recent generations. Instead, it has become common that technologies unimaginable in one's youth become ordinary in later life.This is the first reason we might not take the prospect seriously: it is easy to underestimate the speed at which technology can change the world.The second reason why it is difficult to take the possibility of transformative AI – potentially even AI as intelligent as humans – seriously is that it is an idea that we first heard in the cinema. It is not surprising that for many of us, the first reaction to a scenario in which machines have human-like capabilities is the same as if you had asked us to take seriously a future in which vampires, werewolves, or zombies roam the planet.1But, it is plausible that it is both the stuff of sci-fi fantasy and the central invention that could arrive in our, or our children’s, lifetimes.The third reason why it is difficult to take this prospect seriously is by failing to see that powerful AI could lead to very large changes. This is also understandable. It is difficult to form an idea of a future that is very different from our own time. There are two concepts that I find helpful in imagining a very different future with artificial intelligence. Let’s look at both of them.How to develop an idea of what the future of artificial intelligence might look like?When thinking about the future of artificial intelligence, I find it helpful to consider two different concepts in particular: human-level AI, and transformative AI.2 The first concept highlights the AI’s capabilities and anchors them to a familiar benchmark, while transformative AI emphasizes the impact that this technology would have on the world.From where we are today, much of this may sound like science fiction. It is therefore worth keeping in mind that the majority of surveyed AI experts believe there is a real chance that human-level artificial intelligence will be developed within the next decades, and some believe that it will exist much sooner.The advantages and disadvantages of comparing machine and human intelligenceOne way to think about human-level artificial intelligence is to contrast it with the current state of AI technology. While today’s AI systems often have capabilities similar to a particular, limited part of the human mind, a human-level AI would be a machine that is capable of carrying out the same range of intellectual tasks that we humans are capable of.3 It is a machine that would be “able to learn to do anything that a human can do,” as Norvig and Russell put it in their textbook on AI.4Taken together, the range of abilities that characterize intelligence gives humans the ability to solve problems and achieve a wide variety of goals. A human-level AI would therefore be a system that could solve all those problems that we humans can solve, and do the tasks that humans do today. Such a machine, or collective of machines, would be able to do the work of a translator, an accountant, an illustrator, a teacher, a therapist, a truck driver, or the work of a trader on the world’s financial markets. Like us, it would also be able to do research and science, and to develop new technologies based on that.The concept of human-level AI has some clear advantages. Using the familiarity of our own intelligence as a reference provides us with some clear guidance on how to imagine the capabilities of this technology.However, it also has clear disadvantages. Anchoring the imagination of future AI systems to the familiar reality of human intelligence carries the risk that it obscures the very real differences between them.Some of these differences are obvious. For example, AI systems will have the immense memory of computer systems, against which our own capacity to store information pales. Another obvious difference is the speed at which a machine can absorb and process information. But information storage and processing speed are not the only differences. The domains in which machines already outperform humans is steadily increasing: in chess, after matching the level of the best human players in the late 90s, AI systems reached superhuman levels more than a decade ago. In other games like Go or complex strategy games, this has happened more recently.5These differences mean that an AI that is at least as good as humans in every domain would overall be much more powerful than the human mind. Even the first “human-level AI” would therefore be quite superhuman in many ways.6Human intelligence is also a bad metaphor for machine intelligence in other ways. The way we think is often very different from machines, and as a consequence the output of thinking machines can be very alien to us.Most perplexing and most concerning are the strange and unexpected ways in which machine intelligence can fail. The AI-generated image of the horse below provides an example: on the one hand, AIs can do what no human can do – produce an image of anything, in any style (here photorealistic), in mere seconds – but on the other hand it can fail in ways that no human would fail.7 No human would make the mistake of drawing a horse with five legs.8Imagining a powerful future AI as just another human would therefore likely be a mistake. The differences might be so large that it will be a misnomer to call such systems “human-level.”AI-generated image of a horse9Transformative artificial intelligence is defined by the impact this technology would have on the worldIn contrast, the concept of transformative AI is not based on a comparison with human intelligence. This has the advantage of sidestepping the problems that the comparisons with our own mind bring. But it has the disadvantage that it is harder to imagine what such a system would look like and be capable of. It requires more from us. It requires us to imagine a world with intelligent actors that are potentially very different from ourselves.Transformative AI is not defined by any specific capabilities, but by the real-world impact that the AI would have. To qualify as transformative, researchers think of it as AI that is “powerful enough to bring us into a new, qualitatively different future.”10In humanity’s history, there have been two cases of such major transformations, the agricultural and the industrial revolutions.Transformative AI becoming a reality would be an event on that scale. Like the arrival of agriculture 10,000 years ago, or the transition from hand- to machine-manufacturing, it would be an event that would change the world for billions of people around the globe and for the entire trajectory of humanity’s future.Technologies that fundamentally change how a wide range of goods or services are produced are called ‘general-purpose technologies’. The two previous transformative events were caused by the discovery of two particularly significant general-purpose technologies: the change in food production as humanity transitioned from hunting and gathering to farming, and the rise of machine manufacturing in the industrial revolution. Based on the evidence and arguments presented in this series on AI development, I believe it is plausible that powerful AI could represent the introduction of a similarly significant general-purpose technology.Timeline of the three transformative events in world historyA future of human-level or transformative AI?The two concepts are closely related, but they are not the same. The creation of a human-level AI would certainly have a transformative impact on our world. If the work of most humans could be carried out by an AI, the lives of millions of people would change.11The opposite, however, is not true: we might see transformative AI without developing human-level AI. Since the human mind is in many ways a poor metaphor for the intelligence of machines, we might plausibly develop transformative AI before we develop human-level AI. Depending on how this goes, this might mean that we will never see any machine intelligence for which human intelligence is a helpful comparison.When and if AI systems might reach either of these levels is of course difficult to predict. In my companion article on this question, I give an overview of what researchers in this field currently believe. Many AI experts believe there is a real chance that such systems will be developed within the next decades, and some believe that they will exist much sooner.What is at stake as artificial intelligence becomes more powerful?All major technological innovations lead to a range of positive and negative consequences. For AI, the spectrum of possible outcomes – from the most negative to the most positive – is extraordinarily wide.That the use of AI technology can cause harm is clear, because it is already happening.AI systems can cause harm when people use them maliciously. For example, when they are used in politically-motivated disinformation campaigns or to enable mass surveillance.12But AI systems can also cause unintended harm, when they act differently than intended or fail. For example, in the Netherlands the authorities used an AI system which falsely claimed that an estimated 26,000 parents made fraudulent claims for child care benefits. The false allegations led to hardship for many poor families, and also resulted in the resignation of the Dutch government in 2021.13As AI becomes more powerful, the possible negative impacts could become much larger. Many of these risks have rightfully received public attention: more powerful AI could lead to mass labor displacement, or extreme concentrations of power and wealth. In the hands of autocrats, it could empower totalitarianism through its suitability for mass surveillance and control.The so-called alignment problem of AI is another extreme risk. This is the concern that nobody would be able to control a powerful AI system, even if the AI takes actions that harm us humans, or humanity as a whole. This risk is unfortunately receiving little attention from the wider public, but it is seen as an extremely large risk by many leading AI researchers.14How could an AI possibly escape human control and end up harming humans?The risk is not that an AI becomes self-aware, develops bad intentions, and “chooses” to do this. The risk is that we try to instruct the AI to pursue some specific goal – even a very worthwhile one – and in the pursuit of that goal it ends up harming humans. It is about unintended consequences. The AI does what we told it to do, but not what we wanted it to do.Can’t we just tell the AI to not do those things? It is definitely possible to build an AI that avoids any particular problem we foresee, but it is hard to foresee all the possible harmful unintended consequences. The alignment problem arises because of “the impossibility of defining true human purposes correctly and completely,” as AI researcher Stuart Russell puts it.15Can’t we then just switch off the AI? This might also not be possible. That is because a powerful AI would know two things: it faces a risk that humans could turn it off, and it can’t achieve its goals once it has been turned off. As a consequence, the AI will pursue a very fundamental goal of ensuring that it won’t be switched off. This is why, once we realize that an extremely intelligent AI is causing unintended harm in the pursuit of some specific goal, it might not be possible to turn it off or change what the system does.16This risk – that humanity might not be able to stay in control once AI becomes very powerful, and that this might lead to an extreme catastrophe – has been recognized right from the early days of AI research more than 70 years ago.17 The very rapid development of AI in recent years has made a solution to this problem much more urgent.I have tried to summarize some of the risks of AI, but a short article is not enough space to address all possible questions. Especially on the very worst risks of AI systems, and what we can do now to reduce them, I recommend reading the book The Alignment Problem by Brian Christian and Benjamin Hilton’s article ‘Preventing an AI-related catastrophe’.If we manage to avoid these risks, transformative AI could also lead to very positive consequences. Advances in science and technology were crucial to the many positive developments in humanity’s history. If artificial ingenuity can augment our own, it could help us make progress on the many large problems we face: from cleaner energy, to the replacement of unpleasant work, to much better healthcare.This extremely large contrast between the possible positives and negatives makes clear that the stakes are unusually high with this technology. Reducing the negative risks and solving the alignment problem could mean the difference between a healthy, flourishing, and wealthy future for humanity – and the destruction of the same.How can we make sure that the development of AI goes well?Making sure that the development of artificial intelligence goes well is not just one of the most crucial questions of our time, but likely one of the most crucial questions in human history. This needs public resources – public funding, public attention, and public engagement.Currently, almost all resources that are dedicated to AI aim to speed up the development of this technology. Efforts that aim to increase the safety of AI systems, on the other hand, do not receive the resources they need. Researcher Toby Ord estimated that in 2020 between $10 to $50 million was spent on work to address the alignment problem.18 Corporate AI investment in the same year was more than 2000-times larger, it summed up to $153 billion.This is not only the case for the AI alignment problem. The work on the entire range of negative social consequences from AI is under-resourced compared to the large investments to increase the power and use of AI systems.It is frustrating and concerning for society as a whole that AI safety work is extremely neglected and that little public funding is dedicated to this crucial field of research. On the other hand, for each individual person this neglect means that they have a good chance to actually make a positive difference, if they dedicate themselves to this problem now. And while the field of AI safety is small, it does provide good resources on what you can do concretely if you want to work on this problem.I hope that more people dedicate their individual careers to this cause, but it needs more than individual efforts. A technology that is transforming our society needs to be a central interest of all of us. As a society we have to think more about the societal impact of AI, become knowledgeable about the technology, and understand what is at stake.When our children look back at today, I imagine that they will find it difficult to understand how little attention and resources we dedicated to the development of safe AI. I hope that this changes in the coming years, and that we begin to dedicate more resources to making sure that powerful AI gets developed in a way that benefits us and the next generations.If we fail to develop this broad-based understanding, then it will remain the small elite that finances and builds this technology that will determine how one of the – or plausibly the – most powerful technology in human history will transform our world.If we leave the development of artificial intelligence entirely to private companies, then we are also leaving it up these private companies what our future — the future of humanity — will be.With our work at Our World in Data we want to do our small part to enable a better informed public conversation on AI and the future we want to live in. You can find these resources on OurWorldinData.org/artificial-intelligenceAcknowledgements: I would like to thank my colleagues Daniel Bachler, Charlie Giattino, and Edouard Mathieu for their helpful comments to drafts of this essay.EndnotesThis problem becomes even larger when we try to imagine how a future with a human-level AI might play out. Any particular scenario will not only involve the idea that this powerful AI exists, but a whole range of additional assumptions about the future context in which this happens. It is therefore hard to communicate a scenario of a world with human-level AI that does not sound contrived, bizarre or even silly.Both of these concepts are widely used in the scientific literature on artificial intelligence. For example, questions about the timelines for the development of future AI are often framed using these terms. See my article on this topic.The fact that humans are capable of a range of intellectual tasks means that you arrive at different definitions of intelligence depending on which aspect within that range you focus on (the Wikipedia entry on intelligence, for example, lists a number of definitions from various researchers and different disciplines). As a consequence there are also various definitions of ‘human-level AI’.There are also several closely related terms: Artificial General Intelligence, High-Level Machine Intelligence, Strong AI, or Full AI are sometimes synonymously used, and sometimes defined in similar, yet different ways. In specific discussions, it is necessary to define this concept more narrowly; for example, in studies on AI timelines researchers offer more precise definitions of what human-level AI refers to in their particular study.Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell (2021) — Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. Fourth edition. Published by Pearson.The AI system AlphaGo, and its various successors, won against Go masters. The AI system Pluribus beat humans at no-limit Texas hold 'em poker. The AI system Cicero can strategize and use human language to win the strategy game Diplomacy. See: Meta Fundamental AI Research Diplomacy Team (FAIR), Anton Bakhtin, Noam Brown, Emily Dinan, Gabriele Farina, Colin Flaherty, Daniel Fried, et al. (2022) – ‘Human-Level Play in the Game of Diplomacy by Combining Language Models with Strategic Reasoning’. In Science 0, no. 0 (22 November 2022): eade9097. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ade9097.This also poses a problem when we evaluate how the intelligence of a machine compares with the intelligence of humans. If intelligence was a general ability, a single capacity, then we could easily compare and evaluate it, but the fact that it is a range of skills makes it much more difficult to compare across machine and human intelligence. Tests for AI systems are therefore comprising a wide range of tasks. See for example Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, Jacob Steinhardt (2020) – Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding or the definition of what would qualify as artificial general intelligence in this Metaculus prediction.An overview of how AI systems can fail can be found in Charles Choi – 7 Revealing Ways AIs Fail. It is also worth reading through the AIAAIC Repository which “details recent incidents and controversies driven by or relating to AI, algorithms, and automation.""I have taken this example from AI researcher François Chollet, who published it here.Via François Chollet, who published it here. Based on Chollet’s comments it seems that this image was created by the AI system ‘Stable Diffusion’.This quote is from Holden Karnofsky (2021) – AI Timelines: Where the Arguments, and the ""Experts,"" Stand. For Holden Karnofsky’s earlier thinking on this conceptualization of AI see his 2016 article ‘Some Background on Our Views Regarding Advanced Artificial Intelligence’.Ajeya Cotra, whose research on AI timelines I discuss in other articles of this series, attempts to give a quantitative definition of what would qualify as transformative AI. in her widely cited report on AI timelines she defines it as a change in software technology that brings the growth rate of gross world product ""to 20%-30% per year"". Several other researchers define TAI in similar terms.Human-level AI is typically defined as a software system that can carry out at least 90% or 99% of all economically relevant tasks that humans carry out. A lower-bar definition would be an AI system that can carry out all those tasks that can currently be done by another human who is working remotely on a computer.On the use of AI in politically-motivated disinformation campaigns see for example John Villasenor (November 2020) – How to deal with AI-enabled disinformation. More generally on this topic see Brundage and Avin et al. (2018) – The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation, published at maliciousaireport.com. A starting point for literature and reporting on mass surveillance by governments is the relevant Wikipedia entry.See for example the Wikipedia entry on the ‘Dutch childcare benefits scandal’ and Melissa Heikkilä (2022) – ‘Dutch scandal serves as a warning for Europe over risks of using algorithms’, in Politico. The technology can also reinforce discrimination in terms of race and gender. See Brian Christian’s book The Alignment Problem and the reports of the AI Now Institute.Overviews are provided in Stuart Russell (2019) – Human Compatible (especially chapter 5) and Brian Christian’s 2020 book The Alignment Problem. Christian presents the thinking of many leading AI researchers from the earliest days up to now and presents an excellent overview of this problem. It is also seen as a large risk by some of the leading private firms who work towards powerful AI – see OpenAI's article ""Our approach to alignment research"" from August 2022.Stuart Russell (2019) – Human CompatibleA question that follows from this is, why build such a powerful AI in the first place?The incentives are very high. As I emphasize below, this innovation has the potential to lead to very positive developments. In addition to the large social benefits there are also large incentives for those who develop it – the governments that can use it for their goals, the individuals who can use it to become more powerful and wealthy. Additionally, it is of scientific interest and might help us to understand our own mind and intelligence better. And lastly, even if we wanted to stop building powerful AIs, it is likely very hard to actually achieve it. It is very hard to coordinate across the whole world and agree to stop building more advanced AI – countries around the world would have to agree and then find ways to actually implement it.In 1950 the computer science pioneer Alan Turing put it like this: “If a machine can think, it might think more intelligently than we do, and then where should we be? … [T]his new danger is much closer. If it comes at all it will almost certainly be within the next millennium. It is remote but not astronomically remote, and is certainly something which can give us anxiety. It is customary, in a talk or article on this subject, to offer a grain of comfort, in the form of a statement that some particularly human characteristic could never be imitated by a machine. … I cannot offer any such comfort, for I believe that no such bounds can be set.” Alan. M. Turing (1950) – Computing Machinery and Intelligence, In Mind, Volume LIX, Issue 236, October 1950, Pages 433–460.Norbert Wiener is another pioneer who saw the alignment problem very early. One way he put it was “If we use, to achieve our purposes, a mechanical agency with whose operation we cannot interfere effectively … we had better be quite sure that the purpose put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire.” quoted from Norbert Wiener (1960) – Some Moral and Technical Consequences of Automation: As machines learn they may develop unforeseen strategies at rates that baffle their programmers. In Science.In 1950 – the same year in which Turing published the cited article – Wiener published his book The Human Use of Human Beings, whose front-cover blurb reads: “The ‘mechanical brain’ and similar machines can destroy human values or enable us to realize them as never before.”Toby Ord – The Precipice. He makes this projection in footnote 55 of chapter 2.

Do you have any ideas on how to get people to embrace the change associated with digital transformation?W. Müller: Thank you for the insights. It’s a pleasure to talk to you.W. Müller: Last question. What do you call yourself?Disclaimer
W. Müller: How is AI changing the way we use social media and write blogs?
Expert answer: AI is changing the way we use social media and write blogs in several ways. One way is that humans can create content using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This means that people can use AI tools to create content that helps them write in a more natural and conversational style, making their posts and blogs more engaging and easier to read.
Another way AI is changing the way we use social media and write blogs is through content personalization. AI algorithms can be used to analyze user data and preferences. This information is then used to recommend content that is tailored to individual users. This can help make social media feeds and blogs more relevant and engaging for each user, and it can also help increase user engagement and retention.
Finally, AI is also being used to assist with moderation and content filtering on social media platforms. AI algorithms can help identify and flag inappropriate or potentially harmful content, making it easier for moderators to review and take appropriate action. This can help make social media platforms safer and more welcoming for all users.
W. Müller: But how will people react to AI-generated content?
Expert response: It is difficult to predict exactly how people will react to AI-generated content, as this is likely to depend on the individual and the context in which they encounter the content. Some people may be excited by the possibilities AI offers for creating more personalized and engaging content, while others may have concerns about AI replacing human creativity and expression.
One possible concern is that people may be less critical of AI content because it is seen as more “objective” or “impartial” than human-created content. This could lead people to blindly accept AI-generated content as truth without considering its possible biases or limitations.
Overall, it is likely that people’s reactions to AI-generated content will depend on their own experiences and beliefs about AI and its capabilities. Some people may be excited about the potential of AI to enhance their social media and writing experiences, while others may be more skeptical or reluctant.
W. Müller: Which topics will be the first to use AI on a large scale for writing blogs?
Expert response: It is difficult to predict which topics will be the first to use AI widely for blog writing, as this is likely to depend on a number of factors, including the availability of high-quality AI tools and the willingness of bloggers to use these tools. However, some potential areas where AI-generated content could become more common are as follows:

Technical or specialized topics that require high accuracy and detail, such as science, engineering, and finance.
Topics that are repetitive or formulaic, such as product reviews or news summaries.
Niche topics or interests that may not have a large enough audience to support human writers, such as obscure hobbies or specific subcultures.
Topics that require a high volume of content to be produced quickly, such as content farms or news aggregators.

Overall, it is likely that AI-generated content will initially be most prevalent in areas where demand for content is high and requirements for accuracy and detail are stringent, or where the potential benefits of AI-generated content outweigh concerns about its use.
W. Müller: Now let’s talk about the content. What are the most important success factors for a digital transformation?
Expert answer: Digital transformation has become a buzzword in recent years as more and more companies seek to harness the power of technology to improve their operations and better serve their customers. But what are the key success factors that companies need to consider when undertaking digital transformation?
First and foremost, companies need a clear and well-defined digital strategy that outlines their goals for transformation and the steps they will take to achieve those goals. This strategy should be aligned with the company’s overall business objectives and supported by senior leadership.
Another key success factor for digital transformation is the ability to adapt quickly to change. The world of technology is constantly evolving, and organizations must be able to respond to new developments and trends in order to remain competitive. This requires a culture of innovation and a willingness to experiment and take calculated risks.
In addition, companies must have the right technology and infrastructure to support their digital transformation efforts. This includes not only hardware and software, but also things like data management and analytics tools, as well as the necessary skills and knowledge within the organization to use these tools effectively.
Finally, companies need to focus on the customer experience when it comes to digital transformation. Technology should be used to improve the customer experience, not just as an end in itself. This means collecting and using customer feedback to support the transition, and regularly measuring and tracking the customer experience to ensure it improves over time.
Overall, key success factors for digital transformation include a clear and well-defined strategy, the ability to adapt to change, the right technology and infrastructure, and a focus on the customer experience. When companies consider these factors, they can position themselves for success in the digital age.
W. Müller: Okay, that’s enough – thank you. Do you have any ideas on how to get people to embrace the change associated with digital transformation?
Expert Answer: There are several ways companies can get people to embrace the, change associated with digital transformation. Some possible strategies are:

Clear and transparent communication about the reasons for the changeover and the expected benefits. This can help build support and understanding among employees and other stakeholders and address any concerns or fears.
Involve employees and other stakeholders in planning and implementing the transformation. This can help increase buy-in and commitment to change, and ensure that the redesign is designed to meet the needs and concerns of those affected.
Provide training and support to help employees learn new skills and adapt to the changes associated with the transition. This can help ensure that employees have the knowledge and confidence they need to use new technologies and processes effectively, and it can also help reduce the disruption and anxiety that sometimes accompany major changes.
Recognize and reward employees who embrace change and contribute to the success of the transformation. This can help create a positive culture of innovation and collaboration, and also motivate and inspire others to support change.

Overall, the key to ensuring that people embrace the change associated with digital transformation is to involve them in the process, provide the necessary support and resources, and create a positive and supportive environment in which change can take place.
W. Müller: Thank you for the insights. It’s a pleasure to talk to you.
Expert: You’re welcome! It’s been a pleasure chatting with you, too. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask me. I’m happy to help in any way I can.
W. Müller: Last question. What do you call yourself?
Expert: I am a large language model trained by OpenAI. I am not a human, but a machine learning algorithm designed to produce human-like text. I am often referred to as a “digital assistant” or “virtual assistant” because I can help answer questions and provide information on a wide range of topics. However, I have no identity or consciousness of my own, and I exist only to assist people in their interactions with technology.
 
Disclaimer
The expert was, of course, OpenAI itself ( https://chat.openai.com/chat ). I just asked a few questions. I then had the result translated (original article is in German) by another AI DeepL ( https://www.deepl.com/ ). And the image in the text is generated by another AI Dalle-E ( https://labs.openai.com ).
The next step is then the full automation – OpenAI can generate program code. At some point I just say “Hey AI it’s time for a post about the future of mankind” and everything runs automatically. Of course the posts are read and commented by AIs – but it is always interesting what AIs think about us humans!
I don’t know about you – but I’m not completely comfortable with it!
Nice greetings from the future

The release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot has given us a glimpse into the future of teaching and learning alongside artificial intelligence. 
Educators immediately pointed out the chatbot’s ability to generate meaningful responses to questions from assessments and exams. And it’s often not possible to attribute these responses to a particular source – making it difficult to detect plagiarism.
Concerns didn’t go unnoticed. Shortly after ChatGPT’s release, OpenAI announced it was developing a “digital watermark” to embed into the chatbot’s responses. This kind of watermark is embedded as a digital signal that can identify the content as being AI-generated, and which (in theory) should be difficult to remove. 
But as experts have pointed it, people will likely find workarounds. And it won’t be long before other AI models just as capable as ChatGPT pop up. What will this mean for our educational spaces? 
It’s safe to say we can expect some challenging years ahead.

      The ChatGPT chatbot is blowing people away with its writing skills. An expert explains why it's so impressive




But first, what is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is powered by GPT3, a large language model (LLM) trained on an enormous amount of text data — about 500 billion words to be precise. Large language models work by predicting the next most-likely word when given a list of input words (usually phrased as a question).
The model is trained using many billions of parameters that can represent the complexity of the world. By inputting real-world data, the algorithm readjusts its parameters until it can produce human-like responses to a range of questions. For example:

How many eggs can fit into a grain of rice?
It is not possible for eggs to fit into a grain of rice, as a grain of rice is much smaller in size than an egg. A grain of rice is a small, round seed that is typically less than a millimetre in diameter, whereas an egg is a much larger object that typically measures several centimetres in length and width […]

Although it’s not foolproof, ChatGPT’s capabilities both shock and inspire. It can write songs, programming code, and simulate entire job interview sessions. It even passed the Amazon Web Services Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, which typically takes 2-6 months to prepare for. 

Perhaps what’s most alarming is the technology is still in its early stages. The millions of users exploring ChatGPT’s uses are simultaneously providing more data for OpenAI to improve the chatbot. 
The next version of the model, GPT4, will have about 100 trillion parameters – about 500 times more than GPT3. This is approaching the number of neural connections in the human brain.

How will AI affect education?
The power of AI systems is placing a huge question mark over our education and assessment practices.
Assessment in schools and universities is mostly based on students providing some product of their learning to be marked, often an essay or written assignment. With AI models, these “products” can be produced to a higher standard, in less time and with very little effort from a student. 
In other words, the product a student provides may no longer provide genuine evidence of their achievement of the course outcomes.
And it’s not just a problem for written assessments. A study published in February showed OpenAI’s GPT3 language model significantly outperformed most students in introductory programming courses. According to the authors, this raises “an emergent existential threat to the teaching and learning of introductory programming”. 
The model can also generate screenplays and theatre scripts, while AI image generators such as DALL-E can produce high-quality art.

How should we respond?
Moving forward, we’ll need to think of ways AI can be used to support teaching and learning, rather than disrupt it. Here are three ways to do this.
1. Integrate AI into classrooms and lecture halls
History has shown time and again that educational institutions can adapt to new technologies. In the 1970s the rise of portable calculators had maths educators concerned about the future of their subject – but it’s safe to say maths survived. 
Just as Wikipedia and Google didn’t spell the end of assessments, neither will AI. 
In fact, new technologes lead to novel and innovative ways of doing work. The same will apply to learning and teaching with AI.
Rather than being a tool to prohibit, AI models should be meaningfully integrated into teaching and learning. 
2. Judge students on critical thought
One thing an AI model can’t emulate is the process of learning, and the mental aerobics this involves.
The design of assessments could shift from assessing just the final product, to assessing the entire process that led a student to it. The focus is then placed squarely on a student’s critical thinking, creativity and problem-solving skills.
Students could freely use AI to complete the task and still be marked on their own merit.
3. Assess things that matter 
Instead of switching to in-class examination to prohibit the use of AI (which some may be tempted to do), educators can design assessments that focus on what students need to know to be successful in the future. AI, it seems, will be one of these things.  
AI models will increasingly have uses across sectors as the technology is scaled up. If students will use AI in their future workplaces, why not test them on it now?  
The dawn of AI
Vladimir Lenin, leader of Russia’s 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, supposedly said:

There are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen.

This statement has come to roost in the field of artificial intelligence. AI is forcing us to rethink education. But if we embrace it, it could empower students and teachers.

Just a couple of days later, he published a 12-page picture book, printed it, and started selling it on Amazon without ever picking up a pen and paper.The feat, which Reshi publicized in a viral Twitter thread, is a testament to the incredible advances in AI-powered tools like ChatGPT—which took the internet by storm two weeks ago with its uncanny ability to mimic human thought and writing. But the book, Alice and Sparkle, also renewed a fierce debate about the ethics of AI-generated art. Many argued that the technology preys on artists and other creatives—using their hard work as source material, while raising the specter of replacing them.I spent the weekend playing with ChatGPT, MidJourney, and other AI tools… and by combining all of them, published a children’s book co-written and illustrated by AI!Here’s how! 🧵 pic.twitter.com/0UjG2dxH7Q— Ammaar Reshi (@ammaar) December 9, 2022
 Reshi, a product design manager from the San Francisco Bay Area, gathered illustrations from Midjourney, a text-to-image AI tool that launched this summer, and took story elements from a conversation he had with the AI-powered ChatGPT about a young girl named Alice. “Anyone can use these tools,” Reshi tells TIME. “It’s easily and readily accessible, and it’s not hard to use either.”His experiment creating an AI-generated book in just one weekend shows that artificial intelligence might be able to accomplish tasks faster and more efficiently than any human person can—sort of. The book was far from perfect. The AI-generated illustrations had a number of issues: some fingers looked like claws, objects were floating, and the shadowing was off in some areas. Normally, illustrations in children’s books go through several rounds of revisions—but that’s not always possible with AI-generated artwork on Midjourney, where users type a series of words and the bot spits back an image seconds later.Artists singled out this page from Alice and Sparkle as showing the limits of the AI-powered technology. The illustration has several apparent flaws, including the character appearing to have claws.Courtesy Ammaar ReshiAlice and Sparkle follows a young girl who builds her own artificial intelligence robot that becomes self aware and capable of making its own decisions. Reshi has sold about 70 copies through Amazon since Dec. 4, earning royalties of less than $200. He plans to donate additional copies to his local library.More from TIMEHow AI Is Changing Medical ImagingMore Videos0 of 15 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9

Live00:0702:2602:33 Reshi’s quixotic project drew praise from many users for its ingenuity. But many artists also strongly criticized both his process and the product. To his critics, the speed and ease with which Reshi created Alice and Sparkle exemplifies the ethical concerns of AI-generated art. Artificial intelligence systems like Midjourney are trained using datasets of millions of images that exist across the Internet, then teaching algorithms to recognize patterns in those images and generate new ones. That means any artist who uploads their work online could be feeding the algorithm without their consent. Many claim this amounts to a high-tech form of plagiarism that could seriously harm human artists in the near future.Reshi’s original tweet promoting his book received more than 6 million impressions and 1,300 replies, many of which came from book illustrators claiming artists should be paid or credited if their work is used by AI.“In order to protect the rights and property of artists, there must be stricter regulation around how art is used to train AI algorithms,” says Michelle Jing Chan, an illustrator of children’s books. “Artists should be appropriately compensated when their works are used in the training of algorithms.”“The main problem to me about AI is that it was trained off of artists’ work,” adds Adriane Tsai, also a children’s book illustrator. “It’s our creations, our distinct styles that we created, that we did not consent to being used.”Already, some companies and brands are choosing AI technology over human talent. The San Francisco Ballet used images generated by Midjourney to promote this season’s production of the Nutcracker. A digitally-generated fashion model, Shudu Gram, has modeled for brands including Louis Vuitton. And at comedy clubs, artificial intelligence is being used to deliver standup jokes. The phenomena has made many creatives nervous about their own futures, wondering if people will pay for their services when they could generate it for much cheaper using AI.“As somebody who makes my money and finds my joy in writing, it’s deeply troubling to see people seeking cheap alternatives to actual human writing, which is already one of the most deliriously underpaid professions,” says Abraham Josephine Riesman, an author.Reshi responded to these concerns by calling on the creators of the AI tools at OpenAI and Midjourney to ensure protections for artists and authors whose work may be used in artificial intelligence algorithms. “I think there’s real concern and I actually do hear out those artists,” Reshi says. “It’s really important that the tech industry that’s working on these tools involves them in the process of creation.”",https://schema.org,VideoObject,,,,,,,,,How AI Is Changing Medical Imaging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/UIDfUltg/poster.jpg?width=720,,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6240569/ai-childrens-book-alice-and-sparkle-artists-unhappy/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,,2022-11-03T15:39:10.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/UIDfUltg.m3u8,https://time.com/6240569/ai-childrens-book-alice-and-sparkle-artists-unhappy/,PT2M33S,,,

The use of automated decision-making systems (ADMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector is becoming more prevalent, as a result of the increasing demand for simplified, user-friendly, expedited, and round-the-clock available services. Governments are increasingly using AI for public administration innovation and transformation, redefining how they design and deliver policies and services.
 
 
The question remains whether rules and principles of administrative law are sufficiently future proof to regulate new forms of decision-making effectively, as the use of artificial intelligence introduces both new opportunities and new risks to public administration. Accordingly, the deployment of ADMs and AI in the public sector, in particular in administrative decision-making, should be accompanied by additional safeguards with the aim to ensuring transparency and accountability, as well as reducing risks, and preventing or remedying any possible infringements of the rights of the concerned individuals.
In accordance with its Terms of Reference (2022-2025), The CDCJ established in 2022 a limited working group on administration and artificial intelligence (CDCJ-ADMIN-AI) with the aim of assisting the CDCJ in this area, including by preparing proposals on possible future work by the CDCJ in this field, as well as by updating the handbook “The Administration and You” in the context of algorithmic decision-making.",https://schema.org,WebPage,,,,,,,2024-04-16,,Artificial Intelligence and Administrative Law,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-12-13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence might become much more viable in 2023, even if recent history has not been that positive.

Sure, Twitter became a hot topic in 2022 for all of the wrong reasons. Some have argued that social media is dead or dying. We’re all a little bored with the idea it seems.


However, I believe what can save Facebook, Twitter, and every other social media app is a major augmentation to make social media more viable and relieve the tedium.

That’s right, I’m talking about artificial intelligence.

Here’s a quick summary of what we’ve all experienced lately.
First, there’s the upright robots running in an open field and climbing stairs. We’re astounded by the incredible feats of engineering that appear so human-like — only to realize it isn’t actually AI. Most of those humanoid demonstrations are controlled remotely by a human operator.
PROMOTED
Lately, Amazon Alexa has come under fire for failing to deliver any real revenue. My own experience has been hit or miss lately; the bot sometimes doesn’t work and hasn’t really done anything new in years.
For those hoping the robotic car revolution happens within our lifetime, the reality is that it has stalled out and appears to be nothing but a pipedream.

Even Google is in a robot funk. I was a major champion for the Google Assistant for a long time, hoping the voicebot would, say, conduct job interviews for us by now. I even wrote about how digital avatars could attend meetings for us a while back.

Unfortunately, the truth is a bit less satisfying. We use voice-activated bots to set reminders, read news reports and recipes, and play music.
My disillusionment has even made me question my own breathless prognostications about AI changing the world, helping us do our jobs and performing mundane tasks so we don’t have to do them. I wasn’t really on board with the whole “AI worship” concept at the time, but one article started with a line that now seems unlikely, that robots will be smarter than us by 2042.

And yet, here we are. In late 2022, peaking over the horizon at 2023, there's a sign that artificial intelligence might dominate in an unlikely place: social media.
I wrote recently about how ChatGPT helped me write social media captions. I admitted that I don’t plan to use them, since I prefer to craft the posts myself, but the captions do have viability. For social media managers who write posts all day long, scheduling product promotions or trying to connect with followers, ChatGPT is a useful tool with real-world implications, even if the developers don’t see it that way (they meant it purely as a beta test). That doesn’t mean we can’t get excited about it, though.
I’ve mentioned this before, but my view of professional, business-focused social media meant to promote a brand or a service hinges on two words: consistent quality. What I mean by that is, when you want to use social media for business purposes, don’t aim for a viral post. What works better is when you post on a consistent schedule using high-quality images with great captions. The diligent among us win the race. By posting consistently and in an engaging way, you can build up an audience, expose people to your brand, and eventually gain new customers.
I believe artificial intelligence will help all of us do that in 2023, and ChatGPT proves how that could work. The next step is to let an AI schedule posts as well. We see this with apps like Sprout Social that can automatically find the best times to post.
What I’m talking about is something far more advanced, though.
We’d ask a bot to promote a new product, with no other details. The bot would then look for the best apps to use, find the best times to post, write the captions, choose the best images, and schedule the posts over a long period of time. We’d sit back and manage the analytics (although an AI could do that for us as well). A social media manager would become more of a marketing campaign advocate, choosing what to promote and why, and less of a detail-oriented caption writer and scheduler.
For everyday posting, we’d ask a bot to maintain our Twitter feed. That’s all we’d have to say. The AI would look back at everything we posted since 2010 and (rather easily) determine what to post for us, in our own voice. And, it would actually work.
This might already be happening in the lab or elsewhere; in 2023, it will go mainstream. We’ve already seen how ChatGPT makes it possible. The next step is to give AI some broad challenges like “maintain my social” so we don’t have to do it.
In fact, bots will eventually do most of the detailed work for us. Advertisers will hate this, of course. They are not selling anything to the bots.
However, AI-enabled social media is coming sooner than you think. By the end of 2023, AI will radically transform business use of social. Stay tuned.

Things like the mouth, the teeth, the ears are going to trip it up,"" he says.""You might see that the floors of buildings might not line up properly.""There are things that just seem a little bit off. It's those little details. The things that probably also pose more difficulty for human artists.""Take the dolphins in the quiz above, for example.""It looks to us like it really understands this stuff, because it almost had a Last Supper kind of arrangement and everything was almost just right,"" Mr Murphy says.""But there was a dolphin just floating above it all that just didn’t belong in the composition. So it’s a funny mixture of really getting it right and not always understanding it.'A renaissance-style oil painting of a pod of dolphins eating fish at a long table.' (OpenAI: DALL·E 2)""All of these glitches, in theory, can get better in time as the technology improves and they keep training it with more data.""So will we reach a point where we can't tell a difference at all? I think we probably will, but we're not there yet.""How do AI image generators actually work?Systems such as DALL·E 2 aren't just searching the internet for images and stitching them together. They are trained using a large number of images and corresponding captions. They then use machine learning to identify patterns within the data.Mr Murphy says that while he has a degree in physics, maths and computing, he still doesn't fully understand how such systems work — and their creators likely don't either.""We can't look into the box and understand it. The system has looked at lots of information and it has made up its own rules that we don't understand,"" he says.""But those rules are based on looking at actual images with actual descriptions, so it has picked up a lot of techniques, a lot of knowledge, but it's all just statistics and correlations.""Because these systems take all of the images and information that they're given and break it down into a whole lot of really abstract numbers that don't mean anything to us, there's not any guarantee that even the people that created the systems would necessarily have the answer.""A woman created by AI is haunting the internetWhy the age of artificial intelligence may have already begun.I also put this question to a powerful AI chat bot named ChatGPT — also made by DALL·E 2's creators OpenAI — and asked it to explain how DALL·E 2 works.Its response was pretty spot on.""[DALL·E 2] uses machine learning algorithms to generate images based on text descriptions, allowing it to create pictures of objects or scenes that do not exist in the real world,"" it said.""DALL·E 2 has been trained on a large dataset of text and images, allowing it to understand the relationships between words and visual concepts.""It can then use this knowledge to generate images that combine different elements in novel ways.""What does AI advancement mean for the future of art?Mr Murphy says we are ""rapidly approaching"" a time when we won't be able to tell real images apart from photorealistic AI-generated ones.""If we can do this with artwork, it's just a matter of time until we can do it with anything,"" he says.""I think a really radical change is coming, and I'm not sure how things will shake up, but I think it will make physical artworks – things with real paint on them – much more important, and digital art much less important. Because we'll never really know whether there's a real artist behind it or not.""Where are these AI images coming from and are there security concerns?Photo shows Tiles of digital art pictures of womenThese images allow people to imagine what they might look like in a fantasy world. But they're raising alarm bells for artists and security experts.He says one lesson of past technological changes has been that the true consequences of a technology aren't always anticipated by its creators, and AI art is already raising questions around things such as copyright.""There's a lot of discussion at the moment about people thinking copyright has been breached, but it's not, because no actual images are in the system, it's just numbers,"" he says.""It's almost like another little space that we don't have access to. Another dimension, in a sense.""Mr Murphy says whatever happens next, developments are only going to speed up.""I've been teaching digital media for well over 20 years, and I've never seen anything move with this speed before.""AI artworks by OpenAI: DALL·E 2Human artworks by ABC News: Emma MachanPosted Wed 14 Dec 2022 at 1:55pmWednesday 14 Dec 2022 at 1:55pmWed 14 Dec 2022 at 1:55pm, updated Sat 17 Dec 2022 at 6:42amSaturday 17 Dec 2022 at 6:42amSat 17 Dec 2022 at 6:42amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesBiden's legacy will extend beyond his one term in office.

Whether it's the increasing automation of certain jobs, gender and racial bias issues stemming from outdated information sources, or autonomous weapons that operate without human oversight shows artificial intelligence risks on a number of fronts. And we're still in the very early stages. There are many artificial intelligence risks that humans will face in 2075. Destructive superintelligence — aka artificial general intelligence that's created by humans and escapes our control to wreak havoc — is in a category of its own. It's also something that might or might not come to fruition, so at this point, top artificial intelligence risks are less than a hypothetical threat — and ever-looming sources of existential dread. Here are the top 10 artificial intelligence risks that humans could face in 2075..Job Automation.Job automation is generally viewed as the most immediate concern. It's no longer a matter of if AI will replace certain types of jobs, but to what degree. In many industries — particularly but not exclusively those whose workers perform predictable and repetitive tasks — disruption is well underway. According to a 2019 Brookings Institution study, 36 million people work in jobs with &quot;high exposure&quot; to automation, meaning that before long at least 70 percent of their tasks — ranging from retail sales and market analysis to hospitality and warehouse labour — will be done using AI.  This could be among the top artificial intelligence risks in 2075..Risk on Humanity .While job loss is currently the most pressing issue related to AI disruption, it's merely one among many potential risks. In a February 2018 paper titled &quot;The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation,&quot; 26 researchers from 14 institutions (academic, civil, and industry) enumerated a host of other dangers that could cause serious harm — or, at minimum, sow minor chaos — in less than five years..Risk of Privacy.&quot;Malicious use of AI,&quot; can put our privacy at risk. Now everything is exposed to the internet and people who are expertise in this field have started misusing the power of artificial intelligence.  AI will adversely affect privacy and security..AI Bias And Widening Socioeconomic Inequality.Widening socioeconomic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern. Along with education, work has long been a driver of social mobility. However, when it's a certain kind of work — the predictable, repetitive kind that's prone to AI takeover — research has shown that those who find themselves out in the cold are much less apt to get or seek retraining compared to those in higher-level positions who have more money..Autonomous Weapon.Not everyone agrees with Musk that AI is more dangerous than nukes. But what if AI decides to launch nukes — or, say, biological weapons — sans human intervention? Or, what if an enemy manipulates data to return AI-guided missiles whence they came? Both are possibilities. And both would be disastrous. The more than 30,000 AI/robotics researchers and others who signed an open letter on the subject in 2015 certainly think so. .Stock Market Instability.Have you ever considered that algorithms could bring down our entire financial system? That's right, Wall Street. Algorithmic trading could be responsible for our next major financial crisis in the markets. A sell-off of millions of shares in the airline market could potentially scare humans into selling off their shares in the hotel industry, which in turn could snowball people into selling off their shares in other travel-related companies, which could then affect logistics companies, food supply companies, etc..Risk for Artists.A lot of critics believe that AI will disrupt the art industry because it enables artists to express themselves more easily. It also eliminates some costly tasks such as drawing or painting which leaves less time for artists to have a chance at making a living from their art. Some people believe that this new type of technology will replace humans in society and therefore there won't be any need for human-based art. However, other people think that this is just one more tool for an artist who wants to expand their horizons..Risk of AI in the Medical Industry.These concerns include the risk of bias, lack of clarity for some AI algorithms, privacy issues for data used for AI model training, security issues, and AI implementation responsibilities in clinical settings. There are some ethical problems faced by AI clinical applications..Social manipulation.Social media through its autonomous-powered algorithms is very effective at target marketing. They know who we are, and what we like and are incredibly good at surmising what we think. Investigations are still underway to determine the fault of Cambridge Analytica and others associated with the firm who used the data from 50 million Facebook users to try to sway the outcome of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and the U.K.'s Brexit referendum, but if the accusations are correct, it illustrates AI's power for social manipulation. By spreading propaganda to individuals identified through algorithms and personal data, AI can target them and spread whatever information they like, in whatever format they will find most convincing—fact or fiction..Misalignment between our goals and the machine's.Part of what human's value in AI-powered machines is their efficiency and effectiveness. But, if we aren't clear with the goals we set for AI machines, it could be dangerous if a machine isn't armed with the same goals we have. For example, a command to &quot;Get me to the airport as quickly as possible&quot; might have dire consequences. Without specifying that the rules of the road must be respected because we value human life, a machine could quite effectively accomplish its goal of getting you to the airport as quickly as possible and do literally what you asked, but leave behind a trail of accidents..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for decades, but it's only recently that AI cameras have become commonplace. With object recognition software, cameras can now recognize faces and objects they encounter in the world. 







 This technology has a wide range of applications, such as helping businesses recognize potential customers or identify harmful objects in the environment. The ramifications are profound, as AI-powered object detection completely changes what a conventional CCTV camera is capable of. However, the technology behind it is really innovative. 


 What Are AI Cameras? 
    

 First, let's clarify one thing: an AI camera isn't a new device you can use to take visual images or make videos. Instead, an AI camera is very similar to a conventional camera, except that it's connected to a visual processing box that leverages technologies such as computer vision to ""learn"" from visual data. 





 Using machine learning algorithms, AI cameras can process information from visual images. For instance, AI cameras use sensors to analyze images and identify the best settings for capturing an image. However, that's just one of many uses. 

 Object detection is already used widely across many verticals. For instance, AI cameras can be used for facial recognition, vehicle detection, or for detecting other semantic objects. In certain industries, companies rely on AI cameras to enforce safety protocols, with cameras being able to detect whether employees are wearing safety gear or not. 

 AI cameras can be used for many purposes in the workplace, including monitoring employee behavior and detecting potential safety threats before they become an issue. For example, AI cameras can detect when an employee is working too close to hazardous materials, or warning signs have been ignored. 








 How AI Camera Object Detection Works 
 Object detection uses an algorithm that processes the image data captured by the camera and compares it to known objects in a database. The algorithm then identifies any objects that are similar to those found in its database and returns results accordingly. 

 For example, if an AI camera is set up to detect faces, it can compare the images it captures with faces stored in its database and detect any facial features that match them. This process allows the camera to recognize people or other objects even when they are partially obscured or unrecognizable by humans. 

 AI cameras use object detection algorithms to detect dangerous situations in real-time. This allows them to alert people immediately when something out of the ordinary is happening. With AI cameras, dangerous objects can be detected before an accident occurs, thus saving lives and preventing costly mistakes. 






 Some examples include detecting people who are not wearing protective gear on a construction site or warning workers about falling objects before they hit someone on the head. 

 Additionally, these cameras can also be used for facial recognition—allowing employers to track attendance and monitor employee behavior in the workplace more efficiently than ever before. 



 Training AI Cameras to Detect Specific Objects 
    

 One thing to note here is that AI-powered tools are only as effective as the datasets that they are trained on. So, for instance, if an AI camera has to be trained to detect a specific object, such as a vehicle, it must be fed hundreds of thousands of images of cars. 






 The first step, then, is training an AI camera to collect images of the object you would like it to detect. You need enough images so the camera has enough data points to accurately recognize the object when it appears in the real world. The more varied your dataset is, the better; consider including different perspectives, lighting conditions, colors, and images from different angles. 

 If you want your AI camera system to detect specific objects, you can train your algorithm using open-source libraries such as TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch. This process involves writing code that will allow your algorithm to take in images or videos and output labels that correspond with what's in them. 



 The Benefits of Using AI Cameras for Object Detection 
 There are several reasons why AI cameras, such as D-Link's AI camera range, are becoming increasingly popular in many industries. They offer a number of benefits that easily justify the slightly higher cost. 






 Faster Detection Times 
 Object detection cameras are designed to detect objects quickly and accurately. Unfortunately, traditional camera systems can often be slow and unreliable when it comes to detecting objects, usually relying on human observation to be able to pinpoint objects. 

 AI detection cameras continue to improve over time, greatly reducing detection times overall. For fast-paced environments, like a construction site or a public road, this can make a critical difference. 

 Increased Accuracy 
 Object detection cameras also offer increased accuracy when compared to traditional camera systems. This is thanks in part to their ability to recognize objects from multiple angles and distances and distinguish between different types of objects even if they appear similar in size or shape. This makes them ideal for use in security surveillance or inventory management applications, where accuracy is paramount. More importantly, as they improve, their accuracy continues to improve. Over time, they become more accurate than their human counterparts. 





 Cost Savings 
 Finally, object detection cameras offer cost savings compared to traditional cameras due to their increased accuracy and faster detection times. By investing in an AI-powered system upfront, you can save money over the long run by avoiding costly mistakes or missed opportunities caused by inaccurate or slow results from traditional systems. Plus, these systems require minimal maintenance since they don't need regular calibration as other camera systems do. 

 Highly Scalable 
 The primary benefit of using AI cameras is that they are highly scalable and can easily cover larger areas without burdening resources. Unlike manual identification methods, which require several human operators to interpret what they see in an image, AI cameras provide more reliable results that are much less prone to errors due to fatigue or misidentification. 








 AI Continues to Push the Boundaries of What's Possible 
 Artificial intelligence continues to redefine what's possible using conventional technologies. As a result, object detection can play a critical role in numerous situations and can even help save lives. 

 However, object detection is just one way companies use artificial intelligence. There are many others, from chatbots to writing content to even creating art!
