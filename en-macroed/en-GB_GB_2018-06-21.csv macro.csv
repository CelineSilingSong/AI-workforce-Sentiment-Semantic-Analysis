How Artificial Intelligence is Changing the Culture of Work 
In many ways, artificial intelligence is reinventing the world of business. A new white paper by culture transformation consultancy Walking the Talk delves into what exactly AI is and the impact it will have on organizational culture. Here’s the latest thinking.

 June 22, 2018 – Artificial intelligence is poised to become one of the most important business disruptors of our times. But too often people look only at the potential downsides of machines simulating human intelligence and overlook the positive impact and value that AI stands to deliver, particularly when it comes to organizational culture.
A new white paper report by Walking the Talk, a global culture transformation firm based in Amsterdam, says the changes that AI brings will be substantial, and that to take best advantage of the technology and to keep ahead of the competition, organizations must embrace a culture of innovation.
“As we move from digitalization to the full digital era, we believe that it is critical to change mindsets and move away from a focus on threats to a focus on opportunities offered by the new AI and cognitive technologies,” said the study, “Future Impact of AI on Culture,” by Jerome Parisse-Brassens, the firm’s executive director, and Humberto Branco, executive director for Latin America. “Beyond the fear of the killer robot and the loss of jobs, which will probably be the case for several industries, AI appeals to our humanity, because at its heart is the use of data to analyze patterns, and in particular patterns of behavior.”





The report asked two central questions: What exactly is AI? And what impact will it have on organizational culture? “At Walking the Talk, we define culture as ‘the patterns of behavior that are encouraged, discouraged, and tolerated by people and systems, over time,’” said Mr. Parisse-Brassens. “With this definition in mind, it is easy to see how central culture is to AI.”
AI Defined
Basically, AI is intelligence displayed by machines. “The term is applied when a machine mimics cognitive functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as learning and problem-solving,” said Mr. Parisse-Brassens. “The term encompasses many things, but at the moment it has a strong emphasis on using algorithms to do very smart things. It makes programming a lot simpler and a lot more interesting. What we are seeing in AI today is mostly pattern-matching and the capacity to look through sets of data.”
Beyond talking to humans, the technology is now moving toward machines talking to one another, which gives rise to images of machines becoming smarter than humans, potentially taking over the world and even wiping out humankind. Yet, Walking the Talk pointed to a more positive view of AI’s potential. “Research is currently being conducted about the ability of machines to stimulate empathy, where it would be able to interpret human emotions and adapt its behavior to give a specific response,” said the report. “It is easy to see through this the impact that AI can have on business: machines dealing with customer complaints, able to ask questions, solving important problems faster and more effectively than humans, showing empathy and providing the appropriate solution.”

Artificial Intelligence to Transform Workplace Sooner Than Expected
Research from McKinsey & Co. finds that between 75 million and 375 million workers globally will have to switch occupational categories and learn new skills in just the next 12 years because of automation and the transition to AI and robotics.

Many industries are already using AI. In healthcare, for example, one application helps doctors sift through hundreds of cancer drugs and choose the best one, based on a rapid analysis of papers, data and records, as well as find trends and treat potential health issues before they appear through regular diagnosis, said the report. The automotive industry is applying the technology with driverless cars. In financial services, AI is helping organize operations, maintain bookkeeping and invest in stocks. It is also being used to detect behavioral patterns for abnormal changes to reduce fraud and financial crime.
Organizational Culture
“What is clear to everyone is that AI is not about eliminating jobs, but about eliminating tasks of jobs, and about creating jobs that are more human – in other words, jobs that machines can’t do – or can’t yet do,” said Mr. Branco.
Walking the Talk said it foresees two main angles in which AI will impact organizational culture. The first one is that AI will help to manage culture. It can help, for example, to conduct a current culture assessment. “The purpose of AI is to analyze vast amounts of data to extract patterns,” said Mr. Branco. “By analyzing behavioral data sets, organizations will develop a good picture of their culture. We can picture a world where data is fed from many sources such as HR data, exit interviews, induction processes, performance management, business processes, leadership forums, and discussion threads to extract real-time behavior patterns to build an almost daily picture of the culture.”

It can also identify the target culture. “AI may be able to predict the best target culture based on hundreds of thousands of external and internal information sources,” he added. “To do this, it could simulate various scenarios of behavior change and measure the resulting business outcomes.”
Mindsets and Behaviors
AI can also serve to develop a culture plan. Beyond behaviors, AI will be able to identify systemic issues and their consequences, avoiding many of the current risks and facilitating the development of a culture plan. “It will help focus on the right culture change levers, better predict impact on culture and on the bottom line,” said Mr. Parisse-Brassens. “AI will also help identify culture influencers in the business as well as those resisting new sets of behavioral and management standards.”
And it can measure culture itself. “Whether it is to measure business outcomes or behavioral shifts, AI will play a significant role,” said Mr. Parisse-Brassens. “AI’s power and intelligence comes from the data at its disposal to analyze patterns, so having tools to collect behavioral shift will still be necessary.”

How Predictive Analytics Promotes Better Decision Making 
CHROs are vital in helping to place the right people in leadership roles at their companies, but these days they also serve a critical strategic function. Those responsibilities seldom play out on a bigger corporate stage than at Johnson & Johnson, where Peter Fasolo serves as CHRO. 

The second angle is that AI will directly influence the mindsets and behaviors of people at work through the systems that will be implemented, he said. Among the “culture archetypes,” that the study identified, innovation is cited as the one that AI will impact the most. “The mindset that sits behind innovation is curiosity,” said the report. “Asking questions, challenging, testing, trialing things and failing fast are all behaviors underpinning innovation, and they are the essence of AI and cognitive technologies.”
A Mindset of Innovation
To make the most of AI, organizations must shift toward a mindset of innovation, bringing the curiosity to look beyond what they can now see and interpret. “They will need to ask the right questions of the machines, they will need to be ready to test the solutions provided, and move quickly,” said Mr. Parisse-Brassens. “AI will innovate, see patterns that the human brain can’t detect, and offer new ways forward.”
In practical terms, AI is already influencing the way businesses are managed, said Messrs. Parisse-Brassens and Branco in an interview with Hunt Scanlon Media. “With an increasingly challenging external environment, there is a critical need for senior executives to be supported in exploring new business boundaries, continuously challenging their traditional business-models, fast-prototyping products and services, being sufficiently humble in accepting high-accurate learning-machine inputs to decisions, to deal with errors, losses and lack of complete answers to new questions that are arising with increasing speed, range, complexity and associated risks,” the authors said. “Openness to learn, to innovate and to foster the courage required to move fast even when uncertain are concrete requirements in embracing AI.”

The type of people organizations need to recruit will change, moving away from highly technical roles to jobs that place more importance on cultural fit and adaptability. “People who are adaptable, responsive and agile will be favored,” said Mr. Branco. “This will impact the culture of the organization towards one of innovation.”
Enhancing Diversity
To build the next generation of technology and AI tools, organizations will need as many diverse points of view as possible, the authors said in the interview. “We need the ability to think differently about data, tools and uses of technology,” they said. “We need people whose logic is different. We need different ways of thinking. This means that contrary to what many of us think, robotization and AI will not remove diversity but enhance it. Talent management will therefore be directly influenced. Through the analysis that AI will provide, it will be able help to maximize the value from the workforce, but also fully engage them, use their strengths and increase their commitment and engagement.”
Related: Attracting Top Talent in the Age of AI
As such, recruitment of talent will need to evolve and in some cases, to be completely transformed or even become unnecessary. “People who are adaptable, responsive and agile will be highly favored, because they will be able to not only work with AI but allow the business to thrive and grow through AI,” the authors said. “A growth mindset will be one of the key attributes of new talent, moving away from static, linear, short-term thinking towards sustainability, incremental, open ways of looking at the world.”
The road to realizing the full cultural impact of artificial intelligence is long, concluded the report. Walking the Talk said it predicts the changes that are coming will be considerable. And as it is so often with culture, leadership will be the central issue. “Will leaders adapt to a new workforce, new ways of thinking and acting?” asked the authors. “Will leaders make the most of a new technology that will help them to empower the workforce? Will they use AI to create the culture they need to effectively implement their strategy, being able to manage their businesses transition to an AI environment? This challenge requires major cross-functional attention, effort and collaboration.”

Factors that contribute to the AI talent shortage
One report suggested there about 300,000 AI professionals worldwide, but millions of roles available. While these are speculative figures, the competitive salaries and benefits packages and the aggressive recruiting tactics rolled out by firms to recruit AI talent would suggest the supply of AI talent is nowhere near matching up to the demand.
As the democratization of AI and deep learning applications expands—possible not just for tech giants but now viable for small- and medium-sized businesses—the demand for AI professionals to do the work has ballooned as well. The C-suite and corporate management’s excitement for AI’s various applications is building and then once they have bought into the concept (which is happening much more rapidly), they want to make it real right away.
PROMOTED





The 2018 “How Companies Are Putting AI to Work Through Deep Learning” survey from O’Reilly reveals the AI skills gap is the largest barrier to AI adoption, although data challenges, company culture, hardware and other company resources are also impediments. These results parallel a recent Ernst & Young poll that confirmed 56% of senior AI professionals believed the lack of qualified AI professionals was the single biggest barrier to AI implementation across business operations.

Another reason for the AI skills crisis is that our academic and training programs just can’t keep up with the pace of innovation and new discoveries with AI. Not only do AI professionals need official training, they need on-the-job experience. Therefore, there aren’t enough experienced AI professionals to step into the leadership roles required by organizations who are just beginning to adopt AI strategies into their operations.
How to close the AI skills gap
One of the ways to address the AI skills gap is to increase resources for digital, math and technical education such as the UK Government announced in its 2017 Industrial Strategy whitepaper. While skills acquisition for younger generations will help in the future, a singular focus on just driving more students into computer science will not solve the issue—the number of computer science graduates in the UK would need to increase 10X to meet the demand.

Many of the tech giants such as Google and Amazon are investing internationally to expand their talent pool. Google Brain Toronto is a facility dedicated to AI and Amazon has an AI-focused lab near the University of Cambridge in England and plans to build a similar facility in Barcelona.
Until there are new graduates to step into AI roles, many companies can focus now on retraining and upskilling current employees. According to a Forbes survey, 63% of companies are now providing in-house data analytics training. The future of work will require employees to be agile and change their skills over time.
It’s challenging to find a person who has the appropriate hard skills and technical know-how as well as the soft skills such as being “highly collaborative” that would make them successful in a high-level AI position that can take their tech skills and apply them to business problems. Recent grads typically don’t have the business acumen and leadership experience that is required to manage AI implementation throughout an organization. As AI matures in organizations, it will be imperative that diverse personnel and thinking is integrated.
Some AI positions could be filled by those with mathematics or physics degree who get trained on AI specialties. Deeplearning.ai, launched in collaboration with Coursera, is hoping to bring AI to a mass audience and help people build their careers in AI.
Could the solution for the AI skills gap be solved by AI? Possibly.  Google is developing AutoML, AI that can actually create other AI systems. If this initiative is successful it could be very powerful for mid-sized businesses that are unable to compete with tech giants for top-tier talent.
Technology has a long history of embracing collaboration across borders and gaining advantage from insights allowed due to using open-source software. Another way to improve the AI skills crisis is to tap into this decentralized network of data professionals.
There’s clearly not one way to solve the AI skills crisis. It will require a multipronged approach over a period of time and the approach will evolve over time. While there is no easy solution, all companies who plan to use AI today or in the future must consider how they will attack the AI talent gap.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/06/25/the-ai-skills-crisis-and-how-to-close-the-gap/,Enterprise & Cloud,The AI Skills Crisis And How To Close The Gap,False,,,,,,,,,

The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the major contributors here. At its core, IoT is all about connected devices equipped with sensors and microchips that help transmit data via the Internet over a centralized platform for enhanced efficiency and performance. Estimates suggest that by 2020, the number of connected devices all over the world will be nearly 50 billion.SourceAs the number of connected devices continues to escalate rapidly, there will arise the need to manage and analyze the sheer amount of data generated by these devices. This data is crucial as it holds valuable insights and patterns that can help businesses and organizations to assess potential risks, find new business opportunities, and most importantly improve the overall functioning and productivity of organizations. Now, this is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) come in. AI and ML technologies allow data scientists to delve deep into massive volumes of data and uncover meaningful insights from it. Stressing the importance of AI for IoT and machines, Prof. John McCarthy aptly stated:“The goal of AI is to develop machines that behave as though they were intelligent.”Although at a developing phase, AI has already started creating job prospects in the global market. Capgemini reports that nearly 83% of organizations leveraging AI technologies maintain that new jobs have begun to crop up in the field of AI. With more and more organizations joining the bandwagon of Big Data and AI, there’s now an enormous demand for skilled data professionals such as data scientists, data engineers, data analysts, and much more.SourceGetting your career started in AI has become much more convenient now that the internet is swarming with highly educative and informative online Artificial Intelligence courses. These courses are specially tailored to introduce aspiring students to the basic concepts of AI such as algorithms, natural language processing, etc., and gradually progress towards the more complex concepts such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning. If you’re even remotely related to the tech-scene, it’s recommended you go through these courses and improve your employability. Because, as it must be clear by now, organizations far and wide are constantly on a lookout for up-skilled data professionals. There couldn’t be a better time for you to start than now!SourceRole Of Computation In Management Of DataToday, data is exponentially increasing — nearly 2.5 quintillions of data is generated daily! In a data-driven world that we live in, this data is the source of all information. However, managing such massive volumes of data is a challenge in itself. Thanks to high-end computing processes we’re able to store, process, and analyze this data to reveal the hidden trends and insights that can enhance business operations, improve the quality of life, and most importantly, foster innovation.SourceComputers can process and analyze data much more quickly and accurately than humans and hence, are immensely helping companies leverage the data at their disposal to calculate vital statistics, monitor employee performance, power automation, boost productivity and sales, improve the efficiency of machines, and much more. It is because of this computation power that organizations today have access to an extensive range of statistical and technical insights and figures. Furthermore, technologies such as cloud computing have enhanced the functionality of AI. For instance, industrial magnates like Netflix and Amazon rely on cloud-based frameworks to process AI tasks and services that demand comprehensive analysis and computing.Data Infrastructure and Artificial IntelligenceData infrastructure is an essential aspect of data processing and analysis. Businesses and organizations cannot create value out of data without having the proper data infrastructures. By data infrastructure, we mean the entire backend computing support system required to process, store, transfer, and safeguard data.While many companies use a software-defined infrastructure (SDI) to support the dynamic IT environment, SDI has its backlogs. Not only is SDI constrained by the static source code, but its functioning also largely depends on the skills and expertise of the software developer who writes the codes for a particular environment. Thus, SDI is not ‘intelligent.’ The trend is now shifting towards Artificial Intelligence defined infrastructures (ADI).Essentially, ADI is an intelligent upgrade of SDI, fully stacked with sophisticated AI and ML algorithms that can ‘learn’ from the existing information to automatically build self-healing frameworks. ADI can:Constantly analyze the dynamic behavior of all the components of the existing infrastructure and ‘learn’ to understand their working by itself.Create an error-free environment by proactively monitoring the functioning of the components of the infrastructure and autonomously taking actions to fix issues, if any.Deploy resources according to the requirements of the workload and also de-allocate particular resources when they are no longer required.These data infrastructures help support various AI-related technologies and application, including:Support for existing frameworks: A data infrastructure should incorporate AI frameworks like TensorFlow, Caffe, Theano, and Torch to enhance and support the present framework. However, the focus should not rely solely on AI frameworks but it should be such that it can fit the requirements and interests of software developers.GPU-friendly environment: To ensure the seamless processing of AI tasks and processes, data infrastructure must support GPU environments having impressive computational power. Microsoft’s N-series GPU instances is an excellent example of thisAI-optimized management environment and tools: The lack of proper management environment and tools for supporting and running AI applications is one of the most significant drawbacks of the present data infrastructures. Hence, it is essential to integrate the right management tools and environment to deliver optimal performance.Machine Reasoning: Machine Reasoning in an integral part of AI environment. Machine reasoning algorithms allow AI environment to keep up with the dynamic trends of infrastructures and technologies, thereby providing meaningful insights into the best course of action.Importance Of Organizational Skills In The Implementation Of AIMerely investing in and leveraging AI technologies isn’t enough. Companies and businesses require a talent pool of professionals who can employ these AI tools in a way that can ensure the best possible results. As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to penetrate industries and businesses across the globe, there’s an increasing need to rethink the entire leadership and thought-process of an organization, right from product strategy and customer experience to finding ways to boost the productivity of human capital. Leaders of the business world have to encourage intelligent AI integration within their system by:Putting People FirstInvesting in AI technologies alone will reap no results. Businesses have to invest in their employees as well proportionately. According to Missy Cummings, Director of Humans & Autonomy Lab, Duke University,“The future of AI is supporting and augmenting human capabilities such that a human-AI team is stronger than either alone.”Cultivating A Work Culture Of LearningBeing a developing field, AI demands constant training and learning to keep up with the innovations and changes it is bringing about today. In the future, AI will bring in new changes in the field of technology and only by encouraging and creating a work environment of constant learning and training can organizations keep up with the innovations of AI.Foster Transparency In Business OperationsOrganizations should strive to maintain and push for transparency in all aspects of their business. Leaders and managers should engage in open communication with employees about their approaches to AI. This will not only help gain their trust and confidence but will also boost their morale and motivate them to work harder.Alain Dehaze, CEO of The Adecco Group, maintains:“Augmented intelligence, blending human input and AI, will be the critical driver to succeed in business and to form a prosperous society. We are on the cusp of technological change unlike any we have seen before in human history. Technological advancement is requiring a deeper focus on innately human skills — critical thinking, emotional intelligence and value judgments.”Having the right data infrastructure along with the proper set of organizational skills can thus, help businesses and organizations leverage artificial intelligence tools and technologies in the right way.",,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-need-for-data-infrastructure-for-best-utilization-of-artificial-intelligence-72612c1026e0,,The Need For Data Infrastructure For Best Utilization Of Artificial Intelligence,,2018-06-25T12:46:58.848Z,72612c1026e0,['Vivek Kumar'],,,,,,

Although I am certain that work will change in many ways, either rapidly or slowly, I don’t think all robotization’s impacts will be entirely adverse.Pessimists predict that technological advances will benefit corporations, not workers. The way they see it, robotization in the manufacturing and service sectors will allow companies to lay off people and destroy jobs en masse. I believe artificial intelligence (AI) will create an abundance of new jobs, positions and professional roles.As robotization spreads far and wide, even the most advanced machines will still be defect prone. They will require software updates, and parts and equipment that will have to be manufactured and fitted. Therefore, sooner or later, a great number of robot specialists, who today do not make up even one percent of the workforce, will have to enter the labor market. Certain industries stand to benefit from this process sooner than others; the automotive industry, transport, logistics, electronics, robotics, and renewables. New manufacturers, engineers, maintenance experts and professionals, equipped with novel skills will join the labor force in great numbers, finding jobs in new companies. Studies show that for every robot brought into use, an average of three new jobs will be created.Chatbot Conference 2018Learn from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and More.chatbotslife.comSo, call me a realistic optimist.A modest proposal: The robot taxAs I reviewed the literature on how the labor market may be affected by automation and robotization, I came across an intriguing suggestion by the journalist Ben Tarnoff in The Guardian, “Robots won’t just take our jobs — they’ll make the rich even richer.” Despite the headline, the author is not downbeat about the future. He identifies solutions for mitigating the downsides of robotization, while allowing that new technologies, which may foster substantial societal growth, will also entail threats unless politicians and economists adopt adequate regulations. Critics of today’s technologies forget that no change — especially the kind of change that affects entire job markets — can be undertaken without putting in place proper regulatory and legislative mechanisms. That the technological revolution requires legislative support should be obvious.Without a political remedy, one dire possible future described by Tarnoff imagines the professional and social death of many groups. As technologies are perfected, and human labor accounts for an ever-lower share of the cost of capital creation, companies earn more money, but the benefits do not trickle down to the worker. Rising profits resulting from greater efficiencies are pocketed by investors and business owners without corresponding increases in wages, training, or employee growth opportunities. This process leads to the wealthy isolating themselves in luxurious guarded enclaves, leaving the jobless members of the lower and middle classes to radical resorts, including violent ones. In this bleak scenario, technology becomes a political shaper of dystopia. Is there a political instrument that could prevent this apocalyptic scenario from emerging? Tarnoff believes a robot tax could raise enough revenue to retrain displaced workers and/or supply them with basic income. This is a conclusion arrived at by EU politicians in France, as well as Bill Gates.Trending AI Articles:1. Machines Demonstrate Self-Awareness2. Visual Music & Machine Learning Workshop for Kids3. Part-of-Speech tagging tutorial with the Keras Deep Learning libraryNow, some bad newsAccording to some studies, there is a 50% chance that the devices and machines that rely on artificial intelligence will be able to perform allhuman jobs within the next 45 years, and that every job will be automated within 120 years. Oxford University Professor Michael Osbourne, who specializes in machine learning, believes that machines will replace roughly 47% of our jobs in the next two decades, leaving half the population with nothing to do. In the United States, automation will destroy an estimated 9.1 million jobs by 2025. The estimated number of jobs that potentially may be eliminated in Japan is 55%, 52% in India, 51% in China and 46% in the United States.In my view, these numbers are still too low.Picture 1: Technical automation potential of a global economy varies among countries. Source: McKinsey Global InstituteOf course, discussing the labor market demands a broader perspective to account for the nature of the work performed, worker education, and other factors. That all matters. The data below make it clear that the negative effects of robotization and automation will be felt unequally by profession. Drivers, for example, should worry, given the rapid advances in autonomous vehicle technology. On the other hand, doctors, lawyers and teachers will probably be safe. Indeed, jobs where human interactions, creativity and emotional intelligence matter should not be endangered. Technology may, in fact, offer these professionals tremendous opportunities to enhance their performance.Picture 2: 60% of all occupations have at least 30% technically automatable activities. Source: McKinsey Global InstituteThe learning machine must be taughtAs robotization advances, demand for new technical skills is bound to grow. A very interesting category of new professionals will be trainers responsible for teaching entire AI systems. These professionals will combine the competencies of programmers, psychologists and coaches. Even today, Google employs specialists whose main responsibility is to teach algorithm-based devices to work faster and more efficiently. Such trainers will work with algorithms and neural networks to ensure that they understand and mimic human behavior ever better. Chatbots, i.e. tools posed to dominate the customer service industry, must be trained to interact with humans to make communication natural. That means covering a whole range of behaviors, including human emotions. Algorithms need to be trained to respond appropriately to complications in human lives. For example, if I lose some documents in a robot-run hotel in the middle of nowhere, the first interaction I am going to have will probably be with a chatbot or a physical robot behind the front desk. Its job won’t be just to find my documents; it will be to calm me down, examine the facts, guide me, support me psychologically and refer me to whoever can solve my problem. Interactions with machines are going to be our future. Special trainers will be needed to ensure such interactions are not devoid of human emotions. These trainers will also be employed by corporations producing personal assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa who asks us about our health and how we feel. And, by the way, all this raises doubts about the claim that machines will never be able to experience human emotions and feelings. But that deserves a separate article.Ethicists of a new eraSince early last year, the European Union has been preparing regulations designed to keep consumers safe from the undesirable actions of AI. The new laws (which may take effect this year), are intended to create rules to protect people harmed by devices that rely exclusively on algorithms. The new legislation will also regulate how our personal data may be made available to machines. And, by the way, this development will create demand for new competencies and new jobs. People will be tasked with monitoring chatbot-generated content and robot performance. New ethicists will thus check applications and machines for possible legal complications. They are likely to be in high demand in telecommunications and automated customer support. Even today, ethicists are being hired by Google (a special DeepMind Ethics and Society unit has been set up in London to address a wide range of ethical issues associated with AI). Ethicists will be needed by all companies that rely on robots, bots or virtual assistants to make their products or render their services.Feeding the machinesAll artificial intelligence relies on processing massive amounts of data. Those data need to be delivered to the machines. Facial-recognition devices, for instance, rely on large collections of photographs. One future job will involve gathering data and feeding them to machines and other devices that require large and varied data sets. The demand for data feeders may give rise to a whole new industry that will create jobs in great numbers.Picture 3: Artificial Intelligence and automation will create demand for new jobs. Source: McKinsey analysisTechnology changes everythingWhile I have only offered a few examples, I am confident there is going to be no limit to the demand for new specialists.The voyage toward artificial intelligence is complex. To say that the automation of business processes will inevitably disrupt public order is to argue the obvious, but that’s only half the story. Clearly, claiming that for every job lost to a robot three will be gained ignores the fact that those three will not be suitable for all the workers displaced. What is certain, however, is that AI will create opportunities for millions of people, liberating them from rote work, motivating them to acquire new knowledge, inspiring them to take on new intellectual challenges and enabling them to learn new things. A new technology that helps advance evolution is neither good nor evil; the potential for both is always there. Which way it goes is up to us.Picture 4: Recently published reports key findings on the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on the jobs market.

Benjamin is a genius who may have created a film that’s going to be a cringe classic for years to come. Zone Out has all the makings of one – hilariously bad dialogue, an absolutely bizarre plotline, distorted characters, an ominously sappy soundtrack and, to wrap it all up, just the best demonic robot laughing you’ll ever hear. If you’ve ever wondered what the end of the world will sound like, we’re pretty sure that robotic laughter is it.But there’s something else that’s special about Zone Out that will ensure the timelessness of the film. Benjamin is not a human or a collective. Benjamin is an Artificial Intelligence programme that wrote, performed, directed, scored and edited the entire film.

Zone Out.The idea was the brainchild of Los Angeles-based director Oscar Sharp and Ross Goodwin, a creative technologist at Google. The pair had previously used Benjamin to make another short film, Sunspring  In that film, they used real actors and Benjamin carried much less of the load. This time, they decided to let Benjamin do just about everything.

Sunspring.Sharp told Wired, “What I was really trying to do is attempt to automate each part of the human creative process to see if we learn anything about what it really is to be a human person creating films.”Like the last time, the short film was created as an entry in the Sci-Fi-London 48-Hour Challenge, which demands that the film be produced in 48 hours while adhering to specific prompts. Thus, we get contorted faces, an incoherent story, incomprehensible dialogue like “There must be some business in my compass” and casual exchanges like: “Are you sure you need a problem?” “I’m not certain, I don’t remember the loss of a substance.”Sharp and Goodwin provided Benjamin entire films from the public domain – The Last Man on Earth and The Brain That Wouldn’t Die – to which the programme added faces of the human actors from Sunspring, using face-swapping technology and dialogue using voice-generation technologies. The programme also wrote the screenplay, put together the footage, and created the melancholic piano score.Here’s the behind-the-scenes film of Zone Out.

The agreement was signed on Friday. Seven other companies have already set up their units at the park and are carrying out researches in tandem with IIT-B.According to the statement issued by the institute, the unit will carry out research work on game automation using machine learning and artificial intelligence. “We look forward to its success, and we are expecting quality output from the collaboration,” said Devang Khakhar, the director of IITB.Khakhar added that the institute has started work on a new facility for the research park — a 14-storey building spread over 400,000 sqft. “We expect it to be ready over the next couple of years.”Managing director of Ubisoft India Jean-Phillipe Pieuchot said that they were hoping to forge a strategic partnership with the institute. “It will take time, but the association will reap dividends in the long run,” said Pieuchot.Elaborating on the nature of the collaboration, Pieuchot said that they will be harnessing data scientists, technology and engineering prowess of the institute.Ubisoft said that it is looking to collaborate with other institutions as well but that its relationship with IIT-B remains unique, adding that India is poised to become a global leader in video game production.“The benefits of developing this technology is not just limited to video games but will have implications in other fields as well. For example, VR (virtual reality) was first developed for video games but is used in several other industries now. The same will be applicable for AI (artificial intelligence),” said an official associated with the project.█  According to the statement issued by the institute, the unit will carry out research work on game automation using machine learning and artificial intelligence.

A large number of Americans would jump at the opportunity to do something else for a living. Going through the motions of performing the same tasks every single day of the work week for what feels like an eternity can get pretty boring. These days, we rely on frequent stimulation and tend to lose focus without it.
As businesses and industries count on our manpower to sustain profits and keep growing, human beings are indispensable to the economy. So where would the global conglomerates and multi-national brands be without the power of the common workforce? It is not as if there is an alternative, right?
Wrong. Robot workers are inevitable. If you think that your job is safe as your occupation is not considered manual labor, then you may want to read up on something called Artificial Intelligence (AI)[wiki]. The fact is that AI will almost certainly replace a wide number of roles which are currently filled by humans in the next couple of decades. Jobs such as personal assistants to cab drivers appear likely to be allocated to innovative AI software and pioneering mechanics.
So, before you quit your job and jump into a new profession for the rest of your days, consider these 7 jobs which may be a better bet in the long run.



1. Journalists
OK, so there was that Los Angeles Times article written by AI. For some out there, this passage proves that AI can one day take over the world of journalism:
  “A shallow magnitude 4.7 earthquake was reported Monday morning five miles [8km] from Westwood, California, according to the US Geological Survey. The temblor occurred at 6.25am Pacific time at a depth of 5.0 miles. According to the USGS, the epicenter was six miles from Beverly Hills, California, seven miles from Universal City, California, seven miles from Santa Monica, California, and 348 miles from Sacramento, California. In the past 10 days, there have been no earthquakes magnitude 3.0 and greater centered nearby. This information comes from the USGS Earthquake Notification Service and this post was created by an algorithm written by the author.” 
While this is impressive in any language, it is essentially a clump stats and figures compiled into reports. The act of editorializing information is not something which AI will likely be able to pull off convincingly.
More importantly, a network of information which the human race relies on to formulate opinions and to live by, generated and controlled by AI, is the stuff of nightmares. Objectivity is meant to be the foundation of news. Investigative journalism, challenging the status quo, and pushing for justice against those who have the money to buy their way out of trouble – and to provide the info which holds them in good light – would be a thing of the past.

2. Artists & Photographers
Is it a far stretch to argue that AI could not produce incredibly intricate and detailed artwork? No, it is not. Even the most basic mechanical invention could produce “artwork” deemed interesting enough to be adorned on a wall of a modern art gallery anywhere in the world.
Attach a can of paint to a broom handle, tie it with rope to an old tumble drier, place a canvas on the floor and turn the drier on: you have a piece to compete with many pieces of “art” which currently sell for thousands in hip galleries in the major cities on the globe.
When it comes to fine art and soulful human expression, things become a little more difficult. Can you imagine AI capturing the delicate beauty of photography? It would be highly unlikely for AI to find a way to create anything like the chaotic, bluesy guitar playing of a Jimi Hendrix, or the heartbreaking yet earth-shattering vocals of Chris Cornell. Although Japan is doing its best to make human musicians a thing of the past, humans will always have a place in art.

3. Judges
Once again, we come back to human emotions: empathy and compassion. There are myriad circumstances involved in complex legal matters, and to think of a robotic judge passing down a long custodial sentence in a highly publicized and polarizing civil-rights case could end up in a situation which makes the Watts Riots look like a Sunday morning softball game.
A judge is appointed to their position as a highly educated practitioner of law, and an esteemed member of society. The Judge-O-Bot 5000 is not something which any human would surely fancy their chances of coming up against, innocent or guilty.
To justify the use of AI in a courtroom would invariably lead to questions about the ability of AI software to perform duties which have historically been assigned to the most honorable among us. Being judged by a computer program for an unexplainable, impulsive, (and above all) human action or reaction is unimaginable.
4. Doctors, Psychiatrists, & Dentists
Make no mistake AI has a very important future in medicine and surgery. In an explicitly logical sense, a computer algorithm working alongside body scanners, for example, may be able to identify certain illnesses and ailments which the human brain could crucially miss.
Although this is the case, if you can envisage the robot from Rocky 4 rolling in with a stethoscope around its neck, informing you that you need a double-leg amputation and don’t feel a little weirded out, you may be on your own. Humans are highly unlikely to be pushed out of healthcare altogether.


In fact, roles like doctors and psychiatrists seem pretty safe from the threats of an all-out, AI takeover. This is due to the lack of empathy and understanding of complex human emotions which are vital parts of the role.
In the case of psychologists, it seems unlikely that there would be much demand for a computer program breaking down our complex emotional issues. It would be incredibly strange to act out on advice from an AI psychologist on relationship problems, or the deep-seated resentment of parents and siblings, given that it is essentially a computer program with no concept of human feelings.

5. Priests & Religious Leaders
Spiritual leaders being replaced by Artificial Intelligence? While pretty much every comedian active today would be able to write an hour-long special about this subject alone, there is more chance of Elvis Presley popping up in a Drake video.
The idea is ridiculous enough on paper without fantasizing about all the things which could conceivably go wrong if this were to happen. Imagine the turning up for church every week to be greeted by a mechanical priest, pastor, or imam. Conveying the message that we are all made in the image of the lord would surely lead to some awkward and suspicious glances from the pews.
There is a chance that the robotic man of God could malfunction, tossing chalices and candles into the poor unsuspecting faces of parishioners before combusting into a ball of flames as churchgoers toss holy water…
It’s not going to happen.

6. Teachers
  “A can of WS-40 a day keeps the teacher away…” 
There is scope to suggest that AI will have a massive impact on the classroom in the future. Leaning aids, teacher’s assistants, and other technology seems certain to help the kids of the future pick up their times tables and American history in a different way to millennials.
To suggest that there will be no place for teachers is another thing. Teachers, like judges, doctors, and priests, are important to society for more than their basic job description. There are a number of human qualities which make a great teacher, and, while it is conceivable for a number of AI teacher models to emerge in the coming years, parents are highly unlikely to feel comfortable allowing their offspring to be taught by a computer program. Instead of that, sites like Udemy.com are getting much more popularity for only one reason. Because a human teacher is the creator of each online courses.


That word comes to mind again, “compassion.” These human emotions and interpersonal skills are, for now, impossible to replicate with AI.
7. Athletes
If you want to see the 100 Meters run in 0.7 seconds, robot athletes may be for you. How about a UFC fight between the best AI geared machines from the USA and Japan? Or the Superbowl contested between the Arizona Androids and the Chicago Cyborgs?
It would be boring, though, wouldn’t it? After a while, the novelty would wear off and you would be left with machinery.
The reason humans over the years fell in love with the likes of Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, and Serena Williams was for the different qualities they brought to their respective sports. The pioneering movement, the grace, the determination, grit, unrelenting dedication, and ability to overcome almost impossible boundaries made them seem superhuman. Super-human.

Conclusion: AI doesn’t have all skills like human
These skills and qualities are what make the greats stand out. Factor in their charisma and stellar personalities, while you’re at it. These things are not easily broken down programmable, as if they were, we would surely already know about it.
Oh yeah, and the trash talk would be unbearable.
