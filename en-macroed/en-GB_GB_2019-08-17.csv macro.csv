If you follow the hype, Artificial Intelligence Is The Next Big Thing. Our houses, our cars, our toasters, all of these seem to be teeming, even overflowing with intelligence, like some great fungus gone amuck. AI is here to stay, and you need it, right now!


Okay, that may be a bit overblown, to the extent that it is worth asking what exactly all this artificial intelligence stuff is, and whether it may actually not be as great as everyone claims it is (nor as bad as everyone fears, if you take the opposite stance that AI is going after everyone's jobs).

A bit of a history lesson then is in order. Artificial intelligence as a concept has been around for as long as humans have been telling stories. Singing swords, enchanted items, the various stuff of magic is a way of ascribing intelligence and free agency to inanimate objects. Hephaestus, the Greek god of the forge, supposedly created bronze handmaidens to help him when he was crafting the weapons of the gods. Talos, the Bronze automata that Hephaestus created to protect the isle of Crete featured as one of the more gripping stories in the tales of Jason and the Argonauts, where Jason and his men were only able to defeat him by taking off the oil cap on his ankle (the original Achilles heel) and letting the oil drain out.

Much more recently, in the 1950s, a team of researchers led by Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy established what would in time become the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Minsky himself was a controversial figure during his life (he died in 2016). He was reponsible for one of the first neural networks, an algorithm that roughly modeled the way a limited number of neurons worked in the brain, but his criticisms of the theories of others such as Frank Rosenblatt's works on what the latter referred to as Perceptrons and his attempt to downplay what AI could do dampened investor interest in AI dramatically, leading eventually to what has since become known as the AI Winter that lasted through much of the 1960s and 70s.

In retrospect, this may not have been a bad thing. Minsky was correct in his assessment that computing power was insufficient at the time for AI to really work, and it would take the compounding factor of Gordon Moore's doubling of processing power every eighteen months another thirty years to reach a stage where the computers were beginning to have the horsepower to explore neural networks to a reasonable level. Ironically, Rosenblatt's perceptron would end up figuring prominently in that, along with the growing realization that non-linear mathematics would be at the heart of that.

Indeed, this was one of Minsky's key arguments in the book that he and psychologist Nicolas Papert wrote, that the perceptron was a non-linear approach, and hence not solvable with technology of the time.The bulk of all computational analysis tools are essentially linear - even data science problems can ... [+] generally be solved by someone with a high school mathematics background and enough persistence.Getty
Moving Beyond Linearity
Linearity is a mathematical concept that has a few different meanings. At its simplest, it means that you can solve problems using variations off of y=a*x + b. For instance, the relationship between temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius is given as C = (5/9) * (F - 32). More generally, it means that you can transform formulas in such a way that the transformed formula has this kind of relationship. Exponential and logarithmic equations are often handled this way, and, if complex numbers (real + imaginary numbers) are used, this also includes trigonometric functions like sines and cosines.
All of these happen (not coincidentally) to be solutions of linear differential equations in calculus, which means among other things, they can be solved exactly, and can be solved with comparatively little problem using numerical methods. Because they describe the behavior of a lot of engineering systems at a fundamental level, mathematicians work very hard to take problems and make them linear.
Non-linear equations, on the other hand, describe a much wider domain of problems, but usually the solutions cannot be transformed into a linear equation, making it harder to solve. For instance, Newton's equations of motions describe the behavior of perfect objects - a hockey puck on ice, for instance, will stay at the same velocity it was hit until it encounters a barrier.Non-linear systems are typically chaotic, forming intra-dimensional fractals and solutions that ... [+] cannot be readily expressed functionally. Most of the core artificial intelligence technologies are non-linear, typically because they are recursive.Getty

However, the same hockey puck on concrete will slow down dramatically, will hop about, and will spin. Why? Friction. Once you introduce friction into the equation, that equation goes non-linear, and it becomes considerably harder to predict its behavior. They become much more sensitive to initial conditions, and can often become discontinuous so that for two points that are more or less next to one another in the source, the resulting function maps them in ways that result in them being nowhere near one another in the target.
The simplest example of this is the hyperbolic equation: y = 1/x. As you get closer to x on the positive size, the value of y goes up, while it goes down for the corresponding negative values of x. At x = 0, the equation is meaningless. This is called a discontinuous function, and it's the bane of mathematicians and physicists everywhere.
There is, however, another class of functions called higher order functions, in which the output of a function is then used as the input to that same function. For instance, suppose that you have a function y = f(x) = x + 1. When x = 0, y =1, a nice simple linear equation. However, f(f(0) = f(1) = 2, f(f(f(0) = 3 and so forth. This is an example of a recursive function.
Non-linear recursive functions tend to produce a cloud of discontinuous points, but the intriguing thing, first discovered by meteorologist Edward Lorentz in 1971, was that if you ran enough points, the cloud would converge upon an orbit that was not quite re-entrant, what he dubbed a strange attractor.
Based upon the work of Lorenz and his own research on the similarity of the stock market movement to the shape of coastlines, mathematician Benoit Manderlbrot popularized the visualizations of non-linear equations by calling them ""fractals"", because they exhibited characteristics similar to the linear-dimensions (dot,line,plane,space, hyperspace) that we're familiar with, but fell somewhere in between these dimensions.
Fractals for a while become a popular field for mining for computer screen backgrounds before the craze finally died down, but unbeknownst to most, they would find a second life in the world of computing as the research into neural networks began to encounter the increased speed and memory availability of computing systems.Text analytics has long been statistical in nature, but because of the non-linearity of language, ... [+] the need for something that moves beyond statistics is more and more pressing.Getty
Text Analytics In A Non-Linear World
However, another diversion is necessary to get there. Linguistic computing has long been something of a backwater in the computing science field. As computers went from large vacuum tube systems down to notebooks and ultimately cell phones and tablets, the urge to talk to (okay, scream at) your computer has, if anything, only become stronger over time. Similarly, there are many tasks associated with curating books and magazine articles - determining salient points, common topics and summarizing - that are both time intensive and require a great deal of skill to do well. If we could get computers to read and summarize (or even more powerfully read and translate) on the fly, it would solve one of the biggest headaches in almost any organization: being able to find the information that you need in media.
There is a whole field that has been around since the 1960s called textual analysis, which involves the use of statistical functions in order to determine the thematic similarity between two works. It's success has been mixed - the search capabilities that these bring is far better than the manual efforts of a legion of librarians manually summarizing, but relevancy is still pretty poor.
In most cases, what is actually used in such systems are indexes, typically with some kind of strength indicator between words and phrases, coupled with where these are located. The statistics are (mostly) linear, but it means in general that there are significant limitations to what can be interpreted.
Semantic solutions are defined by graphs of interconnected content. As with non-linear computation, ... [+] semantic networks (which are often used to model language) are fractal in nature.Getty
Tim Berners-Lee , the creator of the first web browser, client and communication protocol that underlies the Internet, started this effort primarily as a way to make it easier to find documents at CERN in Switzerland. By tagging content and building in metadata directly in the documents, Berners-Lee was able to make the documents more machine readable.
He came back to this theme a decade and a half later, and realized that he could use a similar approach with any kind of data. The big difference was that he realized that the information in a ""data document"" could be broken down into an interconnected graph network of simpler assertions. Each node became an identifier of an entity or concept, each edge a vector that described a relationship with other nodes.
This ""graph"" view provided a number of huge advantages over traditional databases. First, metadata about something could be added simply by creating an link to from the metadata back to the item in question. Second, a resource could have more than one value for a given property without the requirements of building a whole table. Finally, it became much easier to abstract out patterns of behavior in the data using the metadata, patterns that could be traversed recursively.
Notice a pattern beginning to develop here? Recursion is difficult to do in a relational database, so there are very few recursive design patterns. With one query, you can essentially reproduce a family tree when working on a graph, you can traverse across the graph without necessarily knowing the next adjacent nodes, and you can merge multiple graphs together without duplication.
This can be used to provide searches based upon connections - search for Batman and you get superhero as a concept, and from this can search through all black (or dark gray) wearing caped crusaders. This is difficult to do with a relational database. It can be done with an XML or JSON database, but in general neither of these is very good at managing references to other entities.
The advantage of working with graphs of information is that the information gets atomized and refactored as distinct properties, often buildable from other properties. In effect, you're dealing with multi-dimensional data, and can even change the categories that different facets of the data have dynamically. Finally, you can detect patterns based upon clusters of data dynamically, without necessarily knowing a priori what properties you're working with. This means that the data can, over time, become self-organizing.
These types of graph databases are known as knowledge graphs. There are other forms of graph data stores that are optimized for different kinds of processing, but most of them work on the idea that information is stored in a graph or mesh connecting entities with relational information.Artificial Intelligence is systemic computing, complex non-linear networks in which the most ... [+] important characteristics are the emergent ones.Getty
Wheels Within Wheels
Approaching 2020, artificial intelligence seems to have several key factors:


Recursion (non-linear processing) is used to create multiple levels of abstraction,
Information is worked on holistically - at any given point information is determined primarily by context, but context switching between and along abstraction layers is a critical part of finding and transforming content.
Categorization is an integral part of the process, with categories coming into existence as a utility to perform certain operations before disappearing once again.
The graph of information is constantly changing in response to filters that are themselves dynamically generated based on existing information.
Intelligence is nodal but also distributed and stochastic - the information that you have in the system is never complete nor totally comprehensive, and decisions can only be made when a tipping point of facts confirming or denying a certain query are reached (information becomes stochastic).
At any given point, information exists in a model, but that model is itself flexible and has the potential to be self-modifying. This is unlike existing systems where the model is usually predetermined.


I think these all fit into our current definition of artificial intelligence, but there's an additional definition that is only beginning to emerge:


The system has a certain degree of self-awareness.


I add this final point with some trepidation, but I think that it is important. Awareness comes in the ability to detect anomalous patterns that threaten the fidelity of the data, actions that are potentially destructive, and actions that incentivize more efficient storage or access of information. Self-healing data systems are one such form of awareness. Systems that are able to determine (and later counter) unwanted bias are another. Once you have a data system that is capable of rejecting data not because of syntactical issues but because the provenance of that data ""tastes funny"", you have a system that is beginning to become self-aware.
There's another important point here that may not have been obvious - artificial intelligence is not an algorithm. It is a network of databases that uses both data science algorithms (which are mostly linear in the broader sense) and higher order functions (recursion and fractal analysis) to change the state of itself in real time.
I think this also sidesteps the Turing Test problem, which basically says an artificial intelligent system is one in which it becomes indistinguishable from a human being in terms of its ability to hold a conversation. That particular definition is too anthropocentric. To be honest, there are a great number of human beings who would appear to be incapable of holding a human conversation - look at Facebook. If anything, the bots are smarter.
The above set of definitions are also increasingly consistent with modern cognitive theory about human intelligence, which is to say that intelligence exists because there are multiple nodes of specialized sub-brains that individually perform certain actions and retain certain state, and our awareness comes from one particular sub-brain that samples aspects of the activity going on around it and uses that to synthesize a model of reality and of ourselves. We even have a pretty good idea how to turn that particular node on or off, via general anesthesia. The rest of the brain is still working, just the part that is your consciousness is temporarily 404'd.With these criteria, we can see artificial intelligence as the process of making things, both ... [+] physical and virtual, aware of themselves and their universe.Getty
Classifying AI
Within those definitions, there are a number of technologies that fall within the rubric of Artificial Intelligence:


Machine Learning. Data systems that modify themselves by building, testing and discarding models recursively in order to better identify or classify input data.
Reinforcement Learning. The use of rewarding systems that achieve objectives in order to strengthen (or weaken) specific outcomes. This is frequently used with agent systems.
Deep Learning. Systems that specifically rely upon non-linear neural networks to build out machine learning systems, often relying upon using the machine learning to actually model the system doing the modeling. It is mostly a subset of machine learning with a specific emphasis on neural nets.
Agent Systems. Systems in which autonomous agents interact within a given environment in order to simulate emergent or crowd based behavior. Used more and more frequently with games in particular, but is also used with other forms of simulations.
Non-Linear Grid Systems. A variation of agented systems in which cells in n-dimensional grids maintain internal state but also receive stimulae from adjacent cells and generate output to those cells. The distant ancestor of most of these is Conway's Game of Life, but the idea is used to a much higher degree of complexity with most weather and stock modeling systems that are fundamentally recursive.
Self-Modifying Graph Systems. These include knowledge bases and so forth in which the state of the system changes due to system contingent heuristics.
Knowledge Bases, Business Intelligence Systems and Expert Systems. These often form a spectrum from traditional data systems to aggregate semantic knowledge graphs. To a certain extent they are human curated, but some of this curation is increasingly switching over to machine learning for both classification, categorization and abstraction.
Chatbots and Intelligent Agents. This differs from agent systems. Agents in general are computer systems that are able to parse written or spoken text, use it to retrieve certain content or perform certain actions, and the respond using appropriately constructed content. The earliest such system, Eliza, dates back to the mid-1960s, but was very primitive. Today's agents and chatbots, on the other hand, use a combination of semantics, Bayesian analysis and machine learning to both build up the appropriate information and learn about the user.
Visual/Audio Recognition Systems. In most cases V/A systems work by converting the media in question to an encoded compressed form, then algorithms look via either indexes or machine learning systems for the closest matches. This is often enhanced with Bayesian Analysis, where specific patterns are analysed based upon their frequency of occurrence relative to one another, and are also often tied in with semantic systems that provide relationship information.
Fractal Visualization. The connection between fractals and AI runs deep, and not surprisingly one of the biggest areas for AI is in the development of parameterized natural rendering - the movement of water, the roar of fire, the coarseness of rock, the effects of smoke in the air, all of which have become standard fare in big Hollywood blockbusters.


It's also worth noting what aren't themselves AI systems, but often play in the same general ""space"":


Autonomous Vehicles. These make use of visual recognition systems and real time modeling in order to both anticipate obstacles (static and moving) and to determine actions based upon objectives.
Drones. A drone is an autonomous vehicle without a passenger, and can be as small as a dragonfly or as large as a jet. Drones can also act in a coordinated fashion, either by following swarm behavior (an agent system) or by following preprogrammed instructions.
Data Science / Data Analytics. This is the use of data to identify patterns or predict behavior. This uses a combination of machine learning techniques and numeric statistical analysis, along with an increasingly large roll for non-linear differential equations. The primary distinction is that most data scientist does not make heavy use of higher order functions or recursion, though again, this is changing.
Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers. Distributed ledger technology underlies electronic coinage, but it is also playing a bigger and bigger role in tracking resources and transactions. One aspect of such systems is that they make it possible to bind virtual objects as if they were unique physical objects, in effect making intellectual property exchangeable. This has application throughout the AI space, especially in the realm of agented systems, even if it is not AI per se.i
Internet of Things / Robotics. Internet of things is intended to provide network connectivity to devices so that they can communicate with other devices. Robotics involves creating autonomous physical agents capable of movement. In that both of these may end up managing their own state, relies upon AI-based systems for identifying signals and determining response, they use AI, but aren't directly AI.
GPUs. The Central Processing Unit is so last century. Artificial intelligence is taking advantage of Graph Processing Units in a big way, as their structure makes them ideal for both semantic analysis and recursive filter applications.


The modern high end camera is a good example of an AI-enabled device. The focusing system is essentially a robot - it has servos and actuators, it is capable of operation independent of a human host, its auto-focusing system involves a continuous feedback loop to determine the best focal length and exposure even before the picture is ""taken"", it makes use of light sensitive arrays that convert light into digital signals, it typically stores dozens or even hundreds of ""photos"" that it can then composite, and then has AI routines capable of removing red-eye, improve focusing and compensate for lighting conditions. In most cases these very complex operations are hidden from the user, who just know that they are taking better photographs than ever before.
As to where the line gets drawn between software and AI, the reality is that the line has been blurry and is becoming more so daily. The vanilla office suite - word processing documents, spreadsheets, presentation software and mail clients - would seem to be the last bastion of non-AI software, but in point of fact all of these packages learn from their users.
Clippy, the annoying pop-up sprite that defined an entire generation of Microsoft Office users, was AI, albeit a very primitive one. Clippy's descendents are busy at work pointing out editing problems and misspellings, making suggestions about different presentation styles, identifying patterns and suggesting better tools to solve problems. Excel's charting suite will create what it believes is the most suitable type of chart to display data, and will then factor in your own interests when you override it so next time it may be more inclined to use your charts of interest - and even note what color schemes you most like to work with.
Adobe Photoshop CS now has the ability to select figures of interest with a single menu click. Image recognition plays a big part in that capability, and increasingly that is also being tied back into semantic systems that will identify the person being selected and update the metadata so that photoshop files can be searched automatically for pictures of that person - all without the user being aware that anything is happening.
In other words, what is happening today is that while most of the software that users work with are not examples of artificial intelligence, AI is in the background, making suggestions, handling classification and identification, pulling together options for making decisions and in some cases making those decisions autonomously. This trend will only continue.AI is still evolving. AI is about making things both physical and virtual aware - of us, of ... [+] themselves, of the world at large.Getty
Summary
It can be argued that artificial intelligence isn't really a technology, per se, but is instead, at any given point, a set of future facing technologies that usually manifest near the end of an ascending business cycle. Some, like fully certified Level 5 autonomous vehicles, quantum communication systems and even artificial general intelligence (AGI) are years or decades in the future. However, seeds for these are being planted now, and it is likely, even if there is an economic downturn, that research will continue during the quiet periods.
So, one good way of thinking about artificial intelligence is that it is the process of teaching computers to deal with multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously. It's information processing gone fractal. And it is, ironically enough, here to stay.

LIKE other human champions facing a machine opponent, Grzegorz “MaNa” Komincz rated his chances. “A realistic goal would be 4-1 in my favour,” he told an interviewer before the match.
One of the world’s best players of video game StarCraft II, Komincz was at the height of a successful esports career. Artificial intelligence company DeepMind invited him to face its latest AI, a StarCraft II-playing bot called AlphaStar, on 19 December 2018.
Komincz was expected to be a tough opponent. He wasn’t. After being thrashed 5-0, he was less cocky. “I wasn’t expecting the AI to be that good,” he said. “I felt like I was learning something.”
It was just the latest in a series of unexpected victories for machines that stretch back to chess champion Garry Kasparov’s 1997 defeat by IBM’s Deep Blue. In 2017, another of DeepMind’s AIs, AlphaGo Master, beat the world number one Go player a decade before most researchers predicted it would be possible. The company’s AIs then mastered chess and StarCraft – a game played with dozens of different pieces with hundreds of moves a minute.
But this isn’t just a case of humans being humbled by superhuman AI. The real story is that each win gives us a glimpse of how AIs will make us superhuman too. That’s because thinking is set to become a double act. Working together, humans and AIs will bounce ideas back and forth, each guiding the other to better solutions than would be possible alone.
The potential goes far beyond games. The hope is that this teamwork will help us make vital breakthroughs in energy use, healthcare…

Are you ready for the robot invasion? Or are you just plain worried that your job will be automated away?
The age of artificial intelligence is not simply here but has permeated through our very existence already. From forecasting market trends to reordering your groceries that were going low to being delivered by drones, artificial intelligence is all around our lives and the way we do business. When we talk about artificial intelligence, its focus centers around adding and, more importantly, enhancing our current capabilities.
AI should be looked at as a way to increase what we currently do. To improve current performance, speed execution times and deliver greater value faster and more direct to our customers. So what would that mean for us as business analysts?











 
 
 
It begins with a great opportunity for us analysts! We get to take our tried and true skills and apply them in new contexts and environments and even emerging industries to uncover needs and see opportunities. Innovation is constantly happening, but the great successes are the ones that address critical problems. How do you know what’s a good problem that needs solving? You do some analysis work. Root cause analysis, process modeling and analysis, business rules analysis and data modeling can show where key aspects of organizations are under performing or even paralyzed by their own behavior.

Identifying these opportunities helps us open the doors to conversations with customers about what is possible. Then getting to expand our knowledge by learning new technologies, approaches and perspectives on how AI can be leveraged by organizations makes us great resources. We get to learn capabilities of new technologies to facilitate collaborative brainstorming sessions on how the new capacities can mean value for our organizations.
With this perspective, analysts need to be mindful of their time and, as always, focus on what key activities deliver the most value. What day-to-day activities could you automate so you spend more time facilitating collaborations, supporting decision making and understanding needs? This makes us then focus on what value we, as analysts, provide organizations. The automation of jobs is focused on removing the non-thinking aspects of work. Yes, there are amazing things that the AI and robotics and drones and other innovative technologies are doing, but first and foremost, having the power of computing to help daily activities is focused on what is repetitive.











 
 
 
What is redundant? What are the things we would often call monotonous? These are GREAT for automating!  And how do you know what these things are? That’s right – you have to do some business analysis! There is a great technique analysts use called decision modeling. The challenge many analysts have with this technique is that they find out that their stakeholders do not make decisions the same way all the time. When you can define rules that lead to patterns in behaviors and activities then you can start to leverage the AI technology. It still needs a foundation to start with and grow from.
Begin looking at your analysis activities: What work is repetitive? What decisions do you make daily? Again, start simple! Think about project management software that begins to notice patterns of status updates and deliverable timeframes so then starts creating reminders and building templates that make your work easier and faster. Then you can spend more time working with your stakeholders than working on your reports.
With the “easy” stuff being taken care of AI, we can then tackle the harder stuff, but that means we need to grow and improve our own skills. Our questions have to get better. Better questions on what the business wants to do. Better questions on what technology is now doing for us. Better questions on considering the possibilities.











 
 
 
As a business analyst, our focus is always on the right questions to determine through consensus, validation and verification activities what the right answers are for the organization at that point in time. Our questions need to have a focus beyond the current timeframe. Can we leverage what we’re doing today for tomorrow? For one year from now? For five years from now? Or can we constantly adapt our focus to meet the evolving landscape? Do you recognize the changes the consumer environments are going through and their perspective on getting their needs satisfied? Customers have gone from Uber to self-driving cars – do you really want to ask them to fill out a paper form?
If you haven’t already shifted your view to the consumer experience, now is the time. What questions can you think of to try to predict what your consumers and stakeholders want? What would they want a month from now? Six months?
Even more important, AI challenges us to not only ask questions of our customers, but ourselves. The biggest question people ask about with AI in many office jobs is what AI means to their livelihood. As business analysts, the same is true to us, we just need to use our own analysis skills. Consider asking yourself some serious questions. What are we doing to avoid becoming obsolete? Have you asked yourself today, what would prevent your role from being automated by a machine? Do you perform complex analysis work? What about your work and daily processes is programmable or repeatable? And more importantly what is not? Those things you could feed into a machine to do – get them off your plate.











 
 
 
Booking a flight, for example, may feel like a personal activity as you pick your timing, seat preference and favorite airlines. But all these preferences can still be elicited, captured and then fed into decision making models. Your actions, along with these models, can then be automated and even forecasted so that the work is now off your plate. But notice in here – requirements must still be elicited (preferences in this case), decisions need to be modeled and processes need to be captured.
Whether using technology to help you or not, the analysis work is still valuable but now must simply come from a new perspective and work in evolving context. Do not hold onto your techniques with such rigor you cannot apply them in new environments. Stay fluid in your approaches and grounded in the theory so that you can see possibilities while driving discussions forward.
We already know our analysis skills sets are valuable – we need to think though what they mean in this changing environment. This is where you want to shift your energies on growing your skills. Do you understand AI well enough that you can articulate its value to an organization? AI is still a ways away from telling businesses to buy new AI technology, but perhaps not that far off. WHY is AI important? What can it do for organizations?











 
 
 
Often the most valuable innovations are asking good questions about existing and often old problems rather than inventing new things. What challenges, inefficiencies and legacy components are holding your organization back? Perhaps these have to be addressed before AI technologies can be introduced? Or perhaps AI technologies can address these items themselves? How do we know? We have to do good analysis work.
In short, keep your skills sharp, continue to learn as much as you can and drive people to articulate what needs are not being satisfied today. Those needs are your opportunities for success!

We live in a world filled with technology that makes our lives easier every day. Drones deliver our packages, chatbots answer our questions online, and safety detection in vehicles help keep us safe. However, this era of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics comes at a price: large portions of the workforce are afraid they will lose their jobs because of advancing technology.
And while some positions do lend themselves to automation, not every role falls into this category. When it comes to positions that require problem-solving, leadership, and initiative, AI can never replace a valuable employee. Here are seven ways these employees bring value to businesses in ways that AI simply can’t:
1. Caring and Empathy
Today, robots can perform surgeries and therapy bots are now available to people seeking mental health assistance. However, nothing can replace the caring and empathy that a live person can extend. Caregivers, therapists, and doctors can show patients sincerity and empathy, which is something a machine can’t do—and likely won’t be able to emulate for another several years.
2. Self-Starting
Employees who take initiative and proactively look for areas of improvement are invaluable to their employers. They develop processes and train others, so the company works more efficiently and effectively. And once they master a skill, they consistently look for ways to improve processes even further. Fired-up employees are proactive and highly valuable to businesses.
Artificial intelligences could never be proactive or creative on its own. Image: Pixabay
AI may be good at processing commands and even identifying new trends or patterns, but it’s not at a point where it can find and start new tasks without some sort of prompt.
3. Creative Thinking
The human brain can take input from various outside influences to develop new, creative ideas. We can be inspired through music, poetry, art, or photography, and then channel that inspiration to develop business or product ideas. 
Companies need that kind of innovation to thrive. Creative employees help their companies to think bigger and sometimes completely out of the box. It’s in this atmosphere where new products are created, new ventures are discussed, and big growth can happen.
Creativity is one area where AI is still lacking. Machines can replicate media with greater accuracy in every subsequent iteration, but creating something new and unique is an ability humans still have a monopoly on.
4. Team Collaboration
Employees who work well with others can bring co-workers and multiple departments together to push the company toward a common goal. When employees feel the workplace is collaborative, they are more engaged—and a recent Gallup report found that teams with high employee engagement rates are 21% more profitable.
While AI programs may be receptive to direct feedback inputs, they lack the sense of human camaraderie that engenders feelings of real collaboration. So though a company might be able to run some processes without human workers, it would be hard to artificially replicate the feeling of real teamwork (and the benefits that come with it).
Collaboration, creativity and teamwork are inherent qualities of human workers. Image: pexels.
5. Role Adaptability
A good employee embraces change and adapts when it’s necessary for the good of the business. When an employee takes on work outside the scope of their position and quickly adjusts to shifting goals and assignments, that’s a huge benefit to employers, particularly in markets that change quickly and frequently.
Machines, on the other hand, are programmed for specific roles. If an industry shift requires a quick pivot in a new direction, tech often has to be deliberately redirected (or replaced) to keep up.
6. Community Contribution
Today’s businesses rely a lot on their communities—both local and online—to make money. Small businesses especially thrive in small, local towns and their homegrown wealth exchanges. Employees contribute to the local economy, which creates local jobs, helps the environment, and nurtures the community.
Robotics, machine learning, and AI cannot do this. In fact, companies that automate jobs out of existence run the risk of alienating their communities, which can lead to difficulty sustaining supply and demand.
7. Contextual Application
One of the most important factors in showing that people are more valuable than AI is that employees have real-life understanding of the business factors, situational circumstances, and other outside data that isn’t always given to the machine. Artificial intelligence is only as smart as the data it’s given; people, though, can account for things outside of data—the context of a situation.
While it is inevitable that technology will eliminate many occupations, it’s obvious that it will not take the place of every job. Creativity, ingenuity, and human nature are all things that machines cannot replicate at this time. Without input from people, AI can’t function as it’s supposed to.
There’s no doubt of AI’s impact on society: it’s making its mark, and things are changing fast. But smart tech is years away from overrunning the job market—just ask your smartphone assistant to weigh in on any subject tougher than the daily weather forecast if you need some reassurance.

The future of work
Executives who are early adopters of AI and cognitive analytics technologies continue to be enthusiastic supporters. According to Deloitte’s second edition of the State of AI in the Enterprise, these trailblazers are reporting substantial returns on initial AI projects and planning more projects for the future.1
AI and its ability to augment human workers is one of the most influential forces shaping the future of work. AI is nearing ubiquity in today’s economy, appearing in both the micro economies—the share of jobs requiring AI increased by 450 percent from 2013 to 20182—and macro economies—industry experts predict that AI deployment will add $15.7 trillion to the global GDP by 2030.3 Humans with machines, data with actions, companies with their customers. The future of artificial intelligence is now.

Lack of AI understanding
Access to talent is a major issue in this new age of humans with machines. The demand is especially intense for technical skills that don’t widely exist. Among the early adopters surveyed for the Deloitte's State of AI in the Enterprise study, lack of AI skills is a top-three concern for 31 percent.4
Clearly, organizations need to look at new ways of sourcing skills if they want to build future success on a foundation of analytics and AI technologies. Deloitte's 2019 Global Human Capital Trends report suggests several ways to tackle this, including finding ""gig workers"" in the alternative workforce and strategically leveraging technology, which can range from AI-driven chatbots to video interviews to targeted job advertising.5

Jobs of the future
A few examples of future jobs in the future of artificial intelligence:6

Cognitive work (re) designer. Redesign knowledge-based jobs and their underlying business processes to take advantage of technologies such as deep and machine learning, natural language processing and generation, and robotic process automation.
Renaissance worker. Combine technical expertise in one or more domains with expertise in design, project management, or client and customer interaction. Bring background in science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM), not just science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), fueled by art courses that add creativity and communication skills.
Digital twin engineer. Whether it’s a jet engine or a shop floor, create a virtual representation of both the physical elements and the dynamics of how an IoT-connected product operates and interacts with its environment and use machine learning to optimize product performance.

AI enhances, does not take away
While the very concept of a job—where it is done and by whom—is being redefined by such forces as the gig economy, proximity, and technology, there are fundamentals that contribute to a positive and fulfilling employee experience that remain constant. These include having meaningful work, a flexible work life fit, and opportunities to learn and perform activities that have an impact.
AI in the workplace has the potential to make jobs much more interesting for human workers by augmenting their tasks and freeing them to perform higher-level functions and make better-informed decisions. Artificial intelligence can spark new ways of working that blend the best of what machines do with what humans bring to this collaboration: experience, judgment, and empathy. In fact, 78 percent of executives surveyed believe that AI-based augmentation of workers will fuel new ways of working.

In the Age of With, which human skills are irreplaceable?
This is a fundamental question that leaders in business and academia are grappling with, and we are only beginning to get a sense of what the enduring human skills are in this nascent phase of human and machine collaboration.
Imagine that you are responsible for operations at a large manufacturer and you want to maximize the life of equipment parts while avoiding unnecessary downtime. In the past, your maintenance team relied on ""tribal knowledge"" estimates or doing an ongoing, in-depth analysis of each piece of equipment. Today smart factories can use machine-to-machine and machine-to-human communication with cognitive technologies to make timely, accurate decisions. This predictive maintenance raises thought-provoking questions about the role of maintenance personnel versus the role of predictive algorithms, and what kind of traits a modern-day maintenance worker should possess.
Determining the immutable human skills needed in a workplace filled with AI solutions is hard, but necessary work. The need for human involvement is not going away, and the value of powerful, esoteric capabilities like imagination cannot be underestimated.

Five questions to unleash talent in the Age of With

What are the skills and capabilities that are going to be paramount for the future success of my organization?
How does the composition of my workforce relate to what I need? What is the gap between today and future needs?
If I am advocating a business strategy that implies a certain level of skill, have I thought about the external and internal talent landscape required to support that?
How am I planning to access those skills and capabilities? Have I opened the aperture to consider the gig economy and proximity dimension?
How do I set up internal systems and platforms to enable continuous adaptation of skills?

AI and radio frequency communications: Trends and innovations happening now

Sometimes people combine things you wouldn’t really think would go well together. Chocolate and peanut butter come to mind, a wonderful mix that doesn’t seem like it should work as well as it does.
Well, technology also frequently mixes and matches things to see what works best. A lot of people probably didn’t think something as modern as artificial intelligence would go well with radio frequencies, but they actually work great together.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to grow radio frequencies (RF) and bring this retro technology to the modern sphere. With RF, we can expand our signals further than before, working faster than with the tools we currently have.
To be clear, we aren’t trying to move backward or get rid of the technology we have now. We’re just finding interesting ways to mix radio into our modern applications and coming up with incredible results. Here’s what the future holds for the meshing of AI and RF.
AI detects offshore RF signals
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have worked together to create a way for the United States Navy to share a popular 150MHz section of RF for communicating. By using AI, NIST can detect when offshore radars are working so multiple channels don’t try to use the same band at once. The AI will tell commercial users when they have to pause in using the 3.5GHz band.
The FCC created the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) in 2015. It allows commercial vendors and providers to use the 3.5GHz band when it’s not needed for operations from the United States Navy. Companies like AT&T and Google jumped at the chance because the band was expected to grow their markets and provide better coverage and data rates. Without the AI and a little legislature, companies and citizens alike wouldn’t be able to use this very popular band.
RF recognition
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) noticed a problem with too much happening all at once. There are a lot of RF signals put into the same spectrums, making things difficult to discern and hear. DARPA created the Radio Frequency Machine Learning Systems program (RFMLS) to fix this problem.
RFMLS can pick out and discern one signal from the next, identifying more important ones and those that don’t follow the rules. With the internet of things (IoT) gathering data from all sorts of sectors, including radio, RFMLS helps collect important, relevant information for this exact purpose. DARPA is hoping to continue the implementation of AI to create better spectrum sharing in the future, much like what NIST has worked on.
Enhancing system performance
As a company that works to bring new engineering technologies to the United States Department of Defense, Alion Science & Technology works to lower costs and improve efficiency. It has also found the same problem as DARPA, with the RF spectrum becoming congested with useless information that drowns out important data. Instead of picking out certain signals, Alion has found a way to boost the ones it needs.
Alion designed a custom AI network to find any signal in raw in-phase/quadrature data with signal-to-noise (SNR) values from +10dB to -10dB. These SNR values are on different sides of the extreme, with -10dB being afflicted with a lot of noise to the point of being nearly discernable. However, Alion’s found that certain networks can understand different aspects of SNR data. AI is used to pair the two up to effectively boost the signal.
RFI and causes
Radio frequency interference (RFI) is what happens when another electronic signal impedes upon the original one. These days, because most things have moved past radio technology, we often call this phenomenon electromagnetic interference, or EMI. The two terms, RFI and EMI, are used synonymously — but it’s important to know where exactly the differences lie, mostly with the product being affected.
The main cause for RFI is usually a congested space of other electronic devices using the same spectrum, like when a radio buzzes because your cellphone is getting a call. The problem could also be due to the design of the product, creating low absorption loss. Both of these are pretty prominent problems, but the core issue is often a design flaw.
Minimizing interference
A technique called RF shielding is often used to minimize RFI. The shield protects important circuit functions and prevents emissions, lowering the chance for RFI to occur. One could use conductive foam, a metal box or metallic film. Either way, RF shielding should be done as early into the design as possible.
You can also use a filter to protect your device from RFI and prevent it from being emitted. Most filters apply a three-pole approach to target a range from 150kHz to 30kHz. These are available at both the commercial and consumer levels for anyone to use. However, this is not a DIY project like RF shielding.
Machine learning and RF
A lot of AI implementation comes down to necessity, as evidenced by machine learning and RF. The military, companies and average people all use radio these days, which can congest the systems on a ridiculous level. Radio communication isn’t obsolete yet.
While a lot of people have become used to satellites, radio is still a viable and quick way to get information across large areas. Unlike many satellites, radio will also always remain dependable — no matter what the situation or how far into the future we look.
Getting AI involved only helps RF evolve into modern-day usage. Now congestion doesn’t have to be an issue. We can pick out certain frequencies, boost even the lowest of signals or tell others to get off when something more important needs to go through.
With AI, radio can rise in popularity again and become the prominent figure it once was. Satellite communication won’t be going anywhere, but perhaps the radio can take us further than any of us previously thought possible.

Every day, progress in artificial intelligence is addressing tasks currently performed only by humans, and it's worthwhile to take a short-term view of what this all means to your company.

Games like chess have been tackled by artificial intelligence with amazing results, but there was this big gap between those games - where everything about the game state and consequences is known before making a decision - and the reality of life where, like poker, there is only a little bit of information available to the decision-makers, and the quality and quantity of information used to make decisions varies wildly. We humans face this situation of high uncertainty every time we cross the street or eat a hamburger, but it doesn't seem to bother us. Until recently, computers have had a lot of trouble dealing with games that give the decision-maker incomplete information about the state of the game. Also, developing strategies in real-time is harder than deciding if you want to bet or fold. Strategic plans can have multiple steps that need to be properly sequenced, and these plans can include contingency plans.

The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.
William Gibson

Artificial intelligence is very hyped up, and for good reasons, but many pop culture information sources lose the ""how"" of it all, and instead focus in on the dream of what may come next, in some far-off future. Vaporware is common in the industry. It's not a good state of affairs because regular people don't see the connection between the research and the resulting products, and people fear what they don't understand.

PROMOTED
I am a practitioner in the artificial intelligence field, and my problem with futurism fever is an endless focus on the distant future devoid of a simple and rational view of reality in the here and now. The tyranny of the rocket equation held back the futuristic promises of spaceflight for a generation, and the progress of artificial intelligence is similarly limited by the inertia that all disruptive technology faces. The fear of change brought on by progress in the artificial intelligence field should not lead society directly to extreme solutions like universal basic income or strong regulation of artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence as it is developed today, is primarily programming, data gathering, and mathematics. It isn't sexy and it works poorly at first. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. The scary results you see in demonstrations are the product of a lot of hard work to hide the shortcomings of a narrow machine intelligence. I like to think of the artificial intelligence field like ""Charlotte's Web"", in the sense that Wilbur (the artificial intelligence agent) gets all of the attention at the fair, but Charlotte (the programmer) stays up all night spinning the web. When Wilbur gets all the attention at the fair, as was intended, you have to ask yourself what exactly the pig did to deserve the attention. Why didn't the farmer market a magic spider instead of a magic pig? Well, the short answer is that the marketers want to promote pigs, but the deeper answer is that too few information sources are looking behind the curtain to explain the reason for the cool demo, ruining the magic trick but enlightening the audience.

I don't mean to give ""real"" futurists a hard time though. Nick Bostrom's excellent book ""Superintelligence"" is worth reading, and even just a watch of his TED talk on the potential future dangers of artificial intelligence could change the way you think about these things. Real research is ongoing on the far future of artificial intelligence, on things like the singularity, and artificial general intelligence, but that is simply not

relevant to your real life right now. It might be someday, but it isn't today. What I want to share with you in this article is the here and now; The gritty reality of compiling code and deploying solutions that companies use to make money, save money, and save time. Specifically, let's look at recent progress in strategic thinking developed by artificial intelligence. Yes, artificial intelligence really is being applied to model decision making of governments and corporations. An example that comes to mind right away is a machine learning model of China's decision making called the Policy Change Index.
Cool Things Are Reaching From The Lab Into The Real World
I am claiming that society should be getting more meaningful information about what's happening right now in the artificial intelligence field. Let's back that up with an example: Artificial intelligence agents are getting better at hard problems they couldn't solve before, and these stronger capabilities will matter. I'm talking specifically about DeepMind's AlphaStar, and many similar systems that are upgrading the plumbing and the brains that run the world economy. This is going to impact the way services are delivered because the strategy part of delivering services has until recently relied very heavily on humans at keyboards wearing headsets. It also impacts the finance sector, where 80 percent of market activity is algorithmic trading agents, and automated strategy plays a major role in these agents moving markets.

DeepMind's AlphaStar has recently been playing online StarCraft 2 matches in Europe, against human opponents who don't know they are playing a computer. The base technology within DeepMind's approach to solving Real-Time Strategy (RTS) ""imperfect information"" game theory is a deep neural network trained on past games and perfected by playing against itself to get even better. Self-play facilitates learning beyond simply copying decisions made in past matches. The core of the approach is a system that uses a mash-up of supervised learning and reinforcement learning, but the key concept to absorb is that a complicated RTS game only humans could play is now being solved very comprehensively by an artificial intelligence system. A predecessor of AlphaStar for playing the game Go was called AlphaGo. Unlike AlhpaGo, AlphaStar needs to develop and execute strategies based upon an incomplete set of information. That's a big step forward, into a more businesslike and realistic domain.Lee Se-Dol, one of the greatest modern players of the ancient board game Go, speaks during a press ... [+] conference after the third game of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match against Google-developed supercomputer AlphaGo at a hotel in Seoul on March 12, 2016.
A Google-developed computer programme took an unassailable 3-0 lead in its match-up with a South Korean Go grandmaster on March 12 -- marking a major breakthrough for a new style of ""intuitive"" artificial intelligence (AI). / AFP / JUNG Yeon-Je        (Photo credit should read JUNG YEON-JE/AFP/Getty Images)AFP/Getty Images
The first set of AlphaStar matches earlier this year were against professional players in a private controlled setting, relying on the ability to perform an amazingly high (superhuman) number of actions per minute to beat the humans. Playing such a hard to play incomplete information game was super impressive, but they are not done just yet.
Developing agents is sort of like building a rocket and watching someone else fly it around. Over the past few months of following AlphaStar news, I've been entertained that Casters watch AlphaStar play like programmers debug their artificial intelligence agents: they look at the successes and marvel at the ideas the agent came up with, and then look at the failures and try to figure out ""Why did it do that?"" Super wonky low-level in-game mistake details like bad building placement and scouting strategies then tie into super wonky low-level in-agent details like analyzing the sequence of states that led the agent to learn to do what it did.
DeepMind is now trying to make AlphaStar even better, by making it play under constraints more like those imposed on a human. DeepMind is looking to train agents like AlphaStar to beat humans at tasks only humans are good at, and they are also making an effort to do it in a way similar to how humans do it, without relying on click spamming the game, or other unfair superhuman ""cheats"" that rely on being a computer to work. I am very sure this is not the solution to all problems humans solve, but it is cool that some subset of all the stuff we humans do is slipping into the realm of automation. Right now there still seems to be a limit to the set of maps AlphaStar can play, but progress is being made, and we can see that progress marching forward in real-time. The initial demonstration of the system played only one of the three StartCraft 2 races (Protoss), but the newer version works for all 3 races in the game. To me, this is the exciting part of the artificial intelligence field today. Every day the limit of what is possible is going up, and there does not seem to be an end in sight.
Assuming the aforementioned progress on machine learning-based strategy generation is within reach, what does an automated corporate strategy look like? In my experience, government and corporate projects contain limited scope requirements to model one part of corporate strategy. Be it credit risk models, recommender systems, customer segmentation, legislative risk models, or trading algorithms, these scope-limited approaches benefit from being easily abstracted into a box in a flowchart with a name on it. Rather than holistic solutions that model a whole company, the most popular kind of project today is a tool that serves management. Tools for forecasting and decision making are very popular right now, and I predict that at some point these smaller bites at the elephant will grow into holistic solutions. The pushback I have heard and seen is that ERP systems promised to provide this sort of holistic strategy generation but didn't, and that the technical debt in the current infrastructure is best addressed by incremental changes in how things work.
Automation in corporate strategy has been around for a long time, but with recent advances in artificial intelligence, it should get even better. The ideas above should lead you to the inevitable conclusion that corporate strategy development is going to benefit from more automation, and specifically from artificial intelligence. Companies are organized a certain way, with specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and plans for improving the KPIs. Expect artificial intelligence to creep into corporate strategy discussions right about now.
There is so much work still to do
To build a system that generates strategies, a good starting point is to develop a simulator to define the boundaries of the world where the agent can play around and make decisions. The simulator also needs lots of data on past decisions and their outcomes, in order to gain some experience. This process of building a simulator also involves deciding how much of the world to simulate. The approach DeepMind followed to avoid the large gap between dumb newborn and beginner agents was to first teach the agent to mimic the historical data, and then to pivot into playing against copies of itself once it was sort of on the right track.
Some key challenges holding back the broader adoption of artificial intelligence for autonomous business strategy development and execution are interpretability, dataset handling tools, automated machine learning, and bias.
Let's first talk about interpretability. We humans need to understand what the machine learned from the data, how it thinks and why it makes certain decisions. Researchers are now working to address these interpretability issues. Some recent progress interesting work on this topic is ""A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions"" and their open-source library shap.A unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model.Scott Lundberg
Beyond interpretability, another challenge is wrangling datasets for training these artificial intelligence agents and labeling the data without too much human effort. Some major efforts in that direction should address most of the problem. One noteworthy project for labeling, transforming, and organizing datasets is snorkel.org, which has a wide corporate user base and US Government support. Pre-built datasets and models are also becoming more available as they are put into the public domain by researchers, corporates, and governments adopting open data policies.
A third challenge on top of interpretability and dataset preparation is automating the process of building machine learning models, which today often requires a data scientist, a machine learning engineer, and a DevOps engineer, as well as a project manager to keep the trains running on time. There are many active automated machine learning projects such as TPOT, which aim to remove these humans from the process as much as possible. This automation is not yet a solved problem, and it gives you a realistic sense of the strings artificial intelligence researchers are pulling on.
A fourth challenge I want to bring to your attention is biases. Artificial intelligence systems are very good at learning and perpetuating bias that exists in observed data. It's a big and unsolved area of machine learning that is holding up some key business processes from easily adopting strategies generated using artificial intelligence. It is the process of verifying that certain biases do not exist in the generated advice that adds significant cost to machine learning projects of this nature.
Rather than waiting for all of these problems to be fully solved, the world is moving ahead with adoption of artificial intelligence at scale, and I believe the training wheels will come off slowly, as these systems become more commonplace within corporate infrastructure.
This article and those that follow should help you understand how the field of artificial intelligence is coming along, and help you to get a sense of what this all means to you right now. Let me briefly summarize the 5 main takeaways:


Under certain constraints, artificial intelligence will be able to generate corporate strategy
Corporate strategy crafted by artificial intelligence will become more popular
Don't freak out. New things are happening, but Skynet is not just around the corner
Computers are getting very good at tasks only humans could do before, like driving
Artificial intelligence, as a field of study, is not finished being invented yet. There are a lot of open problems that humans are working to define and solve, both within the AI field and as problems that AI could help to solve
