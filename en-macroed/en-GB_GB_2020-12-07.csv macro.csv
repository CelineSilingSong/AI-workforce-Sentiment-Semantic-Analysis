The plasma source for the accelerator

view large

Researchers have used AI to control beams for the next generation of smaller, cheaper accelerators for research, medical and industrial applications.
Experiments led by Imperial College London researchers, using the Science and Technology Facilities Council’s Central Laser Facility (CLF), showed that an algorithm was able to tune the complex parameters involved in controlling the next generation of plasma-based particle accelerators.
The techniques we have developed will be instrumental in getting the most out of a new generation of advanced plasma accelerator facilities under construction within the UK and worldwide. Dr Rob Shalloo
The algorithm was able to optimize the accelerator much more quickly than a human operator, and could even outperform experiments on similar laser systems.
These accelerators focus the energy of the world’s most powerful lasers down to a spot the size of a skin cell, producing electrons and x-rays with equipment a fraction of the size of conventional accelerators.
The electrons and x-rays can be used for scientific research, such as probing the atomic structure of materials; in industrial applications, such as for producing consumer electronics and vulcanised rubber for car tyres; and could also be used in medical applications, such as cancer treatments and medical imaging.
Broadening accessibility
Several facilities using these new accelerators are in various stages of planning and construction around the world, including the CLF’s Extreme Photonics Applications Centre (EPAC) in the UK, and the new discovery could help them work at their best in the future. The results are published today in Nature Communications.
First author Dr Rob Shalloo, who completed the work at Imperial and is now at the accelerator centre DESY, said: “The techniques we have developed will be instrumental in getting the most out of a new generation of advanced plasma accelerator facilities under construction within the UK and worldwide.
“Plasma accelerator technology provides uniquely short bursts of electrons and x-rays, which are already finding uses in many areas of scientific study. With our developments, we hope to broaden accessibility to these compact accelerators, allowing scientists in other disciplines and those wishing to use these machines for applications, to benefit from the technology without being an expert in plasma accelerators.”
First of its kind
The team worked with laser wakefield accelerators. These combine the world’s most powerful lasers with a source of plasma (ionised gas) to create concentrated beams of electrons and x-rays. Traditional accelerators need hundreds of metres to kilometres to accelerate electrons, but wakefield accelerators can manage the same acceleration within the space of millimetres, drastically reducing the size and cost of the equipment.

However, because wakefield accelerators operate in the extreme conditions created when lasers are combined with plasma, they can be difficult to control and optimise to get the best performance. In wakefield acceleration, an ultrashort laser pulse is driven into plasma, creating a wave that is used to accelerate electrons. Both the laser and plasma have several parameters that can be tweaked to control the interaction, such as the shape and intensity of the laser pulse, or the density and length of the plasma.
While a human operator can tweak these parameters, it is difficult to know how to optimise so many parameters at once. Instead, the team turned to artificial intelligence, creating a machine learning algorithm to optimise the performance of the accelerator.
The algorithm set up to six parameters controlling the laser and plasma, fired the laser, analysed the data, and re-set the parameters, performing this loop many times in succession until the optimal parameter configuration was reached.

Electrons are ejected from the plasma accelerator at almost the speed of light, before being passed through a magnetic field which separates the particles by their energy. They are then fired at a fluorescent screen, shown here

Lead researcher Dr Matthew Streeter, who completed the work at Imperial and is now at Queen’s University Belfast, said: “Our work resulted in an autonomous plasma accelerator, the first of its kind. As well as allowing us to efficiently optimise the accelerator, it also simplifies their operation and allows us to spend more of our efforts on exploring the fundamental physics behind these extreme machines.”
Future designs and further improvements
The team demonstrated their technique using the Gemini laser system at the CLF, and have already begun to use it in further experiments to probe the atomic structure of materials in extreme conditions and in studying antimatter and quantum physics.
The data gathered during the optimisation process also provided new insight into the dynamics of the laser-plasma interaction inside the accelerator, potentially informing future designs to further improve accelerator performance.
The experiment was led by Imperial College London researchers with a team of collaborators from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), the York Plasma Institute, the University of Michigan, the University of Oxford and the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY). It was funded by the UK’s STFC, the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, the US National Science Foundation and the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

The idea of artificial intelligence (AI) — systems so advanced they can mimic or outperform human cognition — first came to prominence in 1950, when British computer scientist Alan Turing proposed an ‘imitation game’ to assess whether a computer could fool humans into thinking they were communicating with another human. Soon after, researchers at Princeton University in New Jersey built MADALINE, the first artificial neural network applied to a real-world problem. Their system, modelled on the brain and nervous system, learnt to solve a maze through trial-and-error.Since then, the rise of AI has been enabled by exponentially faster and more powerful computers and large, complex data sets. Applications such as machine learning, whereby a system identifies patterns in large sets of data, have demonstrated the potential for AI to be practical and profitable.Today, AI forms the basis of computer systems handling tasks such as voice recognition and translation on smartphones, piloting driverless cars, and controlling robots that automate chores in homes and factories. In research, AI is being used in a growing number of applications, such as processing the enormous amounts of data that underpin fields including astronomy and genomics, producing climate models and weather forecasts, and identifying signs of disease in medical imaging.“AI is a foundational science in the same sense that physics is a foundational science,” says Amir Husain, a computer scientist who founded SparkCognition, a company in Austin, Texas, that creates AI-based analytic and security systems. “A lot of people think that AI is a product or technology, but it’s actually an enabler for almost everything we do.”

Nature Index 2020 Artificial intelligence
Business, as a result, is booming. The 2019 AI Index Report, published by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence in California, estimates that global private investment in AI in 2019 was more than US$70 billion. The US, China and Europe took the largest share; Israel, Singapore and Iceland were found to invest heavily in per capita terms. Start-ups founded on AI technologies are a major part of the ecosystem, garnering more than $37 billion globally in investments in 2019, up from $1.3 billion raised in 2010, according to the report.Revenues have also skyrocketed. The International Data Corporation (IDC), a market research company based in Framingham, Massachusetts, predicts that worldwide revenues for the AI market will total $156.5 billion in 2020, an increase of 12.3% over 2019. Although growth in 2020 is slower than in previous years due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IDC expects that global revenues will surpass $300 billion in 2024.As nations vie for leadership, AI research output is increasing rapidly. According to our analysis of journal publications and conference papers tracked by the Dimensions database, the global output for AI research grew from just over 52,000 globally in 2000 to roughly 403,000 in 2019, representing an increase of more than 600%. Now the most popular specialization among computer-science PhD students in North America, AI is set to continue its steep, upward trajectory.Rising revenuesThe United States has historically been the leader in AI-related research output, having accumulated the highest number of publications over the past two decades. But China has ramped up its output in recent years. In each year from 2016 to 2019, China produced more AI-related papers than any other nation, according to Dimensions. Over this period, China’s output of AI-related research increased by just over 120%, whereas output in the US increased by almost 70%. In 2019, China published 102,161 AI-related papers, and the US published 74,386. India, which came in third, published 23,398.

Publication numbers aren’t the whole story, says Jeffrey Ding, a PhD student at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, UK, who studies China’s AI strategy. In the AI Index Report, which uses citation numbers to measure the quality of AI papers, papers from China were cited about 20% less than the world average in 2019, whereas papers from the US were cited about 40% more than average. “Just pumping out raw numbers of papers that don’t have a lasting impact isn’t really useful,” says Ding. “It’s more important to keep up with the technology frontier.”A Nature Index analysis for this supplement looked at the number of AI-related articles published in the 82 high-quality natural-science journals tracked by the index, which primarily concern the application of AI to research in the broad fields of chemistry, the physical sciences, life sciences, and Earth and environmental sciences. Between 2015 and 2019, the US was the leader, with the UK, Germany and China in second, third and fourth place, respectively. But China has increased its output in journals tracked by the index. Although it was the fourth-most prolific country in the index in 2015, with roughly half as many AI-related papers as Germany, China crept up over the next three years, then leapt to second place in 2019, showing an increase of 340%. The US, UK and Germany slightly more than doubled their output over the same period.

For the near future, Ding says, the US is likely to remain the world leader in AI. “Though China has some exceptional universities, such as Tsinghua University, the US dominates in terms of maybe the top 20 universities doing AI research, and that is reflected in the quality of the papers. It’s very unlikely that China will become the singular innovation centre by 2030.”Many countries see AI as providing a competitive edge, not only economically, but militarily, says Husain. He likens the competition in AI to the Space Race of the mid-twentieth century, in which the US and the Soviet Union vied to be the first to achieve milestones in space travel. “The Space Race yielded contributions that differentiated the American technological ecosystem from all others for decades to come,” says Husain. “If a country invests heavily in this area, it will yield technologies that will form the pillar of defence capability and economic differentiation for the rest of the century.”Technologies that can be developed based on AI will indeed have both economic and military benefit, says Daniel Araya, a policy analyst at the Center for International Governance Innovation, a think tank in Ontario, Canada. “We’re talking new weapons, data-driven innovation for industry and automation, and redesigning how our society works from the ground up.”Husain points to Germany, which maintains a strong economy that relies on exports of products such as machine parts and automobiles, even though lower-income countries can provide low-wage labour for manufacturing. Germany has been able to compete by using automation to keep manufacturing costs down, while keeping quality and productivity high. AI could reinforce this advantage by powering the next generation of automation technologies. “Anybody that has mastery over this technology and is investing in implementing it retains an economic lead,” says Husain. Institutions in Germany, such as the Fraunhofer Society, Europe’s largest application-oriented research organization, have been emphasizing Industry 4.0, a national strategic initiative from the German government to introduce more digital innovation and advanced robotics into manufacturing and supply-chain management.In China, the ability offered by AI systems to monitor public spaces and scan Internet traffic in an effort to glean user intentions may provide the state with improved tools for social control, enhancing its capability for monitoring the population or censoring information. Even in countries that don’t officially track their populaces, facial-recognition technology, such as that produced by New York-based company, Clearview AI, is being used by law enforcement to identify suspects. The technology has been met with deep concern by some researchers, who say that biases built into its algorithms could result in ethical and human rights abuses.Amid the controversy that surrounds certain applications of AI, some groups are highlighting the good it can do. In 2019, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, a scientific society in Menlo Park, California, launched its Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity award, a US$1-million prize funded by Squirrel AI, an education technology company based in Shanghai, China. The inaugural winner, Regina Barzilay from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, received the award in September 2020 for developing a machine-learning algorithm that can examine mammograms and predict which women are at a higher risk of breast cancer. Barzilay has also developed a pattern-recognition algorithm that predicts which molecules might make good candidates for new medications. Publishing in the journal Cell, Barzilay and her colleagues described how their system identified a molecule, dubbed halicin, as a potentially potent new antibiotic (J. M. Stokes et al. Cell 180, 688–702; 2020). When the molecule was synthesized and tested, it was found to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Barzilay continues to work on halicin and hopes to progress it to clinical trials.Money to spendWith an eye to the potential benefits of AI-based technologies, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) announced in August 2020 that it is establishing five new institutes focused on different topics, each led by a different university, and each to receive $20 million over five years. One, led by the University of Oklahoma in Norman, will use AI systems to improve climate forecasting accuracy. Another, at the University of Texas at Austin, will focus on the next generation of machine-learning algorithms. A third, led by the University of Colorado Boulder, will apply AI technologies to teaching and learning. The fourth, headed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will explore the discovery and synthesis of new materials and drugs using AI systems. And a fifth, led by MIT, will investigate how AI can improve research in fundamental physics. The NSF has put out a call for proposals for eight more AI institutes, which it plans to announce next year. “We have a long history of supporting basic research in artificial intelligence,” says Erwin Gianchandani, the NSF’s deputy assistant director for computer and information science and engineering.In addition, the US Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture has committed to funding another two institutes each with $20 million over five years to apply AI to questions of crop yield, pest resistance and food distribution.Access to massive data sets on which to train machine-learning systems is one advantage that both the US and China have, says Araya. Europe, on the other hand, has stringent data laws, which protect people’s privacy, but limit its resources for training AI algorithms. “So, it seems unlikely that Europe will produce very sophisticated AI as a consequence,” he says. “China is at the opposite end of the spectrum, where it has few data protections, and huge access to varied and diverse pieces of data.”The NSF doesn’t make decisions based on global competition, says Rebecca Keiser, the organization’s first chief of research security strategy and policy. Her position is designed to safeguard the security of federally funded research, while promoting international collaborations. “We think of it more in terms of the impact that our funding is going to have, rather than from a nation perspective. The fact that it also contributes to US global science leadership is fabulous,” says Keiser. As for competing against China in AI, she says, “We don’t really know how much, and where, they’re investing, so it’s hard to compete against that.”With funding from other major US agencies, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and National Institutes of Health, the US government expected to spend almost $5 billion on unclassified AI research in 2020. Other countries are investing, too. The UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council gave out nearly £160 million (US$212 million) in 2020. The European Commission, which has been supporting research through its Horizon 2020 programme, says public and private investment in AI should reach €20 billion (US$23 billion) across Europe by the end of 2020. Even with other countries placing emphasis on AI research, including Israel, Japan, Singapore and Australia, the race comes down to China versus the US, Araya says.The refinement of AI systems is driven not simply by academic questions, but by applying the systems’ intelligence to practical problems. Countries will probably make advances by using AI in areas where they already have expertise, says Ding, such as automation in Germany or robotics in Japan. Having so many researchers around the globe tackling all aspects of AI should advance the whole field, says Keiser. “It’s always good to have a bit of healthy competition.”

In association withLucrezia Del Zompo at Queen Mary University of London, where she studies AIDaniel Hambury/Stella Pictures LtdJason Deans9 December 2020Lucrezia Del Zompo, 24, grew up in Sardinia and studied subjects including physics, maths, biology, philosophy, history and Latin at the equivalent of GCSE and A-level.  She moved to the UK for her undergraduate degree in biomedical/medical engineering at King’s College London, before receiving a DeepMind scholarship to do a Master of Science in artificial intelligence at Queen Mary University of London.  In September Lucrezia started a new two-year course at Queen Mary — a master degree apprentice as a digital and technology solutions specialist. This is a vocational course and Lucrezia is doing an apprenticeship with Siemens Mobility, the transport division of the German multinational engineering company. In her apprenticeship she uses her AI and engineering skills. She spends 80 per cent of her time working at Siemens in the UK, with the other 20 per cent used for study at Queen Mary, covering modules including cloud computing, project management for big data analysis, applied statistics and big data processing.  What does your work at Siemens Mobility involve?“I’m working in the rolling stock department — they make trains and develop applications to improve the interpretation of data coming from the vehicle. I’ll rotate around different teams in the department [as part of my apprenticeship]. I’m currently with the business and innovation team in a technical sales role, using my data, AI and engineering knowledge. “My manager and I have meetings with customers and we try to understand how to best satisfy customer needs using the data available. For example, a customer requested an app to better understand the flow of people into each carriage, to help maintain social distancing.  “This requires digital knowledge and data analytics, because when you develop an app it involves AI, machine learning, data mining processes.”
You did your undergraduate degree in biomedical/medical engineering. Why did you decide to specialise with a masters in AI?“In the last year of my degree, I had to choose an optional module and one of them was machine learning for biomedical engineering. I didn’t know much about it but I was curious — it turned out to be the best choice for me.  “I was a bit scared at the beginning because of all the computer programming and mathematics but machine learning and AI can be applied to so many fields — natural language processing, imaging analysis — so that’s what made me choose an AI masters.  Read MoreSTEM Challenge #5: Understand AI by playing noughts and crossesSTEM careers: How do I become a video game developer? “If I want to go back to the medical field, for instance, then I can use this knowledge that I’ve gained.”
How did you find the challenge of an AI masters without first having done a computer science degree“It was quite challenging at the beginning. But I had basic knowledge of programming languages such as Python and the teaching staff were very helpful and understanding. I just worked really hard, especially in the first semester, to get up to the level of my other classmates.”
Was there something that set you off on this path to biomedical engineering and then AI?
“I was always interested in medicine and technology. I wanted to be a doctor. Then at high school in Sardinia, when I was 17, I went to an open day at Cagliari University and came across biomedical engineering. There was a student who gave an amazing presentation and I decided this was exactly what I wanted to do.”
What advice would you give young people thinking of pursuing a career in AI?“When I was an undergrad I had to choose between machine learning and another module. I had a chat with one of my professors and said: ‘It seems interesting but I’m afraid because I don’t really know the field.’ She told me: ‘If it’s difficult then it’s the right choice because you will learn more from it and it will push you to do better.’  “Go for the challenging choices even if you’re scared of them. If you feel they’re the right thing and you could learn from them, you should go for it.”

The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) has adopted a feasibility study on the possible establishment of a certification mechanism for artificial intelligence tools and services. The study is based on the CEPEJ Charter on the use of artificial intelligence in judicial systems and their environment, adopted in December 2018. The Council of Europe, if it decides to create such a mechanism, could be a pioneer in this field.
After consultation with all member and observer states, this feasibility study will be followed by an action plan that the CEPEJ will prepare and send to the Committee of Ministers for examination in 2021.
The CEPEJ also adopted the roadmap of its Working Group on Cyberjustice and Artificial Intelligence.
The work carried out in the field of the digitalisation of justice aims to provide new concrete tools in this area to European courts, which has become even more necessary during times of sanitary crisis and closures of courts, while ensuring respect for the fundamental principles of the European Convention on Human Rights and in particular those of its Article 6.
The President of the CEPEJ, Ramin Gurbanov, was re-elected for a new term of 2 years (1st January 2021 to 31st December 2022).

The Covid-19 pandemic has rapidly increased that trend, driven by the triple necessities of increased productivity, lower costs and human safety. Suddenly, human contact is both undesirable and more longed for than ever. Delivery companies, plumbers and even some medical providers now boast about their “zero contact” service, but we relish any chance we get to have an in-person meal or a face-to-face meeting.As we face the future of an A.I. economy, 2020 has taught us the importance of human connection.When I began my career in A.I. in 1983, I described A.I. in my application to the Ph.D. program at Carnegie Mellon University as “the quantification of the human thinking process, the explication of human behavior” and our “final step” to understanding ourselves.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn a way I was wrong, and in a way I was right. A.I. programs are capable of mimicking and even surpassing human brains in many tasks. But if A.I. allows us to truly understand ourselves, it will be because it liberates us from the mechanical drudgery of routine tasks and allows us to focus on our humanity and the compassionate connections between us.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.We already know that many of the jobs that are being replaced will not return, because A.I. can do them much better than people at essentially zero cost. This will generate tremendous economic value but will also result in unprecedented job displacement. In my book “A.I. Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” I estimated that by 2033 A.I. and automation will be able to do 40 to 50 percent of our jobs.To prepare now for the millions of displaced jobs and tackle retraining for the new skills required when A.I. is both a co-worker and a tool, I propose the 3 R’s — relearn, recalibrate and renaissance — as part of a gargantuan reimagination of how we live and work to deal with the central economic issue of our time: the A.I. revolution.ImageAn A.I.-powered robotic hand, created by the research company OpenAI, learned to solve a Rubik’s cube, demonstrating a near-human level of dexterity.Credit...Matt Edge for The New York TimesFirst, and perhaps easiest, is forewarning people in endangered jobs and establishing programs for them to relearn their fields in the context of A.I. The good news is that there are plenty of “human” skills that A.I. cannot master: creativity, social interaction, physically complex or dexterous work and, of course, using the A.I. tools that require human operators.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTVocational schools need to redesign their curriculums to increase courses for sustainable jobs. Governments could take the lead and provide incentives and subsidies for those courses, rather than blindly pursuing broad-brush economic measures like universal basic income. Corporations could also provide programs, such as Amazon’s Career Choice program. This program pays up to $12,000 annually over four years for Amazon’s hourly employees to earn degrees in high-demand occupations such as aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design and nursing.Pandemic or no pandemic, the importance and number of human-centric service jobs, such as nursing, will grow as wealth and life spans increase. The World Health Organization predicts that by 2030, we will fall short of the number of health care workers required to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of “good health and well-being for all” by approximately 18 million. There is an acute need to reassess such vital, yet undervalued, human-centric service roles both in terms of how they are perceived and how much they are paid. These jobs will form a bedrock for the new A.I. economy.As we prepare people for the eventual transition to an A.I.-driven economy, we will also need to recalibrate many of today’s jobs. Like software did a few decades ago, A.I. can augment humans’ creative thinking with a computer’s relentless ability to churn through masses of data, hypothesize alternatives or optimize outcomes. There will not be a single, generic A.I. tool, but specific tools customized for each profession and application. We may have an A.I.-based molecule generation program for drug researchers, an A.I. advertising planner for marketers or an A.I. fact checker for journalists.Merging A.I. optimization and the human touch will reinvent many jobs and create even more. A.I. will take care of routine tasks in tandem with humans, who will carry out the tasks that require, well, humanity. For example, future doctors will still be a patient’s primary point of contact, but they will rely on A.I. diagnostic tools to determine the best treatment. This will redirect the doctor’s role into that of a compassionate caregiver, giving them more time with their patients.Just as the mobile internet led to roles like the Uber driver, the coming of A.I. will create jobs we cannot even conceive of yet. Examples today include A.I. engineers, data scientists, data-labelers and robot mechanics. We should watch for the emergence of such roles, make people aware of them and provide training for them.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFinally, just as the wealthy Italian cities and merchants funded that country’s Renaissance, we must hope that A.I. will inspire a renaissance of its own. With machines taking over many duties and tasks in the new economy, A.I. will inject flexibility into traditional working patterns, allowing us to rethink what work-life balance should look like and transforming both the weekday routine and retirement thresholds. With more freedom and time in such a new social contract, people will be liberated to follow their passions, creativity and talents, and to let that personal exploration inform their careers as never before.Painters, sculptors and photographers will be able to use A.I. tools to compose, experiment, enumerate and refine their artwork. Novelists, journalists and poets will use new technologies to take their writing in previously unthought-of directions. Educators, freed from the drudgery of grading and paperwork, can finally unleash their energy to design lessons that encourage curiosity, critical thinking and creativity. A.I. programs can help teach facts and figures so that teachers can spend more time developing students’ emotional intelligence.The three R’s will represent an unparalleled undertaking for humanity. Companies will need to retrain a massive number of displaced workers. Governments must raise an astronomical amount of money and redistribute it to fund this transition. Schools need to reinvent education to produce creative, social and multidisciplinary graduates. Everything must be redefined: the work ethic of society, entitlements for citizens, responsibilities for corporations and the role of governments.In all of this, the role of A.I. technologies is crucial. If we do it right, A.I. will free us to embrace not only our creativity and compassion for one another, but also our humanity.Kai-Fu Lee is a computer scientist, business leader and author, and is the chairman and chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital investment company.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Gebru asked Bender if she had written about the ethical questions raised by recent advances in AI that processes text. Bender hadn’t, but the pair fell into a conversation about the limitations of such technology, such as evidence it can replicate biased language found online.Bender found the DM discussion enlivening and suggested building it into an academic paper. “I hoped to provoke the next turn in the conversation,” Bender says. “We’ve seen all this excitement and success, let’s step back and see what the possible risks are and what we can do.” The draft was written in a month with five additional coauthors from Google and academia and was submitted in October to an academic conference. It would soon become one of the most notorious research works in AI.The Dark Side of Big Tech’s Funding for AI ResearchBy Tom SimoniteLast week, Gebru said she was fired by Google after objecting to a manager’s request to retract or remove her name from the paper. Google’s head of AI said the work “didn’t meet our bar for publication.” Since then, more than 2,200 Google employees have signed a letter demanding more transparency into the company’s handling of the draft. Saturday, Gebru’s manager, Google AI researcher Samy Bengio, wrote on Facebook that he was “stunned,” declaring “I stand by you, Timnit.” AI researchers outside Google have publicly castigated the company’s treatment of Gebru.Trending NowWhy Some Cities Are Banning Facial Recognition TechnologyThe furor gave the paper that catalyzed Gebru’s sudden exit an aura of unusual power.

The company did not respond to a request for comment. In a blog post Monday, members of Google’s AI ethics research team suggested that managers had turned Google’s internal research-review process against Gebru.

Harnessing artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has become the new arms race among the great powers, a Hudson Institute panel on handling big data in military operations said Monday.
Speaking at the online forum, Richard Schultz, director of the international security program in the Fletcher School at Tufts University, said, “that’s the way [Russian President Vladimir] Putin looks at it. I don’t think we have a choice” but to view it the same way.
He added in answer to a question that “the data in information space is enormous,” so finding tools to filter out what’s not necessary is critical. U.S. Special Operations Command is already using AI to do what in the old days was called political or psychological warfare, in addition to targeting, he added.

SOCOM Commander Army Gen. Richard Clarke said that, in recent conversations he has had with commanders in Afghanistan, between 2001 and 2018 “70 percent of their time was putting bomb on target.” But now, through better use of AI for speedy and precise targeting and a greater understanding of the effectiveness of information operations, they have reversed that ratio.
Clarke and Schultz co-authored the recent monograph “Big Data at War” that details what SOCOM gained in moving out with AI and machine learning.
Bryan Clark of the Hudson Institute said during the event that the lessons learned from Special Operations Command work in Afghanistan – starting in 2004 but accelerating in 2008 – is being felt across the Department of Defense. “It’s decision-centric warfare” versus “attrition-centric warfare.” He compared it to “maneuver warfare in the information domain.” He specifically cited the value of Project Maven as improving a field commander’s ability to more effectively command and control his unit’s operation in conflict – from when, what and where to fire, to not shooting at all.
Project Maven is a Pentagon project using machine learning to sort through masses of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data – unmanned systems video, paper, computer hard drives, thumb drives and more – collected by the department and intelligence agencies for operational use across the services. It has sometimes been called “algorithmic warfare.”
In a combat situation, Clark said, “you’re not trying to kill every bad guy out there” but rather are targeting a leader or a group of leaders. AI has already gained a strong foothold in logistics and maintenance in Pentagon thinking and is now making its way to commanders.
“Maven has made some inroads [because] it is actively giving them courses of actions” and even parallel courses of actions to take simultaneously to further confuse an enemy.
Clark added that for more than a decade private industry has applied AI and machine learning to its operations. In doing so, businesses found out how to conduct tasks work with technology and then use the human workforce for other tasks, creating greater output overall.
Maven, however, has had something of a checkered past, particularly after Google withdrew from the project in 2018. Schultz said “the big issue is what happens to Maven a year or so from now when it goes out of business,” as expected under current budget plans.
With that being said, Schultz added that the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division and its XVIII Corps “want to be the first” division and corps to apply AI and machine learning across the board, from planning to operations to sustainment. He said the commanders had a special operations background before moving into their new positions, and that experience made them more familiar with what these technologies could do for them.
Clarke said a number of these AI and machine learning ideas would be tested in the Army’s Project Convergence next year.
“Commanders have to set the tone [to allow] ideas to bubble up,” Clarke said of his experience in SOCOM. They have to build the cadre of data scientists and coders and the mid-level managers to become truly effective and sustain efficiencies. When that’s in place, they can share best practices with other units.
All agreed that, even with the adaptation of AI and machine learning to military operations, forward presence would remain important. How many forces, however, could be reduced when forces like Marines have more tools in their hands to succeed. Clark added, “we’re definitely seeing that synergy” in the Marine Corps on applying AI to operations.
“We can prevail” against the Chinese and the Russians in the new arms race, Schultz said. “We just need to be able to harness [artificial intelligence].”
Clarke said his command was putting its “money where its mouth is” when it comes to investing and operating with advanced technologies. “We don’t have a choice.”

Technology is everywhere in the 21st century, and America’s food system is no exception.
Scientists with the USDA Agricultural Research Service’s (ARS) Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC), at the University of California (UC) – Davis, have joined forces with over 40 researchers from six organizations to form an institute that will use artificial intelligence (AI) to create the next-generation food system. The team, led by UC Davis, also includes UC Berkeley, Cornell University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The project is funded by a $20 million grant from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture.
“The AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS) is dedicated to accelerating the use of artificial intelligence to optimally produce, process, and distribute safe and nutritious food,” said Dr. Danielle Lemay, a USDA research molecular biologist at WHNRC.
The institute’s goals include using molecular breeding to improve crop yield, quality, and disease resistance; using AI applications and other technology, such as sensing platforms and robotics, to reduce resource use; enhancing food safety; and developing tools for consumers to make personalized health decisions.
According to Lemay, AIFS is developing AI to determine how to breed plants for optimal production, how to better manage water and nitrogen use, and how to forecast crop yields. For food processing, AI will help inform decisions about cleaning to improve sanitation and reduce the spread of pathogens. AI will also help reduce energy use and food waste by advising against transporting food that may not be used at its destination. In nutrition, AI will predict the ingredients from photos in a consumer’s own food journal.
“Also, one of our goals is to help young people understand the value of where their food comes from, and to see themselves in future agriculture and food careers,” Lemay said. “The opportunity is to create more workers at all levels who have both AI and food system expertise. This includes engagement at every level – from K through 12 and at community colleges, summer internships, and field days with farmers.”
Lemay, who leads the institute’s nutrition research, said AIFS is unique in that no other AI research effort has included human nutrition. “Our grand challenge is to apply AI technologies to better capture what people are eating, to determine the nutrients and molecular structure of that food, and to predict health outcomes of those dietary choices.”
“In the future, we hope that AI can be used to personalize information on health status, genotype, and microbiome,” said Lemay.
This research supports multiple themes outlined in the USDA Science Blueprint (PDF, 2.6 MB), which moves us closer to meeting the goals outlined in USDA’s Agriculture Innovation Agenda.

This supplement explores artificial intelligence (AI), one of the most rapidly advancing and controversial topics in scientific research. Driven by escalating computing power, expanding data sets, and algorithms of unprecedented sophistication, the number of journal and conference papers referring to AI in the Dimensions from Digital Science database increased by more than 600% between 2000 and 2019. Almost one-third of those papers date from 2017 to 2019. The year 2020 is set to be the biggest yet, both in terms of research published and money invested.

Nature Index 2020 Artificial intelligence
In these pages, we look at emerging technologies that are transforming the ways we live and work, and the growing concern around their potential misuse. We consider the collective responsibility of all who are engaged in the research and development of AI, including publishers, to ensure that it is carried out ethically and inclusively.We are pleased to bring you an experiment in AI-powered curation of content from the Nature Index publisher, Springer Nature, related to drug discovery with AI, as well as an account of the current and future uses of AI of scholarly publishing. We also describe the work of some of the most innovative researchers in the field, and the leading institutions based on output in the 82 high-quality natural-sciences journals tracked by the index.It is important to note that the Nature Index lens on AI research is a very focused one; the articles picked up by our database search concern specific applications of AI in the life sciences, physical sciences, chemistry, and Earth and environmental sciences. Between 2015 and 2019, these highly specialized articles comprised just 1.2% of all AI-related articles in the Dimensions database. The leading institutions for AI in the Nature Index are quite different from those with the most AI-related research in Dimensions, with Western institutions dominating the former and China the latter.

Poland joins the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence
08.12.2020
During the plenary summit held in Montreal, Poland joined the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence and its responsible development. 







The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) is an initiative that leverages international cooperation on key research and projects. The organisation aims at developing a responsible and trustworthy artificial intelligence.
Breakthrough technology
The founding members of the GPAI are Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union (as a single entity enacting international law). On 4 December, the Partnership was joined by new members during a plenary summit –  Poland, Brazil, the Netherlands and Spain.
“On behalf of the Ministerial Council of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, I would like to welcome Poland as a new member. We are certain that Poland will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience in the field of artificial intelligence to this ground-breaking initiative,” wrote Elizabeth Thomas-Raynaud, Secretary of the GPAI.
Poland’s accession into the Partnership is a result of Polish involvement in the field of AI in international forums, including the work of the AIGO (OECD) - Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and HLEG (EC) – High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence, spanning more than two years.
The experts representing Poland on the GPAI forum are attorney Robert Kroplewski, plenipotentiary of the Minister of Digital Affairs for Information Society and Prof. Bogumił Kamiński, Warsaw School of Economics.
AI development in Poland
“Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly turning into one of the most influential technologies in the world today. It changes the way people work and has a significant impact on national economies. Taking advantage of its full potential requires international cooperation and coordination,” claims Minister Marek Zagórski, Secretary of State in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.
New technologies and solutions based on AI have an increasing impact on building the capacity of national economies. Poland also wants to get on this bandwagon.
To this end, the Polish Government has enacted the ""Policy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in Poland” – a document, the goal of which is to achieve this objective, which emerged as a result of months-long consultations. The document has already been approved by the Committee of the Council of Ministers for Digital Affairs, currently pending approval by the Council of Ministers.
The “Policy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in Poland” supports and complements other documents, including the Responsible Development Strategy, the European Commission's Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence, as well as the work of international organisations, including the OECD.    
Our document takes into account not only the international, legal, technical or organisational dimension of the use of artificial intelligence, but also its ethical aspects,” says Minister Marek Zagórski, Secretary of State in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister. “Our mission is to support the society, companies, representatives of the academia and public administration in taking advantage of opportunities related to AI development, while ensuring the protection of human dignity and conditions for fair competition in this global race,” he added.
The document defines actions and objectives for Poland in the short term (2023), medium term (2027) and long term (post-2027) perspective.
We divided them into six areas:
AI and society – activities, whose goal is to make Poland one of the major beneficiaries of a data-based economy, while raising awareness of the need for the continuous improvement of digital competences.
AI and innovative companies – support for Polish AI companies, including the development of financing mechanisms, as well as ways of cooperation between start-ups and the government.
AI and science – support for the Polish scientific and research community in designing interdisciplinary challenges or solutions in the area of AI, including activities aimed at preparing AI expert staff.
AI and education – activities starting in primary schooling and continuing until the university level – course curricula for people at risk of losing their jobs as a result of development of new technologies, educational grants.
AI and international cooperation – activities supporting Polish companies in the field of AI and technology development in the international arena.
AI and the public sector – support for the public sector in the implementation of contracts concerning AI, better coordination of activities and further development of programmes such as GovTech Polska.

The first summit of the Global Partnership for Artificial Intelligence (GPIA) was held in Montreal on December 3 and 4. On this occasion, the Franco-Canadian PMIA initiative was expanded to include four new member states, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland and Brazil.

Officially launched on 15 June 2020, the PMIA has 15 founding members: France, Canada, Australia, the Republic of Korea, the European Union, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. The goal of this international, multi-stakeholder initiative is to promote the responsible use of AI in a spirit of respect for human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and economic growth. To achieve these objectives, member countries work through the PMIA to build bridges between theory and practice, to support research activities or the application of trusted artificial intelligence.
Democratic values, human rights, accountability, transparency, diversity, inclusiveness and privacy are at the core of the values of PMIA and its work.
On the occasion of this first summit, the PMIA bodies (steering committee and council) were officially set up and the first works undertaken by the researchers were presented in plenary session. The experts are notably supported by two centres of expertise located in Paris, hosted by Inria, and in Montreal, hosted by the Montreal International Centre of Expertise for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (CIMIA). Working groups focus on 4 main themes: “Future of Work” and “Innovation & Commercialization” in Paris, and “Responsible AI” and “Data Governance” in Montreal. An additional group dedicated to Covid-19 was launched in 2020 to help address the global health crisis.
This session also confirmed the momentum behind the initiative. Spain, the Netherlands, Poland and Brazil joined the initiative, bringing the number of PMIA member states to 19. The newly elected Steering Committee members include 5 States (France, Canada, United States, Italy and Japan) and 6 AI experts (see list below).
France, which has been designated as the incoming vice-presidency, will assume the presidency in 2022. Canada will hold the presidency until the fall of 2021. The next PMIA Summit will be held in Paris.

                  Congress
                












































Several Senate and House staffers suspect the responsible use of artificial intelligence and America’s technology workforce pipeline could land among big-ticket tech policy items for the next Congress, which is set to start early next month. “I would love to see us putting out proposals related to bias [in AI] and related to the future of work—those are two areas that we have not played in too much yet,” Sam Mulopulos, a legislative assistant for Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said during a virtual event hosted by the Wilson Center Thursday. He spoke alongside a few other Congressional staff members in the AI caucuses. The group reflected on AI-accelerating accomplishments that unfolded through the current but soon-to-end session of Congress. Mulopulos noted the Senate AI Caucus launched in 2019 and before this session closes, all six of its legislative proposals related to the emerging technology are poised to pass through the National Defense Authorization Act, which could soon be up for a vote. While AI is widely used commercially and increasingly leveraged by federal agencies, it remains on-the-rise and less-regulated. Congress members’ views on the tech are generally mixed across the aisle.Explainable AI was defined in American law for the first time in the 2020 NDAA, through legislation partly pushed forward by Portman. Signaling back to that, staff director for the Science Space and Technology Committee’s Subcommittee on Research and Technology Dahlia Sokolov said there’s still a dire need for consensus definitions for other descriptives connected to trustworthy AI.“Bias is probably an easier one, because you get statistical results,” she said. “But a lot of these terms you use around trustworthiness—transparency and explainability are two big ones—we don't actually have agreed upon definitions, so we really need to start at first principles: what do we even agree these things mean and how do we measure them?”The realm of responsible AI is also a sharp focus for Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M, according to the lawmaker’s Military Legislative Assistant Sean Duggan. Offering an example of potential implications in this area, Duggan highlighted the need to be able to trace back an algorithm’s role or choice in denying someone a loan. “I think that AI will only be as useful or accepted as people feel comfortable that it is a part of our everyday lives,” Duggan said. “And if you can't explain that to somebody on the street, then I think that a lot of its usage, and future can be limited. That's one big focus of the senator—and hopefully the Senate AI caucus next year—how do we increase familiarity, trustworthiness and accountability with AI?”Technology evaluations steered by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology could enable new learnings on bias in AI, Mulopulos added, suggesting one on algorithms used to make housing-related decisions and any racial disparities that might arise, prompted by Duggan’s point. AI and accountability in its usage has also emerged as an Executive Branch priority. President Trump signed an executive order last week guiding agencies’ efforts with the technology, with the intent to foster public trust.The panelists agreed that the future of work and broadening America’s technology-focused education pipeline will likely also be in-focus for Congress next year. “Part of what we need to do is start really looking internally about how we can make sure our children ... are educated enough to tackle these jobs,” Mike Richards, deputy chief of staff for Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas, said. A focus could be placed on further incentivizing kids to gain interest in science, technology, engineering and math—or STEM—education paths, he said.Sokolov added that while the federal role in STEM education and the nation’s talent pool is small compared to the state and local levels, it’s not nonexistent. The Science Committee will look back on current incentives, scholarships and fellowships in this space to address ongoing challenges that come with building a future-facing workforce, she noted. They’ll also be “thinking harder and more deeply about this diversity issue in terms of what really works.”“I think we all recognize, too, that this pandemic has set us back on STEM education, and in particular, equal access across the socio-economic spectrum,” Sokolov said. “And it's going to be a real challenge to build our way back out of that.”

AI Digital Oilfield Lab Opens at University of HoustonProject Teams Students, Faculty and Industry to Create Innovative Solutions  
By Jeannie Kever 713-743-0778December 10, 2020


The new Artificial Intelligence Industry Incubator and Digital Oilfield Lab at the University of Houston at Sugar Land offers students, faculty and industry collaborators to use artificial sensors and other equipment.Key players in bringing the lab and incubator to the College of Technology are, from left, Dean Anthony Ambler; Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies George Zouridakis; Konrad Konarski, chair and director of operations at the AI Innovation Consortium; Associate Professor Amaury Lendasse;  Professor of Practice David Crawley; and Associate Professor of Instruction Brian Mehring.The energy industry is rapidly becoming more dependent on the use of data and artificial intelligence. A new Artificial Intelligence Industry Incubator and Digital Oilfield Lab at the University of Houston will allow students, faculty and industry professionals to create the technologies and other solutions needed for the future.
The lab, a project of the UH College of Technology and the AI Innovation Consortium (AIIC), will open later this month, focused on projects that can promote safety and efficiency by, in part, relying on machine learning and other forms of AI to reduce the human footprint in the field. The consortium is based in Louisville, Kentucky, and made up of universities including UH, Pennsylvania State University, the University of Louisville and Louisiana State University, along with a number of corporations.
The Artificial Intelligence Industry Incubator and Digital Oilfield Lab will be housed at the University of Houston at Sugar Land, an instructional site of the University of Houston, and is part of the College of Technology’s Advanced Technology and Innovation Laboratory.
College of Technology Dean Anthony Ambler said the project and membership in the AI Innovation Consortium are a win for both students and industry.
“As subject matter experts in energy technology, our expertise in AI machine learning and robotic process automation and project management has already generated advances for the consortium’s industry partners and for our students,” he said.  
David Crawley, professor of practice in the College of Technology, said the partnership will conduct commercial research and prototyping for the next generation of energy innovation. But beyond the commercial applications, he said, it will support students with workforce skills, industry internships and incubator activities.
“The laboratory and incubator will allow our students to contribute to the various applied research and proof of concept work currently underway and in the future,” Crawley said. “This includes working with the AIIC’s commercial partners to create opportunities to move their incubator experience and advanced academic background into jobs at participating operations.” 
The AIIC has built similar incubator programs at Penn State for industrial manufacturing and the University of Louisville for autonomous driving. For the program at UH, consortium leaders said several companies already have agreed to collaborate on projects focused on AI-powered predictive analytics, AI for visual inspection, and health and safety.
“This incubator program emphasizes the need to build projects grounded in clear business value, with technologically rich and hands-on initiatives, and an engaging industry/academia partnership,” said Konrad Konarski, chair and director of operations at AIIC. “This allows us to focus on the most relevant AI technologies that have immediate impact and value to the oil and gas industry.”
Kris Skrinak, a leader in AI who is global machine learning segment lead for Amazon Web Services and a member of the AIIC advisory council, said the UH program is important for industry in several ways.
“These types of AI programs help strengthen efforts for broader industry adoption and are assisting in cultivating the next generation of AI experts in the workforce,” he said.

In association withNever lose: these rules will ensure you never lose at noughts and crosses - and help you understand AI Illustration by Garry Parsons @Meiklejohn.co.ukJason Deans8 December 2020Welcome to the fifth part of the Future London STEM Project — our series for young people that considers the impact of science, technology, engineering and maths on our world, and explains how you can get involved. Every fortnight we share a STEM challenge for you to try at home, and meet inspiring people who tell us about their STEM jobs and explain how they developed their skills through school, university and beyond.  Today we’re working with the Game AI Research Group at Queen Mary University of London and taking a look at artificial intelligence and the key role it plays in the creation of video games. We’re also meeting Lucrezia Del Zompo who uses artificial intelligence in her job and in her studies.Mike Cook, 33, a research fellow working in Queen Mary’s Game AI Research Group, has helped us with our latest STEM Challenge, in which we show you how to never lose at noughts and crosses — and how to simulate how AI can do the same thing — using just a piece of paper with a set of instructions.  In our third STEM challenge, a magic card trick, we learned how computer algorithms work: how by following a series of logical steps, they guarantee a desired outcome to solving a problem.  AI is often used to describe machines or computers that mimic the learning and problem-solving functions of the human mind. Devices with AI are known as “intelligent agents” — capable of assessing their environment and taking actions to achieve specific goals. They do this by using algorithms that not only follow the same series of steps every time to solve a problem, but are capable of learning by a process of trial and error.  Mike says: “Imagine that you were trying to bake a cake but parts of the recipe were missing. We can bake a cake every day and change the recipe a little each time and see how it tasted. Over time, we’d get closer to a cake that tasted good.
“Those are the kinds of processes where we like to apply AI. Ones where our algorithm doesn’t just do the same thing, but has a way of improving its solution each time it tries and fails.”
If you’ve played a video game, then you will have played against the game’s AI in single-player mode. The AI will be programmed to behave differently, depending on the game. “In a game like The Sims, we want our AI to act more like humans,” explains Mike. “We want it to be emotional, make mistakes, to create dramatic stories.
“Whereas in a game like Dark Souls [for ages 16+], which is about being an adventurer, we want the AI to be difficult but we don’t want it to always beat us. We want it to be predictable so we can learn its movements and work out how to defeat it.”

Sometimes you notice the AI because it’s an enemy, for instance. But not all AI controls characters in games. Some of it is making the game design adapt to things we do.  Mike explains what that means in an online multiplayer game like Fortnite: “Here these intelligent algorithms try to guess where you’re going to move or shoot next, so if there’s a problem with your internet connection, it still feels to you like the correct thing happened.”
AI is also used in video games for “procedural generation”, which is designing the content, the levels and worlds players inhabit. “One of the big examples of this is Minecraft. Minecraft worlds are created by procedural generation and it’s the AI doing the game design,” Mike says.
How to never lose at noughts and crossesWant to impress your friends or family by  never losing at noughts and crosses? In our fifth STEM challenge, we show you how learning a simple set of rules can help you build a winning streak — just make sure your opponent doesn’t learn them too!Noughts and crosses may appear a simple game, yet it’s used by lecturers at Queen Mary University of London to show school students how computer programs and artificial intelligence work. In fact, one of earliest video games, OXO, developed by Cambridge University computer science professor Sandy Douglas in 1952, used an AI program to play noughts and crosses.  Playing noughts and crosses by following the rules below will help you understand how everything computers do is governed by instructions created by computer programmers. This also prompts the question: can something that follows these instructions be considered intelligent?  We’ve worked with the Game AI Research Group, part of the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London on this latest STEM challenge.  Our noughts and crosses challenge is based on an activity co-created by Paul Curzon, professor of computer science in the school, for the Computer Science 4 Fun (cs4fn) project at Queen Mary, which shows how computer science is about solving puzzles, creativity and changing the future.  You will needA piece of paper to write down the rules for never losing at noughts and crossesSome more paper to play noughts and crosses on — or, if you have one, a whiteboard you can wipe clean after every gameA pen or pencil, or a whiteboard penSomeone to play against (preferably an opponent who doesn’t know the rules for never losing a game!The rules for never losing at noughts and crossesOn a piece of paper, write down the following rules — which you could also call a computer program or algorithm as they are a set of instructions to be followed. If you can memorise them, you’ve more chance of winning!
Move 1:  Go in a corner.  Move 2:  If the other player did not go there, THEN go in the opposite corner to move 1. ELSE go in a free corner.  Move 3: If there are 2 Xs and a space in a line, THEN go in that space. IF there are 2 Os and a space in a line, THEN go in that space. IF NOT go in a free corner.  Move 4: IF there are 2 Xs and a space in a line, THEN go in that space. IF there are 2 Os and a space in a line THEN go in that space. IF NOT go in a free corner.  Move 5: Go in the free space.  If you follow the rules every game, you will either win or draw — never lose. Repeat this process until the other player gets tired of you being the noughts and crosses champion!Why do these rules work?Mike Cook says that noughts and crosses is useful for illustrating how computer programs  and AI work. “It’s a determinist game, meaning you always know what’s going to happen when you make a move. It’s also what we  see all the information in the  game at all times, except what the other player is thinking.“The more you play noughts and crosses the more you learn the process by which you can always guarantee a win or a draw. That process is exactly the algorithm you’ve written  down. Most AI comes down to writing some kind of algorithm.”
However, AI is not just an algorithm that follows that same set of instructions no matter what happens. An AI device is an “intelligent agent”, capable of assessing its environment, learning by trial and error and adapting to solve problems.  So where does the intelligence in AI come from — is it from the people who design it or the device itself? This is a big philosophical question that computer scientists are always debating, according to Mike. “Certainly a lot of the intelligence comes from the people who write the algorithms, design computer systems and input data that AI uses. But sometimes we can’t really agree on where the intelligence comes from,” he says. There are examples of AI algorithms that have come up with solutions that no one would ever have thought of.  “With AI we’re trying to find ways to give computers the same kind of reasoning, planning and processes we take for granted. The most fun part of building an AI is trying to figure out how to take this knowledge that you have and express it in a way that a computer can understand and use.”

TK photograph: Erik BlombergA study by Tampere University uses artificial intelligence (AI) to study photographs from World War II in a multidisciplinary research project whose results will help museums and image archives to meet the requirements of the EU’s Web Accessibility Directive. Researchers in various fields will also benefit when AI handles the raw screening of large data.“Our study has much to offer in terms of accessibility on the one hand and AI and image research on the other,” says Anssi Männistö, university lecturer in visual journalism.
Männistö is a member of research projects related to AI and image analysis of war photos taken during WW2. The starting point is basic research whose results can help the work of digital archives that contain millions of images. The results will benefit memory organisations, such as archives, libraries, museums and research institutes, as well as newspapers, media and image archives owned by private companies.
A solution for museums’ problem with EU Directive
The multidisciplinary research group received funding from the Academy of Finland’s Intelligent Society Programme for the research project “Improving Public Accessibility of Large Image Archives” (IPALIA), which uses AI to study the accessibility of large image archives. At Tampere University, three research fields participate in the study: machine learning, information studies and visual culture research.
The project aims to improve public access to large image databases and collections in a way that meets the conditions of the EU’s Web Accessibility Directive that entered into force in September.
The directive requires that all images that are publicly available online must be accompanied by a textual description of the content. This requirement is a bottleneck for image archives and museums because there are no cheap and efficient methods to do this work. The problem is particularly great for Finnish-language and Finnish image content.
The research project will use materials from the Finnish Wartime Photograph Archive of the Finnish Defence Forces, which contains almost 160,000 photographs taken by the information troops (TK) during the Finnish Winter, Continuation and Lapland Wars captured in 1939–1945.
According to Männistö, the aim of the new research project that is about be launched is to create a model that provides content description for the TK images in accordance with the directive. The same model will also help other museums and image archives to meet the conditions of the directive.
“The purpose is to provide help in a big challenge. The obligation to have descriptive texts is a rather big problem for many museums,” Männistö says.
Männistö considers the situation to be optimal for AI research because there is a high demand for practical accessibility solutions.
Ideological undertones of war photographs
The captions for images are often written with an emphasis on factors that do not meet the conditions for accessibility. Images from the front may even contain an ideological or propagandistic description of the situation.
AI and algorithms are not neutral either, but in their basic form they extract quantitative information from many images, for example, of individuals, animals, objects, buildings and their numbers.
AI does not tell you directly that the sergeant major and the captain in the photo are in an artillery barrage or in a certain place in their free time. Instead, it can tell, for example, which patterns or objects are in the front or behind the main characters. Männistö is particularly fascinated by the fact that AI is also able to do spatial analysis.
AI produces basic descriptive text, but it is still partly unclear how much it manages to say about the sexes and age groups of the people in the photo and how well it is able to determine, for example, the weather or the season.
“We have a pretty big basic research component. It is not possible to say with certainty how deep we will get, but we are quite sure that we will gain interesting results,” Männistö says.
The research project has agreed with the Tampere Museum Centre Vapriikki that the model created in the project will be tested with some of Vapriikki’s materials in the final phase.
“There may be certain special characteristics in the war imagery that are good to analyse and exclude and to examine how generalisable our method is. We are pleased to have this opportunity,” Männistö notes.
Männistö praises the research project, for example, for the fact that the new Tampere University can, at its best, introduce genuine and new creative multidisciplinary research and problem solving.
In addition to Männistö, Postdoctoral Research Fellow Jenni Raitoharju, who studies machine learning and AI, and Associate Professor Sanna Kumpulainen from information studies are involved in the planning and implementation of the IPALIA project.
AI names people and animals in the contents of photographs. As a new feature, it can also distinguish spatial elements. Identifying TK photographers in the study “Machine Learning Based Analysis of Finnish World War II Photographers”.
WW2 photos are public, but their contents have not been analysed
The Finnish WW2 images have been published for everyone to use, but only a small part of them have been used in eg books. According to Männistö, no one still has a precise idea of the totality of the huge material.
“The photos have been published, but I hit a wall while getting acquainted with their number, contents and temporal variation,” Männistö describes his research experiences.
The idea of using machine learning for the analysis of war images arose when Männistö went through such images while writing a book with historian Ville Kivimäki.
In the first phase, Männistö and an international research group conducted an AI based analysis of the war images whose results have been reported in the article “Machine Learning Based Analysis of Finnish World War II Photographers”. The study is known to be the first of its kind worldwide.
According to Männistö, a new dimension of photographic research is introduced in the article, which is the fact that the study distinguishes between basic image sizes such as overview shots, medium shots and close-ups. AI also distinguished where the people in the image are located. These functions can be applied by museums and media houses.
With traditional methods, researchers can browse and observe the quantitative properties of images very slowly, which means that the numbers of images that can be examined are small, only a few hundred or thousand images.
The research group got AI to analyse about 59,000 WW2 images in a short time. The study produced interesting distributions that would have taken months or years to do with other methods.
From war image analysis to photos about covid-19
The analysis of war images will be helpful when Männistö begins studying photographs published in the Helsingin Sanomat (HS) newspaper during the covid-19 pandemic in the KORTE project. According to Männistö, the method implemented in the study to identify the mutual distance of the persons in the image in both depth and width is the key to being able to analyse the changes in the distances between people in HS photographs during the pandemic.
In the research project, the character structure of approximately 80,000–100,000 images will be broken down by machine learning and the interrelationships between image content will be investigated further. In the second phase of the project, qualitative analysis – meaning more traditional media research methods – will be used. It is not a question of alternative but of complementary methods.
Männistö says that the transition from WW2 images to newspaper images is a tremendous leap into another era. The images of WW2 basically lack all metadata, such as information about the time, place, and camera settings, which in modern cameras are automatically saved to an image file.
The sample of newspaper images will cover a period of 6–7 months in 2020 and the same months for 2019. AI will screen information from the HS images about the mode in which the images were taken, whether indoors or outdoors, and whether the people are close to each other or far apart. The basic distribution will provide a starting point for qualitative analysis.

Researchers will have more time for their studies
The new opportunities afforded by AI and machine learning are likely to revolutionise research by analysing raw data.
Männistö remembers how in the 1990s, he went through six months of the Time and Suomen Kuvalehti magazines in six research periods in search of images on Islam for his doctoral dissertation.
“It took me months to go through the magazines. I took photocopies and there were no digital cameras,” Männistö reminisces.
He went through hundreds of images and browsed thousands of pages. Now, he estimates that thanks to AI, a zero could be added to the end of those numbers and a couple of zeros deleted from the time he spent. That time can now be used on the qualitative analysis part.
“I find this inspiring because new methods are being developed and it is tested how they could work together in the multidisciplinary study of journalism, communication and history,” Männistö says.
In the future, huge amounts of data can be processed with the help of AI, and researchers’ time is freed from browsing pages to the actual research analysis.
“I cannot say when we are at a mature stage, but we are now taking decisive steps in that direction. There are likely to be setbacks, but I’m very excited about this method,” Männistö enthuses.

New applications powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are being embraced by the public and private sectors. Their early uses hint at what’s to come.FACIAL RECOGNITION: Recognizing biasIn June 2020, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft announced that they were stepping back from facial-recognition software development amid concerns that it reinforces racial and gender bias. Amazon and Microsoft said they would stop selling facial-recognition software to police until new laws are passed in the United States to address potential human-rights abuses. IBM has called for an industry-wide review of the technology and how it is used.Earlier in the year, Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, backed a proposal by the European Union to temporarily ban the technology in public places, such as train stations and stadiums.Facial-recognition systems are trained using a vast number of images to create ‘faceprints’ of people by mapping the geometry of certain facial features. Faceprints are used to classify a face into categories such as gender, age or race, and to compare it to other faceprints stored in databases. According to a 2018 report by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), between 2014 and 2018, facial-recognition systems became 20 times better at finding a match in a database of 12 million portrait photos. But a separate study, published by NIST in December 2019, found that African-American and Asian faces were misidentified 10 to 100 times more often than Caucasian men (P. J. Grother et al. NIST Interagency/Internal Report 8280; 2019). The systems also had difficulty identifying women.

Nature Index 2020 Artificial intelligence
In a seminal paper published in 2018 by Timnit Gebru, former co-lead of Google’s Ethical AI Team in Mountain View, California) and Joy Buolamwini from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, male and light-skinned subjects were found to be more accurately classified than female and dark-skinned subjects. The study states that such errors occur largely because the systems were trained using mostly white, male-dominated data sets. One widely used data set was roughly 75% male and 80% white (J. Buolamwini and T. Gebru Proc. Mach. Learn. Res. 81, 77–91; 2018).“There is a realization in the computer facial recognition community that there are high-stakes consequences, especially for marginal communities,” says Ellen Broad, an AI governance and ethics expert at the Australian National University in Canberra.A Nature survey, featured in a November 2020 special issue on facial recognition, revealed discomfort among some researchers working in the field, particularly with regards to how its use might affect minority groups (see Nature 587, 354–358; 2020). The 480 respondents said they were most uncomfortable about the use of facial recognition for live surveillance in schools and workplaces, and by companies to monitor public spaces, but were generally in support of it being used by police in criminal investigations.The New York Police Department (NYPD) has been using facial-recognition technology since 2011 to match faces of unidentified criminals in surveillance footage and crime scene photos to those on watch lists. The NYPD states that no known case in New York City involves a person being falsely arrested on the basis of a facial-recognition match.Despite concerns, facial-recognition software use is on the rise in many countries. It is now widespread in China and its use is growing rapidly in India. In 2019, the Australian government’s Identity-matching Services Bill authorized the Department of Home Affairs to create and maintain facilities for the sharing of facial images and other identity information between government agencies and, in some circumstances, private organizations. — by Leigh DaytonDEEPFAKE: Blink and you’ll miss itThe origins of deepfake, using AI to create falsified photos, videos or audio files, can be traced to 2017, when pornographic videos spliced with celebrities’ faces were posted online. The early iterations that followed were relatively easy to detect, says Siwei Lyu, professor of computer science at the State University of New York at Buffalo, who pioneered a technique when he noticed that people in deepfake videos blinked far less often than they do in real life. As the technology advanced, so did Lyu’s detection algorithms. They are now designed to identify the subtle changes left by creators when they resize or rotate a person’s face to merge or superimpose it onto an image or video.One way to create a deepfake video, Lyu explains, is using a neural network called a generative adversarial network (GAN), split into two parts. The ‘generator’ is trained using thousands of photos, videos or audio files to create hyper-realistic, but false, versions. The ‘discriminator’ detects poorly made fakes by comparing them to the real thing. The two parts might compete back and forth millions of times before the generator creates something realistic enough to ‘fool’ the discriminator.The more advanced the GAN, the less training data it requires. That’s one reason why Hao Li, professor of computer science at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, thinks the battle to detect deepfakes could already be lost. “The fakes are getting so much better that they’re undetectable in real time,” he says.In 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that deepfake audio was used to impersonate the voice of a chief executive from an unnamed UK-based energy firm to complete a fraudulent €220,000 (US$261,000) bank transfer.Li hopes that the more people learn about the existence of deepfakes, the less effective they will become. In September 2020, Microsoft Research launched its Video Authenticator software to combat the spread of disinformation through deepfakes, particularly those designed to undermine electoral processes and COVID-19 health advice.Although there is an urgent need to combat deceptive deepfakes, the technology is increasingly being embraced by researchers, particularly in fields such as medicine and astronomy. In 2019, for example, a team from the Institute of Medical Informatics at the University of Lübeck in Germany proposed the use of GANs to create hyper-realistic medical images to train AI used in cancer diagnosis. And a team led by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California is using its ‘CosmoGAN’ system to produce maps of dark matter in the Universe. — by Bill CondieAI DRUG DISCOVERY: Quicker treatments In January 2020, researchers launched the world’s first human clinical trial of a drug discovered using AI. Intended to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the compound DSP-1181 was identified using an AI drug discovery platform called Centaur Chemist.After trawling through chemical libraries containing thousands of molecules, Centaur Chemist found the most relevant compounds for regulating serotonin, a chemical in the brain that has been linked to OCD. These were synthesized and tested in the lab before DSP-1181 was selected for a clinical trial in Japan.

The project is led by Exscientia, the British pharmaceutical company that owns Centaur Chemist, and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, a Japanese pharmaceutical firm. It took less than 12 months for the team to progress from the discovery stage to the end of preclinical testing. The global average is four to six years. If DSP-1181 obtains regulatory approval, it would be a major feat. Ninety per cent of compounds that start phase I trials (the earliest trials of drugs in people) fail to make it to market.AI-powered systems have the potential to rapidly accelerate the drug-discovery process and thereby reduce spending. Bringing a new drug to market costs, on average, up to US$2.8 billion, and can take more than a decade. “Drug discovery is so expensive; anything, no matter how small, is going to be of immense benefit,” says Toby Walsh, professor of artificial intelligence at the University of New South Wales in Australia. “I can’t think of a more pressing time to develop drugs more cheaply and quickly.”The project follows work by Hong Kong-based biotechnology company, Insilico Medicine, and its machine-learning platform, GENTRL. A 2019 Nature Biotechnology paper led by Insilico founder Alexander Zhavoronkov describes how, in 46 days, the company designed, synthesized and experimentally validated a drug that targets a protein linked to a number of diseases, including fibrosis (A. Zhavoronkov et al. Nature Biotechnol. 37, 1038–1040; 2019). The drug has been found to be effective in rats.It’s unsurprising that pharmaceutical giants are increasingly partnering with AI firms for drug development. In August 2020, Exscientia was named alongside Pfizer, Bayer and Merck as one of 37 partners in the new Corona Accelerated R&D Europe initiative, the largest undertaking of its kind to discover and develop COVID-19 treatments. — by Leigh DaytonREADING NON-VERBAL CUES: Emotional intelligenceEmotion AI describes systems that can recognize, respond to and simulate moods and emotions. Designed to detect non-verbal cues, including body language, facial expressions and tone of voice, technologies based on emotion AI are being developed by industries such as recruitment, health care and education.In offices or classrooms, for example, emotional cues could be used to detect those who are overworked or disengaged, says Simon Lucey, director of the Australian Institute of Machine Learning at the University of Adelaide, South Australia. “It’s a fantastic application base to flag early signs of people who are stressed,” says Lucey. Researchers are also exploring how emotion AI could detect signs of depression and anxiety.Research on emotion AI has grown rapidly. According to the Dimensions database, the number of publications that mention ‘emotion AI’, ‘sentiment analysis’ and ‘opinion mining’ has increased almost tenfold between 2011 and 2019, from 1,225 publications to 11,926.Companies such as Affectiva, founded by researchers from the MIT Media Lab, offer products aimed at detecting consumer reactions to brands and advertisements. In South Korea, nearly one-quarter of the top 131 corporations say they are using or plan to use emotion AI in recruitment, according to the Korea Economic Research Institute. Companies selling these systems, such as Midas IT, based in Pangyo, South Korea, claim that they can determine if a candidate is more likely to have qualities such as honesty or tenacity, based on expressions and word choice during interviews.Researchers are calling for caution. They point to a lack of evidence that current emotion AI products can accurately deduce an individual’s emotional state. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, says it is also concerning that such technologies assume that certain facial movements are universally perceived as expressions of particular emotions. Her research, which includes studies conducted with small communities in the Pacific, found diversity, rather than uniformity, in how people across cultures interpret facial movements. — by Bill Condie

Considering this advancing trend, many eCommerce businesses have begun to use different forms of artificial intelligence for understanding their customers’ buying behavior, offering relevant products at the right time, and identifying competitors’ strategies by enabling AI reliable analytics. To add to that, competition across global eCommerce markets is at an all-time high. While eCommerce companies are standing up to these market challenges, AI brings the best results in business operations. Build Your Next eCommerce Strategy With AI-based ModelsE-commerce businesses around the world are using AI to accomplish tedious tasks so they can channel their efforts towards more intelligent work. From Alexa to Google’s home devices & chatbots artificial intelligence has already been a part of our lives. Likewise, AI in eCommerce has improved the entire experience of online buying & selling and adding a personal touch to the customer experience. Companies like Amazon and  have already revolutionized their traditional practices to bring the best results in their businesses.But how are they doing this? In this article, we will see various applications of artificial intelligence in eCommerce.Personalization of Online PurchasesArtificial intelligence in eCommerce offers personalized and interactive buying experiences. With AI-enabled systems, companies can view their customers’ preferences in real-time and provide them with reliable and specialized shopping experiences. AI can deliver suitable product suggestions according to the preferences of the user. AI can play a big role in identifying customer behavior through personalization and, by analyzing clicks, shopping carts, purchasing history, and search queries. All these can help eCommerce brands to deliver suitable suggestions for additional purchases that make sense in the eyes of the user. Warehouse AutomationAI in eCommerce is also transforming warehouse management for small businesses. AI-powered solutions help to streamline product pick-and-pack processes without taking lunch breaks. AI robots can work 24/7. Employing AI solutions in the warehouse can result in a reduction of errors as AI robots understand their placement and thus can place and retrieve them when required. Warehouses can also use technologies such as IoT and AR/VR, that work in tandem with AI to improve the accuracy in warehouse operations. AI robots can monitor warehouse operations as well. And they can identify and assess the risk score of activities in the warehouse by analyzing them. The robots can also take over the high-risk tasks, and thus is beneficial for improving the safety of employees at the warehouse.Visual SearchAI-enabled visual search is the ability to use an image to search for identical or similar visual images. A product picture is worth a thousand words, visual product searchability can undoubtedly solve the issue of inaccurate search queries. When purchasing online a customer should have a simple search process but in many cases the journey from ‘searching’ to ‘seeing’ a product is a path filled with hassles that often leads to no-purchase at all. AI-enabled visual search eases the way consumers see a product. AI in eCommerce has improved the visual search capabilities and helps in finding products that match close to your search. AI ChatbotsAnother popular example of AI in eCommerce is Chatbot. These are systems that interact either through text or voice interface. With AI chatbots in eCommerce, consumers can speak to a device rather than typing on a keyboard. Some of the best examples of AI chatbots are Facebook Messenger and Slack. They can adapt to any language and respond depending on the region. AI chatbots can benefit eCommerce businesses especially those who receive international requests in a multitude of languages. The chatbots understand the dialect and languages including past behavior of a user and customer chat statistics to provide the best possible solution. Popular eCommerce websites such as Amazon and eBay have implemented AI chatbot applications to deliver convenient order placing and customer service experience to the users.Superior User ExperienceWith AI in eCommerce, certain advanced systems are being used by companies such as facial recognition, recommendation engine, and voice interfaces. These systems help in understanding customer behavior when buying a particular product or service. The AI-enabled programs assist eCommerce in creating a better user experience for different circumstances. If you’re not already using these AI eCommerce systems, you should begin experimenting with a few and watch the results. eCommerce Catalog ManagementNowadays retailers need to create a convenient and user-friendly process of online shopping to satisfy the needs of shoppers. So, it’s important for online retailers to have good catalog management for a better user experience. An online eCommerce catalog provides product names, descriptions, prices, supplier details, and other related information. Within those thousands of product categories, small details like color, texture, pattern, style, sleeve, length, bottom type, and fit need to be accurately mentioned in the catalog to help customers get the right product information.The use of AI in eCommerce catalogs can now help in obtaining accurate and consistent data for getting deeper catalog insights. Similarly, automated product tagging by AI improves business operation efficiency and gives retailers the ability to track or tag manually. Automated product tagging tailored by AI increases business operation efficiency and ensures a better shopping experience. For example, a catalog can have 10,000 products in different colors, shapes, sizes, and they all need to be tagged correctly. AI-enabled automatic tagging organizes and tags the product catalog based on their characteristics. This is the reason why a lot of eCommerce companies have adopted this technology, making it an essential part of their online selling strategy. Automated Pricing ManagementApart from managing catalogs, inventory, and taking care of customer purchase preferences, as an online retailer, you must also know the best price for your products. Thanks to AI, eCommerce companies are able to provide them with the smallest detail possible that helps them to improve their business operations. In a nutshell, with AI in eCommerce pricing, you have analytics software for price analysis that uses a certain statistical model, machine learning, and a number of other AI models to create algorithms that automatically identify pricing patterns from the data and predict prices based on that information. Automated AI pricing solutions in eCommerce can help reduce the manual work regarding tracking the prices of your competition. This way, businesses have the ability to determine product prices based on data from both internal and external sources. TakeawaysIn this post, we’ve looked at how businesses can use artificial intelligence in eCommerce to increase overall profit margins.Today, the use of artificial intelligence in eCommerce is booming and more and more businesses are adapting to this trend. In such a competitive scenario, AI in eCommerce really plays an important role in creating personalized experiences. For competing with top eCommerce giants like Amazon and Flipkart, businesses should adopt AI in eCommerce business processes as soon as possible.",,artificial-intelligence-ecommerce-start-using,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['/html/head/title', ""/html/head/meta[@name='description']/@content""]}","{'@type': 'AudioObject', 'caption': 'Artificial Intelligence In eCommerce: It’s Time To Start Using It ', 'transcript': 'Artificial Intelligence has progressed to the point where it has become an essential component of the eCommerce industry.

Popular eCommerce websites such as Amazon and eBay have implemented AI chatbot applications to deliver convenient order placing and customer service experience to the users.Superior User ExperienceWith AI in eCommerce, certain advanced systems are being used by companies such as facial recognition, recommendation engine, and voice interfaces. These systems help in understanding customer behavior when buying a particular product or service. The AI-enabled programs assist eCommerce in creating a better user experience for different circumstances. If you’re not already using these AI eCommerce systems, you should begin experimenting with a few and watch the results.\xa0eCommerce Catalog ManagementNowadays retailers need to create a convenient and user-friendly process of online shopping to satisfy the needs of shoppers. So, it’s important for online retailers to have good catalog management for a better user experience. An online eCommerce catalog provides product names, descriptions, prices, supplier details, and other related information. Within those thousands of product categories, small details like color, texture, pattern, style, sleeve, length, bottom type, and fit need to be accurately mentioned in the catalog to help customers get the right product information.The use of AI in eCommerce catalogs can now help in obtaining accurate and consistent data for getting deeper catalog insights. Similarly, automated product tagging by AI improves business operation efficiency and gives retailers the ability to track or tag manually. Automated product tagging tailored by AI increases business operation efficiency and ensures a better shopping experience. For example, a catalog can have 10,000 products in different colors, shapes, sizes, and they all need to be tagged correctly. AI-enabled automatic tagging organizes and tags the product catalog based on their characteristics. This is the reason why a lot of eCommerce companies have adopted this technology, making it an essential part of their online selling strategy.\xa0Automated Pricing ManagementApart from managing catalogs, inventory, and taking care of customer purchase preferences, as an online retailer, you must also know the best price for your products. Thanks to AI, eCommerce companies are able to provide them with the smallest detail possible that helps them to improve their business operations. In a nutshell, with AI in eCommerce pricing, you have analytics software for price analysis that uses a certain statistical model, machine learning, and a number of other AI models to create algorithms that automatically identify pricing patterns from the data and predict prices based on that information.\xa0Automated AI pricing solutions in eCommerce can help reduce the manual work regarding tracking the prices of your competition. This way, businesses have the ability to determine product prices based on data from both internal and external sources.\xa0TakeawaysIn this post, we’ve looked at how businesses can use artificial intelligence in eCommerce to increase overall profit margins.Today, the use of artificial intelligence in eCommerce is booming and more and more businesses are adapting to this trend. In such a competitive scenario, AI in eCommerce really plays an important role in creating personalized experiences.

What's more? Well, recently drones again hit the headlines, owing to their new ability to help people, hikers lost in woods. In their paper published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence, researchers, David Schedl, Indrajit Kurmi and Oliver Bimber, from Johannes Kepler University, share how artificial intelligence to improve thermal imaging camera searches for people lost in woods..When hikers, trekkers or commoners are lost in woods, rescue team rely on binoculars, and thermal imagers installed on camera and in chopper sensors, to find the missing. Generally, the thermal imaging devices highlight differences in body temperature of people on the ground versus their surroundings, making them easier to spot.  However, the problem with these forms of devices is that they fail to work efficiently due to dense vegetation covering the soil and preventing wide or long-range view searches. Additionally, in the case of thermal imaging, heat signage from external factors like the sun, ambient heat from trees, fauna and other humans' body heat also interfere with the search process. Further, these existing tools used in such search and rescue operations are not sufficient nor speed up the mission..The trio team of researchers hence focused on surmounting these problems by using a deep learning application to improve the images that are made. They engineered drones which can be particularly adept at recognizing humans from everything that surrounds them. They aimed to show how automated person detection under occlusion conditions can be notably improved by combining multi-perspective images before classification..They employed image integration by airborne optical sectioning (AOS). AOS is a synthetic aperture imaging technique that uses camera drones to capture unstructured thermal light fields. In simpler terms, they used AI application to process multiple images of a specific area. This is interesting because comparing and processing of data from different cameras allow several thermal imagers to work as one large telescope..After processing the artificial intelligence ​​images, the final terrain images produced have a higher depth of field, i.e. the footage shows how the tops of the trees appear blurry, while the outlines of people on the ground were more recognizable..For training the artificial intelligence system, the researchers had to create their own image database. They used drones to photograph volunteers on the ground in a variety of positions. The system test results showed that the accuracy of this solution ranged from 87%-95% when compared to 25% of traditional thermal imaging images. Also, using AOS helped researchers achieve a precision and recall of 96% and 93%, respectively..&quot;In the future, rescuing lost, ill or injured persons will increasingly be carried out by autonomous drones. However, discovering humans in densely forested terrain is challenging because of occlusion, and robust detection mechanisms are required. We show that automated person detection under occlusion conditions can be notably improved by combining multi-perspective images before classification,&quot; say the researchers. They also revealed that their system is ready for use by search and rescue crews and could also be used by law enforcement, the military, or wildlife management teams. Moreover, these findings can lay the foundation for effective future search-and-rescue technologies that can be applied in combination with autonomous or human-crewed aircraft..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
