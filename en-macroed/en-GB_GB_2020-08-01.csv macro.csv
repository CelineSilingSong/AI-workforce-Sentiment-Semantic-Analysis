By Social EuropePublisher: Social Europe (in cooperation with Friedrich-Ebert Stiftung and Weizenbaum Institut)Published: 1st August 2020Free PDF DownloadDossier Description
Artificial Intelligence is permeating a wide range of areas and it is bound to transform work and society. This dossier, published in cooperation with our partner Friedrich Ebert Stiftung and Weizenbaum Institute, addresses possibilities and challenges of AI. Above all, it asks what needs to be done politically in order to shape this transformation for the sake of the common good.
AI has conjured up a dystopia of robots displacing human workers from employment. Some have predicted very large-scale job substitution but others question whether such a predetermined outcome can be envisaged: whether jobs are lost and how they are changed depends on whether workers are involved in the decisions that are made. Similar concerns apply to issues of recruitment and monitoring of workers: will AI data serve a ‘surveillance capitalism’ or could it assist workers in the performance of their jobs if they have more power to influence the outcome?
AI raises wider questions about the society in which we live and that of the future. Market-research institutes foresee huge efficiency gains, but are these credible and, if so, how will such gains be distributed? Feminists and anti-racists have expressed concern that the algorithms on which AI depends unconsciously embed the social prejudices of their human authors. Issues of privacy and civil liberty surround the possession and control of the data mined by AI. How education must change so that citizens can feel empowered rather than alienated by AI is also at stake—as is the ever-present issue of where AI fits in meeting the existential challenge of climate change and biodiversity loss.

3 Important Ways Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Your Business And Turbocharge Success Adobe Stock

But before you can develop a robust AI strategy – in which you work out how best to use AI to drive business success – you first need to understand what’s possible with AI. To put it another way, how are other companies using AI to drive success?

Broadly speaking, organizations are using AI in three main ways:

·        Creating more intelligent products

PROMOTED
·        Offering a more intelligent service
·        Improving internal business processes
Let’s briefly look at each area in turn.
Creating more intelligent products

Thanks to the Internet of Things, a whole host of everyday products are getting smarter. What started with smartphones has now grown to include smart TVs, smartwatches, smart speakers, and smart home thermostats – plus a range of more eyebrow-raising ""smart"" products such as smart nappies, smart yoga mats, smart office chairs, and smart toilets.

Generally, these smart products are designed to make customers’ lives easier and remove those annoying bugbears from everyday life. For example, you can now get digital insoles that slip into your running shoes and gather data (using pressure sensors) about your running style. An accompanying app will give you real-time analysis of your running performance and technique, thereby helping you avoid injuries and become a better runner.

Offering a more intelligent service
Instead of the traditional approach of selling a product or service as a one-off transaction, more and more businesses are transitioning to a servitization model, in which the product or service is delivered as an ongoing subscription. Netflix is a prime example of this model in action. For a less obvious example, how about the Dollar Shave Club, which will deliver razor blades and grooming products to your door on a regular basis. Or Stich Fix, a personalized styling service that delivers clothes to your door based on your personal style, size, and budget.
Intelligent services like this are reliant on data and AI. Businesses like Netflix have access to a wealth of valuable customer data – data that helps the company provide a more thoughtful service, based on what it knows the customer really wants (whether it’s movies, clothes, grooming products or whatever).
Improving internal business processes
In theory, AI could be worked into pretty much any aspect of a business: manufacturing, HR, marketing, sales, supply chain and logistics, customer services, quality control, IT, finance and more.
From automated machinery and vehicles to customer service chatbots and algorithms that detect customer fraud, AI solutions and technologies are being incorporated into all sorts of business functions in order to maximize efficiency, save money and improve business performance.
So, which area should you focus on – products, services, or business processes?
Every business is different, and how you decide to use AI may differ wildly from even your closest competitor. For AI to truly add value in your business, it must be aligned with your company’s key strategic goals – which means you need to be clear on what it is you're trying to achieve before you can identify how AI can help you get there.
That said, it’s well worth considering all three areas: products, services and business processes. Sure, one of the areas is likely to be more of a priority than the others, and that priority will depend on your company’s strategic goals. But you shouldn’t ignore the potential of the other AI uses.
For example, a product-based business might be tempted to skip over the potential for intelligent services, while a service-based company could easily think smart products aren’t relevant to its business model. Both might think AI-driven business processes are beyond their capabilities at this point in time.
But the most successful, most talked-about companies on the planet are those that deploy AI across all three areas. Take Apple as an example. Apple built its reputation on making and selling iconic products like the iPad. Yet, nowadays, Apple services (including Apple Music and Apple TV) generate more revenue than iPad sales. The company has transitioned from purely a product company to a service provider, with its iconic products supporting intelligent services. And you can be certain that Apple uses AI and data to enhance its internal processes.
In this way, AI can throw up surprising additions and improvements to your business model – or even lead you to an entirely new business model that you never previously considered. It can lead you from products to services, or vice versa. And it can throw up exciting opportunities to enhance the way you operate.
That’s why I recommend looking at products, services, and business processes when working out your AI priorities. You may ultimately decide that optimizing your internal processes (for example, automating your manufacturing) is several years away, and that’s fine. The important thing is to consider all the AI opportunities, so that you can properly prioritize what you want to achieve and develop an AI strategy that works for your business.

AI is going to impact businesses of all shapes and sizes, across all industries. Discover how to prepare your organization for an AI-driven world in my new book, The Intelligence Revolution: Transforming Your Business With AI.

Ensuring artificial intelligence is humane and regulated

August 5, 2020 



 




© Peshkova | 
Alejandro Saucedo, Member of the European Commission’s High Level Expert Group Reserve List on AI and Engineering Director at Seldon, argues that to ensure artificial intelligence is humane, it must be regulated
Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to bring about both transformational change and cost savings in virtually every sector. In fact, the improvements in productivity and innovation unlocked by AI are currently unleashing a “Fourth Industrial Revolution”, which PwC estimates will contribute over $15.7 trillion to the global economy and add at least 9.9% to Northern Europe’s GDP by 2030.
However, if our society doesn’t implement this technology properly, AI threatens to unleash a plethora of social injustices. The EU doesn’t currently have specific standards or legislative instruments to regulate the development and implementation of AI so as to help prevent it from being a source of injustice. In the coming years, I believe we need to see legislation — similar in scope to GDPR — come into play in this field.
The risks of AI
Despite the massive potential upsides, there are reasonable and legitimate fears regarding the widespread adoption of AI. The use of AI by bad faith actors raises a host of risks for personal and organisational cybersecurity, and AI’s use in predicting individual decisions raises a swathe of privacy concerns. We also know that the job displacement AI will bring to some industries may threaten livelihoods, let alone the less discussed mental health challenges that AI will bring.
More insidiously, improper practices with AI can lead to it perpetuating undesirable biases in society. The data that AI systems are “trained” with by data scientists and developers have a direct effect on the findings and decisions they output, meaning that feeding an AI model biased data can lead to it making socially unjust decisions. For example, many predictive policing AIs across the U.S. have been “trained” with falsified data that biases their decision-making against ethnic minorities. This is highly problematic and highlights the importance of training AI models with carefully-assessed and representative data.
Further, there is the risk that individuals and organisations can delegate decision-making entirely to AI systems, which reduces accountability and increases ambiguity. This is dangerous, as decisions made by AI models can influence major decisions, such as if a person receives a loan, gets hired for a job, or comes under suspicion by law enforcement.
To illustrate this problem, consider the case of a person who is wrongfully arrested on the basis of an AI model’s conclusions – who is responsible? Is it the individual policeman who acted on the AI’s predictions, or the whole department for not having a human-in-the-loop structure to vet their AI properly, or the compliance officer who signed the model off, or the developer who first deployed the AI model? This all shows that if improperly handled, the complexity of AI opens up a bureaucratic nightmare that’s rigged against those who may seek restitution or justice.
AI experts have the tools to tackle the risks
Regardless of how well we can automate processes with AI capabilities, any accountable structure will ultimately require humans at its core. Based on this, developers, data scientists and AI specialists have a professional responsibility throughout the development, deployment and operation of AI systems. Whether it is about mitigating undesired biases, ensuring AI processes remain accountable, or guaranteeing privacy by design in machine learning systems, there’s much that those who develop and operate AI models can do.
For mitigating bias, we can be more rigorous with our training data, ensuring that it’s properly representative of the real world by leveraging data science best practices together with domain knowledge, thus reducing the risk of our models making unjust and discriminatory decisions. We can also bring in subject experts in the areas we’re applying models in, ensuring that they subject the model to rigorous assessments of its decision-making abilities in their field throughout development.
In turn, we can also take steps to make models more interpretable. We can spend more time and resources, leveraging explainability tools and processes to introduce explainability into models and AI systems, so they are more understandable to laypeople. This way, the teams using the models know exactly why they’re making a decision and can decide whether the logic is valid. We can introduce humans into helping AIs make their decisions, so there’s always a human agent who shoulders responsibility if something goes wrong.
To make AI humane, regulation is essential
However, for the above to be implemented, we cannot realistically expect data scientists and developers to do it alone. Complex ethical decisions that impact people’s lives cannot just rest on the shoulders of a single developer or data scientist. Companies often tend towards short-run profitability over decisions that would benefit society in the long-run, and making AI humane means putting additional time and resources into an activity that doesn’t immediately generate revenue.
That’s why we need a regulatory environment for AI, and both policymakers and developers need to be proactive and engage in interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure it can be efficiently created. If done well, good regulation that compels organisations to adopt these best practices for AI development and deployment can be a catalyst for innovation, since the additional confidence and stability in the industry will encourage investment and new roles across the field.

Under favorable conditions, however, Russia is quite capable of becoming a serious player and even a local leader in certain areas.",,,N/A,N/A,"Russia’s leaders have been paying close attention to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for several years now. President Vladimir Putin has said on numerous occasions that the leader in the field of AI would become “the master of the world.” Until recently, however, Russia remained virtually the only large country without its own AI development strategy.
That changed in October 2019, when the country adopted a long-discussed National Strategy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence Through 2030. One of the driving forces behind the strategy was Sberbank president German Gref. The state-owned bank has also developed a road map for developing AI in Russia and coordinated the creation of Russia’s AI development strategy, which is largely corporate, involving the internet giants Yandex and Mail.ru Group, along with Gazprom Neft energy company.
The same companies, along with MTS and the Russian Direct Investment Fund that joined later, have formed a structure known as the AI Russia Alliance, which is tasked with promoting Russia’s AI-based technologies. The alliance was established on November 9, 2019, at the AI Journey conference attended by Putin. The new entity is supposed to lobby for simpler procedures for introducing AI technologies, as well as the participation of business in two areas: developing driverless transportation, and legislation relating to industrial and personal data.
The alliance is expected to coordinate the efforts of the business and scientific communities to attain the objectives set forth in the national AI strategy. It can be concluded, therefore, that the driving force developing Russian AI technologies in the near future will be commercial—and that it will be large IT companies rather than start-ups.
The Russian government finances industry-specific projects—quite generously by Russian standards—which testifies to the high priority assigned to this field. The application of AI in the military industry, in which Russia’s position is traditionally strong, is the subject of particular attention.
Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Russia will become a leader in the development of AI as set forth in the national strategy because of its current lag behind the leading technological powers, as well as some other factors, such as a small venture capital investment market. The successful development of specific areas of AI is more likely, and Russia may be capable of becoming a local leader in those fields.
On the international arena, Russia opposes banning lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) and the military use of AI, but it does engage in dialogue with other states and actors and supports formulating clear universal rules and ethical norms.
Russia’s Priorities
The national strategy stresses two defining time markers for the development of AI in Russia: 2024, by which time Russia is expected to have significantly improved its positions in this field, and 2030, when it should have eliminated its lag behind developed countries and attained global leadership roles in certain AI-related areas. According to the document, Russia’s key AI development priorities include increasing the number of entities involved in technological innovation by 50 percent, and creating а high-performance export-oriented sector equipped with modern technologies in key industries, primarily in manufacturing and agriculture.
The strategy focuses heavily on support for both state and privately sponsored scientific research. Citations of Russian scientific publications in the field of AI, as well as the number of patents and applied technological solutions registered and developed by Russian scientists, are expected to increase significantly by 2024. The government is also working to overhaul existing legal norms to simplify the development and implementation of AI-based technologies (for instance, driverless transportation). The document stresses the need for Russia’s international cooperation on issues of AI-based product standardization and certification.
Another of the strategy’s focus areas is the importance of preparing AI specialists. Apart from recruiting foreign specialists, the document proposes introducing AI-related educational modules at all educational levels, as well as creating respective job development and professional retraining programs. Special emphasis is placed on math and science education and its integration with humanities. According to the strategy, the number of Russian AI specialists is to grow significantly by 2024, and Russian universities are to acquire world-class educational programs that will make it possible to make up for personnel shortages.
The Russian strategy also emphasizes domestic AI-based software development, the creation of AI open-source libraries, better data access and quality, and improved hardware for AI projects.
As for military objectives, the document identifies them purely in terms of “guaranteeing national security.” But the overall strategy clearly favors commercial AI use.
Current Assessments
Unlike China and the United States, Russia isn’t a global leader in AI technologies. Although the strategy states that “the Russian Federation possesses significant potential to become one of the international leaders in the development and use of artificial intelligence technologies,” it’s unlikely the country will be able to achieve this goal in the short and medium term. Nevertheless, certain areas of AI development and application do exist; Russia enjoys strong positions there and can succeed in the future. Russia’s ranking in the AI technology race is hard to establish, since current international ratings use different methodologies. Many of them don’t list Russia at all, which is unsurprising, since the country lacked an official AI development strategy until November 2019.
In terms of individual AI-related technology indicators, Russia has only three supercomputers ranked among the 500 most powerful computers in the world, for example, while China has 228, the United States has 117, and Japan has 29. 
At the same time, Russia is doing quite well in terms of computer science education, which includes machine learning. Sixteen Russian universities that offer this major made it onto the list of the world’s 684 best educational institutions, according to the 2019 World University Rankings. However, only two Russian universities—Moscow State University and St. Petersburg’s ITMO (Information Technologies, Mechanics, and Optics)—were in the top one hundred.
The number of AI start-ups in a given country is also a key indicator of its progress in this field. According to TRAXCN statistics, Russia currently has 168 AI start-ups, compared with 6,903 in the United States and 1,013 in China. These estimates appear to be somewhat exaggerated, since the list includes twenty- and thirty-year-old “start-ups,” but still, they make it possible to assess the bigger picture of the state of venture capital investment markets with respect to AI. In part, the small number of Russian AI start-ups can be explained by the domination of established companies in this sphere. This is what distinguishes Russia from most other developed technological powers. According to Russia’s proposed Artificial Intelligence road map, the country has a total of 400 companies working on developing AI. 
Military Applications
International ratings obviously don’t include military programs, yet military science and the defense industry have been locomotives for the development of Russian technology for many years. It’s difficult to assess the extent to which AI is used in the military sector due to the classified nature of such projects. Nevertheless, public pronouncements by Russian government officials make it possible to draw certain conclusions. Defense Ministry representatives and other government officials have said repeatedly that the Russian Armed Forces boast a full lineup of AI-based weapons, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, fighter jets, and underwater robots.
In his address to the Federal Assembly on March 1, 2018, Putin stated that Russia had developed an unmanned deep-sea vehicle that is capable of global-range travel and can carry nuclear weapons. These autonomous vehicles, dubbed Poseidon, are slated to join the Russian naval arsenal by 2027.
That same month, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu urged military personnel and civilian scientists to combine their efforts in working on AI technologies “whose development is necessary to parry possible threats to Russia’s technological and economic security.” Shoigu was speaking at the first “Artificial Intelligence: Problems and Prospective Solutions” conference held at the Defense Ministry. It’s difficult to estimate Russian investments in the military applications of AI, but it is possible to list some structures affiliated with the Defense Ministry that are working on these issues.
The state-owned Rostec corporation has acknowledged that a number of its subsidiaries—the Kalashnikov and Tecmash concerns, High Precision Systems holding, and TsNIITochMash company—were working on developing AI-related weapons. Tecmash, for example, has been incorporating AI into the volley fire systems it produces for several years now. In a December 2019 speech at the Defense Ministry board meeting, Putin said: “Robotic systems and unmanned aerial vehicles are being rigorously introduced and used in combat training, which dramatically boosts the capabilities of armed units and subunits.”
New models of weapons and equipment are being actively tested in Syria. Back in 2016, the Russian Defense Ministry alluded to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor the ceasefire there. During the next few years, both serial UAV models such as Orlan-10 and Forpost and test models like the Orion medium-altitude long-endurance UAV—potentially capable of carrying weapons—took to Syria’s skies. Autonomous aerial vehicles are one of the most promising areas for the introduction of AI and its military use. The exact number of UAVs in the Russian army arsenal is unknown, but the head of the Russian General Staff’s office for UAV development, Major General Alexander Novikov, estimated it at more than 1,900 units in 2018, and their number has likely increased since that time. In August 2019, the Defense Ministry published a video of the maiden flight of the S-70 Okhotnik-B heavy combat UAV developed by the Sukhoi Design Bureau. The Okhotnik (whose name translates as “hunter”) is likely capable of carrying weapons and striking both air and land targets.
In April 2020, the Defense Ministry announced a closed tender worth up to 387,751,000 rubles ($5.3 million) to complete a scientific project titled “Research on creating an experimental model of neural network development, training, and implementation for the new generation of artificial intelligence military systems” (code name “Kashtan”). In addition, the Era military innovation technopolis is due to be completed in the southern city of Anapa in the fourth quarter of 2020. It will specialize in robotics, AI, information security, and supercomputers.
The military sector is, therefore, one of the strongest in terms of developing Russian AI technologies. Roger McDermott of the Jamestown Foundation believes that in terms of decisionmaking speed, the new AI-based Russian combat control information systems that were showcased during the Tsentr 2019 strategic exercise give the Russian military a strategic advantage over NATO armed forces. 
Support Instruments
According to the proposed AI road map prepared by Sberbank under a government contract, Russia is planning to spend 244 billion rubles on the development of AI through 2024. Sberbank itself is planning to invest almost half of that: 112 billion rubles, while another 91 billion rubles will come from the federal budget. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) also wants to take part in the venture.
There is also a proposal to create a new 120 billion ruble AI federal project as part of the Digital Economy national program (the road map was also completed under this program, albeit under the Digital Technologies project). The artificial intelligence project was also developed by Sberbank and is supposed to be overseen by the Economic Development Ministry. In other words, there is some confusion now over instruments of AI development in Russia. 
In November 2019, the RDIF reported that it had raised $2 billion in domestic and international investments in Russian companies that use AI. The RDIF will also undertake to bring these companies to international markets. According to some media publications, the fund will invest some of its money in creating an Artificial Intelligence Institute at Moscow State University. 
Such investment volumes are unique for Russian science. But how significant are they on a global scale? It is certainly far less than the leaders of the tech race spend on AI. China annually invests tens of billions of dollars in AI, including at a regional level. Beijing alone is planning to invest $2.1 billion in an AI industrial park, while Tianjin is considering the creation of a $16 billion AI development fund. In turn, the U.S. government allocated $4.9 billion for AI research in 2020. Venture investors have contributed even more, investing over $8 billion in AI start-ups in 2018 alone.
Nevertheless, the Russian road map budget is quite comparable to what other technologically advanced countries spend on AI development. The UK, for example, revealed plans in 2018 to invest 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in AI development, and Germany is to invest 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) through 2025. It is assumed that private investors will contribute similar amounts.
The Russian government and Russian technology giants are making significant efforts to bridge the gap between Russia and leading countries when it comes to AI development. In February 2020, Putin endorsed the idea of creating a network of supercomputers and second-tier computing centers in large cities throughout the country.
Russia has already managed to make significant progress in this area. At the end of 2018, the first energy-efficient petaflop Zhores supercomputer was launched at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech). It’s specifically designed to solve machine learning and data-driven modeling problems. In the near future, its capacity is expected to increase to 2–3 petaflop per second, putting it in the same league as the top 500 supercomputers in the world. A year later, Sberbank launched its Christofari supercomputer. Specially designed to work with AI algorithms, the Christofari has an effective performance of about 6.7 petaflops per second, making it the most powerful in Russia and the twenty-ninth most powerful in the world at the time of its launch.
Sberbank and RDIF also intend to invest significant funds in the development of Russian software. In addition, there are state plans to develop a grant system, introduce new educational programs in the field of AI, and include AI training courses in the school curriculum. As a result, the number of Russian publications at top-level AI conferences is expected to increase from 30 in 2018 to 500 in 2030, while the number of AI specialists trained by higher and continuing education programs is expected to grow from 650 to 6,000 over the same period.
Russian businesses are willing to put AI technology into practice, giving Russia a competitive advantage. Microsoft has named Russia the world leader in the active implementation of AI in business. According to its research, 30 percent of Russian companies actively implement AI: the highest number among all countries studied, compared with an average of 22.3 percent.
Russian companies are also actively involved in the development of AI technology. They are, for example, at the forefront of developing driverless vehicles. Although Russia’s position in the Autonomous Vehicles Readiness Index is still fairly weak (it was ranked 22 out of 25 in 2019), Russia has been actively developing this field with the help of a number of companies and organizations including the internet giant Yandex, KAMAZ truck maker, StarLine unmanned vehicle developer, the Central Scientific Research Automobile and Automotive Engines Institute (NAMI), and the Moscow Automobile and Road Construction University (MADI).
Driverless cars have been tested on the roads of Moscow and the Russian republic of Tatarstan since 2019, and in March 2020 the experiment was expanded to eleven more regions. A bill on the use of autonomous vehicles on public roads was introduced to the State Duma in late February 2020. In addition, in March of this year, the Non-Commercial Partnership for Development and Use of Navigation Technologies (NP GLONASS), which includes Yandex, Rostelecom, MTS, and other companies, sent letters to the foreign, transportation, and justice ministries requesting the suspension of certain provisions of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic that impede the introduction of driverless vehicles. The complete legalization of autonomous vehicles will be a major boost to the development of Russia’s driverless transportation industry.
Russian AI technologies have, therefore, been developing at an accelerated pace, largely due to the greater attention that the Russian government and major tech corporations now pay to this sector. Although state investments and grants can’t adequately replace venture investments, Russia does have an opportunity to significantly improve its positions in the AI race.
International Cooperation 
Russia believes it would be premature to discuss limitations on the military use of AI at an international level, citing the lack of commonly accepted terminology and the absence of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) as reasons for its position. In part, this is because Russia views itself as one of the leaders in developing AI and robotics. Many countries that have embarked on successful LAWS projects—the United States, Israel, the UK, and others—hold similar positions.
Today, the main forum regulating AI is the UN. Since 2017, a specially created group of government experts (GGE) has been discussing LAWS issues in the context of the Inhumane Weapons Convention. In the past, similar discussion formats have led to the banning of cluster bombs, napalm, blinding laser weapons, and anti-personnel mines. Russia is represented in the GGE by officials from the foreign, defense, and economic development ministries.
Thirty countries currently insist on restrictions on the development and use of LAWS. Russia’s official position is that “work on definition and basic functions should mainly be guided by the ultimate goal of LAWS discussion—i.e., explore possibilities to use this weapon type in a most adequate manner in future and maintain a due level of human control over it. At the same time, specific forms and methods of such control should remain at the discretion of states.” Russian officials underscore that the work of the GGE should not “upset the balance between humanitarian concerns and the interests of defense security of the participating states.” 
Another international platform for discussing AI problematics is UNESCO, which has had an ad hoc expert group working since March 2020 on formulating global standards and recommendations on AI ethics. Russia is represented in the group by Professor Maxim Fedorov, director of the Center for Computational and Data-Intensive Science and Engineering at Skoltech. The group plans to meet through August 2020, by which time it is expected to have come up with internationally applicable recommendations on formulating ethical principles for AI development and use.
The Committee on AI under the Commission of the Russian Federation for UNESCO is called upon to consolidate the Russian position on this issue. That committee is chaired by Alexander Kuleshov, the head of Skoltech and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Its first session featured a discussion on differences in global understanding of AI ethics, at which Fedorov said: “We need to move from polarity to international cooperation.”
On the whole, Russia seems to be supportive of developing international cooperation in the field of AI and formulating universal and legal norms in this sphere. As for Russia’s position on the possible LAWS ban, it proceeds from efforts to lobby the interests of the domestic defense industry, and is in line with the behavior of most countries that produce unmanned vehicles.
As of today, Russia cannot be described as a leader in the AI race. Even if AI development becomes Russia’s highest priority, Moscow essentially has no chance of catching up with Washington and Beijing in this field. Nevertheless, smart investing and capitalizing on the country’s competitive advantages, such as highly skilled computer specialists and large domestic IT companies, could deliver results in the medium and long term. Russian positions have been traditionally strong in the military sector, but the successful development of other AI-related sectors is also possible. Under favorable conditions, Russia is quite capable of becoming a serious player and even a local leader in certain areas.

The problems that we are solving today touch critical aspects of our customer’s life, helping how they manage their finances and plan for the future. For instance, our algorithms help identify recurring expenses and can estimate income to help our customers optimally plan their budget and maximize their savings.
  In your 10 years working in AI and data science, what has surprised you about the evolution of these fields?
 I’ve been surprised by the speed of innovation and adoption. In the past decade, AI has been applied to a wide variety of industries and now touches almost everyone’s life through chatbots, voice-based devices, smartphones, cameras, just to name a few examples. There are huge opportunities to innovate with AI and algorithmic engineering to help our digital banking customers even more in the future.
  In your view, what is the next frontier for AI and data science overall, and specifically within financial services and personal financial management?
 AI has the potential to unlock innovation, increase efficiency, accelerate digital transformation and improve the customer experience. While the technology is mature enough and has made a huge impact already, I believe the ongoing R&D in areas such as Explainable AI, Responsible AI and AI model productionizing will unlock numerous layers of adoption especially in regulated industries like financial services.
 Responsible AI focuses on ensuring the ethical and accountable use of AI and helps form new regulations and monitoring that is consistent with the values and expectations of the modern world, with fair consideration towards speed of innovation and positive impact. On the other hand, the research on Explainable AI aims to make the AI models more transparent, making it more clear on how the model came up with a certain outcome. This can help firms adhere to the regulatory guidelines. Lastly, reliable productionizing of AI models makes it easier to maintain the lifecycle of model deployment. In combination, these areas will be the next frontiers for AI.

The idea that the photos we share are being collected by companies to train algorithms that are sold commercially is worrying. Anyone can buy these tools, snap a photo of a stranger, and find out who they are in seconds. But researchers have come up with a clever way to help combat this problem.The solution is a tool named Fawkes, and was created by scientists at the University of Chicago’s Sand Lab. Named after the Guy Fawkes masks donned by revolutionaries in the V for Vendetta comic book and film, Fawkes uses artificial intelligence to subtly and almost imperceptibly alter your photos in order to trick facial recognition systems.running Fawkes on your photos is like adding an invisible mask to your selfiesThe way the software works is a little complex. Running your photos through Fawkes doesn’t make you invisible to facial recognition exactly. Instead, the software makes subtle changes to your photos so that any algorithm scanning those images in future sees you as a different person altogether. Essentially, running Fawkes on your photos is like adding an invisible mask to your selfies.Scientists call this process “cloaking” and it’s intended to corrupt the resource facial recognition systems need to function: databases of faces scraped from social media. Facial recognition firm Clearview AI, for example, claims to have collected some three billion images of faces from sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Venmo, which it uses to identify strangers. But if the photos you share online have been run through Fawkes, say the researchers, then the face the algorithms know won’t actually be your own.According to the team from the University of Chicago, Fawkes is 100 percent successful against state-of-the-art facial recognition services from Microsoft (Azure Face), Amazon (Rekognition), and Face++ by Chinese tech giant Megvii.“What we are doing is using the cloaked photo in essence like a Trojan Horse, to corrupt unauthorized models to learn the wrong thing about what makes you look like you and not someone else,” Ben Zhao, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago who helped create the Fawkes software, told The Verge. “Once the corruption happens, you are continuously protected no matter where you go or are seen.”You’d hardly recognize her.

Image: The VergeThe group behind the work — Shawn Shan, Emily Wenger, Jiayun Zhang, Huiying Li, Haitao Zheng, and Ben Y. Zhao — published a paper on the algorithm earlier this year. But late last month they also released Fawkes as free software for Windows and Macs that anyone can download and use. To date they say it’s been downloaded more than 100,000 times.In our own tests we found that Fawkes is sparse in its design but easy enough to apply. It takes a couple of minutes to process each image, and the changes it makes are mostly imperceptible. Earlier this week, The New York Times published a story on Fawkes in which it noted that the cloaking effect was quite obvious, often making gendered changes to images like giving women mustaches. But the Fawkes team says the updated algorithm is much more subtle, and The Verge’s own tests agree with this.How much difference can a tool like Fawkes make?But is Fawkes a silver bullet for privacy? It’s doubtful. For a start, there’s the problem of adoption. If you read this article and decide to use Fawkes to cloak any photos you upload to social media in future, you’ll certainly be in the minority. Facial recognition is worrying because it’s a society-wide trend and so the solution needs to be society-wide, too. If only the tech-savvy shield their selfies, it just creates inequality and discrimination.Secondly, many firms that sell facial recognition algorithms created their databases of faces a long time ago, and you can’t retroactively take that information back. The CEO of Clearview, Hoan Ton-That, told the Times as much. “There are billions of unmodified photos on the internet, all on different domain names,” said Ton-That. “In practice, it’s almost certainly too late to perfect a technology like Fawkes and deploy it at scale.”Comparisons of uncloaked and cloaked faces using Fawkes. Image: SAND Lab, University of ChicagoNaturally, though, the team behind Fawkes disagree with this assessment. They note that although companies like Clearview claim to have billions of photos, that doesn’t mean much when you consider they’re supposed to identify hundreds of millions of users. “Chances are, for many people, Clearview only has a very small number of publicly accessible photos,” says Zhao. And if people release more cloaked photos in the future, he says, sooner or later the amount of cloaked images will outnumber the uncloaked ones.On the adoption front, however, the Fawkes team admits that for their software to make a real difference it has to be released more widely. They have no plans to make a web or mobile app due to security concerns, but are hopeful that companies like Facebook might integrate similar tech into their own platform in future. Integrating this tech would be in these companies’ interest, says Zhao. After all, firms like Facebook don’t want people to stop sharing photos, and these companies would still be able to collect the data they need from images (for features like photo tagging) before cloaking them on the public web. And while integrating this tech now might only have a small effect for current users, it could help convince future, privacy-conscious generations to sign up to these platforms. “Adoption by larger platforms, e.g. Facebook or others, could in time have a crippling effect on Clearview by basically making [their technology] so ineffective that it will no longer be useful or financially viable as a service,” says Zhao. “Clearview.ai going out of business because it’s no longer relevant or accurate is something that we would be satisfied [with] as an outcome of our work.”Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeTesla’s big, epic, confusing future | The Vergecast

Callaway used machine learning throughout the Mavrik line to introduce new design elements, some of which surprised even the veteran members of its 120-person R&amp;D team.\n\nCallaway’s AI efforts began with its Flash drivers, which relied on AI to determine the shape of its face. Driver faces typically employ a familiar shape which is thicker in the center and thins out around the edges. “The face thickness pattern that it first came out with looked nothing like what we designed,” says Alan Hocknell, Callaway’s senior vice president of research and development. “One of the thinnest areas was in the center. It had a pattern of ripples and ridges. It had thick areas directly adjacent to thin areas. It had things we really didn’t understand, but we could prove that it generated more ball speed.”\n\nComputers typically help club makers simulate thousands of ball strikes to analyze the consistency of its performance. Callaway, however, fed parameters into the AI and let it work to solve problems on its own. \n\nBy relying on AI simulations, the company can more effectively refine the groups of players it’s trying to help by adjusting the performance targets. That’s especially difficult to do with beginners. “The challenges of designing for the lower-ability golfers is that you have a higher degree of noise,” says Hocknell. “Shot-to-shot variation is a lot higher than with tour pros. The computer can help analyze that. It helps us capture what the challenges are that we need to address.”\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Flash Face on the Mavrik driver has a different shape than typical clubs.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAccording to Hocknell, the development process for a new set of clubs typically ranges between 12 and 16 months, which only provides enough time to create three or four prototypes. Once a club exists in the physical world outside of the simulation, the company uses a swing robot to evaluate its performance, but it also puts the club in the hands of real people. The AI can help analyze shots—even if there’s a lot of variation due to varying skill levels—and help guide the development in the right direction.\n\nCreating the clubs that AI designs isn’t always simple, however. Callaway says it has had to make some notable upgrades to its manufacturing process in order to bring the clubs off the screen and into the clubhouse. In order to manufacture the driver faces, for instance, it needed to revamp its forge. “We needed a new titanium alloy—one that we could fabricate this unusual thickness pattern,” says Hocknell. “There were only a couple machines in the world that could do that with the thin titanium grade we were using. We had to change the crystal structure in the titanium in such a way that it would be durable under the loads it was going to see.”\n\nThe measuring equipment needed a similar boost. “We developed a laser scanning system that puts millions of points of laser light onto the back of the face in order to measure in way greater detail than with a touch probe,” says Hocknell. “We went with a couple dozen points to millions.” Of course, the designs aren’t valuable if they can’t make it out onto the course.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHybrid clubs have replaced longer irons for some players, especially those who have trouble getting the ball in the air.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn order to handle all of the calculations, Callaway built its own supercomputer with around 1,000 cores on its campus. With the amount of operations they’re doing, Hocknell says it was more financially feasible than leasing time on a cloud-based system. “Things that used to take four to five weeks now take a couple days,” he says.\n\nAs time goes on, the size of Callaway’s data set about golf shots will only grow. It currently goes back 20 years and constantly pulls data from networked machines at Callaway fitting centers around the world. Eventually, AI can play a role in the actual fitting process. Right now, Callaway collects data about those shots for its own research, but down the road, a player could step into a fitting session and get real-time analysis of their game to help guide them toward the right clubs.\n\nCurrently, Callaway offers three different flavors of its AI-designed Mavrik clubs, including the standard version for average players, the Sub-Zero version for high-level and pro-grade players, and the Max edition, which places the emphasis on forgiving mishits over pure ball control and feel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe center of gravity has moved toward the face of the driver.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWhile that’s quite a few clubs to keep track of, Callaway says that each one has its own unique design. “Before, you’d typically pick an iron in the middle of the set and then use a spreadsheet to set the parameters for the rest of the clubs,” he explains. “That seems a little crude today.” Now, AI has refined the process to emphasize desirable traits for their specific use. Longer irons emphasize ball speed and trajectory to give more distance. Shorter irons aim to make launch trajectories and ball spin more consistent for hitting—and staying on—the green.\n\nCallaway will continue to feed data into its algorithm in hopes to figure out how it can further refine its clubs.

This is the first time Callaway has used AI to design a full range of clubs including irons. Callaway 






Artificial intelligence may regularly beat humans at games like chess and checkers, but it’s currently helping us out when it comes to golf. Callaway used machine learning throughout the Mavrik line to introduce new design elements, some of which surprised even the veteran members of its 120-person R&D team.
Callaway’s AI efforts began with its Flash drivers, which relied on AI to determine the shape of its face. Driver faces typically employ a familiar shape which is thicker in the center and thins out around the edges. “The face thickness pattern that it first came out with looked nothing like what we designed,” says Alan Hocknell, Callaway’s senior vice president of research and development. “One of the thinnest areas was in the center. It had a pattern of ripples and ridges. It had thick areas directly adjacent to thin areas. It had things we really didn’t understand, but we could prove that it generated more ball speed.”
Computers typically help club makers simulate thousands of ball strikes to analyze the consistency of its performance. Callaway, however, fed parameters into the AI and let it work to solve problems on its own. 
By relying on AI simulations, the company can more effectively refine the groups of players it’s trying to help by adjusting the performance targets. That’s especially difficult to do with beginners. “The challenges of designing for the lower-ability golfers is that you have a higher degree of noise,” says Hocknell. “Shot-to-shot variation is a lot higher than with tour pros. The computer can help analyze that. It helps us capture what the challenges are that we need to address.”

The Flash Face on the Mavrik driver has a different shape than typical clubs. Callaway 

According to Hocknell, the development process for a new set of clubs typically ranges between 12 and 16 months, which only provides enough time to create three or four prototypes. Once a club exists in the physical world outside of the simulation, the company uses a swing robot to evaluate its performance, but it also puts the club in the hands of real people. The AI can help analyze shots—even if there’s a lot of variation due to varying skill levels—and help guide the development in the right direction.
Creating the clubs that AI designs isn’t always simple, however. Callaway says it has had to make some notable upgrades to its manufacturing process in order to bring the clubs off the screen and into the clubhouse. In order to manufacture the driver faces, for instance, it needed to revamp its forge. “We needed a new titanium alloy—one that we could fabricate this unusual thickness pattern,” says Hocknell. “There were only a couple machines in the world that could do that with the thin titanium grade we were using. We had to change the crystal structure in the titanium in such a way that it would be durable under the loads it was going to see.”
The measuring equipment needed a similar boost. “We developed a laser scanning system that puts millions of points of laser light onto the back of the face in order to measure in way greater detail than with a touch probe,” says Hocknell. “We went with a couple dozen points to millions.” Of course, the designs aren’t valuable if they can’t make it out onto the course.

Hybrid clubs have replaced longer irons for some players, especially those who have trouble getting the ball in the air. Callaway 

In order to handle all of the calculations, Callaway built its own supercomputer with around 1,000 cores on its campus. With the amount of operations they’re doing, Hocknell says it was more financially feasible than leasing time on a cloud-based system. “Things that used to take four to five weeks now take a couple days,” he says.
As time goes on, the size of Callaway’s data set about golf shots will only grow. It currently goes back 20 years and constantly pulls data from networked machines at Callaway fitting centers around the world. Eventually, AI can play a role in the actual fitting process. Right now, Callaway collects data about those shots for its own research, but down the road, a player could step into a fitting session and get real-time analysis of their game to help guide them toward the right clubs.
Currently, Callaway offers three different flavors of its AI-designed Mavrik clubs, including the standard version for average players, the Sub-Zero version for high-level and pro-grade players, and the Max edition, which places the emphasis on forgiving mishits over pure ball control and feel.

The center of gravity has moved toward the face of the driver. Callaway 

While that’s quite a few clubs to keep track of, Callaway says that each one has its own unique design. “Before, you’d typically pick an iron in the middle of the set and then use a spreadsheet to set the parameters for the rest of the clubs,” he explains. “That seems a little crude today.” Now, AI has refined the process to emphasize desirable traits for their specific use. Longer irons emphasize ball speed and trajectory to give more distance. Shorter irons aim to make launch trajectories and ball spin more consistent for hitting—and staying on—the green.
Callaway will continue to feed data into its algorithm in hopes to figure out how it can further refine its clubs. Hocknell expects more surprises along the way.

Does Artificial Intelligence Go Against Islamic Teachings?



FacebookTwitterPinterestGoogle



The development of Artificial Intelligence is centred on the idea that we as humans can create devices and technologies that are capable of seeing, hearing and behaving like humans. The idea of the soul is fundamental to our beliefs as Muslims. But this field of work does not recognise the soul as an important differentiator as to what makes a human, human. So does AI go against Islamic beliefs? 
It is now quite ordinary to speak to inanimate objects and more often than not, to expect an intelligible answer or some task to be carried out, like respond to a search query, schedule an appointment or make a phone call. How is this possible? 
What is Artificial Intelligence? 
Have you ever wondered what is happening behind the screen or within the plastic boxes with flashing lights? 
And is there anything for Muslims to think about in relation to this new world of seemingly speaking, seeing, acting and thinking things?
All of this has become possible through advances in artificial intelligence, and in the above cases, through advances in language processing. 
Being able to understand and produce human speech is just one of dozens of areas that have advanced rapidly in less than half a decade due to advances in artificial intelligence (AI). 
The development of AI is the quest to design intelligent computer systems – systems that would be capable of the sophisticated array of behaviours and mental capacities that are associated with human intelligence such as learning, understanding language, reasoning, creativity and thought itself.
One of the major events that initiated this resurgence of interest in AI was when an AI system, named AlphaGo, developed by Google subsidiary DeepMind, defeated a leading human player in the board game Go, which is a game known to require high levels of intuitive thought and creativity.

Since then, there has been a huge amount of interest in AI from academics, technologists, investors, governments and policy makers, accompanied by billions of pounds in research funding and widespread public debates on the social, political and ethical implications of AI as its usage grows. 
The ultimate aim of AI research is to create intelligence comparable to, or exceeding, our own, which is known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).
The development of AI and AGI is firmly connected with one of the biggest mysteries in philosophy and science, which is understanding the basis of our intelligence and consciousness and uncovering their origins. 
Science and technology now lead the way in exploring ideas about human nature and human intelligence. 
Does AI Go Against Islamic Teachings? 
For Muslims, and most religious traditions, consciousness, intelligence and human nature are linked to the existence of the soul. 
However, a scientific approach to these questions does not allow for belief in anything immaterial, like the soul. 
AI should therefore be of interest to Muslims as key Islamic teachings are challenged by new scientific ideas emerging from AI research, and these scientific ideas gain credibility amongst people who don’t understand how the technology works and its limitations. 
Like ancient people seeing pharaoh’s magician conjure up false serpents, every new and seemingly magical technology gradually deceives modern people into believing scientists have gained, or will soon gain, the power to create living, animate beings.
What Does the Quran Tell Us About Intelligence and Our Souls? 
One of the key teachings, which we learn directly from the Qur’an, is that we have a unique form of intelligence, knowledge and understanding that differentiates us from animals, angels and jinns. 
The Qur’an tells us that when God created Prophet Adam, عَلَيْهِ ٱلسَّلَامُ, and brought him to life by placing a soul in his body, God instructed the angels and Iblis (the devil) to bow to him after he demonstrated his unique form of knowledge. 
As AI is infused with new devices and technologies, and hence into more aspects of our life, we are encountering new entities that seem to be capable of hearing, seeing, speaking, willing, knowing and intelligent, yet these new entities are not living and certainly don’t have anything like souls. 
What is The Impact of AI on Islam?
The hidden impact of AI is that it makes us believe we are nothing more than soulless machines even with all of our thinking, seeing, speaking and acting.
Muslims should ask how this complicates key stories in the Qur’an that are taught to children, such as when Prophet Ibrahim, عَلَيْهِ ٱلسَّلَامُ, asked his people what they worship. 
When his people replied that they worship idols and “remain constantly in attendance on them,” Ibrahim ,عَلَيْهِ ٱلسَّلَامُ , challenged them by asking, “Do they listen to you when ye call (on them)? Or do you good or harm?”.
Today, people remain constantly in attendance of their smart devices, which do seem to listen when called, and AI algorithms can push people in positive or negative directions. 
In sum, Muslims need to think more carefully about how they use new AI-powered devices in daily life and how they might complicate Islamic teachings in the minds of future generations.

There's a call to rethink Artificial Intelligence as Augmented Intelligence, to stress the capability of people working with AI instead of being replaced by AI..In present times, AI specialists, data scientists, designers, and engineers explore how we can function close by machines, when we should enable machines to make psychological decisions, and how all of society can gain from the productive and monetary benefits guaranteed by innovation in AI..Augmented Intelligence is a technological approach dependent on big data that joins techniques of machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics intending to produce relevant data for targeted choices. It is a development of artificial intelligence that includes human association in a procedure of constant inclusion, focused on improving the results obtained..Humans provide a variety of instances, the machine learns a model and reports results to people who assess the nature of the model itself and decide how to reintroduce these outcomes into the model. This innovation is dependent on Artificial Intelligence strategies in which human activity is fundamental and involved in a consistent cycle..According to Gartner, by 2021 artificial augmentation will reach up to US $2.9 trillion of business value and 6.2 billion hours of worker productivity worldwide..Augmented intelligence carries artificial intelligence into the work environment, permitting enterprises to gain new bits of knowledge, support group performance, and keep a stride ahead in front of the competition. One of the greatest misunderstandings about augmented intelligence is that it forfeits the human experience to drive efficiencies..In reality, augmented intelligence is intended to work close by individuals to release the combined power of innovation with human intelligence and emotions. Augmented intelligence and its capacity to help human workers is one of the most persuasive powers molding the future of work, empowering adopters to harness the best gifts of humans and machines, engaging both to perform the tasks that they're naturally most suitable for..Augmented intelligence can assist organizations with revealing new insights, find new opportunities, make new products and services, and define better approaches for working. By understanding their sharpness and flexibility to venture into new areas, they're finding new markets and clients for their services. Effectively installing and integrating Augmented intelligence into the workforce provides benefits for all partners, including employees, managers, and clients..With the assistance of augmented intelligence, information can be shared, stored, looked, and sorted out to dispose of redundancies across offices, at last uniting your enterprise under shared objectives to drive business development. At the point when the precise data is delivered at the correct time, the management turns out to be increasingly informed, progressively secure, and increasingly sure about their capacity to make strategic choices without the fear of passing up details that might be covered deep inside a report, or covered up in the fine print. At the point when your organization faces immense competition in your industry, it's simpler to face the determined challenges if you have to remain in front of the competition. Augmented Intelligence can wipe out repetitive tasks, helping teams to concentrate on complex research issues..Noteworthy changes might be incorporated by the preferences AI can bring, yet execution despite everything falls on the shoulders of your business knowledge group. Augmented intelligence eases the monotonous tedious work; however a human touch finishes the circle — changing raw data into substantial plans and forms, and progressive advancement..At the point when people join forces with machines, it opens up additional opportunities for associations to concentrate additional time on important tasks, such as building the brand or upgrading client experience. It's these sophisticated human activities, controlled by AI, that transform developing pioneers of the industry into genuine industry trailblazers..In truth, augmented intelligence and artificial intelligence are a piece of an inventive change that holds the possibility to transform the modern culture. Also, this leaves space for huge long haul development. Indeed, even as the current influxes of cognitive advancements dislodge a wide scope of occupations, it remains the case that augmented intelligence will be integral to numerous sorts of innovative work..From the innovative and scientific perspective, what's important is to raise the augmented intelligence and artificial intelligence from the degree of consideration and deliver it to the end client, making it simple for applications in regular day to day existence..In the coming decades, these innovations will turn out to be increasingly significant and will change regular daily existence. From banking and administrations to transport, to security and human relations for wellbeing and personal satisfaction..All services for the individual, even those with a more noteworthy cognitive contribution, will be automated. Augmented intelligence by 2050 won't supplant human activities but will be the cognitive component nearby the man who will accompany him to have a superior quality of work and life..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

        The   Tory Burch Foundation Summit  in early March was a gathering of some of the most prominent executives and entrepreneurs in the world.
    




        Bank of America COO   Thomas Montag  former AOL CEO   Steve Case  , and   Dina Powell McCormick  , partner and member of the Management Committee at Goldman Sachs, were a few of the execs who spoke about how   they sought to make their companies more inclusive. 





        A prominent theme throughout the conference was gender parity in the workplace.
    




        ""The word 'ambition' takes on a completely different meaning when applied to a woman than when applied to a man,Burch told Business Insider. ""Women are criticized for exhibiting the exact same quality men are praised for. This has to change. We do that by shining a light on unconscious gender bias, which was the focus of our Summit.""
    




  Yasmin Green,  director of research and development at Jigsaw, a unit of Google parent company Alphabet, spoke about one particularly complex hurdle in modern society: the difficulty of programming artificial intelligence without bias.
    




        The problem with training AI on humans, Green said, is that   humans are biased  , and when the data that feeds AI is biased, then the AI becomes biased itself.
    




         ""Are we content with algorithms that reflect back to us the way the world works?"" 
    




        Green detailed an experiment that demonstrated this unconscious bias in AI. She and her team created the same fake professional profile for a woman and a man and browsed online job sites as each of these imaginary people. In the end, they found that men were five times as likely to see ads for higher-paying jobs than women.
    




        This, she said, was because women believe they must fulfill 100% of the requirements before they apply to a job, whereas men believe they only need to meet at least 60% of the requirements before they apply to the job.
    




        ""So at the same skill level, we [women] are clicking on jobs that are less senior and less well paid,Green said. ""But if we click that way, then the internet is going to learn and that's what we're going to see.""

Conventional wisdom has it that physicians cannot work from home. In the field of healthcare, traditional leverage of AI has been on disease detection and prediction. AI engines have generally been efficient in predicting anomalies in CT scans to detect onset of a disease. Does it need to remain restricted to detection only? At specific scenario. Many of the Type1 diabetes patients now use a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) to get a near real time reading of their blood sugar levels to determine insulin dosage. These commercially available devices pull the data and load into a cloud based data set-up at a regular interval. Physicians look at the data during review and suggest adjustment to foods and dosage. A simple AI algorithm can take this further by recommending precise set of treatment recommendations for physicians to validate. Since routine visits are getting deferred, this simple intervention has the potential to increase both precision and accuracy of the treatment process for all conditions that require timely and routine physician visits.This opens up the possibility of AI being used as a recommendation tool as opposed to a detection only model. This single change has the ability to transform the entire business model of physical healthcare. From a facility to physically host healthcare professionals along with patients, hospitals and clinics may start operating as a digitally driven operations nerve center.AI based scheduling service may listen to the patients conditions through a chat bot or voice application. It can ask a series of questions, look at the clinical records of the patients in the system and get a basic hypothesis ready for diagnosis based on data.It can then schedule an appointment with the most competent physician available depending on the urgency. Before the appointment, the AI engine may prepare a complete briefing with potential diagnosis and recommended treatments. It can answer a set of follow on questions and allow the recommendations to be overridden. In case of a required diagnostic intervention, AI driven scheduler should be able to arrange for an agent to collect the samples and add them in the patient dossier. Post tele or video consultation, a personal yet non-intervening Voice AI service may do regular follow-throughs, a reminder on medication and other recommended treatment follow through along with any future treatment recommendation. AI engine can sharpen this recommendation by constantly looking through data stream coming from devices that monitor the patient, by consulting physicians. While this sounds futuristic, we have the technology components commercially available. With a strong and progressively cheaper data network, communication has just got easier. Cloud based storage and delivery of information has cut down the cost of computing infrastructure to a fraction. AI can process faster with advanced hardware gaining speed. Finally, a compulsive situation out of a pandemic has changed our mindset to believe things can be equally good if not better in a remote mode.Through an efficient sharing of this data with suppliers, typical gaps of demand and supply can be bridged as well. Most important component of making the system work, the need for healthcare professionals may be calibrated as well and with increasing load on healthcare system, a changing model of treatment aided by AI seems to be a good option for future.
