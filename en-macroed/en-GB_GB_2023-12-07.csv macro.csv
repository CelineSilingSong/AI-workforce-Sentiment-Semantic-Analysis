After a year defined by a fresh buzz around artificial intelligence, the question on my mind heading into 2024 is where we’ll start to see the long-term impact of AI. One obvious candidate is the job market.


Here’s how I think the evolving impact of AI will create trends, challenges, and opportunities in the professional world.

AI’s Influence on Recruitment
AI has already been a mainstay with recruiters for years. They use intelligent technology to identify ideal candidates and weed through mountains of applications. In 2024, candidates are turning the tide when it comes to AI in recruitment.

PROMOTED
This is largely because many tools are becoming more accessible to the average job seeker. Teal, for example, offers those searching for employment a suite of AI-powered tools, including a resume builder, cover letter generator, LinkedIn profile analysis, and job application tracker.

As the job market evolves, both employers and the employed will implement a growing number of AI solutions to give themselves a cutting-edge advantage. It is a trend that is set to grow in the coming months.

AI Will Alter Existing Roles
AI is often seen as a job killer, but it is more accurate to refer to it as a job redefiner. In most cases, AI doesn’t remove the need for important work. On the contrary, even as it develops greater capabilities, it still addresses the simple stuff compared to its human counterparts.

According to a recent LinkedIn article, “Repetitive tasks, by their very nature, consume a significant chunk of time and resources. They often require human intervention, prone to errors, fatigue, and inconsistency. Enter AI: a technology capable of performing these tasks tirelessly, consistently, and without the typical human-induced variations.”

This creates new opportunities for employees to focus on meaningful, high-value activities. The result is jobs with more specific, nuanced requirements. At the same time, these positions won’t be bogged down with simple, time-consuming minutiae.
AI Will Naturally Create New Opportunities
The existence and rapid adoption of AI will naturally create a demand for jobs in that field. As companies seek ways to capitalize on the efficiencies and profitability of AI systems, they will need humans to lead the charge.
This pioneering phase will require software engineers, data scientists, and other specialized personnel. It will open up new skills that employees can learn to give themselves a competitive edge.
AI Will Have Negative Repercussions on Jobs, Too
Of course, it’s not all good news for those working alongside AI. One recent survey from ResumeBuilder reported that 44% of companies expect layoffs to occur in 2024 due to new AI capabilities.
With that said, it’s worth pointing out that this appears to be largely connected to the culling of simpler activities within daily business pursuits. Of the respondents, 83% clarified that, as far as existing employees are concerned, AI skills will be a factor in helping them retain their jobs.
For those willing to embrace AI, the future is bright. For those working jobs AI can quickly replace, they must begin developing new skills.
The Shift to AI Isn’t Going to Be Instant
It’s tempting to look ahead and ring the alarm on AI. There’s no doubt that change is coming, and some hard-working employees will lose their jobs before long.
However, the thought that we’re looking at an apocalyptic future in the coming months is alarmist. Pew Research reports that the transition to AI will likely take half a century or more.
In addition, as much of the above data shows, most of the change will be either a horizontal shift or an improvement. Will some jobs be automated? Yes. Will others evolve with the times? Absolutely. Still others will grow out of the need for AI, as well. The one surety heading in 2024 is that AI will be a major factor in the workforce, and human workers and employers must be ready to adapt on a daily basis.

What’s more, the pace of change is startling, with more than 90% of surveyed employers predicting that they will use AI-related solutions in their organizations by 2028.To better understand where workplaces might be headed, Access Partnership and Amazon Web Services (AWS) collaborated on a new survey of 3,297 employees and 1,340 organizations in the U.S., across industries.Here are five takeaways from the report.1. Most organizations will use AI and expect to benefit from itAlmost all organizations in the U.S. will be AI-enabled. According to the report, 92% of the organizations surveyed plan to use AI-powered solutions by 2028.While most employers (92%) believe their IT departments will be the biggest beneficiary of AI, they also believe other departments, from sales and marketing (85%) to human resources (78%), will derive significant value from it as well.Most see AI offering significant benefits for their organizations by automating employees’ tasks (64%), highlighting this as a key benefit; improving workflows and outcomes (58%); enhancing communications (54%); and helping their employees learn new skills (50%).2. Generative AI tools will become commonplace at workGenerative AI—a type of AI that can create new content and ideas quickly, including conversations, stories, images, videos, music, and more—has captured mainstream attention in the past year.Considering this momentum, it is not surprising that more than 93% of employers and 86% of employees expect to use generative AI within the next five years to increase innovation and creativity, automate repetitive tasks, and boost learning.3. Acquiring AI skills could boost paychecks and accelerate career growthAmazon aims to provide free AI skills training to 2 million people by 2025 with its new ‘AI Ready’ commitmentAmazon’s AI Ready initiative comes as new AWS study finds strong demand for AI talent and the potential for workers with AI skills to earn up to 47% more in salaries.Read moreWith substantial potential to improve operational efficiency, worker productivity, and decision-making, surveyed employers are willing to pay higher wages to employees with AI skills and expertise. Notably, while employers are willing to pay an average of 47% more for IT workers with AI skills, the study found that pay benefits will extend across departments. Employers said that they would be willing to pay workers with AI skills a premium in sales and marketing (43% higher salary); finance (42%); business operations (41%); legal, regulatory, and compliance (37%); and human resources (35%).Overall, nearly 80% of workers surveyed mentioned that they would be interested in developing AI skills to advance their careers. The study also found that this interest in AI transcends generations. For example, about two-thirds of workers over the age of 55, a demographic usually thinking about retirement, say they would enroll in AI upskilling courses if employers offered them.4. AI’s productivity payoff could be profoundAmong workers, 88% expect to use AI in their daily work by 2028. By hastening ideas and creativity, automating repetitive tasks, and enabling better decisions, surveyed employers believe AI could boost overall productivity by as much as 49%.These findings are remarkable when one considers average nonfarm labor productivity growth in the United States has averaged 1.3% per year since 2019.5. Employers report an AI skills gapUnderstanding the potential benefits of AI, 73% of surveyed employers consider hiring talent with AI skills and experience a priority. But, nearly three in four (75%) of them say that they can’t find the talent they need.7 free and low-cost AWS courses that can help you use generative AIAWS skills trainings on generative AI offerings are available to everyone, with all levels of experience.Learn moreThe survey also reveals employers are not solely focused on workers with technical skills such as coding. In fact, critical and creative thinking are even more in demand by employers.In short, the survey confirms that employers face a growing AI skills gap that can only be addressed through training and education programs. Unfortunately, the report also shows that 82% of employers and employees aren’t sure which specific skills they should pursue, and nearly 80% don’t know what outside training might exist for them.Looking ahead, it’s clear that employers and employees are expecting AI tools to deliver tremendous benefits in the workplace on a daily basis. But because it’s still early, most agree that considerable preparation and training will be needed to make the most of this evolving technology. Only time will tell how that shakes out for the future of work.Sign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter Thank you for signing up. emailSign UpProtected by reCAPTCHA.

 20-year-old Sandra Ubege is in her final year of studying Media Studies at the University of Huddersfield. Like most soon-to-be graduates, she’s worried about securing her first job after university. But for Sandra’s cohort and the cohorts which come after, these anxieties about securing work are becoming exacerbated by the growing power of AI.
Sandra is a creative, and is particularly keen to get into screenwriting and film directing. “This year we’ve seen how easy it is for studios to implement AI in production and push out humans that put in the effort,” she says. “My understanding is that AI steals from human artists, and that’s how it learns, and as such studios will take advantage of the fact they don’t have to pay AI like they pay human artists.” She refers to the Hollywood strikers who walked out over issues regarding AI as a potent example of just how much of an impact new technology is having on the creative industries. “I’m too disconcerted by the growth of this technology to even look at the positives.”

 “One of my modules is about short film, and another is about journalistic writing; in both of these we’ve had a few lectures where we talk about AI and what it’s doing to the industry. Professors are basically saying that this is going to be a part of the arts industry now, and we have to embrace it. I really hated that,” Sandra continues. “I’m extremely worried about AI’s impact on my career prospects, because it can only get worse from here [...]  I’m trying to be optimistic but I just can’t.”
Sandra isn’t alone: a new study from Kingston University has found that half of current students at university think their job prospects could be under threat from AI. This chimes with BMG resarch for the i, which found that some 52 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds are worried about the impact of the technology on their future employment prospects, compared to 39 per cent of the general population. The situation across the pond is identical, where half of US college and university graduates also feel threatened by the growth of AI.
Since the launch of OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT in November last year, conversations surrounding artificial intelligence’s capabilities have grown increasingly urgent. Many have expressed concern over the possibility of AI supplanting workers from their jobs, leaving swathes of the population unemployed. And it’s unsurprising that students are particularly concerned about the impact AI could have on the graduate job market: competition for graduate jobs hit a record high in the UK in 2021 post-COVID, with companies receiving an average of 91 applications per graduate vacancy. While the graduate job market has since improved, the situation is still bleak: data from Reed, one of the UK’s largest employment platforms, shows the number of available graduate jobs is still about 40 per cent below 2018 levels, with wages remaining stagnant in the face of the rising cost of living. Graduates from 2020 onwards currently face an unemployment rate of 12 per cent, which equates to over 96,000 unemployed graduates each academic year.
 
“I would be so much less worried if the government did more for university students and graduates, especially those in the arts” – Sandra Ubege

 It’s been estimated that 10 to 30 per cent of jobs are automatable, and with all this in mind, it tracks that students are conscious of anything which may hinder their already dwindling prospects. Sandra’s degree is in Media Studies, but students studying other courses have cause for concern too. AI has many capabilities, including writing, creating art, coding, and translating – potentially threatening jobs which use these skills, such as copywriting, graphic design, software development, and translation to name a few. 
David Spencer is an economics professor at the University of Leeds and author of Making Light Work: An End to Toil in the 21st Century, and he explains that it is not surprising that so many students and graduates are concerned, given how frequently the media is reporting on mass job losses due to AI. But he stresses that all hope is not lost. “Whether there will be fewer jobs in the future remains a moot point. New jobs have been created in the past and there is no reason why they won’t be created in the future,” he says. “AI, like other technologies, may change the skills required by employers but graduates will likely retain advantages in the labour market.” He adds that this not only applies to STEM graduates, but arts graduates too, “who will have the creative skills to undertake tasks that AI won’t be able to replace”.
“I think the problem of graduates not getting graduate jobs reflects an economy that cannot produce enough graduate jobs,” he continues. “The UK economy is too focused around the promotion of low paid and low productivity work, which means it cannot absorb more graduates.” He adds that students would be less concerned about AI “if investment levels in the economy could be improved and the demand for graduate employment raised,” while a better welfare ‘safety net’ would “benefit all workers but more so non-graduates who face fewer prospects for moving on to better-paid work or worse, underemployment or unemployment”.
 
“I think the problem of graduates not getting graduate jobs reflects an economy that cannot produce enough graduate jobs” – David Spencer

 This chimes with Sandra. “Even after university, a lot of jobs ask for years of experience, and if we’re really busy studying we often don’t have time for that or there aren’t appropriate internship or placement opportunities there in the first place,” she says. “I would be so much less worried if the government did more for university students and graduates, especially those in the arts.”
Ultimately, it isn’t unequivocally a ‘bad’ thing if AI ends up doing jobs previously done by humans. AI could actually make life better for us, by making work more efficient and productive and granting us more leisure time. What is worrying, though, is the government’s lack of preparation for the advent of AI. While Rishi Sunak has postured as a technocrat and even hosted the world’s first AI safety summit at Bletchley Park this autumn, his government and the past decade of Tory rule has done very little to actually brace UK society for the ways AI will revolutionise the workforce – conversely, they’ve made us as ill-prepared as possible by slashing the welfare system and doing little to provide enough highly-skilled jobs for graduates and other workers.
Still, the potential for a better future is there. “AI should be used to generate productivity gains that can be used to lighten work,” Spencer surmises. But, he adds, the future of work depends on ensuring that AI is governed democratically. “A better future of work and life for all will depend on ensuring that AI is operated in the interests of people, not profits.”

Over the last year, generative AI—a form of artificial intelligence that can compose original text, images, computer code, and other content—has gone from experimental curiosity to a tech revolution that could be one of the biggest business disruptors of our generation. Along the way, business leaders in every industry have been scrambling to develop their generative AI strategies, address potential risks, and figure out the best next action while trying to stay one step ahead of the competition.
The challenge now, of course, is separating the hype from reality to move forward on a path that makes sense for real businesses.  Fortunately, while the spotlight on generative AI may be new, the underlying technology has been around for quite some time, and many pioneering companies have already begun paving the way for successful commercial-grade implementations. In fact, our team has been working with generative and conversational AI in complex professional services applications like insurance, banking, and healthcare for the better part of a decade, and we’ve learned some important lessons along the way.
Where will the biggest transformation occur first?
First, it is clear that generative AI will transform business. The rate at which the technology continues to grow, and its amazing ability to keep getting better, is nothing short of remarkable. Any job function that involves working through large amounts of information to synthesize insights will be touched by generative AI. Importantly, however, that does not mean humans will be removed from the loop. It just means the way we do our jobs will change.
Second, the leaders in the generative AI arms race will be those who are able to get their data organized and accessible quickly. While off-the-shelf generative AI technology from the likes of OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and others is incredibly powerful, the key to successful commercial generative AI initiatives is having authoritative, comprehensive reference data to train the system for a specific use case.
For example, some of the specific use cases where we are currently seeing the fastest and most impactful commercial applications of generative AI are in the following four areas:

Agent Assist in Customer Experience: These are AI-powered applications that leverage previous customer activity, payment histories, transactions, and investment records to equip live customer service agents with effective response scripts. Examples include insurance prior authorizations to check eligibility for a prescription and robo-enhanced investment guidance and advice in financial services.

2. Contract Analysis/Drafting: Generative AI solutions in finance, insurance, and legal sectors that extract key information from contracts and legal documents, address inconsistencies, identify risks, and even draft legal text.
3. Audit: In finance and accounting, businesses are deploying generative AI to analyze 100% of compliance documents, replacing the outdated sample-based compliance approach.
4. Code Generation: Across all sectors, we are seeing clients utilizing generative AI to write code, detect bugs and streamline product development.
Strong data governance and human expertise: Essential ingredients
Across all these examples, reliable data and human expertise are critical differentiators between genuine, commercial-grade solutions and mere technological novelties. In complex, highly regulated industries like insurance and financial services simply applying an off-the-shelf AI chatbot to a front-end interface is not an option. To provide real value, and mitigate risk, these applications must comprehend the entire customer data landscape, be trained on specific use case nuances, and produce accurate results that are easily verifiable.
Early leaders are already recognizing that rock-solid data governance and cloud migration capabilities are the critical prerequisites for a strong generative AI strategy. Likewise, they realize that human talent will be central to success. From programming and training large language models to integrating the technology into existing workflows to interpreting nuances in specialized subject matter, effective generative AI will continue to require human intermediation. After all, generative AI’s true potential lies in augmenting our strengths and mitigating our weaknesses, not rendering us redundant.
As more commercial-grade generative AI solutions come to market, the distinction between those that systematically improve workflows and drive better customer engagement and those who claim to automate everything effortlessly with the push of a button will become abundantly clear. While we are currently at the beginning of a massive surge in new innovation involving generative AI, it is crucial for companies integrating and building these technologies to see beyond the hype and embrace this exceptional opportunity to strengthen their products, services, and workforce.

  Generative AI Can Boost Productivity Without Replacing Workers



The first large-scale study of a ChatGPT-like assistant in the workplace finds that it can benefit less experienced employees — and make customers happier.

Since generative AI went mainstream a year ago, it has inspired an equal measure of hype and fear. Boosters of tools such as ChatGPT and DALL-E predict that they will transform our economy, while skeptics worry about their potential to produce inaccurate or harmful results and ultimately replace workers. But until recently, no one had tested what really happens when companies unleash generative AI at scale in real workplaces.
The first such study, released as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper earlier this year, found the best-case scenario: Providing workers with a generative AI tool similar to ChatGPT can lead to more productive workers, happier customers, and higher employee retention.
Researchers studied nearly 5,200 customer support agents at a Fortune 500 software firm who gained access to a generative AI-based assistant in a phased rollout between November 2020 and February 2021. During support chats, the generative AI tool shared real-time recommendations with operators, suggesting how to respond to customers and supplying links to internal documents about technical issues.
Compared to a group of workers operating without the tool, those who had help from the chatbot were 14% more productive, on average, based on the number of issues they resolved per hour. The AI-supported agents ended conversations faster, handled more chats per hour, and were slightly more successful in resolving problems. Notably, the effect was largest for the least skilled and least experienced workers, who saw productivity gains of up to 35%.
Big Gains With Fewer Pains
“These are huge numbers,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor (by courtesy) at Stanford Graduate School of Business and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. “I’ve done lots of work on the introduction of new information technology over the years, and often companies are happy to get 1% or 2% productivity gains.”

For most of the past 30 years, computers and digital technologies have helped higher-skilled workers more than less-skilled workers.… It was fascinating to see that this technology goes the other way around.

Brynjolfsson was also surprised that productivity rose so quickly. “Often with new technologies, there’s a bit of a decline before it takes off, because it’s difficult and costly to implement changes, retrain workers, and change business processes,” he says. “In this case, we did not see a lull, and performance took off over just a few months.”
The reason for the boost, according to Brynjolfsson and coauthors Danielle Liopen in new window, an associate professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and Lindsey Raymondopen in new window, a PhD student at MIT Sloan, was that the bot learned what the most successful agents were doing right by digesting millions of transcripts of service interactions. It then disseminated these lessons — often tacit knowledge that’s hard to distill into employee trainings — to the wider workforce. With help from AI, agents who’d been on the job for two months performed as well as unsupported agents with six months of experience.
“For most of the past 30 years, computers and digital technologies have helped higher-skilled workers more than less-skilled workers, which has led to a growing gap in wages and income inequality,” Brynjolfsson says. “It was fascinating to see that this technology goes the other way around — it’s a good sign.”
The intervention also led to happier customers, as measured by both customer surveys and a textual analysis of their language in conversations. “People like it when you solve their problems, and the system seems to be doing a better job of that,” Brynjolfsson says. The team didn’t find much evidence that customers were more satisfied simply because agents with the AI assistant used more positive language — the research found that agents tended to use a peppy tone even before the system was introduced.
Far from resenting an AI coach, agents with access to the tool were less likely to quit, a significant finding in an industry with chronically high turnover. “We don’t know for sure why this occurred, but I would guess that it’s more enjoyable to be in a job where the customers like you and you can solve customer problems faster,” Brynjolfsson says.
AI vs. Inequality
Overall, the researchers concluded that generative AI was a win for the company’s employees, customers, and stockholders alike. “It wasn’t squeezing one group for the benefit of the others — all three were better off,” Brynjolfsson says. In 2021, he co-founded a startup called Workhelix to help other companies apply generative AI to boost productivity.
Taking a broader view, Brynjolfsson says the study signals that generative AI will turbocharge productivity in the U.S. economy over the coming decade. He was so confident in his prediction that he placed a $400 bet on Longbets.org that non-agricultural productivity growth would average over 1.8% annually through 2029 (compared to the Congressional Budget Office estimate of less than 1.5%).
“That would mean we could raise living standards and address a lot of problems, like the budget deficit, healthcare, and the environment,” he says. “And if it’s helping less-skilled workers more, that can help reduce inequality.”
Brynjolfsson cautions that the study doesn’t illuminate how generative AI will reshape the broader labor market. Yet he argues that employers who interpret the research as an excuse to lay off higher-skilled workers are missing the point. “The lesson is that, more often than not, you’ll benefit by augmenting workers rather than trying to replace them,” he says. “A smart company is going to make sure they compensate and retain the high-skilled workers, so the system can continue to learn from them.”

NEW YORK -- A year after the introduction of AI chatbot ChatGPT, many organizations have realized that a key value of generative AI systems is their ability to augment humans' work rather than replace workers.







As generative AI has grown quickly in popularity and many vendors released their own generative AI chatbots and platforms, it has seemed at times that the popular technology would replace workers such as artists, lawyers, white-collar office employees and even writers.
Similarly, there were concerns that the new technology was not secure enough to use in an enterprise environment, especially in industries working with personal and sensitive data.
However, amid the barrage of new generative AI tools, the landscape appears to be settling down for enterprises looking to benefit from the technology as a way to supplement their existing workforce.

Edward Jones
For financial advisory and wealth management firm Edward Jones, the value of generative AI has come from using the technology to help advisers support clients while removing some of the drudgery from work, said Shannon Favazza, principal and head of analytics at the firm.
""We think AI can be a great copilot to the adviser [and] augment that adviser's intelligence to make the adviser more productive,"" Favazza said during a presentation at the AI Summit New York 2023 conference on Dec. 7. ""AI brings a great opportunity for advisers to become more productive and be able to serve clients and serve investors who desperately need financial advice and otherwise wouldn't have access to it.""



We want people to say, 'Hey, this is the copilot. This is not a job replacement.'


Shannon FavazzaPrincipal and head of analytics, Edward Jones




Edward Jones took steps internally to help financial advisers and C-suite executives see the value from this application of generative AI in finance, Favazza said.
For example, using GPT 3.5 from OpenAI, Favazza and her team created generative AI-powered chatbots for Edward Jones employees to experiment with.
""The point [we made is that] the future is here, it's now, and we're able to do these things -- and everybody else is able to do these things,"" Favazza said.
The goal was to boost trust in generative AI, she said.
""There's a lot of natural distrust by what people see in the news,"" she continued. ""We want people to say, 'Hey, this is the copilot. This is not a job replacement.'""

Shannon Favazza, principal and head of analytics at Edward Jones, discusses the firm's approach to generative AI.







Moody's Analytics
Like Edward Jones, risk analytics firm Moody's Analytics -- a subsidiary of finance giant Moody's -- took an internal approach to generative AI before introducing a product to customers.
While advanced AI technologies such as quantum computing and blockchain have long been a part of Moody's Analytics' IT arsenal, generative AI has spun off many complex models. That can be challenging for a company with large data sets that is concerned about data privacy and security, said Caroline Casey, general manager for customer experience and innovation at the company, in an interview.
Before releasing its Research Assistant product on Dec. 4, Moody's created an internal copilot product -- not to be confused with Microsoft Copilot. Research Assistant is a search and analytical tool built on Azure OpenAI and uses OpenAI's GPT-4.
""We know that the purpose of this is not to replace a human,"" Casey said. ""It's to take out the kind of mundane work -- the trying to find information, the retrieval, the searching -- and actually help them to focus on where they've got the best expertise.""
Moody's began its journey in the summer after the CEO encouraged all employees of Moody's Corp. to be innovators.
Bouncing off that idea, the finance company created a cross-organizational team that included members from Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investors Service called the generative intelligence group. This group helped build the copilot platform that enabled all parts of the organization to experiment with generative AI technology.
""It was important for us as well to make sure everyone was on the journey,"" Casey said.
The first stage of building the platform was making sure it was secure. To do this, Moody's used Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.
""The key for us and a lot of organizations is we don't want our proprietary data to essentially train someone else's language model,"" Casey said.
Therefore, although OpenAI's GPT-3.5 powered Moody's internal copilot, the organization felt confident that it was not compromising its confidential data.
Azure OpenAI is meant for enterprise use and has added security embedded within it. Meanwhile, ChatGPT is a little risky to enterprises that do not want their proprietary data to be used to train the model.
The second stage was educating all employees with mandatory training for how to use generative AI. The training consisted of discussions about generative AI ethics, governance and prompt writing.
Moody's also set up an idea board enabling everyone in the organization to submit their ideas about generative AI. To date, employees have submitted 500 ideas to the board, with 20 of those ideas now being implemented in one way or another externally, Casey said.
""That's enabled us to work in a really distributed way and get things done much faster,"" Casey said.
It also enabled different units within the parent company to remain connected by the underlying technologies such as Meta's Llama.


Avatar tutor
Finance is among a number of industries experimenting with using generative AI as a copilot.
David Grewell, dean of the College of Engineering and Engineering Technology at Northern Illinois University, came to the conference to find a partner for a generative AI product idea he's developing for students. He is looking to develop an avatar tutor, he said in an interview.
""Often, when I see students struggle with fundamentals, I want to do what we can to make sure they're successful,"" Grewell said.
The avatar would augment students' learning and walk them through the process of getting a solution to certain engineering problems, while ensuring the generative AI tool is trustworthy.
""The other thing is to make sure we keep the AI within the rails so the student can't trick it,"" Grewell said.
At the conference, Grewell looked at conversational AI systems such as Amelia and IBM Watsonx.
""I want an interface that's easy for the student,"" he said. ""I don't want them struggling learning how to use it. I want the interface to be seamless and totally intuitive.""

Ever get bogged down by confusing AI terms? In the past year, countless AI-infused products and services have become available, offering a dizzying variety of features frequently wrapped in hard-to-discern jargon.With this handy glossary, you'll now know the difference between AI and AGI, what really happens when ChatGPT ""hallucinates,"" and know what it means when you hear GPT-4 described as an LLM with a transformer model built using deep neural networks. Let's dive in.AgentAn agent, in the context of AI, is a model or software program that can autonomously perform some kind of task. Examples of agents range from smart home devices that control temperature and lighting, to sensors in robot vacuums and driverless cars, to chatbots like ChatGPT that learn and respond to user prompts. Autonomous agents that carry out complex tasks are often cited as examples of what the next leap forward in AI might look like.AGI (Artificial general intelligence) AGI is a type of program or model that has the full intellectual capabilities of a human, i.e. general intelligence. AGI has abilities like reasoning, common sense, abstract knowledge, and creativity. Essentially it is able to autonomously perform tasks without human instruction. True AGI doesn't exist yet, but experts believe it could be achieved in the near future (although opinions vary on exactly when). Companies like OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic are committed to trying to create AGI. See also: Strong AIAlgorithm An algorithm is a set of rules or instructions for a computer program to follow. In the context of AI, algorithms are the basis for building its intelligence. Think of an action within the human brain being broken down into a series of steps. Algorithms mimic that process by building a series of if-then statements.AlignmentAlignment refers to how successfully AI is able to achieve goals not explicitly included in a prompt or request. These can include accuracy, security, and harm prevention. If an AI is misaligned, it's veering off its intended uses and applications, i.e. it gives wrong or inappropriate responses. Alignment is a big part of the ethics conversation, because a model that doesn't have proper alignment has the potential to spread misinformation, create cybersecurity threats, and share dangerous or harmful information.

AI (Artificial intelligence)AI is the blanket term for technology that can automate or execute certain tasks designed by humans. Lately, when people talk about AI (""AI is going to destroy humanity"" or ""AI is going to replace our jobs"") they're talking about AGI and generative AI. But AI is a huge concept that encompasses many technologies we've been using for years, such as algorithms that recommend content or products, self-driving cars, or voice assistants. Black boxCertain AI models are sometimes referred to as black boxes, which means users are unable to see or understand the inner workings of the technology. The black box problem has become especially relevant in the generative AI conversation, since companies like OpenAI and Google are notoriously secretive about how they work. But also, because generative AI is somewhat autonomous, even the developers don't fully understand how the algorithm generates outputs. As ethicists and policymakers call for more accountability and transparency of AI companies, it has raised the importance of cracking open the black boxes. ChatbotA chatbot is a type of program or model that can have a conversation with a human, like ChatGPT, but the term can also refer to customer service chatbots that provide alternatives to talking to a customer service rep on the phone or over text. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, and Character.AI have all received attention for their ability to hold sophisticated human-like conversations with users, but chatbots have been around for a while. ELIZA is considered the first chatbot, developed in 1966 by MIT scientist Joseph Weizenbaum.Deep learningDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that mimics the way humans learn. Powered by neural networks, deep learning uses multiple layers of algorithms to understand complex and abstract concepts, like conversations and images. Applications of deep learning include facial recognition technology, chatbots like ChatGPT, and driverless cars.

Diffusion modelA diffusion model is a machine learning model that can generate a response similar to the one it's trained on. In technical terms, it is a Markov chain trained using variational inference. Markov chain and variational inference are mathematical terms used to predict sequences and approximate information within large amounts of data. But what you need to understand is that diffusion models are what make AI image generation possible. Stable Diffusion, OpenAI's DALL-E, and Midjourney are all examples of products that use diffusion models.Generative AIThanks to OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT, generative AI has entered the mainstream. Generative AI is a type of AI that can create text, images, video, audio, and code based on prompts from a user. Generative AI is what powers AI chatbots like ChatGPT. It works by initially learning patterns from data (see Training below), and continues to learn as it builds on new data from prompts. Generative AI typically exists in the form of a chat interface, like ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard, so it can have a back-and-forth conversation with the user. The launch of ChatGPT created such a frenzy because it was an easy and accessible way for people to understand and harness the capabilities of generative AI. For all of its benefits, generative AI's widespread use has dangers since it tends to hallucinate, or confidently make things up. Unlike simpler forms of AI, generative AI is able to create entirely new content from training data, as opposed to a sensor with finite objectives or a voice assistant that parrots pre-existing information.Ethicists and policymakers have called for the regulation of generative AI because of its potential to spread misinformation, entrench biases, or enable cybercrime. Generative AI models also use datasets scraped from the web, which has raised concerns about privacy and copyright violations. Its ability to quickly generate content and automate tasks has also raised concerns about replacing jobs, particularly in the media and entertainment industries. GPU (Graphics processing unit)A GPU is a powerful chip or graphics card that is able to process multiple complicated computations. GPUs were initially developed to process images and graphics, as the name suggests, but they've been adapted for AI for their ability to handle the massive amount of computing power required by machine learning. It's estimated that ChatGPT uses 20,000 GPUs and will eventually need 30,000 graphics cards to power its model.HallucinationGenerative AI, particularly text-based chatbots, has a tendency to make things up. It's described as ""hallucination,"" because generative AI can sometimes go off on a total tangent, confidently talking about something that isn't true.

For example, a generative AI chatbot might hallucinate by saying Steve Jobs was a close-up magician, popular in Las Vegas during the Rat Pack era. But more commonly (and worryingly), generative AI chatbots hallucinate subtly, by mixing in fact with fiction. For example, it might say Steve Jobs was the founder of Apple (true), who oversaw the launch of the iPhone (true), for which he was declared Time's Person of the Year (not true). This happens because generative AI models work by predicting words based on probabilistic relation to the previous word. It isn't capable of understanding what it's generating. Let that be a reminder that ChatGPT might act sentient, but it's not.

JailbreakingJailbreaking a chatbot is getting it to do something outside of its intended uses. Using a certain kind of prompt, a jailbreak enables the user to bypass rules or guardrails, essentially tricking it into doing something it's not supposed to do according to its alignment. Jailbreaking can range from making a chatbot say offensive or inappropriate stuff just for fun, to making it share dangerous and actionable information, like how to make napalm. Large language model (LLM)A large language model is an AI software program that is trained on vast amounts of data to understand and generate text. LLMs string together sentences by predicting the next word based on probability. Since LLMs have been trained with so much data — basically the entirety of the internet — they are very successful at generating human-like text using this method. OpenAI's GPT models, Google's PaLM models, and Meta's Llama models are all examples of LLMs. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are what power ChatGPT and PaLM 2 and for Bard.Licensed dataLicensed data is information from the web that is purchased or accessed by a business or organization for the purpose of training AI. You might hear instances of companies saying they trained their models using licensed data. That's to say the data was legally obtained. The issue of licensed data has come up a lot recently due to the mass amounts of data needed to train AI models like ChatGPT. It gets murky in legal terms, because of the argument about what constitutes public domain, the original creator's intent, and how companies should be allowed to use that data.

Machine learningMachine learning is a method within artificial intelligence where a model is trained on data to learn and improve over time. Machine learning models use data to recognize patterns, classify information, and make predictions. Examples include filtering out spam emails (classification learning), using housing data to predict the price of a house (regression learning), or identifying images of dogs (deep learning). AI and machine learning are terms often used interchangeably, but machine learning is a subset of AI, that's defined by being trained with data to build its intelligence.ModelYou've likely heard this term thrown around a lot in relation to AI. A model is a program or algorithm designed for a specific purpose. An AI model is a general term for a program designed to replicate and/or automate certain tasks.Natural language processing (NLP)The reason why ChatGPT's responses read as so eerily human is because of natural language processing. The term refers to the discipline of training a model on text and speech so that it understands and expresses itself like a human might. Natural language processing also involves linguistics research so that models can understand the complexities and nuances of language. Neural networkInspired by the way the human brain works, neural networks are algorithms composed of artificial ""neurons'' or nodes that communicate with each other. Each connection between two neurons carries a certain value or ""weight"". These weights automatically make certain assessments about inputs, and the neuron will ""fire"" if a certain threshold is reached, which will pass along information to other neurons in the network. Neural networks power deep learning.

'ChatGPT Voice' is now available to free users. Here's how to speak with it.



Open-sourceOpen-source means the source code of a software program is open and free to the public (whereas a black box is closed). That means developers can use, modify, and build their own products with it. An open-source AI model is seen as a way of democratizing the development of AI, which is often shrouded in secrecy. Unlike Google and OpenAI's models which are closed-source, Meta recently released an open-source LLM (Llama 2). Other open-source models include Falcon, MPT, and RedPajama. ParameterA parameter is a variable in an LLM that can be weighted or adjusted during training to determine a specific outcome. You may have heard about parameters in relation to how powerful an LLM is — for example, GPT-4 has 1.7 trillion parameters. The more parameters an LLM has, the more complex it is and the more capacity it has to learn. Think of parameters as settings on a high-quality camera. On the camera you can adjust light, film speed, zoom, aperture, change out the lenses, etc. and every configuration produces a slightly different result. Now multiply that by billions or trillions, and that's what parameters do.PromptA prompt is a request or question that a user sends to a chatbot. There's a whole subculture devoted to ensuring the best response from large language models. Whether it's for code-generation, jailbreaking, or just getting the best answer you're looking for, prompts depend on clarity, conciseness, context, and intent. See also: Prompt engineer.
SEE ALSO:

Are 'prompt engineer' jobs real? Yes, but maybe not for long.



Prompt engineerWith the rise of generative AI chatbots, there's suddenly demand for expertise in crafting the right prompts. That's where prompt engineering comes in. A prompt engineer is someone with deep knowledge of LLMs who can optimize the best prompts for different purposes. That could be ensuring the chatbot successfully understands the request, or poking around the model to find threats and vulnerabilities. Prompt injection attackThe rise of LLMs has led to a new kind of cyberattack called prompt injection attacks. Prompt injection, similar to jailbreaking, is the act of using a carefully crafted prompt to manipulate models like ChatGPT for nefarious purposes. Through prompt injection, hackers exploit a vulnerability within a chatbot to share confidential information, or bypass the model's guardrails. Attackers use this directly, by interacting with the chatbot, or indirectly by hiding a prompt within a plugin or webpage, to secretly access personal or payment information. Recommendation algorithm/systemBefore the rise of ChatGPT, AI was already a big part of our lives. One of the more ubiquitous examples of this is the recommendation algorithm (or system). It's a term for a machine learning algorithm that makes recommendations based on user data and behavior. Your recommended shows on Netflix, products on Amazon, videos on YouTube and TikTok, and posts on Instagram are some examples of recommendation algorithms at work.

Strong AIStrong AI is another term for AGI or artificial general intelligence. It is a theoretical (for now) form of artificial intelligence that can autonomously ""think"" and act like a human.TokenA token is a unit of information within a large language model. It can be a word, part of a word, punctuation mark, or a segment of code — essentially the most fundamental form of something with meaning. When you hear that an LLM is trained on a certain number of tokens or a pricing model costs a certain number of cents per 1,000 tokens, this is what it's referring to. TrainingTraining is the process of feeding data to a machine learning model. There are two types of training: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is training a model with data that has already been labeled or classified in some way, whereas unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data which forces it to learn patterns and associations on its own. Each type of training has its own strengths and weaknesses. LLMs like GPT-4 use a combination of both unsupervised and supervised learning. Training dataTraining data is data that's used to train a machine learning model. Training data for LLMs consists of huge amounts of data called datasets, that are largely scraped from the internet. There are public datasets like Common Crawl and the Wikipedia database, and private or proprietary datasets gathered by companies like Google that have the resources to do so. Its dataset, MassiveWeb, for example, was created by Google-owned DeepMind and includes social media and blogging sites like Reddit, Facebook, YouTube, and Medium. So if you've ever posted on one of those sites, your data was probably used to train Bard. Transformer Did you know that GPT (as in ChatGPT) stands for generative pre-trained transformer? It's not just a tongue-tying acronym. A transformer is a type of neural network that powers the deep learning model used for generative AI. It works by embedding words (tokens) with context, using a ""self-attention"" mechanism, which enables it to predict what the next word might be. Otherwise, the model would just perceive words as bits of data without any association to each other. The transformer model, which kicked off the development of products like ChatGPT, originates from a paper by Google and University of Toronto researchers in 2017.

Published: Dec 07, 2023 05:16 AM ESTKirstie McDermott8 months ago0ShareThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) impacting jobs.Georgijevic / iStock There are numerous concerns workers have regarding the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), and more specifically generative AI, which erupted into the mass consciousness in late 2022.
A primary concern among those possessing AI expertise is the impact on their earning potential. After all, in a year rife with redundancies, cost of living squeezes, and pay rises that barely, or don’t keep up with inflation, maximizing your in-demand skills for top pay is key.

That is borne out by the fact that job postings mentioning either AI or generative AI more than doubled globally between July 2021 and July 2023, according to new data.
Additionally, job posts that mention AI or generative AI have seen a 17 percent greater application growth over the past two years, and when it comes to money, another study has found that AI-related jobs offer 77.53 percent higher salaries than other occupations.
That’s according to AI Influence on US Workforce Salaries data from BizReport, which also found that the pay gap between tech jobs and other occupations has widened by 36 percent thanks to the rise of AI. 
And when it comes to money, there are some states where you should focus your search.
Connecticut has the highest average AI wage at more than $176K a year, while Arizona offers the highest AI job pay––up to $450K per year. The lowest-pay location? It’s Tennessee at just $84K. 
The report also says that next year, there’s the potential for more than 131,000 AI-related jobs in the jobs market.

Job seekers are applying to more roles than years prior. Some say generative AI tools are to thank.
Six months ago, Anshita Verma was sending out a handful of job applications a day. Now, the 26-year-old data scientist is sending out 10 to 15 daily, and she says it’s all thanks to artificial intelligence tools.


“Instead of taking 30 minutes to fill out an application, it might take me 10,” says Verma. Plug-in AI browser tools that autofill the fields in job postings have greatly sped up the time she spends on applications, she says, letting her apply to more jobs more quickly.

Others are using generative AI programs like ChatGPT to create resumes and cover letters on demand that match the skills and qualifications of the job. Some are using job search automation tools such as LazyApply and SimplifyJobs to apply to jobs en masse. And AI tools such as Pyjama Jobs and Talentprise, which help candidates identify jobs their skill sets match, could also be boosting application rates.

Experts say the tools are one reason, coupled with a cooler labor market and inflation, that employers are getting inundated with more applications. Workers in the U.S. and the U.K. are applying to about 15% more roles compared to a year ago, according to recent data from LinkedIn.

“Job seekers are being more aggressive” compared to years past, says LinkedIn’s chief economist Karin Kimbrough, with AI helping people submit applications to more postings. “There’s a whole energy around AI right now, and if you have these tools that are going to help you craft that perfect message with personalized suggestions, it really gives you a little bit more confidence in applying.”
It can also prompt job seekers to apply more broadly. “Not only are they applying to more jobs, they’re actually applying to jobs they normally wouldn’t apply to,” says Michelle Volberg, founder and CEO of recruiting firm Giledan 360. “AI is like LinkedIn’s ‘Easy Apply’ tool on steroids. It's letting tech candidates apply to finance or healthcare roles if there’s some sort of overlap, or make their resume appear relevant when in reality it’s not.”

Experts say the increase in applications, due in part to AI, is swamping recruiters, leaving companies to sort through a flood of resumes. It’s causing “this really big need in the recruiting department to use AI to sort, filter, search and source resumes,” says Josh Bersin, a human resources industry analyst, who said he recently posted a job for an editor and got 300 responses in the first hour, with “90% of them looking like they were written by ChatGPT.” Says Bersin: “[Recruiters’] workload just went up because it's easier to apply.""
AI could also be making it harder for job seekers, as AI-assisted applications raise the bar for getting noticed and increase chances of getting missed amid the deluge. “People aren't finding a job as quickly as they might like, so they might feel the need to cover more bases and apply to more roles,” LinkedIn’s Kimbrough says.
Kimbrough and others say AI isn’t the whole reason job applications and competition are up. Add in slower hiring by companies, layoffs in many sectors and an uncertain economy, and it makes for an even more competitive job market.
Jon Stross, cofounder and president of hiring software company Greenhouse, says the amount of applications per job has more than doubled since June 2022. “The odds of getting a job are low,” he says, “so people are like, ‘how do you game the system?’” He says AI plays a part in the increased job applications, but the economic climate is having an impact, too.
James Neave, head of data science at job platform Adzuna, agrees: “AI is likely to be helping jobseekers speed up how long it takes to apply for jobs, which could mean they have the time and energy for more applications. But ultimately, AI isn’t the underlying cause behind greater job applications. That comes down to labor market dynamics.”
November job growth was slightly stronger than economists’ estimates as the U.S. added 199,000 jobs, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report. That’s up from October's 150,000—the lowest number of jobs added since January 2021. There were also more than 600,000 layoffs in the U.S. this year—a 198% increase from last year. The layoffs in the first nine months this year were the worst string of job cuts since 2020 and the second-worst stretch since 2009, according to staffing firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
Many companies use applicant tracking systems to help screen candidates’ applications for relevant skills and weed out those that don’t match certain keywords. But some say ATSs may not be able to keep up with the AI tools job seekers are using to better their chances of getting recognized, creating more work for recruiters and hiring managers.
When workers use AI tools to include keywords from job postings in their resumes, it can cause “a lot more resumes to potentially be getting through than there should be,” says career coach Jessica Mencunas. “That might work a little bit in the opposite of what the intention [of using an ATS] was: to really help recruiters be much more efficient.”
Some postings on LinkedIn even boast more than 1,000 applications. “It’s to the point where some companies don't even get through all the applications—it's just not possible,” says Volberg.
Some workers, such as Ronny Llerena, are still searching for jobs after being laid off earlier this year. “It’s insane,” says Llerena, 25, who has been looking for business operations opportunities in New York since the summer. “There are jobs that are posted for a day with 500 applicants already.” He says AI tools have helped him tailor his cover letters to specific jobs more quickly.
He doesn’t see AI as the sole reason the job market is so competitive, but says the increase in applications has pushed him to look for roles outside of tech and rely more on networking and referrals. Says Llerena: “AI certainly isn't helping alleviate the volume.”

Sign in Ohio is primed for growth, with low unemployment and high capital investment. In September, Joby Aviation announced it would invest up to $500 million to build air taxis in Dayton, confirming the state’s status as an elite manufacturing hub. Last year, Intel agreed to build two advanced semiconductor factories outside Columbus; at $20 billion, this is the largest private-sector investment in state history. Amazon is investing $7.8 billion to expand its data centers in central Ohio.All of this happened because the private and public sectors worked together to make Ohio an attractive place to do business. But we cannot be complacent. Rather, we need to recognize current and emerging problems, and address them. At the top of that list: the coming workforce gap.Ohio has only 75 workers available to fill every 100 open jobs, and our labor force participation rate is below the national average. Moreover, the demographic trends are not promising. By 2030, given our aging population and stagnant population growth, Ohio could have 600,000 fewer working-age residents (15-64) than in 2010. Employers are faced with a skill and site arbitrage problem — not having the right skills with ready workers in the right place.To exacerbate the challenge, there is the emergence of generative AI (gen AI), which will almost certainly disrupt workforce supply and demand. McKinsey has estimated that, accelerated by gen AI, up to 30% of current hours worked in the United States could be automated by 2030, requiring 12 million job shifts.Gen AI is a game-changer because it takes AI much deeper. It can process extremely large and varied sets of unstructured data and generate content in new ways. For example, it could automate certain call center operations by providing customer support through chatbots or interactive voice response. In pharma, gen AI could speed up the clinical trial process by accelerating the identification of molecules for new drugs. Overall, the effect on the workforce will likely be substantial, particularly in office support, customer service and food service. McKinsey has estimated those earning less than $38,200 a year are 10 to 14 times more likely to need to change occupations by 2030 than the highest earners, due to AI and automation.At the same time, though, gen AI could also provide a significant productivity boost — 0.1 to 0.6% more a year through 2040. Combined with other technologies, that figure could reach 3.3%. And that boost matters: there is no prosperity without productivity.The challenge for Ohio is to get ahead of the curve, to enable workers to move from jobs in sectors with declining demand to higher-paid ones with a future and to use gen AI to build a truly sustainable and inclusive economy. This shift will require the public and private sectors to work together, as they have before, to develop a cohesive strategy and the capabilities our industries need.For the private sector, that means supporting workers in learning AI-related skills that will help businesses capitalize on the productivity opportunity. For example, as companies seek to capitalize on gen AI’s potential, how could they train people to be prompt engineers? Employers can also revisit hiring policies that historically focused on credentials, such as a four-year college degree, and instead focus those policies on skills gained through previous employment or other kinds of accreditation.The public sector also has an important role to play. One place to start is with information: analyzing trends to identify workforce gaps. To fill them, we need to ensure our schools and other organizations are giving young people the capabilities that employers want. For example, among Ohio’s college graduates, only 20% get degrees in STEM-related majors, compared to 22% in the country as a whole, and the rate of growth of these graduates (3% in 2021) is much slower than in the rest of the United States (9%). And finally, government leaders can work with the private sector to help spread the costs of training and re-skilling, and to facilitate workforce mobility and social support.Ohio has a history of resilience and competitiveness. We have reinvented ourselves before. The changing workforce and the rise of gen AI are another such challenge. The choice is clear: we can act now to build a workforce that is ready for the changes gen AI will bring and an economy that works for all of us. Or we can put it off and play catch up — when it might be too late.Brandon Carrus is the managing partner of McKinsey & Company’s Ohio office.

SINGAPORE: In the race to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI), Singapore aims to get ahead by more than tripling its AI workforce to 15,000 in the next three to five years.
This goal is achievable, according to industry observers, who see the figure as a starting point and as a critical mass needed for innovation.Advertisement 












But they also highlighted the need to look beyond numbers to ensure workers have the depth of skills needed as well as the ability to make interdisciplinary connections.
""It is certainly not just about the numbers, but more about specific talents and ideas,"" said Associate Professor Kan Min Yen of the National University of Singapore's (NUS) computing school.
""As with other areas of (information and communications technology), a single, uniquely integrative individual can catalyse the development of an entire sector of technology that we do not have today.""
Tripling the number of AI professionals will help contribute to breadth, but the field also requires deep expertise and cross-linking among industry, academia and start-ups, he added.
The Singapore government announced the 15,000 target on Monday (Dec 4), as part of a revised national AI strategy (NAIS) spurred by recent breakthroughs - particularly in generative AI.Advertisement 












The wide-ranging strategy also spans efforts to drive AI creation and usage by companies, support AI start-ups, update national research priorities, and strengthen data sharing and computing power.
Singapore also aims to accelerate the exchange of ideas, with plans to establish an ""iconic AI site"" to nurture a tight-knit knowledge community.
STATE OF PLAY
Singapore's general pipeline of tech talent took a hit when the country outsourced ICT jobs in the 1990s and 2000s, according to Associate Professor Damien Joseph of Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) business school.
This saw system development jobs going to India, or ICT call centre positions going to the Philippines and Ireland, for example.
But experts pointed out that Singapore is not alone in falling short of AI expertise today.Advertisement 












Thirty-five per cent of companies in the Asia-Pacific see a lack of AI skills as a major factor significantly limiting their evaluation of generative AI capabilities, according to a survey by market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC) in August.
This figure is actually lower among Singapore companies, at 22 per cent.
In fact, NUS' Assoc Prof Kan said that globally, Singapore contributes disproportionately more than other countries to the AI talent pool, as it does in many areas of advanced computing technology.

Some of the increase in AI workers that Singapore seeks will come from local universities. In 2020, the undergraduate intake for information and digital technologies degree courses was 3,100 across the country's six autonomous universities, according to the Education Ministry.
But not all graduates will specialise in AI, leaving a gap likely to be filled by other sources, including continuing education and overseas workers.Advertisement 












An apprenticeship scheme by AI Singapore – the national programme to develop AI capabilities – will be redesigned as part of NAIS 2.0.
Close to 300 people have graduated from the apprenticeship since it started in 2018. About 90 per cent have gone on to become data scientists, machine learning operations engineers, AI engineers, software engineers and other roles.
AI Singapore said its graduates have between five to 15 years of experience, with diverse backgrounds in engineering, banking and finance, teaching, law and human resources. 
Still, given a worldwide scarcity, Singapore will have to present itself as an attractive destination for AI talent - and it does have some advantages in this area.
Assoc Prof Kan pointed to the country's transparency, suitability as a testbed and interconnectivity. And speed of AI regulation and rollout can allow Singapore to serve as a role model for other countries facing more difficulties scaling up deployment, he said.
Mr Adrian Goh, co-founder of tech talent platform Nodeflair, said government support to foster tech trends and welcome innovation - as seen in cryptocurrency-friendly policies - has helped make Singapore attractive.
The country's strong English proficiency also attracts global companies like FAANG - Meta (formerly Facebook), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - and Nvidia, while the high quality of life appeals to overseas AI talent.
Compared to the United States, where tech workers face challenges securing visas, Singapore has a streamlined employment pass system, Mr Goh added.
On the other hand, compared to Singapore, other countries in the region offer ""cost-efficient growth options"" with their emerging talent pools, he said.
Singapore's software engineers have the highest median salaries among seven Asian economies, according to a recent Nodeflair report. The median salary for a lead software engineer was about S$6,600, versus S$2,400 in Malaysia and S$2,100 in Vietnam, which had the next highest salaries.
Dr Lily Phan, IDC's research director for the future of work in the Asia-Pacific, also cited a lack of ""AI-readiness"" infrastructure, which was a limiting factor for 47 per cent of Singapore companies her market intelligence firm surveyed.
""It's the combination of different factors to make AI really work: Strategy, infrastructure, skills, governance (regulatory framework), data and culture,"" she said.






 










WHAT AI JOBS AND TRAINING COULD LOOK LIKE
Singapore's announcement also opened up questions about what the 15,000 jobs could look like, the skills needed, and how workers in other fields can take advantage of new opportunities.
The NAIS 2.0 report differentiates between AI creators who are ""top-tier AI talent"", AI users comprising enterprises and the general workforce, and AI practitioners who are tech workers. The 15,000 target applies to the latter group.
By that, the government is referring to workers with the skillset to create, implement and deploy AI systems, said Professor Lee Wee Sun of NUS' School of Computing.
To do this, software engineering skills are needed to create reliable systems that can be maintained at scale, he said.
Relevant roles could vary from training large language models to evaluating and making judgments based on AI recommendations, said Dr Phan.
NUS' Assoc Prof Kan said AI practitioners also help to bridge AI adoption in mainstream, commercial products.
And they are needed not just in companies but also in the public service, where they can help set up governmental frameworks and regulations to ensure fair and proper use of AI, he added.
This will require a general understanding of how AI is trained as well as its current limitations.
Assoc Prof Kan also pointed to the importance of interdisciplinary links – for instance, pairing AI understanding with subject matter expertise in a field wanting to benefit from the tech, such as healthcare or education.

Nodeflair's Mr Goh said that while software engineers and data analysts are already well-suited for transitioning into AI, domain-specific professionals trained in data science and machine learning also have an important role to play.
This is because understanding the nuances of a domain is valuable when working on AI applications.
While more training is required for such workers to make the career switch to AI, they are ""much more valuable talent"", he said.
The level of AI proficiency they would need to attain depends on the role, ranging from a developer creating large language models, to a developer working on a product that incorporates an application programming interface (API).
""To illustrate, it's like comparing building a car engine from scratch (the first scenario) to simply fitting a car engine into the rest of the car (the second scenario),"" said Mr Goh.
He stressed that even someone with software development experience will need continual learning to make sure their skills stay relevant, given the fast-evolving nature of the AI field.
And for those employed by tech companies, basic AI proficiency is increasingly expected as a core technical competency due to the pervasiveness of AI in business operations, said Mr Goh.
This is reflected in offerings at universities, where AI is being incorporated as a core subject for computer science students.
All of NUS' roughly 900 computer science students annually are required to take a compulsory AI module, and the university is in the process of setting up a graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster for its AI courses, said NUS' Prof Lee.
University programmes focusing on interdisciplinary AI knowledge are also coming up.
In November, NTU announced a new four-year bachelor of applied computing in finance, with integrated courses like machine learning in finance.
""By building a strong AI ecosystem, Singapore is in a strong position to be a regional AI hub,"" said Prof Lee.
""We have a strong education system that is able to develop the local talent. (And) we can attract some of the best talents in the region.""
