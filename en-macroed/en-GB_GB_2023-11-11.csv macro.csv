November 15, 2023By Music Business WorldwideMBW Views is a series of exclusive op/eds from eminent music industry people… with something to say. The following article is a little different than the usual first-person pieces we run: it’s something of a public resignation letter.Ed Newton-Rex is one of the most prominent figures in the evolution of generative AI in music. The California-based entrepreneur founded the pioneering music-making AI platform Jukedeck over a decade ago, before selling it to TikTok/ByteDance in 2019. He subsequently became Product Director of TikTok’s in-house AI Lab, before becoming Chief Product Officer at music app Voisey (sold to Snap in late 2020).Since last year, Newton-Rex has worked at Stability AI, home of generative AI image-maker, Stable Diffusion. Last year Stability AI raised USD $101 million at a $1 billion valuation.Newton-Rex has made a big impact at Stability AI in a relatively short time. As VP of Audio at the company, he’s led the development of Stable Audio, a generative AI music-making platform trained on licensed music in partnership with rights-holders. Last month, Stable Audio was named one of Time’s ‘Best Inventions Of 2023’.Despite this success, Newton-Rex has just quit his role at Stability on a point of principle. A published classical composer himself, Newton-Rex has, throughout his career, been consistent in his belief in the importance of copyright for artists, songwriters, and rightsholders.As he explains below, Newton-Rex’s personal respect for copyright has somewhat clashed with that of his employer in recent weeks, after Stability AI argued in favor of the ‘fair use’ of copyrighted material to fuel generative AI within a submission to the US Copyright Office. (As Newton-Rex points out, several other large generative AI companies share Stability’s position on this.)Some additional recent context: Newton-Rex’s decision to resign from Stability AI arrives as the debate over the ‘harvesting’ of copyrighted music by generative AI platforms gets even louder. Just last week, superstar Bad Bunny expressed his fury over an AI-generated track that artificially replicates the sound of his vocals, as well as those of Justin Bieber and Daddy Yankee.The purported maker of that track, which has over 22 million plays on TikTok, calls themselves FlowGPT. In a message responding to Bad Bunny published on TikTok, FlowGPT offered to let the artist re-record the AI-generated track “for free with all rights… but don’t forget to credit FlowGPT”. It gets worse: If Bad Bunny’s team managed to get the track removed from digital platforms, FlowGPT threatened, “I’ll have to upload a new version.”Over to Ed…I’ve resigned from my role leading the Audio team at Stability AI, because I don’t agree with the company’s opinion that training generative AI models on copyrighted works is ‘fair use’.First off, I want to say that there are lots of people at Stability who are deeply thoughtful about these issues. I’m proud that we were able to launch a state-of-the-art AI music generation product trained on licensed training data, sharing the revenue from the model with rights-holders. I’m grateful to my many colleagues who worked on this with me and who supported our team, and particularly to Emad for giving us the opportunity to build and ship it. I’m thankful for my time at Stability, and in many ways I think they take a more nuanced view on this topic than some of their competitors.But, despite this, I wasn’t able to change the prevailing opinion on fair use at the company.“I don’t see how using copyrighted works to train generative AI models of this nature can be considered fair use.”This was made clear when the US Copyright Office recently invited public comments on generative AI and copyright, and Stability was one of many AI companies to respond. Stability’s 23-page submission included this on its opening page:“We believe that Al development is an acceptable, transformative, and socially-beneficial use of existing content that is protected by fair use”.For those unfamiliar with ‘fair use’, this claims that training an AI model on copyrighted works doesn’t infringe the copyright in those works, so it can be done without permission, and without payment. This is a position that is fairly standard across many of the large generative AI companies, and other big tech companies building these models — it’s far from a view that is unique to Stability. But it’s a position I disagree with.I disagree because one of the factors affecting whether the act of copying is fair use, according to Congress, is “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work”. Today’s generative AI models can clearly be used to create works that compete with the copyrighted works they are trained on. So I don’t see how using copyrighted works to train generative AI models of this nature can be considered fair use.“Companies worth billions of dollars are, without permission, training generative AI models on creators’ works, which are then being used to create new content that in many cases can compete with the original works. I don’t see how this can be acceptable.”But setting aside the fair use argument for a moment — since ‘fair use’ wasn’t designed with generative AI in mind — training generative AI models in this way is, to me, wrong. Companies worth billions of dollars are, without permission, training generative AI models on creators’ works, which are then being used to create new content that in many cases can compete with the original works. I don’t see how this can be acceptable in a society that has set up the economics of the creative arts such that creators rely on copyright.To be clear, I’m a supporter of generative AI. It will have many benefits — that’s why I’ve worked on it for 13 years. But I can only support generative AI that doesn’t exploit creators by training models — which may replace them — on their work without permission.I’m sure I’m not the only person inside these generative AI companies who doesn’t think the claim of ‘fair use’ is fair to creators. I hope others will speak up, either internally or in public, so that companies realise that exploiting creators can’t be the long-term solution in generative AI.Ed Newton-RexMusic Business WorldwideAnalysis United States United Kingdom MBW ViewsRelated Posts  ‘Music licensing is the bridge which connects creators and users – a connection that encourages new ideas and increased value.’  ‘There is no legal or indeed moral excuse for the commercial use of music by AI companies without the prior permission of songwriters and rightholders.’  ‘Neighbouring rights are becoming a significant and vital revenue stream for recording rightsholders.’  Why Daniel Ek’s celebration of local artists is really anti-‘streaming tax’ spin    ",WebSite,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/why-just-resigned-from-my-job-generative-ai/'}",Why I just resigned from my job in generative AI.,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2023/11/EdNewton.jpg', 'width': 1358, 'height': 768}",2023-11-15T18:53:13+00:00,2023-11-15T19:19:58+00:00,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Music Business Worldwide', 'url': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/author/mbw/'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Music Business Worldwide', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2020/05/Vc15Mog7_400x400-60x60.png', 'width': 60, 'height': 60}}",Music Business Worldwide,https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/search/{search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/why-just-resigned-from-my-job-generative-ai/', 'name': 'Why I just resigned from my job in generative AI.'}}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation, aka RAG?


				Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from external sources.

  To understand the latest advance in generative AI, imagine a courtroom.
Judges hear and decide cases based on their general understanding of the law. Sometimes a case — like a malpractice suit or a labor dispute — requires special expertise, so judges send court clerks to a law library, looking for precedents and specific cases they can cite.
Like a good judge, large language models (LLMs) can respond to a wide variety of human queries. But to deliver authoritative answers that cite sources, the model needs an assistant to do some research.
The court clerk of AI is a process called retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG for short.
How It Got Named ‘RAG’
Patrick Lewis, lead author of the 2020 paper that coined the term, apologized for the unflattering acronym that now describes a growing family of methods across hundreds of papers and dozens of commercial services he believes represent the future of generative AI.
Patrick Lewis
“We definitely would have put more thought into the name had we known our work would become so widespread,” Lewis said in an interview from Singapore, where he was sharing his ideas with a regional conference of database developers.
“We always planned to have a nicer sounding name, but when it came time to write the paper, no one had a better idea,” said Lewis, who now leads a RAG team at AI startup Cohere.
So, What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from external sources.
In other words, it fills a gap in how LLMs work. Under the hood, LLMs are neural networks, typically measured by how many parameters they contain. An LLM’s parameters essentially represent the general patterns of how humans use words to form sentences.
That deep understanding, sometimes called parameterized knowledge, makes LLMs useful in responding to general prompts at light speed. However, it does not serve users who want a deeper dive into a current or more specific topic.
Combining Internal, External Resources
Lewis and colleagues developed retrieval-augmented generation to link generative AI services to external resources, especially ones rich in the latest technical details.
The paper, with coauthors from the former Facebook AI Research (now Meta AI), University College London and New York University, called RAG “a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe” because it can be used by nearly any LLM to connect with practically any external resource.
Building User Trust
Retrieval-augmented generation gives models sources they can cite, like footnotes in a research paper, so users can check any claims. That builds trust.
What’s more, the technique can help models clear up ambiguity in a user query. It also reduces the possibility a model will make a wrong guess, a phenomenon sometimes called hallucination.
Another great advantage of RAG is it’s relatively easy. A blog by Lewis and three of the paper’s coauthors said developers can implement the process with as few as five lines of code.
That makes the method faster and less expensive than retraining a model with additional datasets. And it lets users hot-swap new sources on the fly.
How People Are Using RAG
With retrieval-augmented generation, users can essentially have conversations with data repositories, opening up new kinds of experiences. This means the applications for RAG could be multiple times the number of available datasets.
For example, a generative AI model supplemented with a medical index could be a great assistant for a doctor or nurse. Financial analysts would benefit from an assistant linked to market data.
In fact, almost any business can turn its technical or policy manuals, videos or logs into resources called knowledge bases that can enhance LLMs. These sources can enable use cases such as customer or field support, employee training and developer productivity.
The broad potential is why companies including AWS, IBM, Glean, Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Oracle and Pinecone are adopting RAG.
Getting Started With Retrieval-Augmented Generation 
To help users get started, NVIDIA developed an AI workflow for retrieval-augmented generation. It includes a sample chatbot and the elements users need to create their own applications with this new method.
The workflow uses NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for developing and customizing generative AI models, as well as software like NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM for running generative AI models in production.
The software components are all part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a software platform that accelerates development and deployment of production-ready AI with the security, support and stability businesses need.
Getting the best performance for RAG workflows requires massive amounts of memory and compute to move and process data. The NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, with its 288GB of fast HBM3e memory and 8 petaflops of compute, is ideal — it can deliver a 150x speedup over using a CPU.
Once companies get familiar with RAG, they can combine a variety of off-the-shelf or custom LLMs with internal or external knowledge bases to create a wide range of assistants that help their employees and customers.
RAG doesn’t require a data center. LLMs are debuting on Windows PCs, thanks to NVIDIA software that enables all sorts of applications users can access even on their laptops.
An example application for RAG on a PC.
PCs equipped with NVIDIA RTX GPUs can now run some AI models locally. By using RAG on a PC, users can link to a private knowledge source – whether that be emails, notes or articles – to improve responses. The user can then feel confident that their data source, prompts and response all remain private and secure.
A recent blog provides an example of RAG accelerated by TensorRT-LLM for Windows to get better results fast.
The History of RAG 
The roots of the technique go back at least to the early 1970s. That’s when researchers in information retrieval prototyped what they called question-answering systems, apps that use natural language processing (NLP) to access text, initially in narrow topics such as baseball.
The concepts behind this kind of text mining have remained fairly constant over the years. But the machine learning engines driving them have grown significantly, increasing their usefulness and popularity.
In the mid-1990s, the Ask Jeeves service, now Ask.com, popularized question answering with its mascot of a well-dressed valet. IBM’s Watson became a TV celebrity in 2011 when it handily beat two human champions on the Jeopardy! game show.

Today, LLMs are taking question-answering systems to a whole new level.
Insights From a London Lab
The seminal 2020 paper arrived as Lewis was pursuing a doctorate in NLP at University College London and working for Meta at a new London AI lab. The team was searching for ways to pack more knowledge into an LLM’s parameters and using a benchmark it developed to measure its progress.
Building on earlier methods and inspired by a paper from Google researchers, the group “had this compelling vision of a trained system that had a retrieval index in the middle of it, so it could learn and generate any text output you wanted,” Lewis recalled.
The IBM Watson question-answering system became a celebrity when it won big on the TV game show Jeopardy!
When Lewis plugged into the work in progress a promising retrieval system from another Meta team, the first results were unexpectedly impressive.
“I showed my supervisor and he said, ‘Whoa, take the win. This sort of thing doesn’t happen very often,’ because these workflows can be hard to set up correctly the first time,” he said.
Lewis also credits major contributions from team members Ethan Perez and Douwe Kiela, then of New York University and Facebook AI Research, respectively.
When complete, the work, which ran on a cluster of NVIDIA GPUs, showed how to make generative AI models more authoritative and trustworthy. It’s since been cited by hundreds of papers that amplified and extended the concepts in what continues to be an active area of research.
How Retrieval-Augmented Generation Works
At a high level, here’s how an NVIDIA technical brief describes the RAG process.
When users ask an LLM a question, the AI model sends the query to another model that converts it into a numeric format so machines can read it. The numeric version of the query is sometimes called an embedding or a vector.
Retrieval-augmented generation combines LLMs with embedding models and vector databases.
The embedding model then compares these numeric values to vectors in a machine-readable index of an available knowledge base. When it finds a match or multiple matches, it retrieves the related data, converts it to human-readable words and passes it back to the LLM.
Finally, the LLM combines the retrieved words and its own response to the query into a final answer it presents to the user, potentially citing sources the embedding model found.
Keeping Sources Current
In the background, the embedding model continuously creates and updates machine-readable indices, sometimes called vector databases, for new and updated knowledge bases as they become available.
Retrieval-augmented generation combines LLMs with embedding models and vector databases.
Many developers find LangChain, an open-source library, can be particularly useful in chaining together LLMs, embedding models and knowledge bases. NVIDIA uses LangChain in its reference architecture for retrieval-augmented generation.
The LangChain community provides its own description of a RAG process.
Looking forward, the future of generative AI lies in creatively chaining all sorts of LLMs and knowledge bases together to create new kinds of assistants that deliver authoritative results users can verify.

Within two months 100m users were posing all sorts of entertaining queries (“Write me a rap song using references to SpongeBob SquarePants”). The number of people Googling “artificial intelligence” surged, and the mania set off investors’ enthusiasm for all manner of AI projects. Yet the real promise, these investors and entrepreneurs are betting, lies with its use in business. Here, too, it could be more rapidly adopted than past innovations. But that does not mean it will happen overnight.The potential is exciting. According to McKinsey, a consultancy, three-quarters of the business uses of generative ai will fall into four areas: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development. Navigating a complex tax code or summarising a legal document could become a breeze. Type in the right prompt and a first draft of marketing copy could magically appear. Already many coders rely on Copilot, a coding tool from Microsoft, to help them write software. Studies show that professional workers with below-average performance tend to experience the most benefit from using generative ai, promising a big increase in output for firms.Already have an account?Log inContinue with a free trialExplore all our independent journalism for free for one month.

But now it is also the name of a “data poisoning tool” helping artists fight back against unauthorized use of their work by artificial intelligence (AI).Nightshade has been developed by computer scientists at the University of Chicago, who have published a paper on their work, Prompt-Specific Poisoning Attacks on Text-to-Image Generative Models.What is Nightshade?Nightshade allows artists to change pixels in their work in a way that is invisible to the human eye. This misleads AI programs, which then believe the image shows one thing, whereas viewers see something different.“Dogs become cats, cars become cows, and so forth,” the MIT Technology Review explains in its preview article on Nightshade.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence? Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance. The Alliance will unite industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems. This approach is known as “poisoning” data. It will lead to generative AI tools creating images that are messed up or don’t match what is being searched for.AI tools extract data from billions of images online, so the more Nightshade is used, the more AI could become poisoned, MIT Technology Review adds.How Nightshade poisons the data that AI tools use. Image: University of ChicagoWhy has Nightshade been developed?AI companies disrespect artists’ copyright and intellectual property when they train their image-generating tools on artists’ work without permission, says Ben Zhao, the computer science professor at University of Chicago leading the Nightshade project.He hopes Nightshade will deter this behaviour and give some power back to artists.Artists, performers and record labels have filed lawsuits against AI companies including OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, for training their AI on artists’ material without permission, reports tech news site VentureBeat.How could Nightshade affect the AI industry?Nightshade could have an important impact if AI companies are forced to be more respectful of artists and their rights, for example by agreeing to pay out royalties, say the contributors to the MIT article.Some AI companies have mechanisms for artists to opt out of their work being used to train generative AI.

     Listen to this article 2 min    AM Best does not believe artificial intelligence is the main cause of recent insurance industry layoffs.
In commentary released today, the credit rating agency wrote that “it is too soon to cite AI as the leading cause of the job losses, at least at this nascent stage.” Instead, AM Best said the layoffs likely fall into “the cyclical, rather than the structural, category.”




The rating agency explained that structural unemployment refers to jobs that are made redundant because of systemic changes and the adoption of technology, or a misalignment between business needs and employee skills. Cyclical unemployment refers to employment fluctuations driven by the business cycle, “which seems to be the case in the insurance industry,” AM Best said.
This insight comes after Liberty Mutual, American Family and GEICO announced staff reductions in recent months. AM Best wrote that personal lines are most affected by the latest layoffs, as loss ratios and underwriting margins are pressured by loss cost inflation, reinsurance capacity and pricing and rising climate risk.

The commentary said the recent insurer layoffs alone do not signal ratings pressure.
AM Best did share that artificial intelligence-related advances will gradually reshape the outlook for insurance industry employment. Many insurance companies are experimenting with and are motivated by generative AI’s customer service potential, AM Best reported, later noting that the speed at which AI develops over the coming years will determine the level of industry disruption.
“Although the overall impact of generative AI on employment remains uncertain, it will likely change the way society works, as current employees learn to leverage the power of this developing technology,” AM Best said.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, hiring by insurance carriers and related companies slowed to an estimated 1,100 positions in October. This was down from September, when the BLS reported 3,900 people were hired, and July, when 8,300 new workers were brought on board.
Insurance technology companies have also been downsizing. Hippo, Branch Insurance, Corvus Insurance and Pie Insurance announced layoffs earlier this year. Last year, Thimble, NEXT, Lemonade and Root were among the insurtechs trimming their workforces.

Well-loved. Like or Dislike: 14 3Greed:  If one needs any further proof the root issue in America, it is summed up in one word Greed. Why else is the Federal Minimum wage STILL at $7.25.  Next is these companies pay their CEO such crazy pay. Take for example the GM CEO, she makes close to 30 million a year, her workers wanted to match her percentage of rate pay increase.  She makes in one month, what some will make in their entire careers, showing up, every day, working every day.  Until the company sends some slickster in too fire you, let you go, and give you a warm embrace as they shove you out the door, only to turn around and interview you the following 6 months for half the pay.  Again, GREED.

There's no longer any doubt that generative AI, based on models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, will impact our jobs.

Workers are already aware of this; 36% of them believe that their job will be replaced by artificial intelligence, according to a BCG study conducted in 13 countries in June. It’s not just speculation. In recent weeks, reports of AI-related layoffs have been multiplying. Onclusive, a media company, recently announced the elimination of 200 jobs (nearly half of its workforce), replaced by an artificial intelligence solution. The CEO of Dukaan, an Indian company that creates e-commerce websites, has announced the layoff of 90% of his customer service teams, replacing them with a chatbot. Business leaders aren't spared either. Almost one in two American CEOs believes that AI would be perfectly capable of carrying out all or part of their roles.


Clearly, GenAI will unlock substantial productivity gains—already certain functions within companies are witnessing productivity surge by over 50%. And though this has sparked anxiety about job losses, it depends on how business leaders intend to use that productivity.

Many businesses will reinvest the savings rather than simply eliminating jobs. Some banks, for example, have harnessed these gains to develop innovative customer outreach strategies, turning previously unprofitable services into profitable ones due to the reduced costs per customer interaction. And higher productivity can also translate into increased capacity where humans are the bottleneck. AI-assisted surgeons, for example, can prepare for operations more rapidly, reducing wait times for ailing patients and potentially increasing the number of people treated.

PROMOTED
Beyond these announcements, researchers have tried to evaluate the likely qualitative and quantitative impact of GenAI on jobs. Research teams from Harvard Business School, MIT, Wharton, Warwick and the BCG Henderson Institute, for example, jointly conducted an experiment with more than 750 BCG consultants worldwide. They observed the impact of using GenAI for 18 so-called “creative” tasks (like coming up with product names, synthesizing documents, writing emails, etc.) and for two complex problem-solving tasks (making a diagnosis and suggesting actions). The results clearly show that undifferentiated deployment of GenAI - beyond creative tasks- is not the solution.
While 90% of employees using generative AI solutions improved their performance in “creative” tasks, and the quality of their output increased by an average of 40% (in terms of content and speed), the same was not true for complex problem-solving. For these more complicated tasks, the average performance of employees using GenAI dropped by 23%. Even more concerning, the performance gain on creative tasks comes at the cost of group creativity, with the variety of results decreasing by 41%.

This is indeed the main dilemma for companies: how to deploy the new generative AI to improve performance while maintaining creative capacity? How can companies differentiate themselves if generative AI standardizes offerings, ideas, discourses and interactions? Ultimately, how can a company differentiate itself if all competitors use the same models and the same data?

Nothing is certain at this stage, but there are some hints on how best to deploy the technology. Above all, be wise in choosing what to automate and what not to automate; decide on a task-by-task basis, not by job category.

Next, always consider the role of humans, understand the value they add over a machine and recruit accordingly. If sales agents are assisted by AI to answer technical questions about products, the best salespeople might be those with stronger relationship skills than is required today. Finally, set aside ""AI-free"" teams to maintain a core group of creatives.
Beyond the impact on specific tasks, GenAI can also help in the shifting labor landscape by bridging skill gaps. Tools like ChatGPT are democratizing job access for individuals with literacy challenges by providing conversational interfaces that simplify complex interactions. AI tutors can smooth and speed certification processes, lowering entry barriers, and aligning with diversity initiatives. Technical jobs with an aging workforce and high qualification barriers, such as elevator maintenance in some countries, are now more accessible to a broader demographic. These advancements position generative AI not only as a tool for productivity but also as a catalyst for a more inclusive workforce.
One thing is certain: the collaboration between humans and the new generative AI systems, harmonious or not, will be a fundamental challenge in the coming decade.

New Generative AI Model Designs Proteins Not Found in Nature

In a new study “Illuminating protein space with a programmable generative model,” published in Nature, researchers present a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, named Chroma, that creates novel proteins not previously found in nature with programmable properties for therapeutic potential and demonstrated experimental success in the lab.
The work comes from Generate:Biomedicines, a company based in Somerville, MA, which works at the intersection of machine learning, biological engineering and medicine with an emphasis on protein design.




“We’ve been working on generative models of proteins since Day 1. That’s why our name is Generate!” exclaimed Gevorg Grigoryan, PhD, co-founder and chief technology officer of Generate:Biomedicines.
Prior to the AI revolution, protein design approaches were limited to generating designs based on nature’s existing proteins, which presented limitations as nature has only sampled a small subset of the possible protein landscape. In contrast, generative AI approaches emphasize de novo protein design—designing new proteins from scratch—to expand the repertoire of functions and desirable attributes beyond what nature has achieved.
Chroma is documented to design proteins under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, and even natural-language prompts. Experimental characterization of 310 proteins generated from Chroma resulted in proteins that express, fold, and possess favorable biophysical properties.







Grigoryan noted that programmability was integral to Chroma’s framework from the get-go, as producing therapeutic applications requires more than generating structures that can be experimentally validated. Evaluating protein function, such as binding, allosteric control, and enzymatic activity, is critical for therapeutic potential.
In addition, Grigoryan highlights that one novelty of the study was a shifted paradigm when thinking about experimental validation in a protein design campaign.
“Instead of the goal being ‘I want the protein to work,’ our goal was to characterize the model. We wanted to understand how much of what Chroma learned was real versus not real,” Grigoryan told GEN.
When deciding which computational structures to experimentally validate, common methodology involves a filtering step, in which protein designers critique designs based on their understanding of biophysical structure, such as penalizing overrepresentation of hydrophobic regions due to solubility concerns.
Grigoryan told GEN that the 310 proteins chosen for experimental validation were taken directly from the model output and not filtered in this way.




“From those proteins, we saw a massively high success rate, which of course is very exciting because it suggests that this large protein space parameterized by Chroma is real [and allows for more effective protein design],” Grigoryan continued.
 Making data work for you
The protein design field’s traditional “bottom up” approach, which simulated protein behavior based on biophysical dynamics of atoms, was logically “fine and consistent” but hasn’t led to the advances that are now achievable with machine learning.
Rather than starting with first principles and evaluating whether simulations are accurate, machine learning approaches start with observations and infer the principles that led to those observations.
“Machine learning tools can make data work for you,” stated Grigoryan.
Specifically, Chroma leverages diffusion models, a machine learning tool that has seen considerable success in image generation tools, such as Midjourney, DALL-E 2 from OpenAI, and Stable Diffusion from Stability AI. These generative models learn the patterns of their training data and generate new outputs with similar characteristics.
Grigoryan emphasizes that this framework makes Chroma malleable to the introduction of new programmable conditions.
“It’s very easy to create a model for new properties and plug it into Chroma. Similar to DALL-E image generators, you don’t have to create a separate model of images for animals, the beach, and mountains. You can just tell the model, ‘I would like a panda dancing on the beach with a sombrero’ and it can generate that for you,” described Grigoryan.
Chroma is not the only generative AI tool leveraging diffusion models for protein design. In July, the lab of David Baker, PhD, professor in biochemistry and the director of the University of Washington (UW) Institute for Protein Design (IPD), published their diffusion model, RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), which demonstrated strong experimental validation and ease of use, in Nature.
“So far, [Chroma] has only been experimentally demonstrated to design new structures, but could likely be adapted to design new protein, peptide and small molecule interactions as has been demonstrated by RFdiffusion,” Baker told GEN.
Along this vein, Grigoryan notes that an effective protein design model is only one piece to the broader process of therapeutic discovery.
“Chroma is a model and not a drug printer. There’s so much more that goes into making therapeutics, which can be resource intensive and involves a very close integration between the wet and dry lab,” said Grigoryan.
Open to all
Generate:Biomedicines has made the code behind Chroma available as open-source software for all researchers across academia and industry.
“Our intention was to go open source before we posted the preprint. From a societal perspective, it would not feel right to stand in the way of what [Chroma] can do for advancing biomedical science, but also other applications, such as nanotechnology and material science,” explained Grigoryan.
From a company perspective, Grigoryan also noted that the ability to continue at the forefront of science is linked to a company’s ability to attract and retain the best talent. Sharing this work is a key action to contributing to the research community.
“It’s great that Generate:Biomedicines is making Chroma available to the scientific community!” said Baker. Baker also indicates that the community will benefit from having multiple generative protein design models to explore.
While diffusion models are the “flavor of the moment,” new protein design tools are expected to infiltrate a rapidly growing field.
“Now that the code is available, [the community] is certainly free to build on it and create better versions. I expect and hope that’s exactly what happens,” stated Grigoryan.

Key Takeaways
Job website Indeed found that postings mentioning AI grew to 20 times what it was at the beginning of the year. Despite the rapid growth, job postings using AI keywords are still a small portion of the overall job market. In its analysis, Indeed found that AI is not taking over full jobs, and is instead being integrated more into work. 
 The growing hype around artificial intelligence (AI) has raised questions for employers and workers alike: Employers want to know if advanced AI tools can boost productivity, and some workers wonder if they’ll be replaced by a mindless chatbot.So-called generative AI algorithms like ChatGPT, which can respond to user prompts by spitting out text that can seem like what a human would write, are starting to make an impact on the job market, albeit a tiny one, according to data from job website Indeed. By the end of October, there were 20 times as many job postings mentioning generative AI-related keywords than when the year began.




 The rapid rise of AI technology has alarmed many government officials and labor leaders, who worry about the possible abuse of the technology and its ability to displace workers. In late October, President Joe Biden called for regulators to establish safeguards on the use of AI. The potential use of AI in scriptwriting was a major reason that Hollywood writers went on strike this summer.Indeed’s job posting data may provide a clue about where the technology is headed because keywords capture not only jobs developing AI but, more important, ones in which workers are expected to use AI tools on the job.


 According to Indeed’s analysis, AI isn't fully taking over entire jobs as of yet but could be used for some specific job functions, like writing marketing copy, for instance.“If we do see continued growth in that area of job postings … that could be an indication there's increasing usage of those tools, that they're spreading throughout the labor market,” said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed’s hiring lab research unit.

AI-Assisted Research on Westlaw Precision – Better, faster answers to complex research questions drawn from the industry's most comprehensive collection of editorially enhanced content  
A new GenAI assistant connects all Thomson Reuters generative AI products, building on innovation from Casetext 
Thomson Reuters Generative AI Platform – A common development platform to design, build, and deploy GenAI skills with unparalleled speed  
New GenAI capabilities for Practical Law – Customers to benefit from AI chat-type interface 
CoCounsel Core – Announcing the commercial offering of CoCounsel skills as part of the Thomson Reuters portfolio 

NEW YORK, Nov. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Thomson Reuters (TSX/NYSE: TRI), a global content and technology company, today announced a series of GenAI initiatives designed to transform the legal profession. Headlining these initiatives is the debut of GenAI within the most advanced legal research platform, AI-Assisted Research on Westlaw Precision. Available now to customers in the United States, this skill helps legal professionals quickly get to answers for complex research questions. This generative AI skill leverages innovation in Casetext and taking a ""best of"" approach was created using the Thomson Reuters Generative AI Platform.  
The company also announced that it will be building on the AI assistant experience Casetext created with CoCounsel, the world's first AI legal assistant. Later in 2024, Thomson Reuters will launch an AI assistant that will be the interface across Thomson Reuters products with GenAI capabilities.  
The AI assistant, called CoCounsel, will be fully integrated with multiple Thomson Reuters legal products, including Westlaw Precision, Practical Law Dynamic Tool Set, Document Intelligence, and HighQ, and will continue to be available on the CoCounsel application as a destination site. Customers will be able to choose the right skills to solve the problem at hand while taking advantage of generative AI capabilities.  
""Thomson Reuters is redefining the way legal work is done by delivering a generative AI-based toolkit to enable attorneys to quickly gather deeper insights and deliver a better work product. AI-Assisted Research on Westlaw Precision and CoCounsel Core provide the most comprehensive set of generative AI skills that attorneys can use across their research and workflow,"" said David Wong, chief product officer, Thomson Reuters.  
With AI-Assisted Research and CoCounsel Core, attorneys are empowered with eight GenAI-powered core skills, including AI-Assisted Research on Westlaw Precision, Prepare for a Deposition, Draft Correspondence, Search a Database, Review Documents, Summarize a Document, Extract Contract Data, and Contract Policy Compliance. The company also laid out high-level product roadmaps to develop numerous additional GenAI skills to address customer-specific needs. Each additional skill will be built on a common software framework within the Thomson Reuters Generative AI Platform. 
AI-Assisted Research allows customers to ask complex legal research questions in natural language and quickly receive synthesized answers, with links to supporting authority from Westlaw content and links to further examine that authority. AI-Assisted Research streamlines the initial phase of legal research with sophisticated answers to questions and the authority those answers are based on, saving hours of work. These responses are founded on more than 150 years of Thomson Reuters classification, analysis, and editorial expertise contributed by subject matter experts and attorney editors. AI-Assisted Research employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to prevent the large language models (LLMs) from making up things like case names and citations by focusing the LLMs on the actual language of Westlaw content. Future plans include expanding GenAI throughout the research process in Westlaw and bringing these capabilities to versions of Westlaw outside the US. Starting in 2024, target markets include the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. 
""Thomson Reuters is well positioned to deliver high-quality AI results because it has the largest, most up-to-date, and trustworthy legal research system in the world,"" said Andrew Bedigian, counsel, Larson LLP. ""The fact that AI-Assisted Research relies exclusively on Thomson Reuters vetted database should provide lawyers with confidence that the answer AI-Assisted Research is generating in response to attorney questions is going to be well supported. And the fact that AI-Assisted Research delivers all the sources it relied upon – right beneath the answer – provides additional confidence that the program is delivering on our research needs."" 
""We leveraged our experts in Thomson Reuters Labs, our more than 1,600 attorneys, and our best-in-class content to build a Westlaw Precision tool that provides our customers with the trust, accuracy, and speed they need to serve their clients,"" said Mike Dahn, head of Westlaw Product Management, Thomson Reuters. ""Our human oversight, technology expertise, and industry-leading content are critical to producing trusted answers with generative AI. This tool won't obviate the need for attorneys, but it will help them do their work better and faster."" 
CoCounsel Core 
With integration well under way, the company today announced CoCounsel Core as the commercial offering of legacy CoCounsel skills. CoCounsel has had more than 4,000 hours of rigorous testing and training by more than 1,400 customers since its launch in May – including input of law firms, corporations, and government agencies. All of this learning is being utilized in the Thomson Reuters innovation journey.  
Thomson Reuters Generative AI Platform 
The Thomson Reuters Generative AI platform is a cloud native technology platform that uses an API-first development approach and incorporates Thomson Reuters user experience and design systems. It will enable Thomson Reuters to quickly and easily launch new generative AI skills by leveraging reusable components as the building blocks for future products. The Thomson Reuters Generative AI platform will provide a safe, privacy-compliant, and reliable platform for generative AI development, enabling scalability across a wide range of LLM providers.   
Thomson Reuters will continue to bring GenAI to more aspects of the legal research process with the introduction of GenAI within Practical Law Dynamic Tool Set in January 2024. Customers will benefit from generative AI within Practical Law through a new interface with an AI legal assistant, which will quickly provide answers using conversational language – all validated by trusted Practical Law content created and maintained by a team of more than 650 legal experts.

Before the pandemic, he liked playing football with local kids in his hometown of Burewala in the Punjab region of Pakistan. But Covid lockdowns made him something of a recluse, attached to his mobile phone. “I just got out of my room when I had to eat something,” says Hassan, now 18, who asked to be identified under a pseudonym because he was afraid of legal action. But unlike most teenagers, he wasn’t scrolling TikTok or gaming. From his childhood bedroom, the high schooler was working in the global artificial intelligence supply chain, uploading and labeling data to train algorithms for some of the world’s largest AI companies.The raw data used to train machine-learning algorithms is first labeled by humans, and human verification is also needed to evaluate their accuracy. This data-labeling ranges from the simple—identifying images of street lamps, say, or comparing similar ecommerce products—to the deeply complex, such as content moderation, where workers classify harmful content within data scraped from all corners of the internet. These tasks are often outsourced to gig workers, via online crowdsourcing platforms such as Toloka, which was where Hassan started his career.A friend put him on to the site, which promised work anytime, from anywhere. He found that an hour’s labor would earn him around $1 to $2, he says, more than the national minimum wage, which was about $0.26 at the time. His mother is a homemaker, and his dad is a mechanical laborer. “You can say I belong to a poor family,” he says. When the pandemic hit, he needed work more than ever. Confined to his home, online and restless, he did some digging, and found that Toloka was just the tip of the iceberg.Featured VideoHarvard Professor Explains Algorithms in 5 Levels of Difficulty“AI is presented as a magical box that can do everything,” says Saiph Savage, director of Northeastern University’s Civic AI Lab. “People just simply don’t know that there are human workers behind the scenes.”At least some of those human workers are children. Platforms require that workers be over 18, but Hassan simply entered a relative’s details and used a corresponding payment method to bypass the checks—and he wasn’t alone in doing so. WIRED spoke to three other workers in Pakistan and Kenya who said they had also joined platforms as minors, and found evidence that the practice is widespread.“When I was still in secondary school, so many teens discussed online jobs and how they joined using their parents' ID,” says one worker who joined Appen at 16 in Kenya, who asked to remain anonymous. After school, he and his friends would log on to complete annotation tasks late into the night, often for eight hours or more.Appen declined to give an attributable comment.“If we suspect a user has violated the User Agreement, Toloka will perform an identity check and request a photo ID and a photo of the user holding the ID,” Geo Dzhikaev, head of Toloka operations, says.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanGearCMF's Phone 1 Is Better Than Any $199 Smartphone Should Ever BeBy Julian ChokkattuThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyPoliticsStaffers Were Told Biden Was Leaving Race in Email Telling Them to Check XBy Makena KellyDriven by a global rush into AI, the global data labeling and collection industry is expected to grow to over $17.1 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research, a market research and consulting company. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Toloka, Appen, Clickworker, Teemwork.AI, and OneForma connect millions of remote gig workers in the global south to tech companies located in Silicon Valley. Platforms post micro-tasks from their tech clients, which have included Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Salesforce, Google, Nvidia, Boeing, and Adobe. Many platforms also partner with Microsoft’s own data services platform, the Universal Human Relevance System (UHRS).These workers are predominantly based in East Africa, Venezuela, Pakistan, India, and the Philippines—though there are even workers in refugee camps, who label, evaluate, and generate data. Workers are paid per task, with remuneration ranging from a cent to a few dollars—although the upper end is considered something of a rare gem, workers say. “The nature of the work often feels like digital servitude—but it's a necessity for earning a livelihood,” says Hassan, who also now works for Clickworker and Appen.Sometimes, workers are asked to upload audio, images, and videos, which contribute to the data sets used to train AI. Workers typically don’t know exactly how their submissions will be processed, but these can be pretty personal: On Clickworker’s worker jobs tab, one task states: “Show us you baby/child! Help to teach AI by taking 5 photos of your baby/child!” for €2 ($2.15). The next says: “Let your minor (aged 13-17) take part in an interesting selfie project!”Some tasks involve content moderation—helping AI distinguish between innocent content and that which contains violence, hate speech, or adult imagery. Hassan shared screen recordings of tasks available the day he spoke with WIRED. One UHRS task asked him to identify “fuck,” “c**t,” “dick,” and “bitch” from a body of text. For Toloka, he was shown pages upon pages of partially naked bodies, including sexualized images, lingerie ads, an exposed sculpture, and even a nude body from a Renaissance-style painting. The task? Decipher the adult from the benign, to help the algorithm distinguish between salacious and permissible torsos.Hassan recalls moderating content while under 18 on UHRS that, he says, continues to weigh on his mental health. He says the content was explicit: accounts of rape incidents, lifted from articles quoting court records; hate speech from social media posts; descriptions of murders from articles; sexualized images of minors; naked images of adult women; adult videos of women and girls from YouTube and TikTok.Many of the remote workers in Pakistan are underage, Hassan says. He conducted a survey of 96 respondents on a Telegram group chat with almost 10,000 UHRS workers, on behalf of WIRED. About a fifth said they were under 18.Awais, 20, from Lahore, who spoke on condition that his first name not be published, began working for UHRS via Clickworker at 16, after he promised his girlfriend a birthday trip to the turquoise lakes and snow-capped mountains of Pakistan’s northern region. His parents couldn’t help him with the money, so he turned to data work, joining using a friend’s ID card. “It was easy,” he says.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanGearCMF's Phone 1 Is Better Than Any $199 Smartphone Should Ever BeBy Julian ChokkattuThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyPoliticsStaffers Were Told Biden Was Leaving Race in Email Telling Them to Check XBy Makena KellyHe worked on the site daily, primarily completing Microsoft’s “Generic Scenario Testing Extension” task. This involved testing homepage and search engine accuracy. In other words, did selecting “car deals” on the MSN homepage bring up photos of cars? Did searching “cat” on Bing show feline images? He was earning $1 to $3 each day, but he found the work both monotonous and infuriating. At times he found himself working 10 hours for $1, because he had to do unpaid training to access certain tasks. Even when he passed the training, there might be no task to complete; or if he breached the time limit, they would suspend his account, he says. Then seemingly out of nowhere, he got banned from performing his most lucrative task—something workers say happens regularly. Bans can occur for a host of reasons, such as giving incorrect answers, answering too fast, or giving answers that deviate from the average pattern of other workers. He’d earned $70 in total. It was almost enough to take his high school sweetheart on the trip, so Awais logged off for good.Clickworker did not respond to requests for comment. Microsoft declined to comment.“In some instances, once a user finishes the training, the quota of responses has already been met for that project and the task is no longer available,” Dzhikaev said. “However, should other similar tasks become available, they will be able to participate without further training.”Researchers say they’ve found evidence of underage workers in the AI industry elsewhere in the world. Julian Posada, assistant professor of American Studies at Yale University, who studies human labor and data production in the AI industry, says that he’s met workers in Venezuela who joined platforms as minors.Bypassing age checks can be pretty simple. The most lenient platforms, like Clickworker and Toloka, simply ask workers to state they are over 18; the most secure, such as Remotasks, employ face recognition technology to match workers to their photo ID. But even that is fallible, says Posada, citing one worker who says he simply held the phone to his grandmother’s face to pass the checks. The sharing of a single account within family units is another way minors access the work, says Posada. He found that in some Venezuelan homes, when parents cook or run errands, children log on to complete tasks. He says that one family of six he met, with children as young as 13, all claimed to share one account. They ran their home like a factory, Posada says, so that two family members were at the computers working on data labeling at any given point. “Their backs would hurt because they have been sitting for so long. So they would take a break, and then the kids would fill in,” he says.The physical distances between the workers training AI and the tech giants at the other end of the supply chain—“the deterritorialization of the internet,” Posada calls it—creates a situation where whole workforces are essentially invisible, governed by a different set of rules, or by none.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanGearCMF's Phone 1 Is Better Than Any $199 Smartphone Should Ever BeBy Julian ChokkattuThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyPoliticsStaffers Were Told Biden Was Leaving Race in Email Telling Them to Check XBy Makena KellyThe lack of worker oversight can even prevent clients from knowing if workers are keeping their income. One Clickworker user in India, who requested anonymity to avoid being banned from the site, told WIRED he “employs” 17 UHRS workers in one office, providing them with a computer, mobile, and internet, in exchange for half their income. While his workers are aged between 18 and 20, due to Clickworker’s lack of age certification requirements, he knows of teenagers using the platform.In the more shadowy corners of the crowdsourcing industry, the use of child workers is overt.Captcha (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) solving services, where crowdsourcing platforms pay humans to solve captchas, are a less understood part in the AI ecosystem. Captchas are designed to distinguish a bot from a human—the most notable example being Google’s reCaptcha, which asks users to identify objects in images to enter a website. The exact purpose of services that pay people to solve them remains a mystery to academics, says Posada. “But what I can confirm is that many companies, including Google's reCaptcha, use these services to train AI models,” he says. “Thus, these workers indirectly contribute to AI advancements.”Google did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.There are at least 152 active services, mostly based in China, with more than half a million people working in the underground reCaptcha market, according to a 2019 study by researchers from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou.“Stable job for everyone. Everywhere,” one service, Kolotibablo, states on its website. The company has a promotional website dedicated to showcasing its worker testimonials, which includes images of young children from across the world. In one, a smiling Indonesian boy shows his 11th birthday cake to the camera. “I am very happy to be able to increase my savings for the future,” writes another, no older than 7 or 8. A 14-year-old girl in a long Hello Kitty dress shares a photo of her workstation: a laptop on a pink, Barbie-themed desk.Not every worker WIRED interviewed felt frustrated with the platforms. At 17, most of Younis Hamdeen’s friends were waiting tables. But the Pakistani teen opted to join UHRS via Appen instead, using the platform for three or four hours a day, alongside high school, earning up to $100 a month. Comparing products listed on Amazon was the most profitable task he encountered. “I love working for this platform,” Hamdeen, now 18, says, because he is paid in US dollars—which is rare in Pakistan—and so benefits from favorable exchange rates.But the fact that the pay for this work is incredibly low compared to the wages of in-house employees of the tech companies, and that the benefits of the work flow one way—from the global south to the global north, leads to uncomfortable parallels. “We do have to consider the type of colonialism that is being promoted with this type of work,” says the Civic AI Lab’s Savage.Hassan recently got accepted to a bachelor’s program in medical lab technology. The apps remain his sole income, working an 8 am to 6 pm shift, followed by 2 am to 6 am. However, his earnings have fallen to just $100 per month, as demand for tasks has outstripped supply, as more workers have joined since the pandemic.He laments that UHRS tasks can pay as little as 1 cent. Even on higher-paid jobs, such as occasional social media tasks on Appen, the amount of time he needs to spend doing unpaid research means he needs to work five or six hours to complete an hour of real-time work, all to earn $2, he says.“It’s digital slavery,” says Hassan.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

This data-labeling ranges from the simple—identifying images of street lamps, say, or comparing similar ecommerce products—to the deeply complex, such as content moderation, where workers classify harmful content within data scraped from all corners of the internet. These tasks are often outsourced to gig workers, via online crowdsourcing platforms such as Toloka, which was where Hassan started his career.
A friend put him on to the site, which promised work anytime, from anywhere. He found that an hour’s labor would earn him around $1 to $2, he says, more than the national minimum wage, which was about $0.26 at the time. His mother is a homemaker, and his dad is a mechanical laborer. “You can say I belong to a poor family,” he says. When the pandemic hit, he needed work more than ever. Confined to his home, online and restless, he did some digging, and found that Toloka was just the tip of the iceberg.
“AI is presented as a magical box that can do everything,” says Saiph Savage, director of Northeastern University’s Civic AI Lab. “People just simply don’t know that there are human workers behind the scenes.”
At least some of those human workers are children. Platforms require that workers be over 18, but Hassan simply entered a relative’s details and used a corresponding payment method to bypass the checks—and he wasn’t alone in doing so. WIRED spoke to three other workers in Pakistan and Kenya who said they had also joined platforms as minors, and found evidence that the practice is widespread.
“When I was still in secondary school, so many teens discussed online jobs and how they joined using their parents' ID,” says one worker who joined Appen at 16 in Kenya, who asked to remain anonymous. After school, he and his friends would log on to complete annotation tasks late into the night, often for eight hours or more.
Appen declined to give an attributable comment.
“If we suspect a user has violated the User Agreement, Toloka will perform an identity check and request a photo ID and a photo of the user holding the ID,” Geo Dzhikaev, head of Toloka operations, says.
Driven by a global rush into AI, the global data labeling and collection industry is expected to grow to over $17.1 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research, a market research and consulting company. Crowdsourcing platforms such as Toloka, Appen, Clickworker, Teemwork.AI, and OneForma connect millions of remote gig workers in the global south to tech companies located in Silicon Valley. Platforms post micro-tasks from their tech clients, which have included Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Salesforce, Google, Nvidia, Boeing, and Adobe. Many platforms also partner with Microsoft’s own data services platform, the Universal Human Relevance System (UHRS).
These workers are predominantly based in East Africa, Venezuela, Pakistan, India, and the Philippines—though there are even workers in refugee camps, who label, evaluate, and generate data. Workers are paid per task, with remuneration ranging from a cent to a few dollars—although the upper end is considered something of a rare gem, workers say. “The nature of the work often feels like digital servitude—but it's a necessity for earning a livelihood,” says Hassan, who also now works for Clickworker and Appen.
Sometimes, workers are asked to upload audio, images, and videos, which contribute to the data sets used to train AI. Workers typically don’t know exactly how their submissions will be processed, but these can be pretty personal: On Clickworker’s worker jobs tab, one task states: “Show us you baby/child! Help to teach AI by taking 5 photos of your baby/child!” for €2 ($2.15). The next says: “Let your minor (aged 13-17) take part in an interesting selfie project!”
Some tasks involve content moderation—helping AI distinguish between innocent content and that which contains violence, hate speech, or adult imagery. Hassan shared screen recordings of tasks available the day he spoke with WIRED. One UHRS task asked him to identify “fuck,” “c**t,” “dick,” and “bitch” from a body of text. For Toloka, he was shown pages upon pages of partially naked bodies, including sexualized images, lingerie ads, an exposed sculpture, and even a nude body from a Renaissance-style painting. The task? Decipher the adult from the benign, to help the algorithm distinguish between salacious and permissible torsos.
Hassan recalls moderating content while under 18 on UHRS that, he says, continues to weigh on his mental health. He says the content was explicit: accounts of rape incidents, lifted from articles quoting court records; hate speech from social media posts; descriptions of murders from articles; sexualized images of minors; naked images of adult women; adult videos of women and girls from YouTube and TikTok.
Many of the remote workers in Pakistan are underage, Hassan says. He conducted a survey of 96 respondents on a Telegram group chat with almost 10,000 UHRS workers, on behalf of WIRED. About a fifth said they were under 18.
Awais, 20, from Lahore, who spoke on condition that his first name not be published, began working for UHRS via Clickworker at 16, after he promised his girlfriend a birthday trip to the turquoise lakes and snow-capped mountains of Pakistan’s northern region. His parents couldn’t help him with the money, so he turned to data work, joining using a friend’s ID card. “It was easy,” he says.
He worked on the site daily, primarily completing Microsoft’s “Generic Scenario Testing Extension” task. This involved testing homepage and search engine accuracy. In other words, did selecting “car deals” on the MSN homepage bring up photos of cars? Did searching “cat” on Bing show feline images? He was earning $1 to $3 each day, but he found the work both monotonous and infuriating. At times he found himself working 10 hours for $1, because he had to do unpaid training to access certain tasks. Even when he passed the training, there might be no task to complete; or if he breached the time limit, they would suspend his account, he says. Then seemingly out of nowhere, he got banned from performing his most lucrative task—something workers say happens regularly. Bans can occur for a host of reasons, such as giving incorrect answers, answering too fast, or giving answers that deviate from the average pattern of other workers. He’d earned $70 in total. It was almost enough to take his high school sweetheart on the trip, so Awais logged off for good.
Clickworker did not respond to requests for comment. Microsoft declined to comment.
“In some instances, once a user finishes the training, the quota of responses has already been met for that project and the task is no longer available,” Dzhikaev said. “However, should other similar tasks become available, they will be able to participate without further training.”
Bypassing age checks can be pretty simple. The most lenient platforms, like Clickworker and Toloka, simply ask workers to state they are over 18; the most secure, such as Remotasks, employ face recognition technology to match workers to their photo ID. But even that is fallible, says Posada, citing one worker who says he simply held the phone to his grandmother’s face to pass the checks. The sharing of a single account within family units is another way minors access the work, says Posada. He found that in some Venezuelan homes, when parents cook or run errands, children log on to complete tasks. He says that one family of six he met, with children as young as 13, all claimed to share one account. They ran their home like a factory, Posada says, so that two family members were at the computers working on data labeling at any given point. “Their backs would hurt because they have been sitting for so long. So they would take a break, and then the kids would fill in,” he says.
The physical distances between the workers training AI and the tech giants at the other end of the supply chain—“the deterritorialization of the internet,” Posada calls it—creates a situation where whole workforces are essentially invisible, governed by a different set of rules, or by none.
The lack of worker oversight can even prevent clients from knowing if workers are keeping their income. One Clickworker user in India, who requested anonymity to avoid being banned from the site, told WIRED he “employs” 17 UHRS workers in one office, providing them with a computer, mobile, and internet, in exchange for half their income. While his workers are aged between 18 and 20, due to Clickworker’s lack of age certification requirements, he knows of teenagers using the platform.
In the more shadowy corners of the crowdsourcing industry, the use of child workers is overt.
Captcha (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) solving services, where crowdsourcing platforms pay humans to solve captchas, are a less understood part in the AI ecosystem. Captchas are designed to distinguish a bot from a human—the most notable example being Google’s reCaptcha, which asks users to identify objects in images to enter a website. The exact purpose of services that pay people to solve them remains a mystery to academics, says Posada. “But what I can confirm is that many companies, including Google's reCaptcha, use these services to train AI models,” he says. “Thus, these workers indirectly contribute to AI advancements.”
Google did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
There are at least 152 active services, mostly based in China, with more than half a million people working in the underground reCaptcha market, according to a 2019 study by researchers from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou.
“Stable job for everyone. Everywhere,” one service, Kolotibablo, states on its website. The company has a promotional website dedicated to showcasing its worker testimonials, which includes images of young children from across the world. In one, a smiling Indonesian boy shows his 11th birthday cake to the camera. “I am very happy to be able to increase my savings for the future,” writes another, no older than 7 or 8. A 14-year-old girl in a long Hello Kitty dress shares a photo of her workstation: a laptop on a pink, Barbie-themed desk.
Not every worker WIRED interviewed felt frustrated with the platforms. At 17, most of Younis Hamdeen’s friends were waiting tables. But the Pakistani teen opted to join UHRS via Appen instead, using the platform for three or four hours a day, alongside high school, earning up to $100 a month. Comparing products listed on Amazon was the most profitable task he encountered. “I love working for this platform,” Hamdeen, now 18, says, because he is paid in US dollars—which is rare in Pakistan—and so benefits from favorable exchange rates.
But the fact that the pay for this work is incredibly low compared to the wages of in-house employees of the tech companies, and that the benefits of the work flow one way—from the global south to the global north, leads to uncomfortable parallels. “We do have to consider the type of colonialism that is being promoted with this type of work,” says the Civic AI Lab’s Savage.
Hassan recently got accepted to a bachelor’s program in medical lab technology. The apps remain his sole income, working an 8 am to 6 pm shift, followed by 2 am to 6 am. However, his earnings have fallen to just $100 per month, as demand for tasks has outstripped supply, as more workers have joined since the pandemic.
He laments that UHRS tasks can pay as little as 1 cent. Even on higher-paid jobs, such as occasional social media tasks on Appen, the amount of time he needs to spend doing unpaid research means he needs to work five or six hours to complete an hour of real-time work, all to earn $2, he says.
“It’s digital slavery,” says Hassan.",,"Companies that provide Big Tech with AI data-labeling services are inadvertently hiring young teens to work on their platforms, often exposing them to traumatic content.",,,

Artificial Intelligence Referees: Offsides and Out of Bounds
Posted by berryht1 on Monday, November 13, 2023 in  Blog Posts.
By Benjamin Dias 
Popcorn spills as the group collectively leaps from the couch to scream at the TV. You hear a cacophony of explicit phrases and derisive language. “Use your eyes!” “How do you call that?!” “Someone paid the ref!” This scene could easily describe fans across the world as they watch football, baseball, basketball, or even tennis. Inextricably linked to any sports competition is the notion of fairness. In any sport, athletes are constrained to the defined rules of their game—no matter how broad or narrow that rule is. Referees and umpires (collectively referred to here as referees) adjudicate these rules in real time to facilitate game management, diagnose rule infractions, and promote player safety.[1]
Referees are human and are therefore subject to human error. While a minor mistake—an errant call, a missed call, or a misinterpretation of an unimportant rule—has a nominal effect on a match, sometimes blown calls alter games and entire seasons.[2] The margin of error for referees seems to shrink over time. For example, recent advances in replay technology enables referees to confirm whether a football player scores touchdown or secures a turnover,[3] a basketball player shoots before the shot clock expires,[4] or a baseball player beat a throw to first base.[5] Although replay review creates more accurate calls, it also contributes to controversy. Referees make on-the-field calls and utilize a pseudo-legal standard, “substantial evidence,” to overturn field calls.  With widespread access to slow-motion replay, fans can review the most minute details of quick interactions and debate whether the videos provide sufficient evidence to overturn the referee’s visceral judgment. Often, fans come to a different conclusion that the officials.
Technological improvement has given birth to greater social scrutiny of referee performance. Beyond replay review, Sports Governing Organizations (“SGOs”) like the National Football League (“NFL”), National Basketball Association (“NBA”), and Major League Baseball (“MLB”) have implemented various camera angles, dedicated replay officers, and trained rules analysts to ensure each game complies with official rulebooks. Still, errors occur. Sports fans and players alike call upon SGOs to replace core referee functions with Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) to improve officiating accuracy.[6] Sports like tennis and soccer have already applied some degree of artificial intelligence technology in VAR and Hawk Eye to enhance refereeing.[7] SGOs and engineers have begun developing AI tools to police whether a pitcher tosses a ball or strike,[8] or whether a basketball player commits a foul.[9] Similar technology could be feasibly adapted for automatic ball-spotting functions in football.[10]
Although SGOs could develop and apply AI technology to supplant core refereeing functions, this blog post cautions against rapid integration out of concern for three distinct categories of legal ramifications.
First, SGOs applying AI technology would feed into the current social narrative that SGOs fix matches, violating anti-racketeering legislation.[11] Congress has long sought to inhibit racketeering in professional sports,[12] but recently, states have nullified federal sports gambling laws, enabling sportsbooks to exist and advertise on television. SGOS derive pecuniary benefits from these advertisements, increasing their incentive to engage in match-fixing. Human referees serve as an inherent barrier to match-fixing because involving more people in SGOs match-fixing schemes increases the chances for leaks. Supplanting human referees with AI that SGOs can manipulate increases the likelihood that SGOs would engage in match-fixing. At a minimum, replacing humans with AI referees would supercharge the social narratives around SGOs and match-fixing, likely culminating in stringent government regulation of AI in the sports industry.
Second, emerging studies indicate a rational fear of algorithmic discrimination where AI predicts biased outcomes utilizing biased data.[13] Algorithms like AI require data to predict realistic outcomes, but sometimes, that data is biased. Algorithmic discrimination—whether malignant or benign—appears ubiquitously across industries who adopted AI tools early like criminal law,[14] health care,[15] and employment hiring practices.[16] If historical biases, like racial biases in penalty rates, exist in human refereeing, these errors would compound under AI and result in discriminatory officiating. Presumptively, discriminatory applications of AI referees would expose SGOs to employment discrimination lawsuits for violating Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations on discharge and discipline.
Third, referees play a significant role in mitigating on-field health and safety issues. Replacing referees with AI could result in a failure by SGOs to uphold their (often contractual) duties to protect player safety.[17] By nature, sports are competitions that pit athletes against each other in a zero-sum, winner-takes-all game. Athletes and fans sometimes succumb to their passions resulting in “chippy” game atmospheres. SGOs expect referees to both enforce rules and prevent athlete and viewer passion from boiling over into all-out brawls. SGOs equip referees with various mechanisms like penalties, warnings, and ejections, to quell aggressive behavior. If SGOs replace human referees with an AI alternative, they knowingly remove an important entity responsible for preventing fights. Assumedly, AI referees would not be able to discern “unnecessary roughness,” “excessive celebration,” or an “intentional hit by pitch” penalties from typical in-game actions. Without shifting the fight prevention responsibility to other human entities, SGOs risk breaching their duty to safeguard the health and safety of their athletes.
Ultimately, although AI technology would likely improve the accuracy and quality of officiating, SGOs should pump the breaks on rapid integration. Legal concerns surrounding racketeering, discrimination, and employment safety highlight the need for more research before adopting available technology to wholly replace human referees. If SGOs remain keen on developing AI tools to improve officiating accuracy, the best solution would be to implement a hybrid system where human referees partner with AI referees to enhance penalty accuracy without sacrificing a core human element in sports. Considering legal liabilities, AI referees should remain technology of the future until sufficient measures are taken to address the racketeering stigma, algorithmic discrimination, and health and safety concerns involved with full adoption.

Should You Use A.I. to Apply for Jobs?

What if you could apply for thousands of jobs with a single mouse-click?

That dream is driving a new generation of A.I.-powered startups that allow job candidates to apply for jobs with a minimum of time and effort. A recent article in Wired breaks down how these companies will use their trained bots to help applicants write and send applications to jobs that meet certain criteria. 

According to Wired, a software engineer named Julian Joseph recently used one such tool, called LazyApply, to apply for 1,000 jobs in less than a day. Eventually, LazyApply would fire off 5,000 applications on Joseph’s behalf, earning 20 interviews. “Compared to the 20 interviews he’d landed after manually applying to 200 to 300 jobs, the success rate was dismal,” the article continued. “But given the time Job GPT saved, Joseph felt it was worth the investment.”

These kinds of stories spark the inevitable question: is it worth entrusting a critical part of your job hunt—crafting your application materials and sending them off to a recruiter or HR specialist—to an A.I.?

The Upside of A.I. of A.I.-Powered Job Applications

Over the past several years, the process of applying for jobs has become exponentially more complicated. Many companies force you to upload your resume and fill out a redundant online form breaking down your skills and experience. Automated resume software may delete your perfectly acceptable resume because you didn’t include the right selection of keywords. And poorly written job postings and documentation can make it difficult to determine what an employer actually wants out of a candidate.

At first glance, bots that apply for jobs might seem like the perfect antidote to this aggravating situation. Who wouldn’t want a virtual assistant who finds the best jobs and fires off applications in the time it takes to make a decent cup of coffee? Just think of what you could do with the time savings.

However, there are a number of downsides to this A.I. revolution—and those could ultimately hurt your chances of landing the job of your dreams.

The Inevitable Downside of A.I.-Powered Job Applications

There’s something to be said about quality over quantity.

It’s worth seeing things from the perspective of the (human) recruiter or hiring manager who, at a certain point, will read your resume and application. They’ll want to know why you want this specific job. How do the job’s requirements align with your past experience and skillset? Why are you interested in this job over a thousand others?

For all of its potential benefits, generative A.I. lacks context and awareness; it doesn’t know which elements of your experience are more relevant to a particular job, and it can’t determine whether listing one skill over another would impress a hiring manager more. Although 46 percent of job seekers are already using ChatGPT to generate a resume or cover letter (according to one survey from earlier this year), just relying on a A.I.-generated resume or cover letter usually won’t yield results: you need to customize such documents to both the job and your background, or the potential employer will reject it as too generic.

Plus, when you “hand apply” to different positions, you have time to check your grammar, spelling, and whether you’re inputting the right information into the right fields. All of those things can boost your chances of landing an interview.

The actors’ guild concluded a nearly four-month long strike last week after finally reaching a deal with major Hollywood studios securing protections for actors against artificial intelligence, but some SAG-AFTRA members who feel the terms of the deal don’t go far enough are urging colleagues to vote no.

Key Facts


SAG-AFTRA, the actors’ union that represents 160,000 entertainment industry professionals, concluded the longest strike in its history on Thursday after 118 days, which was prolonged by disagreements between the union and studios over artificial intelligence.



The SAG-AFTRA board approved the new contract with 86% of board members voting in favor, though it still has to be ratified by the union’s full membership.



The union released a summary of the deal Monday, which contains protections including mandatory consent from performers, or from representatives of deceased performers, to create a “digital replica” of an actor.



Performers must also be paid for the days they would have had to work in person if their digital replica is being used and background actors must be paid if their replicas are used as principal characters.


Actors will be owed residual payments, which compensate performers when their work is rebroadcast or reused, when their digital replicas are used onscreen.


Employers must also receive consent from performers to use their likenesses in a project for which they were not employed, or to digitally alter their performances.


The agreement also allows employers to create “synthetic performers,” which are nonhuman and artificially generated, though consent from performers is required if the synthetic performer’s facial features are recognizable as a real actor.

Chief Critics
Actress Justine Bateman, who was an AI adviser to the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee, garnered attention for a 29-post thread on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which she voiced concerns over the language used regarding artificial intelligence. Bateman criticized what she considered loopholes in the proposed contract, including an exception for studios to use digital doubles without consent “when the photography or sound track remains substantially as scripted, performed and/or recorded,” which she said is vague and will be up to a studio’s interpretation. Bateman also criticized another exception, which allows employers to use digital doubles without a performer’s consent when the project is “comment, criticism, scholarship, satire or parody, a docudrama, or historical or biographical work.” Actors may find themselves in a “project you never consented to, doing things you never were informed of, for no compensation at all,” Bateman stated. She called the “synthetic performer” clause the most serious issue, stating it is “baffling that a union representing human actors would give approval of those same actors being replaced by an AI Object.” Actress Katja Herbers posted on X the contract should define performers as human beings to separate them from “synthetic performers,” and said a reliance on nonhuman performers will diminish opportunities for film crew members since AI-generated performers will not need makeup, hair or costume workers. Several actors, including Kellen Goff, Jessie Pridemore and Belsheber Rusape Jr. posted on X they will vote no on the deal because of the AI terms and urged fellow actors to do the same. Some actors, including Francesca Monet Calo, voiced concerns on social media that actors may be pressured to give consent for AI usage for fear of not being hired otherwise. “‘Ensuring whether the actors have the RIGHT to say no’ does not protect the actors once they DO say no,” Calo posted.
Contra
In a Monday Zoom meeting for SAG-AFTRA members, union president Fran Drescher condemned “naysayers who have exploited this momentum of ours,” accusing opponents of the deal of trying to “tear down what was being done in the negotiating committee.” Lead negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland defended the deal and stated any contract that forbids the use of AI altogether would have been unfeasible. Drescher also criticized members who plan to vote “no” on the deal based on a single issue, which would be “detrimental to the greater good,” stating these members are overlooking other benefits of the contract.
PROMOTED
Key Background
The months-long actors and writers strikes were both largely held up by concerns over AI. SAG-AFTRA pushed back against studio proposals that would have allowed employers to use likenesses of deceased performers without the consent of their estates or the union, and the union pushed for compensation when AI scans of actors are re-used. The writers strike ended in September after securing protections that allows writers, but does not compel them, to use AI and prevents AI-generated writing from being considered “literary material,” meaning AI will not receive screenwriter credits over the actual writers.
What To Watch For
Whether SAG-AFTRA members will vote to ratify the contract. Voting reportedly begins Tuesday. If the contract is rejected, the strike will resume. SAG-AFTRA has reportedly never rejected a contract before.

By Navneet Singh, Founder & CEO of AVSAR
In the dynamic landscape of the global economy, the inexorable advance of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation is ushering in a new era, and India finds itself on the front lines of this transformative wave. This technological surge is not merely altering the job market; it’s fundamentally reshaping the very nature of employment, presenting an intricate tapestry of opportunities and challenges.
Automation’s Unveiling Impact
At the heart of this revolution lies the automation of mundane tasks. Jobs characterised by repetition and rule-based functions are progressively being assumed by machines, heralding efficiency gains but also prompting the obsolescence of traditional roles. Industries like manufacturing, data entry, and customer service are witnessing a discernible shift toward automation, compelling a reevaluation of jobs once deemed the bedrock of employment.
However, the story doesn’t end with job displacement. It unfolds with job creation. AI and automation are fostering the emergence of new roles and industries, necessitating a workforce equipped with skills aligned to the evolving technological landscape. Professions in AI development, machine learning, robotics, and data analysis are experiencing a surge in demand, emphasising the need for professionals with a specialised skill set.
India’s Tech Odyssey Continues
India, with its burgeoning tech industry, stands at the forefront of this transformative wave. The Information Technology (IT) sector, a linchpin of the country’s employment ecosystem, is undergoing a paradigm shift. While routine coding and testing functions face automation, there’s a burgeoning demand for AI specialists, cybersecurity experts, and professionals adept at crafting and maintaining intricate algorithms.
Further, the transformative impact extends beyond the tech sector, permeating into healthcare, finance, and agriculture. AI is revolutionising healthcare diagnostics, streamlining financial transactions, and optimizing precision in agriculture. This promises not only increased efficiency and innovation but also necessitates a robust commitment to reskilling and upskilling to align the workforce with the demands of these emerging fields.
The Gig Economy and Flexibility
The surge of the gig economy stands as another testament to the influence of AI and automation. AI driven platforms offer unprecedented flexibility, from ride-sharing to freelancing opportunities in programming and content creation. Individuals now have a myriad of avenues for income generation. However, this shift raises pertinent questions about job security and the imperative need for comprehensive social safety nets in this evolving employment landscape.
Re-skilling for the Future
Effectively addressing the impact of AI and automation on the job market demands a holistic approach to education and skill development. As industries metamorphose, a dynamic and adaptable workforce becomes imperative. Educational institutions and training programs must recalibrate their curricula to synchronise with the emerging demands of the job market, emphasising not only technical skills but also critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability.
Moreover, a collaborative effort between the government and the private sector is indispensable to facilitate this transition. Initiatives promoting digital literacy, providing accessible training programs, and supporting research and development in emerging technologies are vital components of preparing the workforce for the future.
Embracing Change for a Brighter Tomorrow
In summation, the transformative impact of artificial intelligence and automation on India’s job market is both profound and multifaceted. While certain jobs confront challenges induced by automation, new opportunities and industries are burgeoning. The crux lies in embracing change, fostering a culture of continuous learning, and preparing the workforce for a future where collaboration between humans and machines defines the new world of work.
This transformative journey necessitates concerted efforts from all stakeholders to ensure a seamless transition and a future where technology enriches, rather than diminishes, the employment landscape. As India strides through this tech-savvy era, adaptation and innovation will emerge as the cornerstones of a future where the workforce not only survives but thrives in the age of artificial intelligence and automation.
