You want success over the coming months and years? The number-one way to get there is through people — building businesses through their creativity, passion, and full participation in decision-making.


But right behind empowered people is the number-two vital ingredient for success: data. Data that can reveal to you what your customers want, how your business is running, and what’s around the corner. Now, we have the key that unlocks the patterns that have long been hidden away in databases and applications. The question is: are we paying enough to the care and feeding of this data?

“Some may think it’s a magical line of code that all of a sudden makes a process much faster,” says Moses Guttmann, CEO and co-founder of ClearML. “But in reality, AI requires meaningful data to make noticeable improvements and drive commercial innovation.”

PROMOTED
It turns out that data may even be a finite resource. One study out of Aston University predicts that we’re quickly running out of storage space for all the data being generated. Plus, there’s even the specter of running out of general training data, as recently reported by MIT Technology Review’s Tammy Xu.

But let’s keep things at the enterprise level for now, where lack of data is already proving to be the most vexing roadblock to AI. Succeeding with AI requires “availability and access to data; and understanding how to apply that data to specific use cases to improve business outcomes,” says Umesh Sachdev, co-founder and CEO at Uniphore.

Successful AI “requires data diversity,’ says IDC analyst Ritu Jyoti in a report from earlier in 2022. “Similarly, the full transformative impact of AI can be realized by using a wide range of data types. Adding layers of data can improve accuracy of models and the eventual impact of applications. For example, a consumer's basic demographic data provides a rough sketch of that person. If you add more context such as marital status, education, employment, income, and preferences like music and food choices, a more complete picture starts to form. With additional insights from recent purchases, current location, and other life events, the portrait really comes to life.”

To enable AI to scale and proliferate across the enterprise, “stakeholders must ensure a solid data foundation that enables the full cycle of data management, embrace advanced analytical methods to realize the untapped value of data,” says Shub Bhowmick, co-founder and CEO of Tredence.
“In terms of data availability and access, businesses need a way to parse through huge tracts of data and surface what’s relevant for a particular application,” says Sachdev. “Is the data easily contained and categorized? Is there enough relevant data to form a meaningful assessment? Consider virtual learning — do educators have enough relevant data from student interactions to make meaningful adjustments to how classroom content is taught?”
A quality dataset “is crucial to supporting successful AI, as models are only as good as the data put into them,” says Guttmann. “This idea of data quality is an important part of having a solution that delivers consistent results, and this also needs to be understood ahead of adoption. Not enough decision makers understand that AI is a never-ending process and also that as the data changes, the AI needs to adopt those changes in tandem.”
For most businesses today, “it is a struggle to tap the immense value present in the data they generate daily,” says Bhowmick. “Hence integrating sufficient business context and change management practices is critical to get the interplay between scale and innovation right. Businesses can have a tangible, measurable impact on their bottom line by using the right data models to operationalize their AI investments. Building an AI-led connected intelligence has never been more cohesive, from demand forecasting and stock alerts to IoT-based remote monitoring for patients. That's just one of the many ways businesses realize AI investments' benefits — by connecting insights to action and value.”
IDC’s Jyoti makes the following recommendations to strengthen the data backbone essential for AI:


Enable data from both internal and external sources. “Machine learning models need the most relevant data, which may not always be inside the organization,” Jyoti points out. “Internal data only allows companies to see their own operations or customer information. That doesn't provide a complete picture. Companies need access to secure data sharing. Create a workflow for bringing in third-party and or net-new data sources into the organization, including testing, buying, and seamless integration with existing internal data sets and processes.”
Bring in data expertise. “Build a talent pool of industry domain and technical experts like data engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers.”
Develop a data strategy. “Get employee buy-in and trust for the data strategy with inclusivity and transparency,” Jyoti advises. “Embrace an intelligent data grid that helps automate and enforce universal data and usage policies across multicloud ecosystems. The grid also should “automate how data is discovered, cataloged, and enriched for users,” as well as “automate how to access, update, and unify data spread across distributed data and cloud landscapes without the need of doing any data movement or replication.”

Elon Musk has been promising to introduce fully autonomous driving features in his Tesla vehicles for the last eight years. Significant progress has been made in this direction, primarily by businesses other than Tesla. But it's still too far off in the future to be drinking chai as an autopilot takes us from Marina Beach to Mylapore..On another front, we could have made fantastic — or, depending on how you look at it, horrifying — progress. Today, AI is capable of writing competent code, creating protein structures and product strategies, writing scripts, picturing our pathetic bodies as ripped superhero avatars, creating cinema, and performing music. All this in a fraction of the time it would take a professional using modern tools to be only somewhat skilled. Your daughter Paromita, who plans to work in software engineering, may have a better employment outlook than your plumber Perumal, according to recent news reports. So, Generative AI is about to make your job obsolete, maybe or maybe not?.This decade will go down in AI history with the emergence of generative AI technology. This nebulous phrase distinguishes AI models that produce writing, music, and visuals from those that make judgments or predictions..The generative AI models for text and images that have been introduced this year are more than competent. The Gofundme initiative to safeguard artists against AI technology, which last week alone collected US$150,000, serves as proof. For example, a survey from the World Economic Forum predicted that by 2025, machines will eliminate 85 million jobs while also creating 97 million new employment roles..Whole jobs are seldom eliminated by technology. Technologies just automate tasks and lessen the labor-intensive aspects of jobs in practice. An acre of land was once daily ploughed by a farmer and his oxen. The same farmer can now plow 15 acres in the same amount of time with a tractor. Knowledge labor will have a comparable rate of productivity growth thanks to generative AI systems. Additionally, they will make some equipment and abilities outdated in the process. Increased employment frequently results from such productivity improvements and the accompanying profit. In the US, this was the situation. In 11 occupations that are thought to be at risk from AI, employment rates increased on average by 13% between 2008 and 2018..Additionally, brand-new employment categories are created by new technology. Before the airplane, there were no pilots. It is difficult to predict what new job categories generative AI will ultimately produce. Many ideas motivate engineering, one of which may be determining the best approach to convey your objective to an AI. I'm not convinced. First, this function is more analogous to a psychologist, as Andrej Karpathy, an AI researcher, has noted. Second, all we want is another AI that converts sentences from everyday language into more detailed prompt inquiries that generative AI models like. Therefore, don't waste your time honing talents for a job you'll never have..To comprehend how future humans and AI would cooperate on cognitive activities, some have proposed a three-step procedure. The demand originates from humans, who then consult an AI system for a list of choices, choose the best fit, and further modify it to suit their needs. This framework is useful. But take note that the structure of cognitive value generation in institutions is not changing as a result of AI..In the future, there might not be much of a reason to hire and train young employees. The children, though, I believe will be well. The paradigm of how one gains expertise currently exists is going to be destroyed. We urgently need to revamp both our established job pathways and our educational institutions. ChatGPT creates MBA essays with a B+ mark on specialized subjects like relational contracts. Teachers in high schools and professors in colleges are about to have a bad surprise..How can Humanity Survive in a Future Dominated by AI?.The solution is to develop your humanity. Workplace value will increase for traits like agency, dedication, empathy, and perserverance. The drawback is that we frequently develop these qualities in our first employment. Because it is practically hard to start as junior staff, I'm not sure where we may get them..Thoughtfully considering your clients and co-workers, your profession, and its role in the world, and learning the finer points of its knowledge base should serve as a general prescription for success for everyone. As a software developer, writing boilerplate code won't get you very far. Start learning about algorithmic complexity, delay, and clear abstractions instead. There will generally be less of a need to put up with the shrewd but volatile sorts on the job. Therefore, perhaps a little humility and friendship are required for those of us with white-collar occupations. The generative AI celebration is just getting started, and it will be eccentric..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Companies, commentators and even sci-fi movies can't stop talking about artificial intelligence (AI).Indeed, AI in the real world is far from the artificial intelligence villains you might recall from your favorite sci-fi flick.This article will break down what artificial intelligence is, how it works and how it's used in the real world. It will also explore AI technology's benefits and potential downsides now and in the near future.



Artificial intelligence explainedArtificial intelligence is the computer simulation of human intelligence. It's programming one or more machines to act in a way that mimics or replicates human behavior. AI breakthroughs are tied to computer science and programming languages, and applications of AI are scalable to simplify workflows across various industries.Depending on the AI program or software used, it can more or less act similarly to someone doing the same task when viewed from the outside as an observer.In general, AI is about creating software that is ""smart"" enough to do complex tasks without excessive human intervention or direction.Indeed, AI researchers want to program computers to rationalize and think semi-independently. In this way, AI computers and software will likely be able to solve problems faster and better than humans can.Artificial intelligence is closely connected to machine learning models, a technology that allows machines and computer programs to learn from and adapt the data without human assistance.For example, a software program could be created (in theory) to run several tests, take the results from those tests, and come to conclusions or better processes without a human having to interfere or direct it.


Artificial intelligence is not about building anything you may have seen in science-fiction stories, like killer robots, war machines and similar constructions. Rather, it's usually about maximizing efficiency, productivity and profit. Most AI research and AI development focus on use cases in the financial, business, supply chain, cybersecurity and healthcare industries.Related: 3 Ways Machine Learning Can Help Entrepreneurs What does AI really mean?For most people, AI means that computers are becoming more intelligent and capable without human direction.It's all based on the idea that human intelligence can be defined and then mimicked so that software can reliably emulate it, even to the point where humans can't tell whether they are talking to a machine or a real person.In some cases, this is already true. Many people get fooled by ordinary customer service chatbot messaging or similar intelligent systems, which have enough preprogrammed sentences and responses that they can feel relatively lifelike.However, AI researchers and machine learning software programmers are focused more on making types of artificial intelligence that can do more profound, more complex work and emulate human intelligence more comprehensively.In a certain sense, humanity has reached the pinnacle of simple machine technology and inventions. With machines that can do precise tasks and carry out complex commands (if programmed correctly), the next phase in machine development is creativity, initiative and complex ""thought.""This doesn't mean that AI will replace humans in all aspects, nor will artificial intelligence spell the end of the human race. It does, however, mean that many new technological advancements could be in the future.


These AI system advancements include:Neural networks that mimic the activity of the human brain.Deep learning algorithms.Natural language processing and speech recognition AI algorithms.New ways to automate systems.Decision-making capabilities.Real-time computer vision overlays or screens.Related: 5 Ways Artificial Intelligence Is Already Influencing Your Daily Life and You Don't Even Know It Why is AI important?In a practical sense, artificial intelligence is essential for various specific goals and objectives.For example, artificial intelligence software may allow enterprises to understand the enormous quantities of data they collect on their target consumers and customers. In this way, businesses can make better decisions about their marketing campaigns, their products and much more.Alternatively, artificial intelligence could be critical because AI-powered machines could do some tasks better than humans, especially when it comes to repetitive or detailed-oriented tasks.For instance, a computer can read mountains of legal documents much more quickly and accurately than even the savviest legal mind, and it can come to some conclusions to provide to lawyers later on.AI is important because:It represents the ability to improve or innovate in industries without much innovation.It may allow humans to exceed current productive capacities even further, meaning more significant profits and more efficient production for businesses and industries.Related: What Is AI, Anyway? Know Your Stuff With This Go-To Guide


How does artificial intelligence work?AI works, in essence, like this:A programmer writes a software program using complex, comprehensive and clever language.That software program includes the capability to ""learn"" from experience, usually by recording event outcomes and changing its behavior in response. This is essentially what machine learning is.The software program then tailors its behavior according to its experience, its predictions for future events and what it needs to do.AI programming uses separate cognition skills to facilitate this behavior. Learning processes allow the AI program to acquire data and make rules for using that data to do actions.Artificial intelligence programs use reasoning processes to use suitable algorithms and reach specific objectives or outcomes. Self-correction processes are leveraged to rework or fine-tune algorithms and constantly strive for more accurate or desirable results.Naturally, this software process is highly complex and resource intensive. Therefore, artificial intelligence technology is only possible in specific contexts and for certain organizations.Generally, real AI (as far as it has been developed) is only available to large enterprises and institutions like the government. AI technology uses specially designed hardware, such as special chips, servers and processors, to facilitate its actions.In theory, as technology and hardware get better, and people develop new ways to write software creatively, the capabilities of artificial intelligence will continue to grow and expand.Artificial intelligence typesTechnically, artificial intelligence can be classified into several different types. The two broadest types are:Narrow or weak AI. Narrow AI is artificial intelligence designed to complete or accommodate very specific tasks. Some examples of limited artificial intelligence include weather app assistants, chatbots and other digital aids, as well as specialized software intended to analyze data and optimize business functions.General or strong AI. General artificial intelligence is closer to the imagined version of AI in sci-fi flicks. It's not yet fully realized, but it's intended to be more versatile and flexible than its narrow counterpart. In theory, general AI can do anything necessary, not just one or two tasks very well.However, artificial intelligence can also be categorized differently based upon intended function and specific capabilities. These types include:


Reactive AI uses algorithms to optimize objectives or outputs based on specified inputs from human users. Examples include chess-playing AIs.Limited memory AI adapts to past experiences and updates itself based on new data or observations. Examples include autonomous vehicles (or the programs that drive them).Theory of mind AI is supposedly fully adaptive and can learn from past experiences. It includes some of the most advanced chatbots that can pass the Turing Test (named after the inventor of the computer, Alan Turing), though they are not self-aware. The Turing Test classifies any machine capable of engaging in conversation with a human without being detected as a machine as demonstrating human intelligence.Self-aware AI is theoretically conscious and aware of its existence, like humans. Self-aware AI has yet to be created.How can artificial intelligence be used?There are practically no limits to how you can use AI solutions as they are developed and implemented in organizations.Nowadays, AI gets used in various industries, and not just as publicity machines like IBM's Deep Blue or Watson, which famously won a game of Jeopardy! as an artificial general intelligence.Related: 5 Ways Artificial Intelligence Is Radically Transforming Creativity in Business HealthcareIn the healthcare industry, artificial intelligence is used to assist with healthcare diagnostics, such as identifying diseases or ailments in patients. That's because AI can often rival humans at locating and identifying anomalies or issues in diagnostic scans.In the healthcare industry, AI is also helpfully utilized to track and maintain patient records, handle health insurance claims and even classify hospital patients quickly and efficiently.Driving and machine operationAutonomous vehicles like those from Tesla also heavily use modern artificial intelligence programs.With self-driving cars, AI may eventually learn from other drivers, fine-tune its own safety practices and drive more safely than even the most experienced human, all while maintaining faster response times due to its computerized nature.In addition, the manufacturing and industrial sectors often use limited machine learning or AI software to operate machines requiring incredible precision and repetition.


Related: What's Under the 'Hood' of Self-Driving Cars? Financial applicationsThe financial industry can use artificial intelligence to analyze stocks, market trends and other economic activity, thus allowing brokers and fund managers to make better decisions on behalf of their clients. This is similar to algorithmic trading and has been increasingly common in recent years.AI is good at this because it can take a lot of information, analyze it quickly and come to accurate conclusions based on past data sets. AI uses expert systems to improve pricing and similar actions over time.GamingYou can use artificial intelligence programs to make gaming bots or nonplayer characters, also known as NPCs. AI intelligence is getting better in this arena all the time — modern bots can simulate some of the motions or behaviors of human players very realistically by simulating the human mind.Related: 3 Surprising Ways That Video Game Companies Leverage AI User assistanceNaturally, artificial intelligence programs are already being used for general user assistance purposes, such as Amazon Alexa. Siri, Cortana, and other basic AI programs will likely become even more sophisticated and intelligent as time goes on.Virtual assistants are already among the most commonly used types of AI computer systems and maybe eventually replace personal assistants.Data analysisYou can use artificial intelligence for general data analysis across various industries. Many large organizations already leverage machine learning or AI platforms and programs to understand their data sets. Google famously uses artificial intelligence to understand its billions of users' queries and search patterns.


The benefits of AIMany people are excited for artificial intelligence technology to grow even further, primarily because of its potential advantages.For example, artificial intelligence programs tend to be much better at detail-oriented jobs than humans, as there is less of a chance that these programs would miss details due to fatigue or human error. This can significantly reduce the time needed for data-heavy tasks, and artificial intelligence programs are already better at analyzing big chunks of data than humans.In addition, AI can deliver more consistent results with fewer errors than human counterparts. Machines like AI don't break or make mathematical errors as often as humans, plain and simple.Some businesses are also looking into AI to replace specific jobs because AI-powered chatbots, virtual agents and customer service agents are always available 24/7, allowing them to respond to customer complaints quickly and easily, around the clock.In a broad sense, AI will allow businesses to make more money, save more and deliver better customer results. The same is true for hospitals, governments and other large organizations that have a lot to do and rely on taking advantage of big data sets.Related: AI Gives Outdated Industries a Makeover The downsides of AIThat all said, AI does have some downsides that it needs to overcome.For starters, artificial intelligence is universally expensive. This is why only some organizations, like the U.S. government, Google and other big enterprises, can fully take advantage of its technology and benefits.


In addition, AI usually requires deep technical expertise to leverage it effectively. This requires having the staff on hand to use, edit and repair AI software or technology from time to time, which only adds to its operating expenses.Furthermore, since AI is still relatively unproven and still being developed, only a limited number of workers have the qualifications to build AI tools or monitor AI programs.Since artificial intelligence hasn't reached its full potential, it can't maintain or repair itself, meaning it is liable to have issues or ""break down"" in specific contexts.Given all these flaws, it's no surprise why artificial intelligence hasn't yet taken over many industries and sectors, despite its purported importance and power.SummaryArtificial intelligence isn't a computerized bogeyman out to ruin the world. AI is also not a one-size-fits-all solution for the world's problems. Rather, artificial intelligence is a valuable software tool that businesses and individuals can leverage for their goals.In the future, artificial intelligence may evolve in a somewhat unpredictable direction, offering even more benefits to organizations that take advantage of it.

GDP is calculated by adding up the value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given year. This includes the value of goods and services produced by both the government and the private sector. GDP is typically measured in monetary terms, using current market prices for goods and services. GDP is used as a measure of the size and strength of an economy, as well as its overall level of economic activity. It is often used to compare the economies of different countries and to track economic growth over time.

There are several traditional ways to increase the GDP:




Encourage innovation and entrepreneurship: Encouraging people to start their own businesses and come up with new ideas can lead to the creation of new products and services, increasing the size of the economy.
Promote free trade: Removing barriers to trade can allow for a greater exchange of goods and services, leading to increased economic growth.
Invest in education and training: By investing in education and training, individuals can develop new skills and knowledge, leading to greater productivity and economic growth.
Foster a supportive business environment: A supportive business environment, including access to capital, regulatory support, and a skilled workforce, can encourage businesses to start and grow, leading to economic growth.
Promote sustainable development: Sustainable development, which takes into account economic, social, and environmental factors, can lead to long-term economic growth.
Encourage collaboration and cooperation: By fostering a culture of collaboration and cooperation, businesses and individuals can work together to create new opportunities, leading to economic growth.




All of the above rely upon a skilled human workforce to increase the size of the economy. Generally speaking, a larger population tends to correspond with a larger economy, all else being equal. This is because a larger population can provide a larger pool of labor, consumers, and producers, which can contribute to economic growth. For example, a larger population may allow for a greater diversity of goods and services to be produced, as there will be a larger demand for these goods and services from the larger population. A larger population may also allow for economies of scale to be achieved, in which the cost of producing a good or service decreases as the volume of production increases.
Now, let's explore what happens if AI race enters the world. How does this new species contribute towards GDP? One way to size the economy is to multiply GDP per capita by the human workforce. So, the size of an economy is limited by the number of working beings. What if the number of working beings becomes unlimited by including the ‘AI beings’ as part of the workforce? Do we start to approach a limitless economy - an economy that has no bounds on its GDP? Let’s delve into this by learning the impact of existing (non-AI) robots in the industry as a small step towards the AI workforce-based limitless economy.
PROMOTED
Robots already contribute to the economy in several ways:


Increased Productivity: Robots can work 24/7 without getting tired or needing breaks, resulting in increased productivity and output. This can lead to increased profits for businesses and contribute to economic growth.
Job Creation: While robots can replace certain jobs, they can also create new jobs in the fields of programming, maintenance, and supervision.
Cost Reduction: Automation can lead to cost savings for businesses through reduced labor costs and increased efficiency. These savings can be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, which can stimulate economic activity.
Increased Efficiency: Robots can perform tasks faster and more accurately than humans, leading to increased efficiency and productivity in various industries. This can lead to increased competitiveness and economic growth.
Innovation: The development and use of robots can lead to technological innovation and advances in various fields, which can drive economic growth.


Extrapolating the impact of robots on the size of an economy, we can say that the AI workforce can contribute to the economy by increasing productivity, reducing labor costs, and improving decision-making processes. AI can perform tasks faster and more accurately than humans, leading to increased efficiency and cost savings for businesses. Additionally, AI can analyze data and make informed decisions, helping companies make better business decisions and increase profits. The development and implementation of AI technologies can also create jobs and stimulate economic growth. However, the extent to which the AI workforce contributes to GDP will depend on various factors, such as the size and adoption of the AI workforce, the type of tasks being performed, and the overall economic conditions of the country. Overall, the integration of AI into the workforce can lead to increased competitiveness and growth for businesses and the economy.

But it is still a complex question whether AI workers should be counted towards GDP. On the one hand, AI workers can contribute to economic productivity and efficiency by performing tasks faster and more accurately than human workers. This can potentially lead to increased profits and economic growth. On the other hand, AI workers do not require wages or benefits and do not contribute directly to the consumption of goods and services, which are key components of GDP.

There are also ethical considerations to take into account. If AI workers are counted towards GDP, this could potentially lead to increased unemployment and wage stagnation for human workers. There is also the question of whether AI workers should be considered entities with rights and protections similar to human workers.

In summary, AI has the potential to increase the GDP and eventually lead to a limitless economy. But ultimately, the decision to count AI workers towards GDP should be made after carefully weighing the potential economic and ethical impacts. Whatever the outcome of Ai species landing in the world, it is clear that we will see a step-function impact on the economy.
