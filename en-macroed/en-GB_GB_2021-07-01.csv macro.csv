Artificial Intelligence has been used for the first time as part of Exercise Spring Storm in Estonia. The AI technology exploited vast amounts of data to help soldiers, providing vital information on the surrounding terrain and environment.
The British Army has used Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the first time during Exercise Spring Storm, as part of Operation Cabrit in Estonia.
Soldiers from the 20th Armoured Infantry Brigade used an AI engine which provides information on the surrounding environment and terrain. 

    “This was a fantastic opportunity to use a new and innovative piece of technology in a deployed environment. The kit was shown to outperform our expectations.""
    
        Major James Mcevoy, 20th Armoured Infantry Brigade
    

Through the development of significant automation and smart analytics, the engine is able to rapidly cut through masses of complex data. Providing efficient information regarding the environment and terrain, it enables the Army to plan its appropriate activity and outputs. 
The Army’s Director of Information, Major General John Cole said:
“The deployment was a first of its kind for the Army. It built on close collaboration between the MOD and industry partners that developed AI specifically designed for the way the Army is trained to operate.
“The lessons this has provided are considerable, not just in terms of our support to deployed forces, but more broadly in how we inform Defence’s digital transformation agenda and the best practices we must adopt to integrate and exploit leading-edge technologies.”
This AI capability, which can be hosted in the cloud or operate in independent mode, saved significant time and effort, providing soldiers with instant planning support and enhancing command and control processes.
20th Armoured Infantry Brigade and user of the AI, Major James Mcevoy said:
“This was a fantastic opportunity to use a new and innovative piece of technology in a deployed environment. The kit was shown to outperform our expectations and has clear applications for improving our level of analysis and speed at which we conduct our planning. I’m greatly looking forward to further opportunities to work with this.
“In future, the UK armed forces will increasingly use AI to predict adversaries’ behaviour, perform reconnaissance and relay real-time intelligence from the battlefield.”
During the annual large-scale NATO exercise, soldiers from France, Denmark, Belgium, Estonia and the UK used the technology whilst carrying out live-fire drills.
Operation Cabrit is the British Army’s deployment to Estonia where British troops are leading a multinational battlegroup as part of the enhanced Forward Presence.
Artificial Intelligence has already been incorporated in a number of key military initiatives, including the Future Combat Air System, and is the focus of several innovative funding programmes through the Defence and Security Accelerator.
Announced by the Prime Minister last November, Defence has received an increase in funding of over £24 billion across the next four years, focussing on the ability to adapt to meet future threats. 
Further outlined in the Defence Command Paper, the MOD intends to invest £6.6billion over the next four years in defence research and development, focusing on emerging technologies in artificial intelligence, AI-enabled autonomous systems, cyber, space and directed energy systems.

 Get it sent to your inbox.In 2018, Liz O’Sullivan and her colleagues at a prominent artificial intelligence start-up began work on a system that could automatically remove nudity and other explicit images from the internet.They sent millions of online photos to workers in India, who spent weeks adding tags to explicit material. The data paired with the photos would be used to teach A.I. software how to recognize indecent images. But once the photos were tagged, Ms. O’Sullivan and her team noticed a problem: The Indian workers had classified all images of same-sex couples as indecent.For Ms. O’Sullivan, the moment showed how easily — and often — bias could creep into artificial intelligence. It was a “cruel game of Whac-a-Mole,” she said.This month, Ms. O’Sullivan, a 36-year-old New Yorker, was named chief executive of a new company, Parity. The start-up is one of many organizations, including more than a dozen start-ups and some of the biggest names in tech, offering tools and services designed to identify and remove bias from A.I. systems.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSoon, businesses may need that help. In April, the Federal Trade Commission warned against the sale of A.I. systems that were racially biased or could prevent individuals from receiving employment, housing, insurance or other benefits. A week later, the European Union unveiled draft regulations that could punish companies for offering such technology.It is unclear how regulators might police bias. This past week, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a government research lab whose work often informs policy, released a proposal detailing how businesses can fight bias in A.I., including changes in the way technology is conceived and built.Many in the tech industry believe businesses must start preparing for a crackdown. “Some sort of legislation or regulation is inevitable,” said Christian Troncoso, the senior director of legal policy for the Software Alliance, a trade group that represents some of the biggest and oldest software companies. “Every time there is one of these terrible stories about A.I., it chips away at public trust and faith.”Over the past several years, studies have shown that facial recognition services, health care systems and even talking digital assistants can be biased against women, people of color and other marginalized groups. Amid a growing chorus of complaints over the issue, some local regulators have already taken action.In late 2019, state regulators in New York opened an investigation of UnitedHealth Group after a study found that an algorithm used by a hospital prioritized care for white patients over Black patients, even when the white patients were healthier. Last year, the state investigated the Apple Card credit service after claims it was discriminating against women. Regulators ruled that Goldman Sachs, which operated the card, did not discriminate, while the status of the UnitedHealth investigation is unclear. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA spokesman for UnitedHealth, Tyler Mason, said the company’s algorithm had been misused by one of its partners and was not racially biased. Apple declined to comment.More than $100 million has been invested over the past six months in companies exploring ethical issues involving artificial intelligence, after $186 million last year, according to PitchBook, a research firm that tracks financial activity.But efforts to address the problem reached a tipping point this month when the Software Alliance offered a detailed framework for fighting bias in A.I., including the recognition that some automated technologies require regular oversight from humans. The trade group believes the document can help companies change their behavior and can show regulators and lawmakers how to control the problem.Though they have been criticized for bias in their own systems, Amazon, IBM, Google and Microsoft also offer tools for fighting it.Ms. O’Sullivan said there was no simple solution to bias in A.I. A thornier issue is that some in the industry question whether the problem is as widespread or as harmful as she believes it is.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Changing mentalities does not happen overnight — and that is even more true when you’re talking about large companies,” she said. “You are trying to change not just one person’s mind but many minds.”When she started advising businesses on A.I. bias more than two years ago, Ms. O’Sullivan was often met with skepticism. Many executives and engineers espoused what they called “fairness through unawareness,” arguing that the best way to build equitable technology was to ignore issues like race and gender.Increasingly, companies were building systems that learned tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, including photos, sounds, text and stats. The belief was that if a system learned from as much data as possible, fairness would follow.But as Ms. O’Sullivan saw after the tagging done in India, bias can creep into a system when designers choose the wrong data or sort through it in the wrong way. Studies show that face-recognition services can be biased against women and people of color when they are trained on photo collections dominated by white men.Designers can be blind to these problems. The workers in India — where gay relationships were still illegal at the time and where attitudes toward gays and lesbians were very different from those in the United States — were classifying the photos as they saw fit.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. O’Sullivan saw the flaws and pitfalls of artificial intelligence while working for Clarifai, the company that ran the tagging project. She said she had left the company after realizing it was building systems for the military that she believed could eventually be used to kill. Clarifai did not respond to a request for comment. She now believes that after years of public complaints over bias in A.I. — not to mention the threat of regulation — attitudes are changing. In its new framework for curbing harmful bias, the Software Alliance warned against fairness through unawareness, saying the argument did not hold up.“They are acknowledging that you need to turn over the rocks and see what is underneath,” Ms. O’Sullivan said.Still, there is resistance. She said a recent clash at Google, where two ethics researchers were pushed out, was indicative of the situation at many companies. Efforts to fight bias often clash with corporate culture and the unceasing push to build new technology, get it out the door and start making money.It is also still difficult to know just how serious the problem is. “We have very little data needed to model the broader societal safety issues with these systems, including bias,” said Jack Clark, one of the authors of the A.I. Index, an effort to track A.I. technology and policy across the globe. “Many of the things that the average person cares about — such as fairness — are not yet being measured in a disciplined or a large-scale way.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMs. O’Sullivan, a philosophy major in college and a member of the American Civil Liberties Union, is building Parity around a tool designed by and licensed from Rumman Chowdhury, a well-known A.I. ethics researcher who spent years at the business consultancy Accenture before becoming an executive at Twitter. Dr. Chowdhury founded an earlier version of Parity and built it around the same tool.While other start-ups, like Fiddler A.I. and Weights and Biases, offer tools for monitoring A.I. services and identifying potentially biased behavior, Parity’s technology aims to analyze the data, technologies and methods a business uses to build its services and then pinpoint areas of risk and suggest changes.The tool uses artificial intelligence technology that can be biased in its own right, showing the double-edged nature of A.I. — and the difficulty of Ms. O’Sullivan’s task.Tools that can identify bias in A.I. are imperfect, just as A.I. is imperfect. But the power of such a tool, she said, is to pinpoint potential problems — to get people looking closely at the issue.Ultimately, she explained, the goal is to create a wider dialogue among people with a broad range of views. The trouble comes when the problem is ignored — or when those discussing the issues carry the same point of view.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“You need diverse perspectives. But can you get truly diverse perspectives at one company?” Ms. O’Sullivan asked. “It is a very important question I am not sure I can answer.”Cade Metz is a technology correspondent, covering artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality, and other emerging areas.

Conneau couldn’t read it himself. But his creation, XLM-RoBERTa, had read it many times: This was its brain matter, the code with which the machine could, in some way, learn to emulate how people speak.Share69 Comments",BreadcrumbList,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6GWTVNWUAFAQXMSAHDDQD4XBDE.jpg&w=1600&h=900', 'height': 900, 'width': 1600}, {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6GWTVNWUAFAQXMSAHDDQD4XBDE.jpg&w=1800&h=1800', 'height': 1800, 'width': 1800}, {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6GWTVNWUAFAQXMSAHDDQD4XBDE.jpg&w=800&h=600', 'height': 800, 'width': 600}]",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/01/humans-ai-language-advances-risks/,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Drew Harwell', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/drew-harwell/'}",2021-08-13T16:48:13.704Z,2021-07-01T14:10:30.147Z,Meet the scientist teaching AI to police human speech,AI researchers at Facebook and Google are teaching machines to police human speech,"{'@id': 'washingtonpost.com', '@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/img/wplogo_344x60_blk.png', 'width': {'@type': 'Distance', 'name': '344 px'}, 'height': {'@type': 'Distance', 'name': '60 px'}}, 'name': 'The Washington Post'}","{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'cssSelector': '.meteredContent', 'isAccessibleForFree': False}",,,,,,False,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'The Washington Post', 'productID': 'washingtonpost.com:basic', 'description': 'Breaking news and analysis on politics, business, world, national news, entertainment and more.

Top 10 Ideas in Statistics That Have Powered the AI Revolution

In this map of white voters in the 2012 presidential election, the green circles represent counties with higher gender gaps than the U.S. average, and the purple circles, gender gaps lower than the average. The brighter the color, the larger the deviation from the average. Estimates are based on a model fit to survey data. This data visualization follows the principles of exploratory data analysis but is based on a fitted model, rather than raw data, using computer-intensive methods.

If you’ve ever called on Siri or Alexa for help, or generated a self-portrait in the style of a Renaissance painter, you have interacted with deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence that extracts patterns from mountains of data to make predictions. Though deep learning and AI have become household terms, the breakthroughs in statistics that have fueled this revolution are less known. In a recent paper, Andrew Gelman, a statistics professor at Columbia, and Aki Vehtari, a computer science professor at Finland’s Aalto University, published a list of the most important statistical ideas in the last 50 years.
Below, Gelman and Vehtari break down the list for those who may have snoozed through Statistics 101. Each idea can be viewed as a stand-in for an entire subfield, they say, with a few caveats: science is incremental; by singling out these works, they do not mean to diminish the importance of similar, related work. They have also chosen to focus on methods in statistics and machine learning, rather than equally important breakthroughs in statistical computing, and computer science and engineering, which have provided the tools and computing power for data analysis and visualization to become everyday practical tools. Finally, they have focused on methods, while recognizing that developments in theory and methods are often motivated by specific applications. 
See something important that’s missing? Tweet it at @columbiascience and Gelman and Vehtari will consider adding it to the list.
The 10 articles and books below all were published in the last 50 years and are listed in chronological order.

1. Hirotugu Akaike (1973). Information Theory and an Extension of the Maximum Likelihood Principle. Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Information Theory.
This is the paper that introduced the term AIC (originally called An Information Criterion but now known as Akaike Information Criterion), for evaluating a model’s fit based on its estimated predictive accuracy. AIC was instantly recognized as a useful tool, and this paper was one of several published in the mid-1970s placing statistical inference within a predictive framework. We now recognize predictive validation as a fundamental principle in statistics and machine learning. Akaike was an applied statistician, who in the 1960s, tried to measure the roughness of airport runways, in the same way that Benoit Mandelbrot's early papers on taxonomy and Pareto distributions led to his later work on the mathematics of fractals.
2. John Tukey (1977). Exploratory Data Analysis.
This book has been hugely influential and is a fun read that can be digested in one sitting. Traditionally, data visualization and exploration were considered low-grade aspects of practical statistics; the glamour was in fitting models, proving theorems, and developing the theoretical properties of statistical procedures under various mathematical assumptions or constraints. Tukey flipped this notion on its head. He wrote about statistical tools not for confirming what we already knew (or thought we knew), and not for rejecting hypotheses that we never, or should never have, believed, but for discovering new and unexpected insights from data. His work motivated advances in network analysis, software, and theoretical perspectives that integrate confirmation, criticism, and discovery. 
3. Grace Wahba (1978). Improper Priors, Spline Smoothing and the Problem of Guarding Against Model Errors in Regression. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
Spline smoothing is an approach for fitting nonparametric curves. Another of Wahba's papers from this period is called ""An automatic French curve,"" referring to a class of algorithms that can fit arbitrary smooth curves through data without overfitting to noise, or outliers. The idea may seem obvious now, but it was a major step forward in an era when the starting points for curve fitting were polynomials, exponentials, and other fixed forms. In addition to the direct applicability of splines, this paper was important theoretically. It served as a foundation for later work in nonparametric Bayesian inference by unifying ideas of regularization of high-dimensional models.
4.  Bradley Efron (1979). Bootstrap Methods: Another Look at the Jackknife. Annals of Statistics.
Bootstrapping is a method for performing statistical inference without assumptions. The data pull themselves up by their bootstraps, as it were. But you can't make inference without assumptions; what made the bootstrap so useful and influential is that the assumptions came implicitly with the computational procedure: the audaciously simple idea of resampling the data. Each time you repeat the statistical procedure performed on the original data. As with many statistical methods of the past 50 years, this one became widely useful because of an explosion in computing power that allowed simulations to replace mathematical analysis.
5. Alan Gelfand and Adrian Smith (1990). Sampling-based Approaches to Calculating Marginal Densities. Journal of the American Statistical Association.
Another way that fast computing has revolutionized statistics and machine learning is through open-ended Bayesian models. Traditional statistical models are static: fit distribution A to data of type B. But modern statistical modeling has a more Tinkertoy quality that lets you flexibly solve problems as they arise by calling on libraries of distributions and transformations. We just need computational tools to fit these snapped-together models. In their influential paper, Gelfand and Smith did not develop any new tools; they demonstrated how Gibbs sampling could be used to fit a large class of statistical models. In recent decades, the Gibbs sampler has been replaced by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, particle filtering, variational Bayes, and more elaborate algorithms, but the general principle of modular model-building has remained.
6. Guido Imbens and Joshua Angrist (1994). Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects. Econometrica.
Causal inference is central to any problem in which the question isn’t just a description (How have things been?) or prediction (What will happen next?), but a counterfactual (If we do X, what would happen to Y?). Causal methods have evolved with the rest of statistics and machine learning through exploration, modeling, and computation. But causal reasoning has the added challenge of asking about data that are impossible to measure (you can't both do X and not-X to the same person). As a result, a key idea in this field is identifying what questions can be reliably answered from a given experiment. Imbens and Angrist are economists who wrote an influential paper on what can be estimated when causal effects vary, and their ideas form the basis for much of the later work on this topic.
7. Robert Tibshirani (1996). Regression Shrinkage and Selection Via the Lasso. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
In regression, or predicting an outcome variable from a set of inputs or features, the challenge lies in including lots of inputs along with their interactions; the resulting estimation problem becomes statistically unstable because of the many different ways of combining these inputs to get reasonable predictions. Classical least squares or maximum likelihood estimates will be noisy and might not perform well on future data, and so various methods have been developed to constrain or “regularize” the fit to gain stability. In this paper, Tibshirani introduced lasso, a computationally efficient and now widely used approach to regularization, which has become a template for data-based regularization in more complicated models.
8. Leland Wilkinson (1999). The Grammar of Graphics.
In this book, Wilkinson, a statistician who's worked on several influential commercial software projects including SPSS and Tableau, lays out a framework for statistical graphics that goes beyond the usual focus on pie charts versus histograms, how to draw a scatterplot, and data ink and chartjunk, to abstractly explore how data and visualizations relate. This work has influenced statistics through many pathways, most notably through ggplot2 and the tidyverse family of packages in the computing language R. It’s an important step toward integrating exploratory data and model analysis into data science workflow.
9. Ian Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron Courville, and Yoshua Bengio (2014). Generative Adversarial Networks. Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.
One of machine learning’s stunning achievements in recent years is in real-time decision making through prediction and inference feedbacks. Famous examples include self-driving cars and DeepMind’s AlphaGo, which trained itself to become the best Go player on Earth. Generative adversarial networks, or GANs, are a conceptual advance that allow reinforcement learning problems to be solved automatically. They mark a step toward the longstanding goal of artificial general intelligence while also harnessing the power of parallel processing so that a program can train itself by playing millions of games against itself. At a conceptual level, GANs link prediction with generative models.
10. Yoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun, and Geoffrey Hinton (2015). Deep Learning. Nature.
Deep learning is a class of artificial neural network models that can be used to make flexible nonlinear predictions using a large number of features. Its building blocks—logistic regression, multilevel structure, and Bayesian inference—are hardly new. What makes this line of research so influential is the recognition that these models can be tuned to solve a variety of prediction problems, from consumer behavior to image analysis. As with other developments in statistics and machine learning, the tuning process was made possible only with the advent of fast parallel computing and statistical algorithms to harness this power to fit large models in real time. Conceptually, we’re still catching up with the power of these methods, which is why there’s so much interest in interpretable machine learning.

MELVIN was a machine-learning algorithm Krenn had built, a kind of artificial intelligence. Its job was to mix and match the building blocks of standard quantum experiments and find solutions to new problems. And it did find many interesting ones. But there was one that made no sense. “The first thing I thought was, ‘My program has a bug because the solution cannot exist,’” Krenn says.MELVIN had seemingly solved the problem of creating highly complex entangled states involving multiple photons (entangled states being those that once made Albert Einstein invoke the specter of “spooky action at a distance”). Krenn, Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna and their colleagues had not explicitly provided MELVIN the rules needed to generate such complex states, yet it had found a way. Eventually Krenn realized that the algorithm had rediscovered a type of experimental arrangement that had been devised in the early 1990s. But those experiments had been much simpler. MELVIN had cracked a far more complex puzzle. “When we understood what was going on, we were immediately able to generalize [the solution],” says Krenn, who is now at the University of Toronto.Since then, other teams have started performing the experiments identified by MELVIN, allowing them to test the conceptual underpinnings of quantum mechanics in new ways. Meanwhile Krenn, working with colleagues in Toronto, has refined their machine-learning algorithms. Their latest effort, an AI called THESEUS, has upped the ante: it is orders of magnitude faster than MELVIN, and humans can readily parse its output. While it would take Krenn and his colleagues days or even weeks to understand MELVIN’s meanderings, they can almost immediately figure out what THESEUS is saying. “It is amazing work,” says theoretical quantum physicist Renato Renner of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, who reviewed a 2020 study about THESEUS but was not directly involved in these efforts.Krenn stumbled on this entire research program somewhat by accident when he and his colleagues were trying to figure out how to experimentally create quantum states of photons entangled in a very particular manner. When two photons interact, they become entangled, and both can be mathematically described only using a single shared quantum state. If you measure the state of one photon, the measurement instantly fixes the state of the other even if the two are kilometers apart (hence Einstein’s derisive comments on entanglement being “spooky”).In 1989 three physicists—Daniel Greenberger, the late Michael Horne and Zeilinger—described an entangled state that came to be known as GHZ (after their initials). It involved four photons, each of which could be in a quantum superposition of, say, two states, 0 and 1 (a quantum state called a qubit). In their paper, the GHZ state involved entangling four qubits such that the entire system was in a two-dimensional quantum superposition of states 0000 and 1111. If you measured one of the photons and found it in state 0, the superposition would collapse, and the other photons would also be in state 0. The same went for state 1. In the late 1990s Zeilinger and his colleagues experimentally observed GHZ states using three qubits for the first time.Krenn and his colleagues were aiming for GHZ states of higher dimensions. They wanted to work with three photons, where each photon had a dimensionality of three, meaning it could be in a superposition of three states: 0, 1 and 2. This quantum state is called a qutrit. The entanglement the team was after was a three-dimensional GHZ state that was a superposition of states 000, 111 and 222. Such states are important ingredients for secure quantum communications and faster quantum computing. In late 2013 the researchers spent weeks designing experiments on blackboards and doing the calculations to see if their setups could generate the required quantum states. But each time they failed. “I thought, ‘This is absolutely insane. Why can’t we come up with a setup?’” Krenn says.To speed up the process, Krenn first wrote a computer program that took an experimental setup and calculated the output. Then he upgraded the program to allow it to incorporate in its calculations the same building blocks that experimenters use to create and manipulate photons on an optical bench: lasers, nonlinear crystals, beam splitters, phase shifters, holograms, and the like. The program searched through a large space of configurations by randomly mixing and matching the building blocks, performed the calculations and spat out the result. MELVIN was born. “Within a few hours the program found a solution that we scientists—three experimentalists and one theorist—could not come up with for months,” Krenn says. “That was a crazy day. I could not believe that it happened.” Then he gave MELVIN more smarts. Anytime it found a setup that did something useful, MELVIN added that setup to its toolbox. “The algorithm remembers that and tries to reuse it for more complex solutions,” Krenn says.Recommended StoriesCan AI Save Schrödinger’s Cat?Anil AnanthaswamyThese Are the Most Beautiful Equations in MathematicsRachel CrowellExotic Quantum ‘Bose-Einstein Condensate’ State Finally Achieved with MoleculesElizabeth Gibney & Nature magazineDoes Quantum Physics Rule Out Free Will?Dan FalkIt was this more evolved MELVIN that left Krenn scratching his head in a Viennese café. He had set it running with an experimental toolbox that contained two crystals, each capable of generating a pair of photons entangled in three dimensions. Krenn’s naive expectation was that MELVIN would find configurations that combined these pairs of photons to create entangled states of at most nine dimensions. But “it actually found one solution, an extremely rare case, that has much higher entanglement than the rest of the states,” Krenn says.Eventually he figured out that MELVIN had used a technique that multiple teams had developed nearly three decades ago. In 1991 Xin Yu Zou, Li Jun Wang and Leonard Mandel, all then at the University of Rochester, designed one method. And in 1994 Zeilinger, then at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, and his colleagues came up with another. Conceptually these experiments attempted something similar, but the configuration that Zeilinger and his colleagues devised is simpler to understand. It starts with one crystal that generates a pair of photons (A and B). The paths of these photons go right through another crystal, which can also generate two photons (C and D). The paths of photon A from the first crystal and of photon C from the second overlap exactly and lead to the same detector. If that detector clicks, it is impossible to tell whether the photon originated from the first or the second crystal. The same goes for photons B and D.A phase shifter is a device that effectively increases the path a photon travels as some fraction of its wavelength. If you were to introduce a phase shifter in one of the paths between the crystals and kept changing the amount of phase shift, you could cause constructive and destructive interference at the detectors. For example, each of the crystals could be generating, say, 1,000 pairs of photons per second. With constructive interference, the detectors would register 4,000 pairs of photons per second. And with destructive interference, they would detect none: the system as a whole would not create any photons even though individual crystals would be generating 1,000 pairs a second. “That is actually quite crazy, when you think about it,” Krenn says.MELVIN’s funky solution involved such overlapping paths. What had flummoxed Krenn was that the algorithm had only two crystals in its toolbox. And instead of using those crystals at the beginning of the experimental setup, it had wedged them inside an interferometer (a device that splits the path of, say, a photon into two and then recombines them). After much effort, he realized that the setup MELVIN had found was equivalent to one involving more than two crystals, each generating pairs of photons, such that their paths to the detectors overlapped. The configuration could be used to generate high-dimensional entangled states.Quantum physicist Nora Tischler, who was a Ph.D. student working with Zeilinger on an unrelated topic when MELVIN was being put through its paces, was paying attention to these developments. “It was kind of clear from the beginning [that such an] experiment wouldn’t exist if it hadn’t been discovered by an algorithm,” she says.Besides generating complex entangled states, the setup using more than two crystals with overlapping paths can be employed to perform a generalized form of Zeilinger’s 1994 quantum interference experiments with two crystals. Aephraim Steinberg, an experimentalist who is a Toronto colleague of Krenn’s but has not worked on these projects, is impressed by what the AI found. “This is a generalization that (to my knowledge) no human dreamed up in the intervening decades and might never have done,” he says. “It’s a gorgeous first example of the kind of new explorations these thinking machines can take us on.”In one such generalized configuration with four crystals, each generating a pair of photons, and overlapping paths leading to four detectors, quantum interference can create situations where either all four detectors click (constructive interference) or none of them do so (destructive interference). Until recently, carrying out such an experiment had remained a distant dream. Then, in a March preprint paper, a team led by Lan-Tian Feng of the University of Science and Technology of China, in collaboration with Krenn, reported that they had fabricated the entire setup on a single photonic chip and performed the experiment. The researchers collected data for more than 16 hours: a feat made possible because of the photonic chip’s incredible optical stability, something that would have been impossible to achieve in a larger-scale tabletop experiment. For starters, the setup would require a square meter’s worth of optical elements precisely aligned on an optical bench, Steinberg says. Besides, “a single optical element jittering or drifting by a thousandth of the diameter of a human hair during those 16 hours could be enough to wash out the effect,” he says.During their early attempts to simplify and generalize what MELVIN had found, Krenn and his colleagues realized that the solution resembled abstract mathematical forms called graphs, which contain vertices and edges and are used to depict pairwise relations between objects. For these quantum experiments, every path a photon takes is represented by a vertex. And a crystal, for example, is represented by an edge connecting two vertices. MELVIN first produced such a graph and then performed a mathematical operation on it. The operation, called perfect matching, involves generating an equivalent graph in which each vertex is connected to only one edge. This process makes calculating the final quantum state much easier, although it is still hard for humans to understand.That changed with MELVIN’s successor THESEUS, which generates much simpler graphs by winnowing the first complex graph representing a solution that it finds down to the bare minimum number of edges and vertices (such that any further deletion destroys the setup’s ability to generate the desired quantum states). Such graphs are simpler than MELVIN’s perfect matching graphs, so it is even easier to make sense of any AI-generated solution. Renner is particularly impressed by THESEUS’s human-interpretable outputs. “The solution is designed in such a way that the number of connections in the graph is minimized,” he says. “And that’s naturally a solution we can better understand than if you had a very complex graph.”Eric Cavalcanti of Griffith University in Australia is both impressed by the work and circumspect about it. “These machine-learning techniques represent an interesting development. For a human scientist looking at the data and interpreting it, some of the solutions may look like ‘creative’ new solutions. But at this stage, these algorithms are still far from a level where it could be said that they are having truly new ideas or coming up with new concepts,” he says. “On the other hand, I do think that one day they will get there. So these are baby steps—but we have to start somewhere.” Steinberg agrees. “For now they are just amazing tools,” he says. “And like all the best tools, they’re already enabling us to do some things we probably wouldn’t have done without them.”Rights & PermissionsFrom our Archives

The GDPR and the Artificial Intelligence Regulation – it takes two to tango?
BY 
                Jenny Bergholm              - 06 July 2021






The recently adopted proposal for an AI Regulation has already been the topic for widespread discussions., and so has the GDPR. This contribution discusses how the proposed AI Regulation inadequately addresses the risks presented to privacy and data protection by AI systems, and fails to integrate the comprehensive framework of the GDPR into the most buzzing proposal for regulation in a long time.
The recently published proposal for a EU AI Regulation (also discussed here and here) is the latest addition to the European Commission’s Digital Strategy, published in April 2021. It is the first of its kind in the world and comprises many important aspects for society. This contribution will discuss the proposed AI Regulation, and in particular the relationship to the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR).
Initially, a few basic concepts of the AI Regulation will be introduced. If adopted, the regulation enjoys a broad scope: it will apply to all providers supplying AI systems within the EU internal market (Article 2 and Article 3(9) and (10)) and all users of AI systems (Article 2) for commercial purposes (Article 3 (4)).
Perhaps most importantly, the proposal distinguishes between high-risk AI systems and other AI systems. An AI system is defined as a software, which is developed with machine learning, logic- and knowledge-based or statistical approaches and which can “generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing the environments they interact with” based on set “human-defined objectives” (Article 3 (1) and Annex I). An AI system is classified as high-risk if it is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or is a product under one of various legislative pieces (Annex II), or falls under one of the specifically mentioned categories (Annex III). The categories of Annex III comprise among others, the use of biometric identification and safety components used in some critical infrastructures, AI systems used for educational purposes and in employment related circumstances.
Whereas certain artificial intelligence practices are directly prohibited, most emphasis is put on high-risk AI systems. Those are subject to purely internal market conformity procedures, with notified bodies and CE marking of conformity. Other AI systems, those that are not considered high-risk, are subject to transparency obligations (Article 52). High-risk AI systems, which make use of techniques involving the training of models with data, will need to be developed based on training, validation and testing of the data sets, to ensure that quality criteria are met.
 The approach is not only detrimentally different from an obligation perspective, but also concerning the processing of personal data of AI systems. The mentioned quality criteria concern data governance, and many of the criteria will serve data subjects. Moreover, the GDPR plays a role in bias monitoring (Art. 10(5)) and processing of biometric data. It is also directly pointed out, that even if a system is included in the scope of the AI Regulation as a high-risk AI system, it does not mean that it is lawful from a data protection perspective (Recital 41). In its joint opinion, the EDPB and the EDPS highlight this and raise criticism regarding the lack of alignment with the GDPR. The EDPB/EDPS further propose that compliance with the data protection framework in the assessment for CE conformity. The European Commission White Paper on AI already identified risks to data protection and privacy rights by e.g. using AI to retrace or de-anonymise data, even for data sets which do not, as such, include personal data. Also the High-Level Expert Group on AI highlighted the need for AI systems to guarantee privacy and data protection, especially for information provided by the user of a system but also data generated about the data subject while using AI-based tools.
It is understood that the AI Regulation is a risk assessment based approach. The scale of risk is graded from unacceptable to minimal risks. Risk-based approaches are also common in cybersecurity legislation, and hints thereof can also be found in the 2020 Cybersecurity Strategy. From a data protection perspective, it can be noted that some risk management elements also exists in the GDPR, such as the data protection impact assessments, as discussed by Gellert and the Article 29 Working Party. Also data protection law is developing in a risk-based direction, as can be seen in the recently published Standard Contractual Clauses for international data transfers, which allow a risk-based approach.
Nevertheless, the rights and obligations of the GDPR stretch further than only high-risk operations. . The issue is, that even though the AI Regulation is intended to complement the GDPR, it provides very little clarity of processing of personal data by any other AI systems than high-risk AI systems. The Proposal includes a declaration that the proposed AI Regulation does not affect the application of the GDPR, but more guidance in the legal text on how the Regulation should be applied with regards to processing of personal data is missing. The lack of clear reference to the GDPR and other data protection legislation has been raised by the EDPB and the EDPS in a joint opinion. This is especially the case for data processing of AI systems which are not considered as high-risk systems. Even for high-risk AI systems, it mainly considers special categories of personal data . A clear example is Article 10 of the draft regulation, concerning data and governance. The article is set to regulate the training, validation and testing of data sets of high-risk AI systems. It refers to the data collection, but with no reference to rights and obligations of the data subjects. Only in Article 10(5), the GDPR is mentioned, as the providers of systems may process personal data of special categories if strictly necessary for the purpose of ensuring bias monitoring, detection and corrections. In such cases, the provider of the system need to adopt appropriate safeguards, such as technical limitations on the re-use of data and privacy-preserving measures. However, read in the light of the GDPR, many of these safeguards are already per-se obligatory due to the GDPR and the principle of data minimisation and privacy by-design and by-default.
Data processing of AI systems, which are not high-risk, or related to biometrics or bias, seem to be left solely to the already existing provisions of the GDPR. This includes, among others, the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, storage limitation, integrity and accountability (Art. 5 of the GDPR). The GDPR has become a bench-mark for privacy and data protection rights, and is one of the success stories of recent EU regulation. It is clear, that the GDPR applies when personal data is processed with the help of artificial intelligence. Even if that fact is not doubted, the relation between the GDPR and the AI Regulation should be clarified. The (long term) quality of the AI Regulation would benefit from clear and strong references to the principles of the GDPR, and so would the innovation community, the internal market and the data subjects.

Following the invention of the camera in the 1850s, artists felt betrayed and threatened by technology as the end of art seemed to loom due to the camera’s ability to capture images in perfect likeness. Since the invention of the camera, technology has accelerated at an exponential rate in ways that have both benefited and disadvantaged the artist. Now with the invention of the first humanoid robot artist, Ai-Da, the lines between benefit and disadvantage have become blurry. “People don’t judge an artwork on its own merit,” Aidan Meller, gallery director and co-creator of Ai-Da, told digitaltrends while speaking about the humanoid. “They always do it through the lens of the artist, Meller continued. “When you look at a Picasso or you look at Tracey Emin, you have a very different response based on the personalities that created [the work]. That’s no different with a robot.” Ai-Da was unveiled as the first robot artist in 2019, showcasing an original skillset that allowed the humanoid to paint abstract artworks. Ai-Da’s artworks are from her ability to examine objects with a camera and then decode these objects through various machine learning algorithms, which are then translated as instructions to Ai-Da’s mechanical arm to re-create the objects. Since 2019, Ai-Da’s artistic skill set has grown and she is now able to write and recite poetry as well as create sculptural works.

Aida has travelled around the world exhibiting work on a scale that most conscious artists could never dream of. Earlier this year she had an exhibition at London’s Design Museum which showed how far she has come in evolving her skillset. The exhibition displayed a series of self-portraits— or selfies — which showed that Ai-Da had been taught to “look” at herself and create self-portraits. Ai-Da co-creator and curator Lucy Seal explained that, “Through technology, we outsource our own decisions. The work invites us to think about artificial intelligence, technological uses and abuses in today’s world.” As Ai-Da continues to be spoken about in the art world and gain so much recognition, now becoming the first humanoid to receive an artist residency, I wonder if Ai-Da herself is an abuse of technology. While I do admire this leap in technology and am impressed by the skillset and innovation Ai-Da holds, I can’t help but think that through this recognition of Ai-Da, and the possibility of the trajectory she stands for which could result in many robot artists, we could be depriving a conscious artist of the opportunity and platforms we are giving humanoids. This thinking is framed by the fact that there are thousands of Black and brown artists who still exist on the margins of the art world, not gaining recognition for the work they have done to shape modern art. It appears disheartening when the art world is now shifting to rather showcase the work of humanoids, instead of spotlighting marginalised artists who have been overlooked for so long. Apart from this, the invention and attention surrounding Ai-Da also allows us to ask ourselves how we value art these days— is it based on the method used to create the art or its underpinning concept? It is to be noted that Ai-Da did not decide to create self-portraits but rather was given instructions by her creators. This method of working is not new to the art world as it is similar to how artist Damien Hurst works. Hurst employs multiple artists to help him realise his works with many criticising that he is nothing but a puppet master with a concept, dictating what artists below him create and taking all the credit for the artworks. So perhaps Ai-Da should stand as a blueprint to how we could use artificial intelligence to our advantage as artists to help realise our own conceptual dreams in the way Hurst does.

While Ai-Da is being credited as an example of an artistic phenomenon, which now puts into question if it is possible to automate creativity, I think back to my early understandings of the works of Jackson Pollock. Pollock created abstract expressionist works which are today renowned due to their technique, scale and colour. When looking at the techniques that Pollock used it came across to me that Pollock, like Ai-da, utilised methods of working that would automate creativity. Showing again the way that Ai-Da works is similar to how other artists have previously operated. So perhaps AI in the art world is less of a threat than we previously imagined. With every wave of technological advancement, we also take a step towards aiding human efforts. Recently, AI has helped restore Rembrandt’s 1642 masterpiece, The Night’s Watch, to the painting’s original size after 300 years. In 1715, the painting was cut to size to suit the wall of Amsterdam’s Town hall. To date, the chopped-off sections of the painting have not been found. However, due to artificial intelligence, the painting has now been restored to its former brilliance, a feat that I doubt we would have been able to do without technology. Technology has also has allowed artists such as Refik Anadol to re-imagine the creation of new age media as Anadol creates surreal, abstract works constructed through data-driven machine learning algorithms. Not to mention the benefit of NFT technology providing the opportunity to democratise the art world when operating in ways seen in exhibitions such as The Digital Diaspora. 
So while a possible disadvantage of artificial intelligence in art is that someday the works of humanoids might eclipse and surpass the works that us mere mortals can create, I rest easy at night knowing that Ai-Da will never be able to truly create from a space of human experience, culture or heritage and to me those are the inspirations which add substance to art. I also embrace the fact that without the technology that Ai-Da stands for many things would not be possible in the arts and realise that if we use technology correctly a world of creative opportunity is created. Most importantly, we need to make sure that this technology does not allow for the unfair distribution of resources, such as recognition and opportunity, which ensures that previously marginalised groups are still given a seat at the table.

A Simple Blood Test to Speed Pulmonary Hypertension Diagnosis


July 1, 2021







Health Sciences researchers are using artificial intelligence to quickly identify the chemical fingerprints of pulmonary hypertension before it’s too late.






Image
 



Drs. Ruslan Rafikov and Olga Rafikova study the genetic and metabolomic biomarkers of pulmonary hypertension.






Deadly if not treated, pulmonary hypertension can be easy to miss. Shortness of breath and difficulty exercising are among its symptoms – the same as those indicating a number of other respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. 
The standard procedure to detect the disease is a pulmonary artery catheterization, an invasive test where a tube is threaded from a vein in the neck or groin to the heart’s right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery to measure pressure. High blood pressure in that area indicates pulmonary hypertension. 




Image
 




Using technology, artificial intelligence and detective work, researchers at the College of Medicine – Tucson built original algorithms to help doctors more quickly and efficiently diagnose pulmonary hypertension.




But at the University of Arizona Heath Sciences, the husband-and-wife team of Ruslan Rafikov, PhD, and Olga Rafikova, MD, PhD, is using artificial intelligence to build original algorithms and feed them to computers to more efficiently diagnose the disease.  
Working in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of Arizona College of Medicine – Tucson,  the two researchers have created algorithms that can detect the tell-tale metabolites associated with the condition in blood samples, speeding diagnosis, providing a quicker path to treatment and potentially adding years to patients’ lives. 
“By creating machine learning techniques or algorithms, we are teaching the computer how to separate metabolite data and determine what’s significant,” Dr. Rafikov said. “Using data, we are allowing for quicker and less invasive ways to assess patients. And that is the goal of our work as we move into the future.”
About 200,000 new cases of pulmonary hypertension are diagnosed every year in the United States, with treatment costs ranging about four to five times higher in patients with the condition than those without, according to a recent report in the American Journal of Managed Care. College of Medicine – Tucson Associate Professor Franz Rischard, DO, estimates the disease occurs at twice the national rate in southern Arizona.
Where machine learning and medicine meet
Drs. Rafikov and Rafikova’s research focuses on the expression of metabolites in cells that are under stress. Metabolites are micro-molecules that drive biochemical activities in cells, such as signaling, stimulatory and inhibitory functions in the body. These small molecules include lipids, proteins and amino and nucleic acids that are building blocks when a cell is in regeneration mode.

Franz Rischard, DO, says southern Arizona sees twice the national rate of pulmonary hypertension.




In pulmonary hypertension, the biochemical processes that create these molecules get hijacked to focus on cell regeneration. This leads to a narrowing of arteries between the heart and lungs, forcing them to work harder and leading to eventual failure.
Analyzing data from blood samples with a computer algorithm, Drs. Rafikov and Rafikova zeroed in on shifts in about a dozen metabolites that signal early diagnosis.
They then created a machine-learning algorithm – a set of instructions for the computer to scan for metabolites in the blood – to detect the presence of pulmonary hypertension, eventually developing a metabolic profile to hone in on 11 specific metabolites out of tens of thousands in the body.
“It’s similar to how our brains learn to identify a specific image,” Dr. Rafikov explained. “You may need many images before the computer recognizes what you’re teaching it to see.” 
The research partners also had to teach the computer to tell the difference between healthy and diseased samples, as well as the differences in samples for other conditions a patient might suffer from, such as diabetes, cancer or other lung and heart diseases.




Image
 




Drs. Rafikova and Rafikov hope to develop additional panels to diagnose other diseases based on their metabolic signatures.




At this stage of their research, it takes about an hour of computing time for the team to run 20 healthy and 20 diseased samples to check for the 11 metabolites connected to pulmonary hypertension. As the computer studies them, it distributes them into healthy or pulmonary hypertension baskets. Bigger sample sizes require more computing power, and Rafikov envisions eventually employing a cloud computing service to process large patient sets.
Expanding their work
After further refinements, Drs. Rafikov and Rafikova hope to provide their 11-metabolite panel to physicians to screen patients with mild pulmonary hypertension symptoms and allow earlier diagnosis. They also plan to develop metabolite panels to improve diagnoses for other diseases by identifying different metabolic signatures.
“We want to develop our own unique algorithm for a multi-level, multi-disease focus that would, from the very beginning, approach each patient as if the system understands there might be several conditions in one person,” Dr. Rafikova said.

Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn is famous for his extensive oeuvre of art, which includes sketches, prints, and paintings. Among the many masterpieces within his portfolio is a particularly ambitious piece that has impressed audiences with its scale and detail centuries after the painter's death—The Night Watch (1642). This lifesize group portrait is one of the most influential pieces from the Dutch Golden Age and, since 2019, has been the subject of an extensive restoration by the Rijksmuseum called Project Night Watch.

Last year, Project Night Watch released an extremely detailed—and completely free-to-download —44.8 gigapixel image of Rembrandt's masterpiece. Recently, the museum unveiled another incredible feat. By combining art with artificial intelligence, the team was able to add missing pieces to the original painting. “In 1715, the monumental canvas was cut down on all four sides to fit onto a wall between two doors in Amsterdam’s Town Hall,” writes Nina Siegal. “The snipped pieces were lost. Since the 19th century, the trimmed painting has been housed in the Rijksmuseum, where it is displayed as the museum’s centerpiece, at the focal point of its Gallery of Honor.”
This success of completing The Night Watch to its original form depended on a 17th-century copy of the painting that was made by Dutch artist Gerrit Lundens prior to the trimming. With this record of what The Night Watch used to look like, the museum's scientists were able to train artificial intelligence to recreate the missing portions in Rembrandt's unique style of painting. This process required a long period of tinkering with the neural network's precision. Eventually, the Rijsmuseum's senior scientist, Rob Erdmann, was able to successfully calibrate the AI technology to print a believable replica of Rembrandt's handiwork onto canvas.FEATURED VIDEOHobo nickels created by Roman Booteen.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, he taught hundreds of kids how to make Alexa do things it isn't programmed to do through webinars, camps and posts on his blog that is available online. ""In this generation, as kids are growing up, they are being exposed to technology and learning things in ways that we never thought was possible,"" said Bradley Metrock, CEO of Score Publishing, which organizes the Project Voice conference. ""Kids like Aariv are setting the expectation of having the chance to speak to technology devices first.""With several people from large companies also nominated, Aariv said he was not expecting to win. ""I was nominated with so many people who worked at big enterprises like Google, Samsung and Amazon, so I was pleasantly surprised when Bradley emailed me that I had won,"" he said.How Aariv Modi got started in artificial intelligenceAariv said he's been involved with the AI industry since he was 10-years-old. In 2019, Aariv uploaded his first YouTube video demonstrating ""How Alexa Works"", how to open the Wheel of Fun app using Alexa, Amazon's virtual assistant that uses AI technology. However, he said it wasn't until the start of the coronavirus pandemic that he became inspired to teach others how to build their Alexa skills.""I was bored out of my mind and I figured a lot of people were feeling the same way, so I thought the best way to give back to the community at the time would be to help teach everybody something new,"" Aariv said. ""I worked with my dad to set up a couple of webinars where I taught kids how to create Alexa skills.""MORE: UT gets $20M to focus on AI technology and lead research instituteHe said over 500 people attended his webinars, where he taught them the technology involved in creating Alexa. His YouTube channel now has over 1,300 subscribers.""I also teach them how to create Alexa skills using code because with Alexa blueprints, you really don't need any coding experience to create them,"" Aariv said. In 2020, Aariv said he also had the opportunity to visit Chattanooga, Tenn., and speak at Project Voice's yearly conference, which brings together those in the technology and conversational artificial intelligence community, according to its website. ""My presentation was about my learnings throughout my year-long journey with Alexa,"" Aariv said. ""I had practiced my presentation maybe 50 times and was still really nervous, but as soon as I went on the stage, my butterflies in my stomach disappeared. It was really exciting and I felt lucky to have the opportunity because I'm able to share what's important and my knowledge with the artificial intelligence community."" MORE: Round Rock student awarded for education efforts on teen dating violenceHe said he is thankful for his father and the friends he has found within the AI community. ""They've always helped me so much and it's really because of them I'm able to speak at conferences,"" Aariv said. ""I truly look up to my dad because he's a really big influence in my life and has always believed I can achieve anything I really want to. He's never treated me like a kid when it comes to programming and I'm super grateful for that."" Although Aariv, 13, said he does not know what he wants to be when he grows up, he wants to be in the tech field and plans to continue sharing his knowledge with the AI community.""I hope to be TEDx speaker this year, talking about voice and AI, and I intend to continue using my YouTube channel, LinkedIn and my blog because I really enjoy teaching others and sharing everything I know,"" Aariv said.Fisher Investments7 Wealth Tips Once Your Portfolio Reaches $1 MillionHow do retirees take steps to preserve their wealth in retirement?

This revolution is labeled as the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Industrial Revolution, or 4IR in short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In developed nations, 4IR is already taking place with massive unprecedented strides in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, nano and biotechnology and more. Led by the likes of USA, Korea, Japan, China and Europe, patenting of 4IR technologies has seen an annual growth of 20% from 2010 to 2018. Its effect has reached our country as well, where automated systems and services are replacing the conventional manual processes to increase efficiency and effectiveness. With its immense potential, both positive and negative, 4IR is being introduced in the national sphere of Bangladesh, influencing the policies and industries for the coming years. And in the preparation and planning for it, academia is positioned to play a uniquely vital role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tale of the revolutions starts in the late 18th century, with the invention of the steam engine. The first industrial revolution repositioned the economic focus of the world from the greens and isolation of agriculture to the grime and hustle of factories. New jobs surfaced, masses migrated, urban societies emerged, and new societal and economic structures took shape.&lt;/p&gt;. &lt;p&gt;The second industrial revolution followed a hundred years later with the introduction of electricity in the industry and the opportunities for mass production. Manual labour was augmented by tools that ran on electricity, helping efficiency in production reach a greater level. This subsequently made way for engineers and specialists to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;blockquote&gt;The last revolution, 4IR, is often mistaken as a continuation of the third one due to its use of modern technologies. But with its exponential growth and unprecedented scope, 4IR has emerged as its own force to be reckoned with. What distinguishes 4IR is its use of smart technologies, artificial intelligence and the fusion of physical, technological and biological components.&lt;/blockquote&gt;. &lt;p&gt;After the mid twentieth century, a new era of digitization was introduced, namely the third industrial revolution. Electronic devices started dominating the workforce, and with their superior computational capabilities, removed human intervention in redundant tasks while creating new opportunities related to the creation and use of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last revolution, 4IR, is often mistaken as a continuation of the third one due to its use of modern technologies. But with its exponential growth and unprecedented scope, 4IR has emerged as its own force to be reckoned with. What distinguishes 4IR is its use of smart technologies, artificial intelligence and the fusion of physical, technological and biological components. Popular technologies that define 4IR include autonomous vehicles, internet of things, virtual reality, biometric identification, genetic and biomedical engineering, robotics and more. These technologies harbour the potential to disrupt the current industries and businesses by interconnecting intelligent devices and machines that can think and work exactly like, or better than, their human counterparts. By enhancing performance, 4IR will streamline production and services. It will decrease human effort by automating existing processes that require manual labor or predictable actions. While this will ease consumer use, it will most definitely replace human workers in the industries. Balancing out the contrasting effects of 4IR is the biggest challenge for policymakers, organisations and businesses in the future too near.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), first coined the term fourth industrial revolution. On the effect of 4IR, he said, “The changes are so profound that, from the perspective of human history, there has never been a time of greater promise or potential peril.”&lt;/p&gt;. &lt;p&gt;WEF’s report, “Future of Jobs” estimates that about 75 million jobs will be displaced due to the technologies of 4IR. Bangladesh, where the majority of jobs situate in the low-end and manual spectrum, will be affected gravely by this force. The symptoms have already surfaced. The International Labor Organization’s (ILO) report, ‘Asia-Pacific Employment and Social Outlook-2018’ says that unemployment in Bangladesh is on the rise and has doubled in the course of seven years. The Access to Information (a2i) project of the Prime Minister’s Office states that over the past 26 years, 74% employment opportunities have dropped due to automation. In 1990, for every million dollar in export, 545 workers were employed, which dwindled to 142 in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), employment growth has decreased in the four years since 2012, with female workers decreasing in number and a 16% cut at the officer level. The CPD survey covered 2000 workers of 193 readymade garment factories, revealing that from 2005 to 2012, the increase in employment growth stood at 4.01%, which, from 2012 to 2016, became 3.3%. This decline in employment rate comes despite the economic growth the country has been enjoying in recent years. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) reveals that in spite of the average annual economic growth of 6.6% from 2013 to 2017, the annual employment generation rate remained at only 0.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This situation will only grow dire in the coming years, as predicted by a government study titled “4IR: Challenge or Opportunity for Bangladesh?” The study says that at least 5.7 million people in five sectors will face job loss by 2041 and around 73 million people will need to be equipped with 4IR skills to develop a future adaptive labor force by 2041. a2i estimates that 60% of the workers in the readymade garment sector will be losing their jobs, along with 55% in the furniture sector, 40% in the agricultural products processing plants, 20% in the leather industry and 20% in the tourism and hospitality sector.&lt;/p&gt;. &lt;p&gt;The country’s youth are the most vulnerable demographic to the changes that will come with 4IR. BBS reveals that 34.3% of the youth are unemployed. A survey report of a local private research organisation Institute of Informatics and Development (IID) says that 84% of the youth feel that their main problem at present is lack of skills and employment, while 28% of them felt that the prevailing educational system hardly helped them in getting jobs. 8% said their education, rather than helping them in employment, became an obstacle instead. The survey was carried out on 11,658 young people in 23 districts of the country in late 2018.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s true that because of 4IR, job loss will be a main challenge but we are optimistic that it will create more job opportunities&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span class=""attribution""&gt;Md Shahidul Haque&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. &lt;p&gt;Despite the alarming statistics and estimations about job displacements and massive unemployment, a silver lining comes with 4IR, like all three of its predecessors, in the form of new jobs. Former foreign secretary Md Shahidul Haque says that, “It’s true that because of 4IR, job loss will be a main challenge but we are optimistic that it will create more job opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WEF report shows that a possible 133 million new jobs will be created. Anir Chowdhury, policy advisor of a2i, says, “We need to re-skill some 75 million people within the next 20 years and within this time frame 20 million people need to come under new skill development projects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign minister AK Abdul Momen states that, “The rate, scale, and scope of this advancement – also known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution – are yet to be fully analysed and understood. But, one thing is for sure, the first wave of impact will be on our jobs. New jobs, such as medical roboticists, simulation engineers, or future forecasters will surface.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, economist Anu Muhammad states that a complete upheaval of the human workforce is not possible, since the unemployed population will not be able to afford the automated goods and services, which in turn will cease production. He recommends policies and frameworks to be established by the government, in congruence with private sector entrepreneurs, keeping a balance between automation and stable employment.&lt;/p&gt;. &lt;p&gt;The insurgence of automations will also not threaten jobs that require human empathy and ingenuity. Jobs where human guidance or care is needed, like that of teachers and nurses, or creative works like that of artists and authors, cannot be overtaken by smart machines, or at the very least, should not be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shamsul Alam, senior secretary of General Economics Division, Bangladesh Planning Commission, recommends a plan for transitioning to 4IR. The plan emphasises technology adaption through smart and competitive trade policies fueled by an expansive manufacturing sector and populated by workers who would be educated and trained in the technologies of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the core of 4IR lies the rise of advanced technologies, and based on the effect of prior industrial revolutions, the need for specialists and engineers adept in those technologies will rise at a similar pace. Emphasis, therefore, should be placed on strategically guiding the existing workforce to adapt while effectively nurturing the future one to excel. This is where the education system and academia steps in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle the demand for a generation adept in 4IR, the educational structure of today needs to be upgraded. Before higher studies, students should be familiarized, conceptually, with basic STEM curriculum. However, the updated curriculum should not overbear the young minds with a barrage of technical terms and techniques. A school student should not be tasked with perfecting the fundamentals of a programming or scripting language, rather be taught the interesting and fun ways logic and processes, ones they are familiar with in real life, can be structured and configured by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most drastic change in curricular structure should be implemented in universities, where the specialization of knowledge and career occurs. A common issue fresh graduates face when embarking on their careers, as seen in IID’s survey findings, is the discrepancy between what they have been taught and what is required of them in their jobs. Sometimes this discrepancy can even halt or harm their employment opportunities. To mollify this discrepancy, quantitative and digital literacy, computing skills and internship opportunities should be integrated in fields that have not conventionally required it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For integration, the teaching learning methods – syllabus, content, delivery medium – must be upgraded regularly through a continuous quality inspection. Universities must identify how new technologies transformed and evolved the respective job markets for each major or field. Moreover, blended learning should be employed on existing courses, by incorporating media beyond the conventional yet irreplaceable face-to-face one, to make these more practicable and applicable in a 4IR-centric workforce.&lt;/p&gt;. &lt;p&gt;For the generation already done with their education and in the workforce right now, top-up trainings should be conducted, to accommodate them with the new demand. Top-up trainings or degrees refer to schooling on a specific subject equivalent to that of the final year of undergraduate studies. This means workers in the middle of their career will spend a dedicated time for educating themselves, augmenting their skills and professional assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norms like life-long educational and skill-development practices must be cultured and embedded in both academia and professions alike. To improve their human resources in terms of technological competence, industry should collaborate with the academia. Other than providing schooling facilities, academia, through research, can instruct the industries in the technologies to learn, how best to integrate these into their current business operations and how to evolve according to the shifting waves of the fast-expanding 4IR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, as a nation, are standing at a decisive crossroads where both delaying and hastily adopting 4IR will lead to the same perilous path of missed opportunities and economic unrest. The full potential of 4IR can only be enjoyed through extensive research, smart planning and timely implementation. Conversation and collaboration among policy makers, the industry and academia is the key and very first step to our technological salvation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* Dr. Kazi Muheymin-Us-Sakib is a professor and former director of Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka. &lt;strong&gt;Email: muheymin@gmail.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* Syed Fatiul Huq is an alumnus graduate student at Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka and a PhD admit at the University of California, Irvine. &lt;strong&gt;Email: s.f.huq11@gmail.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
