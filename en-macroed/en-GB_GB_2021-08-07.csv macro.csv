Using artificial networks will help us to understand how brain structure supports brain function. In turn, using empirical data to make neural networks will reveal design principles for building better AI.

“So, the two will help inform each other and enrich our understanding of the brain.”Separate research from the University of Delaware in the US found that coating sensors and other bioelectronic devices in polymer could help them to integrate more easily into the human body.The researchers were seeking a way to insert microelectrodes containing gold, stainless steel and silicon into human brain tissue without causing scarring, which also affects their electric signals and prevents them from operating properly when they created the coating.Coating  the components in the organic polymer, known as PEDOT, which was sold commercially as an anti-static coating for electronic displays, allowed the signals to flow freely, increasing signal quality and the length of battery life.Dr David Martin, who led the study, was confident the research could contribute to the future merger of the human brain with AI, enhancing human capabilities with software and machine insight. “The ability to do the polymerization in a controlled way inside a living organism would be fascinating,”  he said. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Organizations seeing the most benefits from Artificial Intelligence (AI) work are more likely to be true believers in cognitive capabilities. Indeed, AI high performers, as identified by McKinsey, invested more of their digital budgets in AI than their counterparts, were more likely to increase their AI investments in the next three years, and employ more AI-related talent, such as data engineers, data architects, and translators, than their counterparts.
""Winning support for AI across the business is crucial for CIOs and other IT leaders hoping to scale their programs.""
Winning over the end users of AI-enabled capabilities is just as – if not more – important to your success.
“Winning support for AI across the business is crucial for CIOs and other IT leaders hoping to scale their programs,” says Dan Simion, vice president of AI & Analytics at Capgemini North America.
How to make the case for AI and build support: 11 tips
To successfully earn buy-in and sponsorship from C-suite executives and line of business teammates alike, there are several moves IT leaders can make:
1. Create excitement within IT
The implementation of AI across the entire Lenovo organization is enabling greater efficiency and effectiveness. But, says Arthur Hu, Lenovo Group’s vice president and CIO, in the past, there has been a gap between strategy and execution. Keep your eye on the macro picture, he advises. “AI is constantly changing, so during strategic planning, I encourage my team to talk about the lifecycle of technology that is currently in use around the company,” says Hu, who asks his team to consider what’s ready for retirement and what’s headed for the mainstream. “By letting my team get creative, it naturally builds momentum and develops excitement.”

2. Get executives involved to match AI to digital transformation strategy
Success requires plenty of input from senior executives. “Executives need to work with their AI teams to ensure that the AI system’s input and output will be aligned with their overall digital transformation strategy,” says Justin Silver, AI strategist at AI platform provider PROS. “Collaborative strategy sessions that bring together executives and AI researchers can bring broader visibility to AI initiatives and keep AI research and development efforts tethered to key needs of the business.”
3. Assemble other advisory councils
AI-enabled innovation must be co-created.
“When making [changes] like this it is important to connect and host advisory councils with your organization’s partners, suppliers, and employees to gain their insight and opinions on implementation,” Hu says. “By doing so, you will see where it is wanted and needed.”
Understand that while IT can assist in AI-enabled innovation, IT cannot demand it of the business, says Hu. It must be co-created. “We have to remember to encourage applied curiosity, and then we can figure out our next steps for execution.”

4. Integrate AI teams into the organization
“Don’t put an AI team in a small silo and tell them to transform the business by themselves,” says Peter Scott, AI consultant and founding director of Next Wave Institute. “That’s like running power to one only one room and telling them to electrify the enterprise. AI is leveraging the intersection of technology and cognition, and it impacts every part of your business where people are thinking.”
5. Personalize the benefits
To encourage user adoption of AI throughout an organization, IT leaders and managers need to demonstrate how the resulting changes will benefit employees. Present quality data that shows how business processes can be improved. “Presenting a successful use case with support from senior leadership and easily recognizable data can incentivize usage,” says Chris Fielding, CIO at Sungard Availability Services. “IT leaders and managers should clearly communicate to team members why the incorporation of AI is beneficial and the positive impact it will have on productivity and efficiency both day-to-day and in the long run.”
Staying people-focused will go a long way, says Silver of PROS. “Retention of employees who have the skills and experience working with AI systems can yield positive returns.”
6. Address job loss concerns
“One of the challenges in AI adoption is the fear that many functional leaders have about losing their jobs or becoming obsolete,” says Nancy A. Shenker, author of Embrace the Machine. “When it’s positioned primarily as a technology improvement or cost-saving advancement, line managers who don’t fully understand the power of AI and ML will start to freak out and get defensive about the human elements of their jobs.”
By emphasizing that AI allows teams to focus on the actions to take based on the insights generated by AI and ML solutions rather than spending time mining the data for patterns, it becomes clear that AI does not remove the need for human decision-making, but instead enables a more effective, efficient route to insightful outcomes, says Simion of Capgemini.

It may also be able to predict whether the condition will remain stable for many years, slowly deteriorate or need immediate treatment.Currently, it can take several scans and tests to diagnose dementia.The researchers involved say earlier diagnoses with their system could greatly improve patient outcomes.Identify patterns""If we intervene early, the treatments can kick in early and slow down the progression of the disease and at the same time avoid more damage,"" Prof Zoe Kourtzi, of Cambridge University and a fellow of national centre for AI and data science The Alan Turing Institute, said.""And it's likely that symptoms occur much later in life or may never occur.""Prof Kourtzi's system compares brain scans of those worried they might have dementia with those of thousands of dementia patients and their relevant medical records.The algorithm can identify patterns in the scans even expert neurologists cannot see and match them to patient outcomes in its database.Memory clinicsIn pre-clinical tests, it has been able to diagnose dementia, years before symptoms develop, even when there is no obvious signs of damage on the brain scan.The trial, at Addenbrooke's Hospital and other memory clinics around the country, will test whether it works in a clinical setting, alongside conventional ways of diagnosing dementia. In the first year, about 500 patients are expected to participate.Their results will go to their doctors, who can, if necessary, advise on the course of treatment.BBC NewsDenis and Penelope Clark want to know how his condition will progress, so they can plan for their futureConsultant neurologist Dr Tim Rittman, who is leading the study, with neuroscientists at Cambridge University, called the artificial-intelligence system a ""fantastic development"".""These set of diseases are really devastating for people,"" he said.""So when I am delivering this information to a patient, anything I can do to be more confident about the diagnosis, to give them more information about the likely progression of the disease to help them plan their lives is a great thing to be able to do.""Sometimes strugglingAmong the first to participate in the trial, Denis Clark, 75, retired from his job as an executive for a meat company five years ago.Last year, his wife, Penelope, noticed he was sometimes struggling with his memory. And they are now concerned he is developing dementia.Denis tries to describe his symptoms but Penelope interjects to say he finds it hard to explain what is happening.The couple are worried about having to sell their home to fund Denis's care. So Penelope is relieved they should not have to wait long for a diagnosis and an indication of how any dementia is likely to progress. BBC NewsNormally, Denis might need several brain scans to see whether he has dementia""We could then plan financially,"" she said. ""We would know whether as a couple we could have a few holidays before things get so bad that I can't take Denis on holiday.""Mental problemsAnother of Dr Rittman's patients, Mark Thompson, 57, who began having memory lapses 10 months ago, before the trial of the artificial-intelligence system began, said it would have made a big difference to him had it been available.""I had test after test after test and at least four scans before I was diagnosed,"" he said.""The medical team was marvellous and did everything they could to get to the bottom of what was wrong with me. ""But the uncertainty was causing me more... mental problems than any caused by the condition. ""Was it a tumour? Would they need to operate? It caused me so much stress not knowing what was wrong with me.""Follow Pallab on Twitter.The AI that spots Alzheimer's from cookie drawingDeepMind uses AI to tackle deadly diseasesDementiaArtificial intelligence",ReportageNewsArticle,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57934589,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'BBC News', 'publishingPrinciples': 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}",2021-08-10T04:28:59.000Z,2021-08-10T04:28:59.000Z,Artificial Intelligence may diagnose dementia in a day,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/177C1/production/_119539169_denisscan2.jpg'}",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/177C1/production/_119539169_denisscan2.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57934589,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'By Pallab Ghosh'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,

Forget the negative comments, the unsure colleagues, and general science fiction painted pictures of AI that you have been fed your entire life. From my personal experience as an AI proponent for the past three decades I know that the power AI has for doing good is exponentially better than anything negative. 


There is only one thing that causes AI to do harm. People. 

Fortunately for all of us there are leaders and visionaries across the globe that are paving the way and setting examples for every business to follow when implementing and leveraging the massive power that AI possesses. These people are AI Ethicists. 

Qualifications of an AI Ethicist

To start, an AI ethicist generally should have an understanding of AI tools and technology of the business and the industry and the specific AI ethical traps that exist in them, good communication skills and the ability to work across organizational boundaries and regulatory, legal, and policy knowledge.
PROMOTED
Beyond this skill set, the ideal AI ethicist for a company would possess a diverse perspective, have in their background interdisciplinary work experience, deep understanding of processes and policies both internal and governmental and be an excellent public speaker with the ability to project confidence when training or presenting to both internal stakeholders and external partners or clients. 
This position currently exists at many companies under different names such as Data Privacy and Ethics Lead (Qantas), Chief AI Ethics Lead (US Army Artificial Intelligence Task Force), Director of Responsible Innovation & Responsible Innovation Manager (Facebook) and several others.

In his work Mills shows an excellent example to try and emulate in his insistence that “An AI product is never just an algorithm. It's a full end-to-end system and all the [related] business processes...You could go to great lengths to ensure that your algorithm is as bias-free as possible but you have to think about the whole end-to-end value chain from data acquisition to algorithms to how the output is being used within the business.""

Dr. Croak’s work at Google is integral to the way AI affects nearly everyone’s life, especially all of us with a smartphone or a Gmail address. A tremendous question she asks that I agree with is around the fact that “there’s a lot of dissension, a lot of conflict in terms of trying to standardize on normative definitions of these principles. Whose definition of fairness, or safety, are we going to use? ...what I’d like to do is have people have the conversation in a more diplomatic way, perhaps, than we’re having it now, so we can truly advance this field.”

Deloitte is focused on achieving maximum human and machine collaboration. To do this they work to communicate their values on use of AI to every single member of their organization, no matter their level. This gets all of their people on one page which then translates when any of them communicate with external stakeholders.
Knowing that my peers in the AI space listed above are working towards a brighter and more ethical future brings me hope and pride. By following their examples and modeling our practices after theirs we can all create a future where the power of AI is leveraged for all that is good, driving society and humanity to approach our full potential.

A new tool co-developed by Microsoft using artificial intelligence to predict deforestation hotspots has identified nearly 10,000 square kilometers of the Brazilian Amazon that’s in imminent danger.Called PrevisIA, it uses artificial intelligence to analyze satellite imagery from the European Space Agency, and an algorithm developed by the Brazilian conservation nonprofit Imazon to find the areas most prone to deforestation.The tool, which the developers say could potentially be applied to any forested area on Earth, will be used for preventive actions, in partnerships with local governments, corporations and nonprofits.The next step of the project is to build partnerships with local governments and institutions to act on preventing deforestation, which is the most challenging phase of the project, according to Imazon researcher Carlos Souza Jr. Nearly 10,000 square kilometers of the Brazilian Amazon, an area the size of Lebanon, is at high risk of being cleared, according to a new tool using artificial intelligence technology to help forecast deforestation before it actually happens.
Named PrevisIA (from the Portuguese previsão for “forecast” and IA for “artificial intelligence”), the tool analyzes images provided by European Space Agency satellites, and through an algorithm created by the Brazilian conservation nonprofit Imazon, finds areas prone to deforestation.
Imazon studies published in scientific journals show that 95% of accumulated deforestation in the Amazon is located within a 5.5-kilometer (3.4-mile) radius of roads; 90% of annual fires occur 4 km (2.5 mi) from illegal roads built in the middle of the forest for logging, mining and land grabbing.

In 2006, the non-profit started to monitor satellite images manually to find these roads before the area around them was cleared of trees, but the laborious and time-consuming work prevented it from scaling up — a problem that the new technology aims to solve. The tool mapped so far the Brazilian Amazon, but could potentially be expanded to any forested area on Earth, the developers say.
The first report using the new tool launched last week shows that 192 municipalities have a high or very high risk of deforestation in Brazil’s portion of the Amazon. Additionally, 48 Indigenous reserves have the same level of risk, as well as 18 conservation units. Also at high and very high risk of deforestation are two quilombos, communities of the Afro-Brazilian descendants of runaway slaves, and 789 rural settlements. In total, this comprises 9,635 km2 (3,720 mi2) of threatened forest.
The next step of the project, developed jointly by Imazon, U.S. technology giant Microsoft and Brazilian mining company Vale, is to build partnerships with local governments and institutions to act on preventing deforestation, which is the most challenging phase of the project, according to Imazon researcher Carlos Souza Jr.
There are two main strategies: one involves civil society organizations and corporations; and the other, governmental institutions, Souza Jr. said. The private sector will act in a “positive intervention,” he said, an approach that includes providing municipalities with information technology to make progress on environmental management.

“We want them to attract the financial sector with differentiated credit lines for those capable of actually reducing deforestation. There are many market initiatives that could work there, such as carbon credits, investments in forestry, having protocols to actually quantify avoided [greenhouse gas] emissions,” he told Mongabay in a phone interview.
When it comes to the governments’ role, Imazon is betting on municipalities and state governments to take the lead, Souza Jr. said, since there are no open lines of communication with the federal government, which has often been criticized for its anti-environment stance.
“The states have the opportunity to become environmental protagonists. Deforestation does not bring any advantages, even financially; buyers of agricultural products are starting to boycott Brazil due to deforestation. People need to understand that it is actually more profitable to have the forest standing,” Souza Jr. said, adding that local prosecutors’ offices are also becoming allies in tackling deforestation.
He also said partnerships with corporations have great potential to boost environmental conservation, noting that the launch of the technology platform already demonstrated a difference in the participation of private parties, with companies actually using their expertise to help build the project instead of just donating money to nonprofits.

Rodrigo Kede Lima, Microsoft’s president for Latin America, said he believes PrevisIA is today one of the most important projects for environmental preservation. “Through intelligent algorithms in the cloud we are able to forecast deforestation and forest fires before they happen. This is one of the biggest examples that technology can help build a better world,” he said at the launch of the platform on Aug. 4.
“The planet is in a hurry, so should we [be],” Tania Consentino, president of Microsoft Brazil, said at the same online event. “The solution for the environmental issues require a coordinated action, not only from the government but together with corporations, nonprofits and society as [a] whole.”
Vale, Brazil’s biggest miner and a frequent target of criticism for its role in some of the worst environmental and social disasters in the country, joined the initiative because “protecting the Amazon is strategic,” according to Hugo Barreto, the company’s director of investments and social development. Speaking at the launch event, he said Vale today directly protects more than 10,000 km2 (3,860 mi2) of forest in the Amazon, and will increase this number by another 5,000 km2 (1,930 mi2).

La particularité de ces deux œuvres d'art ? Elles ont été créées par Artifly, une intelligence artificielle capable de prendre en compte les envies des utilisateurs pour concevoir une œuvre d'art sur mesure.


Art and artificial intelligence: two fields that seem so far away, yet can find such beautiful applications. Earlier this month, a digital artist by the name of Dries Depoorter designed a toolto unmask Members of Parliament when they were using their smartphones in plenary. In the same month, a small team of art and AI enthusiasts developed an algorithm called Artifly that allows users to create a personalized work of art according to their desires, which can then be purchased. Let’s take a look at this amazing new tool.
An artificial intelligence tool that creates works of art according to the style you want

In 2018, Christie’s, an auction company, sold “The Portrait of Edmond de Belamy” for $432,000 for a base estimate of $10,000. What is special about this work? It is the first work entirely conceived by AI (See our article dedicated to the Obvious collective, author of the portrait, in the magazine ActuIA N°3). A year later, Ben Kovalis, Eyal Fisher and Guy Haimovitz launched the Art AI gallery, a collection of artworks designed with the help of artificial intelligence and tools they have developed.
In July 2021, the three experts took their algorithm development a step further: they designed Artifly, a tool that allows users to design their own artwork automatically according to their desires, using AI. Users scroll through a selection of artworks and choose the designs that interest them. Artifly understands what style of art fits you and learns from your selections to create a brand new custom artwork in a minute, which they can purchase if they wish.
Will AI ever replace artists? Ben Kovalis refutes this theory.

When art lovers and specialists discover the tool of Kovalis, Fishet and Haimovitz, they are of course immediately intrigued, Ben Kovalis rightly explains:
“We are confronted with a common question when we present Artifly: “so you want to replace human artists with robots?”. When I hear this question, my answer is: Certainly not, first of all because we don’t think it’s possible to replace artists. It is simply something that improves art. Human effort is still needed to set up the artistic process. You need a lot of sweat, tears and human involvement to create an AI algorithm that creates something beautiful.”

He goes on to draw a parallel with music and the use of synthesizers in the 1980s:
“Not everyone liked the synthesizer. Many exploited it, many didn’t use it, but it became irrevocably something that helped create pop music. Today, the music is the same music we know and love, it just has a little bit of technology in it. It’s the same thing we do with art.”

Depending on what the algorithm comes up with, prices range from $29 to a few hundred dollars for the most expensive works. The three collaborators are now looking to see if there is a secondary (or resale) market that could exist based on the certificates of authenticity provided with the work and whether the price of the works made by Artifly will ever rise.

Challenge is next step in the NFL's Digital Athlete initiative, designed to improve the long-term health and safety of players


$100,000 in total prize money available; open through November 2, 2021
 




New York, August 10, 2021 – The National Football League (NFL) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) today launched a new artificial intelligence challenge to create ways for computers to automatically identify players using NFL game footage. New computer vision models created through the challenge will accelerate the NFL's work with AWS to better understand, and aim to reduce, injuries in the NFL. Prize money totaling $100,000 will be awarded to data scientists with winning models. The contest will be open through November 2, 2021.


This challenge is the next step in the NFL's work with AWS to develop the Digital Athlete, a virtual representation of an NFL player that can be used to better predict and hopefully prevent player injury. Last season, the NFL hosted its first computer vision competition, providing computer scientists NFL game data and challenging them to create ways to detect on-field helmet impacts. Nearly 7,800 submissions were received from data scientists around the world. Those solutions are now being used by the NFL and AWS in ongoing work on the Digital Athlete.


This challenge builds upon last season's competition by scoring teams based on how accurately they identify players involved in a helmet impact. The NFL will be providing data scientists with the same set of game data to build upon the current models. This competition will advance an already robust machine learning pipeline built on AWS that is working towards being among the most advanced and sophisticated injury surveillance and mitigation programs in professional sports.
 


""This competition is foundational in helping identify each player's risk to injury-causing events, especially when it comes to head health,"" said Jeff Miller, NFL Executive Vice President overseeing the league's health and safety programs. ""We are excited to enlist some of the most talented data scientists from around the world to help develop these solutions and meaningfully advance player safety.""


""Using AWS's broad range of technologies including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), the NFL and AWS will generate more new insights than ever previously possible into player injuries, game rules, equipment, rehabilitation, and recovery,"" said Priya Ponnapalli, Senior Manager, Applied Science, Amazon ML Solutions Lab. ""This contest will continue that work and the data and insights collected through this project have the potential to shape the future of football.""


The Digital Athlete will ultimately help the NFL and its clubs to leverage sports science and injury biomechanics to develop individualized training and recovery regimens, conduct real-time risk analysis for injury during games, and identify and evaluate additional player safety initiatives, including around equipment, rules changes and coaching techniques.

SDPs, zero trust, and VPNs are three methods of securing an enterprise. VPNs have historically served as businesses’ main defense  against external threats by encrypting tunnels between networks. But SDPs and zero trust networks are increasing in popularity, too. SDPs are networks that sit atop other networks to hide them from attackers or unauthorized users, acting like a cloak of invisibility to prevent network-based attacks. Zero-trust networks assume any user or device cannot be trusted, restricting every user’s access to network resources -- regardless of identity or network access history.

AI, zero trust support remote work technologies


Artificial intelligence and zero-trust frameworks have played a critical role in helping enterprises support a surging remote workforce.

Published: 11 Aug 2021


 
The COVID-19 pandemic made remote work technologies a necessity for day-to-day business. Microsoft Teams, Webex, Zoom and other collaboration offerings took the place of in-person meetings, sales calls and industry events.







Other technologies, however, have toiled behind the scenes to support distributed workforces. These technologies will continue to evolve as remote operations persist in the coming months. Panelists at the CompTIA ChannelCon conference, which concluded Aug. 4, discussed the technical underpinnings of home offices and unattended workplaces.

Zero trust, SASE emerge as essential
An increase in remote work has prompted a rise in zero-trust implementations, and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) has also landed on enterprise technology agendas. Zero trust emphasizes user and device authentication to grant network access -- a security approach that's well-suited to remote workforces that blur traditional network boundaries. SASE, based on cloud architecture, can scale to accommodate increases in the number of remote workers.



""Technologies around the zero-trust architecture and Secure Access Service Edge became critically important,"" said Tracy Holtz, vice president of security solutions, North America, at distributor Tech Data.
Holtz, who participated in the CompTIA panel, also identified VPN, SD-WAN and web application firewalls as pivotal remote work technologies. ""Those will become a continued focus for every company as we evolve ... hybrid work environments,"" she said.
During the pandemic, more than 150 of Holtz's Tech Data team members transitioned from occasional to full-time remote work.








AI and ML bolster security
Artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) have also contributed to remote work security, although largely out of view.
""A lot of the ways AI has impacted this area [have] been in ... background processes,"" said Lloyd Danzig, chairman and founder of the International Consortium for the Ethical Development of Artificial Intelligence. Pattern recognition, used in ML, provides one example.
""There's a lot of pattern recognition involved in the cybersecurity protocols that keep companies safe every day during the normal course of business,"" Danzig said. That includes when people access servers from all over the country.
Pattern recognition lets people ""work much more fluidly from home using their own devices,"" he added.



Technologies around the zero-trust architecture and Secure Access Service Edge became critically important.

IoT supports lights-out operations
IoT, meanwhile, plays a role back in the main office, as many workforces remain highly distributed.
""IoT, from a sensor perspective, has been a very important part of moving our world forward,"" said Robert Senatore, CEO at Data2Go Wireless, an IoT network services provider. ""We have a lot less people who are actually going to an office ... so IoT, the automation and the data collection through sensors, and other pieces of wireless hardware, have been really important to ... capture the data.""
He cited examples of sensors that provide temperature readings or indicate whether doors open or close. IoT, he said, helps businesses maintain control of their offices, gain information and take action on that information.


The future: Drones boost remote connectivity
Many remote workers have experienced poor connectivity -- in densely populated cities where peak-use periods can affect service quality, for example.
Kimberly Penn, founder and CEO at Professor Drones, a drone consultant based in Houston, suggested drones could provide a connectivity boost. ""It would be amazing to have a drone associated with 5G and some of the other [high-speed internet] technologies that ... could tether and help us stay connected,"" she said.

The Luddy Center for Artificial Intelligence is set to open this month, providing researchers a place to focus on the intersection of robotics, complex networks, health and social media.AI in medicineKay Connelly, Luddy School’s associate dean of research, studies proactive health and AI technologies that can help the terminally ill and older people as they age, specifically wearable devices. She said proactive health is like “Fitbit before Fitbit.”Her work is key in one of IU’s Grand Challenges, and it tackles how to get the right treatment to patients at the right time. To research how to treat gestational diabetes, women are given wearable devices to track their heart rate, sleep and physical activity. The hope is to prevent development of the disease and stop it from becoming Type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes diagnoses come during a woman’s pregnancy, according to mayoclinic.org, and the data collected from these wearable devices allows researchers to detect which women are at higher risk to develop gestational diabetes. Former Luddy School dean Raj Acharya’s work in AI also influences the medical community, especially as variants of COVID-19 continue to arise. Acharya currently has a National Science Foundation grant dedicated to reconstructing the genome of viruses using DNA and RNA sequencing, which is essential to the vaccine development process.He takes short, cut-up strands of DNA and RNA, then uses the information they contain to solve questions about the full strands, which scientists are not able to fully read. He said viruses want to fool the immune system — this is why viruses mutate — so AI and machine-learning techniques are used to reconstruct viruses to understand the structure and order of characters which make them up. He said the interaction between our immune system and viruses is a type of game theory. When a virus enters our body, our immune system learns and stores a sequence of the virus so it can fight it, but recombination of its character makeup allows the virus to trick our immune system.While Acharya uses sequencing for developments in the medical field, AI can also help researchers understand the evolutionary process called phylogenetic analysis, which is used to construct evolutionary trees showing which animals evolved from another. AI on the streetsIU computer scientist David Crandall’s expertise is computer vision, the part of AI that tries to get computers to recognize things and make decisions based on what they see. Self-driving cars use this kind of research because they need to recognize things like stop signs and be able to make the decision to stop. This process uses machine learning, which trains computers to recognize things based on a large data set. Machine learning is an important development because in the past it would take months or even years to program specific commands, but now machine learning can expedite the process by having the computer teach itself, Crandall said. Crandall said studying how children learn has been influential to this type of research. In the same way children begin to understand things by observing them over and over, so do the programmed machines. This is also how programs like Alexa learn to respond to a person’s command. Amazon engineers have given the computers powering Alexa thousands of collected audio clips and taught the algorithm how to recognize certain commands, Crandall said. These are examples of the black box model, which is a system used to study the inputs something is given and what outputs it gives back. More from IU:Students, faculty and staff praise mask mandate before fall semesterBeth Plale, a professor and executive director of the Pervasive Technology Institute at IU, does research in data provenance, which is essentially data auditing. Her job is to study algorithms and their similarities to unconscious human bias, which can be encoded because of structural issues in our society, she said. Plale said studying the outcomes of AI is important because if their work can be misused, people can use machine-learning algorithms to teach robots to be bigoted and do bad things. She brought up Microsoft’s conversational bot Tay, which was pulled from Twitter because just hours into its launch users had taught it to be racist and use inflammatory political speech. AI needs to be accountable, she said, and her work is focused on looking into issues that arise and mitigating them, like unconscious biases in algorithms or people's ability to manipulate outcomes. She says while trust in science is still high, transparency in the work researchers are doing is critical. Researchers need to jump on the important conversations early so they don’t become politicized. “There’s only so much a researcher — an academic researcher — there’s only so much we can do or say because there are forces that squelch our voices,” Plale said.What is driving research?As Michael McRobbie’s tenure as Indiana University’s president was coming to an end this June, one of his final moves was to dedicate the Luddy Center for Artificial Intelligence, a new “state of the art” facility for advanced AI research and machine learning. The $35 million center is part of a $60 million gift from alumnus Fred Luddy, who is the namesake of IU’s school of informatics, computing and engineering. Construction began in February 2020 and it is set to open this month. According to a news release from IU, the center’s initial focus will be robotics, complex networks, health and social media. “The explosion worldwide of the uses and applications of AI, building on decades of steady research progress, made this the perfect time for IU to establish a major holistic initiative in artificial intelligence,"" McRobbie said.During McRobbie's tenure he also launched the Grand Challenges program, a $300 million investment into solving some of Indiana's most pressing issues. These challenges include research into precision medicine, environmental change and addiction crises.Ethical questionsWhile artificial intelligence research can lead to breakthroughs that make people’s lives easier, IU’s faculty also is concerned about what consequences it will have and what conversations need to be had as the field develops. Both Plale and Crandall point to automated military drone strikes as an example of ethical problems society will have to grapple with. This discussion is particularly relevant in Crandall’s field of study, because computer vision would be used in such drones, and he said AI is notoriously bad at understanding things out of context. “I think they struggle in certain circumstances. For example we know that they struggle often when they encounter situations that they’ve never encountered before,” Crandall said. For example, a sticker on a stop sign may cause an autonomous car to not recognize it or act accordingly. The stakes are even higher when considering autonomous drones having the power to kill people without human intervention, and Plale said the ethical implications of whether military drones should have the power to do so is a problem society will have to face. She tied this in with the conversation of the moral considerations a sentient AI robot would be given if researchers are able to develop one. The moral considerations are broad questions that AI researchers should contribute to the discussion of, she said, but ultimately society will be responsible for coming up with the answers. However, Connelly believes IU and universities in general are a good place for ethical discussions because there are diverse voices at the table and the structure of funding and research is different compared with a corporation. “You find that people who are advocating for the ethics often get pushed aside, or pushed out completely because it doesn’t fit in that profit model,” she said. Corporations also tend to ignore the populations Connelly’s research is focused on because there’s less profit incentive in low-income communities. Her research is specifically targeted to making sure people with increased risk of health disparities get access. Benefits of IUIn addition to the less-profit-based research IU is able to engage in, Connelly believes the university setting is perfect because diverse voices will be heard and be able to point out when research is short-sighted or developments don’t take into account their communities. She mentioned problems with facial recognition not working for people of color in some cases as a potential way more diverse voices can shape the future of AI. She believes IU does a good job mentoring students from all backgrounds, including first-generation or students with a non-English primary language, because IU's apprenticeship-style research helps students learn the ""nitty gritty"" of the field.“They are bringing their perspectives to the table, so students are critical,” Connelly said. In terms of research resources, IU is well situated thanks to top-notch researchers in all fields of AI and having medical professionals and experts within other schools at IU, Acharya said. He said with IU’s Grand Challenges there is a lot of cross pollination between the Luddy School and IU Health faculty in Indianapolis.In the three ways of looking at AI — algorithmic or computer science, cognitive science and hardware — IU has great people in all three, Acharya said. Plale also pointed out IU’s well positioned infrastructure, including Big Red 200, a supercomputer designed to support research in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics, which was installed in January 2020. Plale noted Crandall’s research in the cognitive science department is a collaborative effort with the psychology department, where studies are looking at how babies learn, which allows the cognitive science department of the Luddy School to apply those methods to machine learning development.  “I think what it suggests is that the collaborative activity that goes on in the academic setting can infuse new thinking,” Plale said.Another collaborative effort Connelly brought up was IU’s Observatory on Social Media, a joint project between the Luddy School, The Media School and Network Science Institute. This project unites data scientists and journalists to study the role of media and technology in society. Connelly worries about manipulation of entire segments of the population, which she believes algorithms on social media can propagate. She sees it as a direct threat to democracy. She said people fall into silos of information and when that happens you’re not exposed to a breadth of information and alternative viewpoints. In 2017, former FBI agent and cybersecurity expert Clint Watts testified before Senate Intelligence Committee about the role Russian bots played in the 2016 presidential election. He said Russians used ""armies"" of Twitter bots to spread misinformation about the election, and in 2017 he'd already been tracking this kind of activity for more than three years.Connelly said everyone is susceptible to this regardless of their views, and she thinks social networks can enforce seeking approval and conforming to whichever way you lean on issues. When you start to sway on issues, those silos are an effective way to pull you back in.AI in mediaArtificial intelligence has been a part of science fiction media since at least the 19th century, and in the same way science fiction has had different portrayals of how AI will become part of our lives, IU’s researchers have different attitudes toward the depiction of AI in literature and film. Crandall, for example, rolls his eyes at a lot of the depictions of AI in the media because it’s very dramatic, especially concerning things like an AI ignoring its programming and thinking for itself. For example, recent movies like ""Ex Machina"" and ""Her"" explore the potential relationships between humans and sentient forms of AI. ""Ex Machina"" (2015) ponders the idea of the creation surpassing the creator and whether an AI can escape the black box, and ""Her"" (2013) explores whether humans can fall in love with an AI. “The state of robotics is that just doing something like folding a piece of clothing is like, beyond what any robot is able to do right now in any reasonable amount of time,” he said. While the more dramatic depictions of AI are a bit laughable to him, Crandall recognizes the more subtle ways AI can control parts of people’s lives, such as using Facebook to influence elections. He said it seems innocent, but it can become something that controls what people see. While this is much more subtle, Crandall said conversations are needed about these negative impacts and where AI goes from here. Plale did not want to speculate too much about media representation, but she is also skeptical about some of the sci-fi portrayals of AI. She said from what she’s seen, AI in the media has been given much more sentience than what exists today, and while robots in factories are very well developed, the ability to get them to process things and react the way a human brain does is limited. Acharya is a bit more optimistic about the role of sci-fi in the development of AI, and thinks in many ways the genre helps researchers be more imaginative. “I think in a way that the media people might be ahead,” he said. “The science fiction is probably ahead because the scientists are constrained by what can happen today. Media people can imagine.”Hopes and fears for the future of AIAs artificial intelligence continues to carve out a role in our lives, IU’s researchers are determined to make the future of AI a positive influence on the lives of Hoosiers. To make sure they usher in technology as a social good, Plale believes the conversations on ethics and the research being conducted need to move forward simultaneously. Acharya brought up deepfakes, which use a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to make realistic-looking images of fake events, as an example of AI being abused by people with bad intentions. In September 2019, AI firm Deeptrace found that 96% of deepfake videos were pornographic, and Boston University law professor Danielle Citron said “Deepfake technology is being weaponized against women” because it can fuel things such as hate porn. Still, Acharya is optimistic about the role AI will play in the lives of people moving forward. He said continued AI research in the medical field will be important in the lives of retired people, as it will allow more of them to live more fully as they age and develop medical problems. Human and machine becoming one is the ultimate goal, he said, in the sense that research into artificial limbs and organs can extend and have a positive impact on people’s lives.Also, hypothesis generation, a new type of AI application which speeds up the process of developing hypotheses and comes up with new ones researchers might have overlooked, helps make research more efficient, Acharya said. Overall, his outlook on the future of AI is positive.For research as a whole, one issue Crandall sees is some researchers’ eagerness to present things without full context because they want their work to seem like a breakthrough. It’s not anyone’s fault, he said, and it might not even be a bad thing because it gets people talking about the work, but the hype about some developments in AI aren’t always centered in reality. More from IU:IU researchers developed a program that maps cities' green spaces, infrastructure“The reality is much more boring,” he said.People have also blown the hype around AI’s impact on the job market out of proportion, Crandall said, and he compared it with the same type of hype around the internet being a job killer when it came out. Forbes reported that in a Gallup poll from 2018, 73% of Americans believed AI would be a net job destroyer, but only 23% of them were worried about it, partially because they didn’t believe their jobs would be affected. “It’s hard for me now to really predict what really the impact will be of AI,” Crandall said. “Except that like, I think it really is something that we have under our control.”He brought up self-driving trucks as an example of something that could push people out of certain jobs, but he’s curious what effect that will have on the job market as a whole. Automating 99.9% of what goes into driving is easy, he said, but in the 0.1% of cases where unexpected things happen, AI is not good at anticipating and reacting the way a human would. He said he’s comfortable with the current situation of trusting the people around him to make responsible and rational decisions while he’s driving. “Somehow we’ve grown accustomed and we’ve grown comfortable with this situation, which when you think about it that way is quite terrifying,” he said. “Every time you get on the road you have to trust everyone else who’s driving to do the right thing.”He thinks on one hand AI is good because you can program it to make decisions, but problems arise because society has to grapple with what decisions it should make. What or who an automated car should focus on protecting when a crash can't be avoided altogether is one example of the discussions Crandall says need to be had. “I think the tricky part is we’re going to have to decide, ‘What is the right thing for it to do?’” he said.ExpertsInSavings | Auto SavingsThe Sneaky Way Virginia Drivers Are Cutting Their Car Insurance Bills in HalfExpertsInSavings | Auto Savings|AdAdLearn MoreUndoFisher Investments7 Wealth Tips Once Your Portfolio Reaches $1 MillionFisher Investments|AdAdLearn MoreUndoLeaf Filter USAHere's What A New Gutter System Should Cost You In 2024Leaf Filter USA|AdAdLearn MoreUndoOnline Shopping ToolsAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackOnline Shopping Tools|AdAdUndoForbesVirginia: Reduce Your Car Insurance Bill If You Live In These Zip CodesForbes|AdAdGet OfferUndoCommonSearchesNew Electric Cars Are So Cheap Now (Take A Look)CommonSearches|AdAdClick HereUndoTheWalletWatcher.com7 Discounts Seniors Only Get If They AskTheWalletWatcher.com|AdAdUndoFlirtForDateDating For Older MenFlirtForDate|AdAdTry NowUndoPenny PincherVirginia Drivers With No DUI Are Getting A Pay Day On WednesdayPenny Pincher|AdAdRead MoreUndoFisher InvestmentsEstate Planning Basics [Free Guide]Fisher Investments|AdAdLearn MoreUndoDeal of the DayREVIEWEDOur Favorite Eye Massager is Less Than $50 During Amazon Prime DayREVIEWEDView Deal Recommendations are independently chosen by our editors.

Imagine what a lawyer does on a given day: researching cases, drafting briefs, advising clients. While technology has been nibbling around the edges of the legal profession for some time, it’s hard to imagine those complex tasks being done by a robot.
And it is those complicated, personalized tasks that have led technologists to include lawyers in a broader category of jobs that are considered pretty safe from a future of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence.
But, as we discovered in a recent research collaboration to analyze legal briefs using a branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning, lawyers’ jobs are a lot less safe than we thought. It turns out that you don’t need to completely automate a job to fundamentally change it. All you need to do is automate part of it.
While this may be bad news for tomorrow’s lawyers, it could be great for their future clients – particularly those who have trouble affording legal assistance. 
Technology can be unpredictable
Our research project – in which we collaborated with computer scientists and linguists at MITRE, a federally funded nonprofit devoted to research and development – was not meant to be about automation. As law professors, we were trying to identify the text features of successful versus unsuccessful legal briefs.
We gathered a small cache of legal briefs and judges’ opinions and processed the text for analysis.
One of the first things we learned is that it can be hard to predict which tasks are easily automated. For example, citations in a brief – such as “Brown v. Board of Education 347 U.S. 483 (1954)” – are very easy for a human to pick out and separate from the rest of the text. Not so for machine learning software, which got tripped up in the blizzard of punctuation inside and outside the citation.
It was like those “Captcha” boxes you are asked to complete on websites to prove you’re not a robot – a human can easily spot a telephone pole, but a robot will get confused by all the background noise in the image.
A tech shortcut
Once we figured out how to identify the citations, we inadvertently stumbled on a methodology to automate one of the most challenging and time-consuming aspects of legal practice: legal research.
The scientists at MITRE used a methodology called “graph analysis” to create visual networks of legal citations. The graph analysis enabled us to predict whether a brief would “win” based on how well other briefs performed when they included a particular citation.
Later, however, we realized the process could be reversed. If you were a lawyer responding to the other side’s brief, normally you would have to search laboriously for the right cases to cite using an expensive database. But our research suggested that we could build a database with software that would just tell lawyers the best cases to cite. All you would need to do is feed the other side’s brief into the machine. 
Now we didn’t actually construct our research-shortcut machine. We would need a mountain of lawyers’ briefs and judicial opinions to make something useful. And researchers like us do not have free access to data of that sort – even the government-run database known as PACER charges by the page. 
But it does show how technology can turn any task that is extremely time-consuming for humans into one where the heavy lifting can be done at the click of a button. 



Sewing machines didn’t replace seamstresses but they changed the job considerably.

A history of partial automation
Automating the hard parts of a job can make a big difference both for those performing the job and the consumers on the other side of the transaction.
Take for example, a hydraulic crane or a power forklift. While today people think of operating a crane as manual work, these powered machines were considered labor-saving devices when they were first introduced because they supplanted the human power involved in moving heavy objects around. 
Forklifts and cranes, of course, didn’t replace people. But like automating the grind of legal research, power machines multiplied the amount of work one person could accomplish within a unit of time.  
Partial automation of sewing machines in the early 20th century offers another example. By the 1910s, women working in textile mills were no longer responsible for sewing on a single machine – as you might today on a home sewing machine – but wrangling an industrial-grade machine with 12 needles sewing 4,000 stitches per minute. These machines could automatically perform all the fussy work of hemming, sewing seams and even stitching the “embroidery trimming of white underwear.” Like an airline pilot flying on autopilot, they weren’t sewing so much as monitoring the machine for problems.
Was the transition bad for workers? Maybe somewhat, but it was a boon for consumers. In 1912, women perusing the Sears mail order catalog had a choice between “drawers” with premium hand-embroidered trimming, and a much cheaper machine-embroidered option.
Likewise, automation could help reduce the cost of legal services, making it more accessible for the many individuals who can’t afford a lawyer.   


Legal scholar Miriam Cherry discusses workplace automation with Elizabeth Tippett.

DIY lawyering
Indeed, in other sectors of the economy, technological developments in recent decades have enabled companies to shift work from paid workers to customers. 
Touchscreen technology, for example, enabled airlines to install check-in kiosks. Similar kiosks are almost everywhere – in parking lots, gas stations, grocery stores and even fast-food restaurants.
At one level these kiosks are displacing paid labor by employees with unpaid labor by consumers. But that argument assumes that everyone could access the product or service back when it was performed by an employee.  
[Insight, in your inbox each day. You can get it with The Conversation’s email newsletter.]
In the context of legal services, the many consumers who can’t afford a lawyer are already forgoing their day in court altogether or handling legal claims on their own – often with bad results. If partial automation means an overwhelmed legal aid lawyer now has time to take more clients’ cases or clients can now afford to hire a lawyer, everyone will be better off.
In addition, tech-enabled legal services can help consumers do a better job of representing themselves. For example, the federal district court in Missouri now offers  a platform to help individuals filing for bankruptcy prepare their forms – either on their own or with a free 30-minute meeting with a lawyer. Because the platform provides a head start, both the lawyer and consumer can make better use of the 30-minute time slot.
More help for consumers may be on the way – there is a bumper crop of tech startups jostling to automate various types of legal work. So while our research-shortcut machine hasn’t been built, powerful tools like it may not be far off. 
And the lawyers themselves? Like factory and textile workers armed with new power tools, they may be expected to do more work in the time they have. But it should be less of a grind. It might even free them up to meet with clients.

Miami Dade College Receives Nearly $1 Million from National Science Foundation to Fund Artificial Intelligence

  








Miami, August 9, 2021 – Miami Dade College (MDC) has been awarded a grant for nearly $1 million from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses with an interdisciplinary approach and ultimately offer a College Credit Certificate in AI, one of the fastest growing industries right now.
As part of the grant, the College will provide industry-based professional training for MDC faculty to develop and pilot AI courses, and integrate AI curriculum into existing courses. Additionally, MDC’s School of Engineering and Technology (EnTec) will provide support mechanisms that engage and encourage underrepresented minorities students to study AI, while establishing multiple entry points into AI for traditional students and existing professionals. The project seeks to meet students where they are geographically, economically, and academically.
“We are very excited to lead the efforts to create an AI for All model,” said MDC President Madeline Pumariega. “This generous grant will support MDC’s mission to prepare all students and faculty with the necessary skills to succeed in today’s innovative labor market and diversify Miami’s growing tech ecosystem.”
The four-year grant will be implemented at MDC in collaboration with the University of Florida, Texas A&M University-Commerce (TAMUC) and the non-profit organization AI4ALL. The project will also have support from AI experts from companies including IBM, AWS, and Microsoft.
“With this project, we hope to learn more about how students come to see themselves as the kind of individuals who study and work in AI, and how we can create more supportive environments for students, particularly those from racially and ethnically marginalized backgrounds, to study AI” said Sarah Rodriguez, Associate Professor at TAMUC and researcher for the grant.
The collaboration with TAMUC will provide MDC with an opportunity to research how best to serve all college students in AI and how the AI program builds STEM identity and AI self-efficacy, particularly among Hispanic and Black students.
“This grant will support the college’s efforts to create AI interdisciplinary courses for all college students,” added Antonio Delgado, Dean of EnTec. “Collaborations with leading AI institutions and companies puts us at the forefront of AI workforce development.”
EnTec is currently offering the course AI Thinking, which explores different technologies utilizing concepts and skills widely accepted for AI and digital competency. The course will be available during the fall semester starting Sept. 29 at MDC North Campus, where the new AI Center is currently under construction.

All these terms fall under the same domain but they have their individual applications and meaning. For the tech companies, the application of these terms is given the top list priority. Even the job hirings for these domains is increasing at a high rate. It has increased 74% according to Linkedin's 2019 &quot;Emerging Jobs&quot; report. The salary offered to a data scientist and AI engineer is quite high which is above US$100k. The growing need for talents in such jobs has triggered a number of universities to provide degrees in those domains, many new courses, diplomas, full-time courses, private boot camps have emerged and also are still emerging. But a question arises about which domain's course should be taken up. Is it AI, ML, or data science? Is there any difference?.Answering this, yes there are differences but the difference is not a definite one. There is a very thin line of boundaries among the three which cannot be ignored. Many universities tend to ignore the boundary and provide degree programs based on the combination of the three. This makes students unclear about which field their focus is on. So, it is important to mark the differences and provide proper guidance to the students..Where does the difference lie between the three domains?.Artificial intelligence refers to machines that have the potential to replicate the cognitive capabilities that are associated with the human mind. It is about replicating human minds' capabilities..Machine learning is generally considered to be the potentiality of a computer program to learn or boost performance through examples rather than detailed programmed rules. Machine learning is one of the essential tools which data scientists use to examine and interpret data..Data science refers to the accumulation of methods, tools, and practices of analyzing data to interpret and derive insights in order to support decision-making..Both AI and data science use machine learning as key tools. In AI, ML tools are used in real-time to allow machines to execute their action. ML is the essential tool in the field of AI to develop intelligent agents. In the field of data science, ML is used as a data analysis tool to unlock patterns in data and to make predictions..What should you learn?.After understanding three different fields of expertise, you need to think about what your goals are and which one you prefer. If you want to go for research work then preferably the field of data science is the one for you. If you want to become an engineer and want to create intelligence into software products then machine learning or more preferably AI is the best path to take..Still, if you are not sure which path to choose you can start with data science because after all data is everything, data is the key to success in all the fields whether it is AI or ML. Strong expertise in processing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data, along with statistical knowledge, will benefit you no matter what path you ultimately take..But it is important to note that if you are just starting your career, try to build your domain knowledge before spending your time learning about data science or ML or AI. If you have adequate domain knowledge you will maturely understand the problem you are trying to interpret and also recognize how AI or ML or data science can play a role in solving it..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
