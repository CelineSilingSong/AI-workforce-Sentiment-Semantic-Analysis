Generative AI is here to stay, but so are artists
Generative Artificial Intelligence is the next commercial frontier for AI. What appeared as a surreal meme generator earlier this year has turned into a goldrush with the success of companies like Stability AI. Max Lunn digs into how they work, their use cases, the issues plaguing them – and why long-termism has clouded the artist debate.

Ever imagined what Soviet Afrofuturism looks like? Me neither, but you don’t have to imagine: DALL·E 2 has done it for you (see below). The digital visual landscape has been changed in a matter of months by three text-to-image AI image generators: DALL·E 2, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. Others such as Nightcafe are also gaining in popularity. In essence, these allow those with access to generate totally new images, based on human inputted natural language prompts.
The results have been startling: the generating models can instantly create novel photorealistic images that accurately follow complex optical phenomena or mimic idiosyncratic artistic styles. They can genre-mix, time travel and predict the future in a manner that suggests a boundless, wild imagination. Remarkably, some of these image generators are open source: anyone can access DALL·E 2 for free, plugging in their own absurdities and leaving with their eery creations.
Although these three generators seemingly arrived out of nowhere, they do have predecessors. You may recall hyper-real images of faces starting to appear a few years ago – faces that in fact didn’t belong to anyone and were mere digital fictions. These arrived courtesy of ‘generative adversarial networks’ (GANs). Since GANs were introduced in 2014 by Google Researcher Ian Goodfellow, the tech has been widely adopted in image generation and transfer. Check out thispersondoesnotexist.com. 
Given DALL·E 2’s and others use for artistic purposes, it is worth noting the AI project ‘The Next Rembrandt’. This was a 3D printed painting based solely on data collected from Rembrandt’s oeuvre, and made using deep learning algorithms and facial recognition techniques. The painting is hugely convincing, appearing as a kind of archetypal Rembrandt, and full of accurately rendered emblematic features. As one of the people involved said: ‘we’re using a lot of data to improve business life, but we haven’t been using data in a way that touches the human soul’.





However, these models could not conjure up images from a simple text prompt: they were not nearly as accessible, or instant. Their predecessor actually came about in 2015 from automated image captioning – a mechanical version of the tedious ‘reCAPTCHA’ process we all are forced to do to prove our humanity. Machine learning algorithms had ‘learnt’ to caption images with natural language, putting them into descriptions. A group of researches from Toronto were inspired to try this process in reverse. One of their early successes was to create a blurry image of a green school bus, demonstrating it was possible to surpass a simple google image search equivalent, and instead invent new images.
The current generation of tools generate images using a process called diffusion. Before this takes place, the model is trained using a dataset of hundreds of millions of images, scraped from places like google images (along with their text descriptions, the ‘alt sets’). The important thing to note is that the new image does not come from the training data: the generator doesn’t just stitch existing images together. It comes from the ‘latent space’ of the deep learning model, which we can understand simply as a multi-dimensional, mathematical space in which the model sorts through images. Within the latent space, the training model ‘learns’ how to differentiate between images, by drawing out variables such as colour and shape. When a prompt comes through, the model will then match this prompt with an area of the latent space.
This is where diffusion comes in, which means that the image will start with a randomised set of pixels, before being added to with the prompt results from the latent space. The process has been described in artistic terms as “pointillism in reverse”, since instead of starting with a complete picture and fractionalising it into thousands of composite parts, the process begins with the pixels and gradually builds them up into something familiar.
Why now?
The virality of these generators has been evident since the summer. The most prominent images tend to be artistic, hyper-real or humorous – or some combination of the three. Having addressed how these generators work, it is worth understanding why they have all appeared with such gusto.
It is most straightforwardly explained in terms of compute power: they are bigger and better. The first AI breakthroughs of the late 2000’s came from both computer’s ability to run very large neural networks and the provision of millions of data points from the internet to train them. The leap from these earlier ‘analytical’ AI breakthroughs – i.e. predicting the ETA of your delivery – to the current ‘creative’ model embodied by DALL·E 2 turns on size. Compute has become cheaper, and the new techniques such as diffusion models have massively shrunk down the costs required to train AIs. Concurrently, researches have created better algorithms.
A straightforward example is the OpenAI’s GPT-3 from 2020, versus its 2019 GPT-2 model. GPT stands for ‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer’ and it is a language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. GPT-2 was ‘fed’ 40 gigabytes of data (7,000 unpublished books) and had 1.5bn ‘parameters’. GPT-3 was given 570 gigabytes – made up of more books and the entirety of Wikipedia, among other things – and boasted 175bn parameters. Its training required far more computing resources, but it hugely outperformed its forerunner, creating credible writing samples – such as this Guardian article convincing us robots come in peace. It is now used for writing code: Codex and Copilot, services based on GPT-3 are successfully able to turn programmers’ natural language descriptions of what they want into actual code.
GPT-3’s ability to simultaneously be a journalist and coder is indicative of the increasing breadth of tasks AI systems can take on, which explains the recent explosion of commercial interest. What until recently appeared as advanced meme generators are now seen as the business tools of the future. Jake Fawkes, a machine learning PhD student at Oxford University, explained this was down to the fundamental flexibility of these models. Whilst earlier breakthrough AI systems could solve one specific task, this current generation are known as ‘foundation models’.
Sequoia Capital puts this simply in a recent commercial overview of the sector:
'The fields that generative AI addresses—knowledge work and creative work—comprise billions of workers. Generative AI can make these workers at least 10% more efficient and/or creative: they become not only faster and more efficient, but more capable than before. Therefore, Generative AI has the potential to generate trillions of dollars of economic value’
Whilst image and text generators may have dominated the conversation given their instantly impressive results and open-source applications such as hugging face, the plethora of tools which are now ready to disrupt roles including graphic design, code design and video editing is remarkable. One London-based example is Colossyan AI, which allows you to create videos with AI actors (image below).





Take the Media & Advertising: the ability to automate agency work and improve ad copy is one use case. There are great opportunities here for multi-modal generation that pairs sell messages with complementary visuals.
So where’s the evidence of this? Where are the salivating venture investors? Much hype accompanied the recent $101M funding raise for open-source platform Stability AI – with the New York Time’s describing a recent event hosted by the company as a ‘coming out party for Generative AI’. Stability AI is the creator of the Stable Diffusion – a generator differentiated by its open-source nature. Stability AI has made public all of the details of its AI model, including its weights. There is a palpable sense that generative AI is in, and web3 and the metaverse are out. SBF’s spectacular fall from grace with FTX’s recent capitulation only served to underscore this.
Commercial barriers 
But there are issues. The underlying tech may be there, but not everyone is on board: worries about the possible uses and effects of these tools provoke fierce debate. These range from the proliferation of child-porn, to the death of the artist, and the projection of ludicrous levels of racist and sexist bias.
The Imagen team in particular are acutely aware of the potential pitfalls of AI imagery, with an explicit statement about “Limitations and Social Impact” on their research page. “There are several ethical challenges facing text-to-image research broadly,” the statement reads. “First, downstream applications of text-to-image models are varied and may impact society in complex ways … Second, the data requirements of text-to-image models have led researchers to rely heavily on large, mostly uncurated, web-scraped datasets [that] often reflect social stereotypes, oppressive viewpoints, and derogatory, or otherwise harmful, associations to marginalized identity groups.”
The academic community is particularly vocal in their opposition to the widespread use of these generators due to the data they are trained on. A widely cited paper by Abeba Birhane, Vinay Uday Prabhu, Emmanuel Kahembwe entitled Multimodal datasets: misogyny, pornography, and malignant stereotypes spells out some of these concerns. The introduction points out: ‘[W]e found that the dataset contains troublesome and explicit images and text pairs of rape, pornography, malign stereotypes, racist and ethnic slurs, and other extremely problematic content. We outline numerous implications, concerns and downstream harms regarding the current state of large scale datasets while raising open questions for various stakeholders including the AI community, regulators, policy makers and data subjects.’
One only has to type in prompts such as ‘nurse’ on Stable Diffusion, for example, to be greeted exclusively with images of women or ‘CEO’ to an eery approximation of the average middle-aged white man. One of the few professional prompts that could generate any non-white figures was ‘fast food worker’. There are also more bizarre episodes which demonstrate the potential of these tools to create wholly unexpected and unpleasant images, threatening their commercial use: this twitter thread details the accidental and unexplained generation of horrific imagery.





These should be understood as cultural and commercial issues: no one will want to risk using generative AI in their business if the data they are trained on enforces damaging stereotypes. These aren’t teething problems, but fundamental issues. Companies such as Unitary are building contextual content moderation solutions by using machine learning models to analyse visuals, text and audio together to interpret content in context, but it has yet to be applied meaningfully to generative AI.
The death of the artist? 
Part of the wider cultural resistance to generative AI centres on the threat it poses to creative livelihoods. Who needs artists, writers or illustrators anymore when you’ve got DALL·E 2 and GPT-3 freely available. This was felt particularly keenly with the publication of an article in the Atlantic earlier this year by contributing writer Charlie Warzel about Alex Jones. To illustrate the article he used an image of Alex Jones he’d generated by Midjourney with the caption Alex Jones inside an American Office under fluorescent lights. AI art by Midjourney. The image works almost by accident; its blurry imprecision adding to the general chaos surrounding Jones at the time.





Soon after being put online, he received a deluge of hate from people online accusing him of taking away work from illustrators and artists. This panic felt by the use of these images has now subsided – much of it was the shock factor, although undoubtedly this will continue to encroach on illustrator’s livelihoods. But there are more nuanced points here: DALL·E 2 is trained on images taken from innumerable creatives stretching back millennia. It is therefore not a stretch to argue these generators are plundering the history of human creativity to make a commercial product.
These fears also tap into the wider debate on the existential threat of AI. The more advanced the machines become, the higher the chance of human bondage. Generative AI adds a unique aspect to this argument because it takes us on not at mapping out a route to work, or even beating us at chess – but creating original works of art. Art, often seen in opposition to science, has been co-opted by machines.
This existential fear is paraded most vehemently by ‘long-termers’: people who adopt an ethical stance which gives priority to improving the long-term future. Long-termism is a central tenet of the feted organisation Effective Altruism, whose prophets include Sam Bankman-Fried and the philosopher William MacAskill. These thinkers quantify morality precisely; working out exactly what deserves time and resources by reference to the size of the threat it poses. MacAskill recently highlighted a survey in which machine learning researchers predict there is a 50% chance of “human level machine intelligence” within 40 years, and that we are more likely to die from this than a car crash. There is a direct link between generative AI and long-termism in the form of OpenAI, the organisation behind DALL·E 2 whose founders including Elon Musk and Sam Altman are motivated by concerns about the existential risk from artificial general intelligence.





This is all perfectly valid. But the fear long-termism generates distorts the discussion of ‘the end of art’. Art is a fundamentally human pursuit and any suggestion these generators are replacing artists is not true. Let us think about impactful art in 2022: it is not pure mimicry of other artists; it is not odd images of Alex Jones in his basement; it is not posters of Soviet Afrofuturism. Impactful art is collectives such as Forensic Architecture – who act as an investigative taskforce, creating videos and aesthetic presentations of state violence and human rights violations, to correct official narratives. Photography didn’t finish off painting – in fact it became an indispensable tool for some of its foremost practitioners - Francis Bacon, for example. Good art requires a distance from its source material; a kind of shamanistic transformation. Generative machines cannot do this: they can only reorder and reconfigure that which has happened.
These generators will eventually be embraced as useful ideating tools for artists: allowing them to create quick mood boards or digital sketches. In the way marketers are not replaced by Canva, but empowered by it, AI generation is simply ‘templatising’ creativity.

Instead of humans reading your résumé, artificial intelligence technology is equipped to do the job. But can it do it well?

Last week, Amazon offered buyouts to its recruiters and could look to replace them with artificial technology software. This is in addition to the projected thousands of people who will be let go from the giant online retailer.


According to a confidential internal document viewed by Recode, Amazon has been working on an Automated Applicant Evaluation system that will determine which job applicants possess the most potential for success. These candidates will then be fast-tracked for interviews within the white-collar headquarters and warehouses. The software searches for matches between the applicant's résumé compared to current Amazon workers currently in the same type of role.

This isn’t the first time the retail juggernaut has attempted an AI recruiting tool. Amazon pulled an AI system in 2017 due to allegations of bias against women. However, it’s reported that Amazon’s new hiring AI is built to ensure that there won’t be prejudices in the hiring process.

PROMOTED
Why AI?
AI doesn’t have to replace recruiters. There will always be a need for human interactions between search professionals and job seekers. AI recruiting automates time-consuming, boring and repetitive tasks efficiently. The technology provides personalization and data insights during the interview process that can help make better decisions without emotions or biases. AI-driven human resources technology incorporates machine learning to perform human responsibilities more efficiently, freeing headhunters to focus on higher-end tasks, such as communicating with HR, internal corporate recruiters, hiring managers and candidates and seeking out new corporate clients.

HireVue
Kevin Parker, the CEO and chairman of HireVue, offers video interviewing and recruiting automation technology. Parker’s company has conducted millions of interviews and has the data to predict the best person for the job.
HireVue’s proprietary software enables companies to record videos of job seekers answering a standard set of interview questions. It offers the ability to interview anytime or anywhere. The technology levels the playing field by highlighting the person, in addition to their résumé.
Historically, hiring decisions have been left to a hiring manager’s “gut feeling.” To avoid biases and “just winging it,” HireVue created structured interview questions and rating guidelines to smooth out the process and make it easy for both candidates and companies who are hiring.
Cost Cutting And Layoffs Are The New Normal
Human resources and recruiters are usually one of the first divisions to get cut when the economy contracts. Nearly 140,000 people in the tech sector were downsized in 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi. Downsizing, hiring freezes and rescinding job offers have become commonplace. Since there won’t be aggressive hiring compared to 2021, there will not be a significant demand for their recruitment services. For example, Apple recently let go of 100 contract recruiters. Deploying AI is a cost saver for Amazon and other companies that need to reign in expenses due, in part, to record-high inflation and interest-rate hikes.
Amazon Plans To Layoff Thousands Of Workers
Amazon announced in a blog post its plans to lay off 10,000 employees, representing 3% of its white-collar professionals in corporate and technology roles. The cuts will primarily focus on money-draining units, such as Amazon voice-assistant Alexa and ebook-reader Kindle. Human resources will also be impacted, indicating that hiring will slow down compared to the aggressive staffing over the last several years. Although the number seems high, it represents 1% of Amazon's more than 1.5 million workers, including hourly warehouse employees.
This won’t be a one-and-done. In addition to the layoffs announced Wednesday by Dave Limp, senior vice president of devices and services at Amazon, there are numerous ways that the online retailer and other tech companies lighten their headcount. While most firms will deny that they use these strategies, tech workers cite that people are let go or pushed out the door through stack rankings, regretted and unregretted attrition, performance improvement plans and continuous rounds of downsizings.
The Downside Of Recruiting AI
Despite assurances that AI won’t have inherent biases, there is no guarantee that it will not occur. The algorithms are designed and built by humans who may possess their own conscious or unconscious biases.
Moreover, humans are not software code. AI may not be able to detect a job hunter’s personality, passion and lived experiences. Candidates are not products, and everyone has their own unique story. There will be issues that will require human intervention.
If a person was downsized and out of work for an extended period, took maternity or paternity leave or switched jobs several times because of impending layoffs, it would be beneficial for a recruiter to get involved and have a one-on-one conversation. If Amazon strictly hires people based on their similarities to current employees, the eCommerce giant runs the risk of creating a bubble of homogeneity, which will bar applicants who don’t fit exactly into the mold, but have a lot to offer.

Cerebras Systems and Jasper Partner on Pioneering Generative AI Work




As one of the first customers to leverage Cerebras’ new Andromeda AI supercomputer to design next set of customer-specific models, Jasper expects to vastly improve the accuracy of generative AI models






November 29, 2022 02:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jasper, the category-leading AI content platform, and Cerebras Systems, the pioneer in accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) compute, today announced a partnership to accelerate adoption and improve the accuracy of generative AI across enterprise and consumer applications. Using Cerebras’ newly announced Andromeda AI supercomputer, Jasper can train its profoundly computationally intensive models in a fraction of the time and extend the reach of generative AI models to the masses.

“Jasper is a category-defining company and the exact type of customer we build for – customers that are trying to transform economies with AI, who are unafraid to venture beyond the status quo and who are interested in doing pioneering work by inventing new approaches to deliver extraordinary results.”Post this

The rise of generative AI is one of the most important technological waves in recent history, enabling the ability to write documents, create images, and code software all from ordinary text inputs. Based on sophisticated generative AI models, Jasper’s products are used by nearly 100,000 customers around the world to write copy for marketing, ads, books, and more. With the power of the Cerebras Andromeda supercomputer, Jasper expects to dramatically advance AI work, including training GPT networks to fit AI outputs to all levels of end-user complexity and granularity. This improves the contextual accuracy of generative models and will enable Jasper to personalize content across multiple classes of customers quickly and easily.

“At Jasper we eliminate the tyranny of the blank page. Our platform provides an AI co-pilot for creators and businesses to focus on the key elements of their story, not the mundane. The most important thing to us is the quality of outputs our users receive. We are hyper-focused on continuously adapting our AI models to meet our customers’ needs,” said Dave Rogenmoser, CEO of Jasper. “Partnering with Cerebras enables us to invent the future of generative AI, by doing things that are impractical or simply impossible with traditional infrastructure. Our collaboration with Cerebras accelerates the potential of generative AI, bringing its benefits to our rapidly growing customer base around the globe.”

“Our mission is to build the fastest AI hardware for the most complicated AI problems. Our recent introduction of Andromeda, the industry’s largest supercomputer, advanced this vision by enabling our partners to train large language models more quickly, to higher accuracy, with better results in less time and with less energy,” said Andrew Feldman, founder and CEO of Cerebras. “Jasper is a category-defining company and the exact type of customer we build for – customers that are trying to transform economies with AI, who are unafraid to venture beyond the status quo and who are interested in doing pioneering work by inventing new approaches to deliver extraordinary results.”

Announced at SC22, the 13.5 million AI core Andromeda supercomputer delivers industry-leading performance and near perfect linear scaling without traditional distributed computing and parallel programming pains, enabling Jasper to efficiently design and optimize their next set of models. In initial work, on small workloads Andromeda was faster than 800 GPUs and on large complex workloads, it completed work that thousands of GPUs were incapable of doing. In a recent publication on Gordon Bell award-winning work, the authors wrote, “We note that for the larger model sizes (2.5B and 25B), training on the 10,240 sequence length data was infeasible on GPU-clusters due to out-of-memory errors during attention computation…. To enable training of the larger models on the full sequence length (10,240 tokens), we leveraged AI-hardware accelerators such as Cerebras CS-2, both in a stand-alone mode and as an inter-connected cluster.” It is these very GPU impossible workloads that Jasper has begun exploring, in the quest for more accurate and relevant models, trained in less time with less energy.

Andromeda is now available for commercial customers, as well as for academics and graduate students. Andromeda is deployed in Santa Clara, California, in 16 racks at Colovore, a leading high performance data center. The 16 CS-2 systems, with a combined 13.5 million AI optimized cores are fed by 284 64-core AMD Epyc Gen 3 x86 processors. The SwarmX fabric, which links the MemoryX parameter storage solution to the 16 CS-2s, provides more than 96.8 terabits of bandwidth. Through gradient accumulation Andromeda can support all batch sizes, a characteristic profoundly different from GPU clusters.

“AI is no longer just the domain of computer scientists or mathematicians; it is now a significant enabling force across all fields of science, which is something we live every day at CSIRO where digital technologies are accelerating the pace and scale of our research in fields ranging from agriculture to energy to manufacturing and beyond.”
— CSIRO Chief Scientist, Professor Bronwyn Fox

We are currently amid the largest surge, arguably ‘boom’, in the application and development of artificial intelligence (AI) for scientific research in history. Scholarly publications, patents, education, training, salaries, research activity and investment are increasing at unprecedented rates.

We may now be on the steepest part of the adoption and development curve. This is happening across the entire economy. Practically all industry sectors, advanced economies, professions and world regions are seeing rapid uptake of AI. The science sector is no exception. 
There’s a worldwide competitive race, and collaborative movement, to develop AI capability. Many scientists, and science organisations, are aiming to uplift AI capability.

AI may help scientists address humanity’s greatest challenges such as climate change, pollution, resource scarcity and infectious diseases. However, not all AI projects have met the expectations of scientists. 
Sometimes AI projects can be complex, costly, time-consuming and labour-intensive with limited results. The pathway to AI enablement, which most science organisations have embarked upon, is both rewarding and challenging.  

This report has been prepared to help science managers, science organisations and investors understand plausible development pathways for AI. Our aim is to describe how AI has changed science and what the future may hold.

Despite all the panicky warnings seen in the mainstream media, AI will not be taking over and automating peoples’ jobs. AI will be replacing manual tasks, not job categories. However, something very important is missing from the picture: the involvement of the employees who will be charged with making AI and data-driven enterprises work. AI is only ramping up demand for the human talent needed to guide AI systems to engage in tasks relevant to the business, monitor and maintain the fairness and actionability of AI decisions, and to build, program, update, and ultimately retire these systems.


That’s one of the takeaways of Deloitte’s latest research on the state of AI, which finds a lack of employee input into the ways AI will be deployed and what it will deliver.

“Assembling the technology and talent required to build, scale and innovate with enterprise AI is an evolving challenge,” the study’s authors, Nitin Mittal, Irfan Saif, and Beena Ammanath, all with Deloitte, point out. “Over the last few years, many successful AI models and training sets have made their way into commercially available software and open-source offerings that can help jumpstart efforts and mitigate effects of the talent shortage. However, the ability for an organization to achieve differentiated tools and applications with AI still hinges in large part on the talent it is able to bring in-house.”

PROMOTED
AI will amplify human capabilities in the workplace, and employees appear to be onboard with this addition to their organizations. Most survey respondents, 82%, indicate their employees believe that working with AI technologies will enhance their performance and job satisfaction.

However, there remain gaps in harnessing increased workforce optimism, the study’s authors add. There is awareness of the dual role humans and machines play in advancing data-driven enterprises. A sizeable segment of respondents, 43%, report their organization has appointed a leader responsible for helping workers collaborate better with intelligent machines. Also, 44% of all respondents reported using AI to assist in decision-making at senior-most levels.

There is also a significant gap in further actions needed to enable the hybrid human-machine workforce. Only 21% of all respondents reported actively educating workers on when to apply AI most effectively, the Deloitte study shows. In addition, only 25% reported providing access of user-friendly AI systems to nontechnical/nonspecialized workers, 30% reported including workers in participative design of AI, and 36% reported redesigning organizational practices in light of a mixed human and machine workforce.

Even among the organizations leading the way with AI, only a minority (32%) reported taking significant action needed to bring workers into greater collaboration with AI systems using innovation rewards or incentives for AI pilots.
“One of the biggest challenges to enabling stronger human and machine collaboration may be that leading practices around the talent models most likely to generate results are still emerging,” the Deloitte co-authors state. “That doesn’t mean all is unknown. An important element that has emerged in establishing positive working relationships with intelligent machines is to focus on fostering trust in algorithms by involving business specialists and frontline employees to help design them.”

Burnout of healthcare professionals has not waned with the pandemic but assistance from artificial intelligence may offer tired workers a reprieve from tedious tasks and a chance to better connect with patients.Half of physicians are experiencing burnout and 45% of physicians over 55 and 14% in the younger age group plan to stop seeing patients in the next three years, according to a survey from the Commonwealth Fund. Partially for this reason, primary care physicians and nurses are expected to leave healthcare in droves in the upcoming years.A survey by Incredible Health showed that 34% of nurses planned on leaving the profession in 2022. Of those planning to leave, 44% cited high-stress conditions and burnout as the reasons for wanting to quit.Some health systems and hospitals are turning to artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to help tackle tedious tasks and better triage patients.AI-enabled triage can shuttle patients to the ideal care providerThe work AI can do to reduce burnout is only just starting, according Anu Shukla, co-founder and executive chairman of health tech company Botco.ai.Of course, chatbots are already a common tool for communicating with patients, but Botco.ai is leveraging new technology that can be implemented in the highly sensitive behavioral health specialty.By using Botco.ai’s automated intake process, patients get to the right provider faster without wasting time at the point of care communicating things like change of address and insurance provider. The platform reports that 89% of respondents claimed that the company’s automated chat tools make it easier for patients to access mental health treatment.“We've come across all these applications for sentiment analysis that had to judge how people are feeling and so that's important in mental health applications,” Shukla told Fierce Healthcare. “We can recognize the words that lead to you putting up a message saying, 'If you are feeling you need immediate help, please call the suicide prevention health hotline.'”RelatedFrom finding the right candidates to keeping them, how hospitals are using AI to address workforce needsThe chatbot shows its greatest advantage in performing triage informed by machine learning, Shukla said, and can direct patients toward the right provider, saving patient and doctor time and reducing frustration. She used the example of an urgent care partner who reported 18,000 conversations moving through Botco.ai’s technology in the first three days after implementation. That provided the bot with more information to learn about the specific population accessing that provider’s website, what those patients tend to look for, what words they use and how they sound when they use them.Botco.ai uses sentiment analysis to see what is beyond a patient’s words, which sends them to the right provider and then gives that provider insights into a patient’s mental status. Shukla says that beyond triage, the use of AI technology is limited and potentially dangerous in the sensitive behavioral health space. But having a patient shuffled through a long, analog intake process when they need immediate care is also risky, she noted.“AI and humans working together is the right combination for many situations,” Shukla said. “We analyze the sentiment. If we get a dangerous signal, we flash the messages to call someone, or we just transfer them over with their permission and so now there’s a human being on the other end.” Depending on the time of day, that human may be in a hotline call center, or they may be a clinician.In behavioral health, Shukla emphasizes that AI decreases shadowy barriers to care, like stigma towards therapy. Shame related to seeking behavioral health support, notably within racial minorities, can be decreased by communicating with a computer instead of another person. For people accessing therapy for the first time, who may be from a culture that deems it an unobjectionable sign of mental weakness, a bot can decrease fear.  Shukla believes that providers want to see these patients and are frustrated when they can't support the populations they personally identify with. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, M.D., has listed health worker burnout as one of five current priorities. His office lists possible solutions to burnout as including the reduction of administrative burdens, increased use of human-centered technology and access to mental health and substance use care.  Physician demand will grow faster than supply leading to a shortage between 54,100 and 139,000 physicians by 2033, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC).To avoid the upcoming drop-off, the AAMC suggests better use of technology by health organizations to improve doctor training and patient care.Botco.ai published a survey in late August reporting that 73% of mental health facilities increased their online support tools in 2022 and 89% of mental health executives say AI-enabled chat improved mental health care accessibility for patients.Of the 120 executive respondents, 41% said they believe that the pandemic made mental health treatment harder to access and 55% said the pandemic further decreased access for racial minorities and LGBTQ+ populations.Online tools like chatbots were credited with connecting patients to care 49% of the time while other forms of outreach were less common, such as word of mouth (25%), doctor recommendations (19%) or advertisements (7%).Conversational AI tools were already in place in 61% of the facilities surveyed which included mental health facilities, behavioral health organizations, addiction treatment providers and rehabilitation centers.The report showed that the benefits extended to health professionals who can defer tedious work to the bot and work to the top of their license, providing care.Botco.ai found that 76% of facilities used automated chat tools to ease intake processes, with 83% using the tool to verify insurance benefits.Decreasing and streamlining administrative burden After the point of care, insights collected from Botco.ai are integrated into the provider’s electronic health records system to decrease administrative burden for clinicians and admin staff.Pegasystems is an API provider that also works to decrease friction in workflow by speeding up interactions and getting patients the care they need faster through AI. Pegasystems’ vice president of healthcare and life sciences Kelli Bravo sees AI as a key tool to help healthcare employees save time on copy and pasting.She uses the example of a client that communicates with customers on 919 different channels. Pegasystems can accommodate this high, complex volume while tailoring messages for customers.“There are a lot of dimensions that we're seeing today,” Bravo said. “Banks and financial institutions started being smart about this; Amazon is excellent at this. What we're trying to do is adapt that capability into the healthcare realm, because it does matter. People want to be able to relate to the context, they want to know and understand who they are, and they want to have empathy, we actually can dial in empathy.”AI can notify health system workers that a region has recently experienced a forest fire so the next time someone calls to talk about a bill, “the system will say, Look, this region needs to have a different conversation.”Other prompts can be served up like whether a patient has searched for information related to diabetes the last five times they’ve been on the health provider’s website. That way, providers can better inform their care and answer the questions patients might not even know how to ask. Interactions are more fruitful, giving providers a sense of satisfaction, according to Bravo.RelatedChaotic work conditions during COVID helped foster clinician burnoutThe system also analyzes workflows and prioritizes the task most valuable to the corner of the health system in question. For example, when assisting payers, Pegasystems’ AI chooses which insurance claim is the timeliest and places that at the top of the list.“That's a huge value of AI predicting what's the value-added work and getting that work prioritized and done and then distributing it to the right people based on what they're great at,” Bravo said. “It helps with retention and also helps with training. It gets so much faster, the system can develop workflows to guide you through the process.”AI can allow for human-to-human engagement with patients or health plan members, Bravo said.

Young     Nov 29, 2022 Alphavector / ShutterstockTweetShareEmailTweetShareEmailThis article is part of the collection: The EdSurge Podcast.Public high school in America was the product of the time of its invention, which was way back in 1821. But in this era of rapid technological change marked by artificial intelligence and robots moving into more aspects of work and social life, maybe the way teaching is done in high school needs a reboot.That’s the thesis of the book “Running with Robots: The American High School’s Third Century.” It is framed around the thought experiment: What would an ideal high school of the year 2040 look like? 
 
 The tour guides of this imagined school of the future are two authors: Jim Tracy, a senior advisor at the nonprofit Jobs for the Future who in his career has led private K-12 schools and served as a college president; and Greg Toppo, longtime education journalist. Surprisingly, these future-looking experts don’t talk that much about robots, or other high-tech tools in the book. They instead focus on how coming technological change will end up shifting the relationship between people and machines, and therefore between students and teachers. But while the book paints an idealized, almost utopian picture of this high school of tomorrow, we learned in our conversation that these authors think it will take some work to avoid some possible downsides of the tech that promises to enrich schools and learning.Listen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, Stitcher or wherever you get your podcasts, or use the player on this page. Or read a partial transcript below, lightly edited for clarity.EdSurge: In your book you imagine a scenario of a high school in 2040 that is designed to take advantage of a world more-heavily infused with artificial intelligence and robots. What is the biggest difference folks would see if they toured this futuristic school? Greg Toppo: One of the big changes is that even though we are sort of obsessed with this idea that technology is going to be a big deal in future high schools, [we think] that the humanities will play a bigger role than they even do now. And we need people to sort of see that before they see anything.Jim Tracy: One of the things that strikes me about this future is that [we predict] the technology [will] become integrated into the creative processes of students. So the technology will allow [a resurgence of] constructivism, so that the students are driving their own learning, following their own passions in any direction that it brings them. And the technology will allow that interface with their classroom … to be infinitely malleable.Having said that, one of the revelations for our chief protagonist at the end is when his guide … explains to him that learned teachers, master teachers, are more central than ever because the landscape is so infinitely malleable, the teachers become even more central—[we’ll really need] the presence of a learned guide. Why did you name your book “Running with Robots”? Toppo: We love the image, which is sort of counterintuitive to what so many people are fearful of. The received wisdom is that robots will take our jobs, and where we're gonna be left penniless and jobless and destitute. We wanted to kind of flip it and see what the possibilities were. And we do this now, you know—we run with robots all day. I just took a load of laundry out of the washing machine, and I'm using a robot basically to get my clothes clean, right? And so we are already running with robots. We're already using them to our advantage, and it will be even more of a mutual relationship 20 years from now. And it was a reference from a book we really admired.Tracy: Yeah it was from a book by [Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson]. The image that they used was that if you think about optimal chess playing, the best human chess player in the world will lose today to the best chess algorithm. By the same token, the best chess algorithm in the world will lose to a combined team of a mid-level algorithmic chess [system] coupled with a human chess player. So we're better together than either is apart. In your research you also visited actual high schools that are trying innovative practices that you say move toward this future. What’s an example in the real world today?Toppo: The examples we use in the book are not really technologically focused. The book focused on new ways of seeing the relationship between teachers and students and between students and the work they do. So one of the things that we were really interested in and focused on was this idea that the biggest change we need to think about is the students' relationship to their work and what the importance of their work is. One of the examples that I liked was a school in Iowa called Iowa Big, which is this experimental high school. And one of the students that we end up talking to there is this student who basically came from a traditional, several-thousand-person, four-year high school, and didn't really like it, was doing fine, and was college-bound. And then she sort of drops into this experimental school and realizes that she had no agency in that previous school, and nobody trusted her, and nobody really was focused on what she was interested in. Nobody really asked her the essential questions that were important to her. And [at Iowa Big], one of the very first questions that one of her teachers asked her was, ‘What makes you mad?’ And that opened up for her this sort of new world of, ‘Oh my God, I'm mad at a lot of things.’ And that was for her at least, this sort of entryway into accessing what was important to her. And she ended up organizing this huge conference about young women in careers. And she actually ended up cold calling the lieutenant governor of Iowa, who is now the governor, actually. And just really doing some amazing stuff that I don't think she would've done otherwise. What's the model or the mechanism that the high school used to get that to happen? Toppo: They were just super focused on kids actualizing themselves—finding what they're interested in, finding what they like to do and what the way they can contribute to the world and really relying on students themselves to figure it out. Tracy: One of the things is something I did at a school that I ran—Rocky Hill School. In that work we were trying to ask the question, ‘What is technology inflection going to mean for the role of humans in 10 to 20 years?’ And the answer that we kept coming up with—whether we were talking with educators or with some of the best software engineers in the world—was that we can't really know exactly what the capacity of AI is going to be in 10 to 20 years, but we can, with a high degree of confidence, say certain things that it won't be able to do yet. And if we look at that, then we can reverse-engineer the human domain that looks like it's going to be pretty safe as part of the workforce and the social sphere and so forth. And the domains that we kept seeing were the domains that are associated not with the intellectual knowledge economy, but rather with the more-compassionate, empathic economy.In other words, we have for the last century and a half in the knowledge economy been educating our students to become repositories of information—whether they're lawyers or doctors [or engineers] and so forth. And then somebody pays them a great deal of money to extract some of that knowledge from their heads. What's happening now is that's being reposited in algorithms increasingly, and that's only going to be more the case going forward, so that the most intelligent, capable medical diagnostician, I predict, will be a computer somewhere in the next 20 years. What is the role of the doctor then? The doctor's role is to be a knowledgeable interpreter of that algorithmic diagnosis—to check it, to make sure that there wasn't a snafu, and to make sure that there is no social bias in the outcome. And also to help interpret that into a regimen for treatment and healing on the part of the patient in a human-connected, empathic way. How then will we train doctors? And that's the critical point for schools, given that technological breakthrough, that now the knowledge economy is going to be owned by the algorithms. How do we train humans to be the empathic partners to that algorithm? And the way that we do that is to train them toward knowledge sufficiency so that they can understand what the algorithm is doing and interpret it for the layperson, but with empathic fluency. Also creativity is another domain that we felt would be still uniquely human. So if you think about how you then translate that into, say, K-12 or higher education, the doctors, for instance, will be trained in content literacy rather than content fluency and empathic and creative fluency. You would spend less time in high school training every student to take calculus and more time in portfolio-types of collaborative endeavors to solve problems.The book portrays a very optimistic 2040. But if new AI tools need to keep students within a courseware system to get the benefits of the algorithms, you could also imagine a more-dystopian version of what happens—where there's less diversity of teaching materials and less control by educators because of that. What advice do you have for curbing some of those impulses that may be inherent in the technology or the market forces?Tracy: I actually think that that's more likely. I think we're leaning heavily in the direction of the more-dystopian outcome, and I’m rather pessimistic. The book was an action of will—to assert, ‘Here's a vision that could be with the exact same technology if we assert a kind of agency of Paideia [a system of schooling from ancient Greek times to give a well-rounded education].On a more practical level, what do you see that educators can do to counteract that?Tracy: I don't know that I have the answer to that. I think that there are strong market and social and historical forces that are driving us toward less-desirable outcomes right now. And so everybody has to play their part. My part was to try to present a vision [for a positive future.] My role was more of a visionary.Toppo: As I look at the edtech landscape, the one thing that worries me the most is privacy. I feel like we need to get privacy right, and I I don't know what it will take to make that happen other than just cataclysmic disaster. My sense is that's gonna need to happen more broadly, that we're gonna have to get to a point where people really are hurting—that we will have to hit rock bottom before a more optimistic vision starts to kick in.Educators as a group don’t get into it to get rich, they get into it to make a difference. And my feeling is that once teachers are maybe more comfortable and familiar with the technology, they can have a hand in its development. To me that's a positive thing, and that opens a possibility that they'll be in control.Tracy: The systems that we have for public education are becoming more rigidified, not more experimental and resilient. And they're becoming increasingly non-functional. And I believe they're going to face some sort of systemic collapse. But what I do see that's hopeful is on the margins—and we highlight some of these in our chapters—there are all sorts of experiments that are going to provide new paradigms that can be adopted when that breach, when that opening really happens in society.Hear the complete interview on the EdSurge Podcast.Jeffrey R.

Snap Inc. in partnership with the Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Application Office launched a new AR lens to raise awareness around the Ghaf tree; the UAE’s national tree, by supporting Goumbook’s ‘Give a Ghaf’ tree planting program.
The initiative launched on the occasion of UAE’s 51st National Day, represents a unique activation that showcases how Augmented Reality (AR) can be used to help make the UAE greener while increasing environmental awareness and engaging with the Snapchat community. The initiative is part of Snap’s global AR for Good efforts and the very first one to take place in the MENA region.
This National Day, Snapchatters will be able to plant a virtual Ghaf tree through the AR lens, and Snap has committed to support their efforts by planting up to 1,000 trees.


His Excellency Omar Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy, and Remote Work Applications stated that the UAE government, under the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai invests in advanced technology and digitalization in vital sectors, to enhance society’s well-being and achieve positive impact in garnering futuristic opportunities.
H.E. said that the initiative, launched in partnership with Snap and coinciding with the National Day of the UAE, incorporates the UAE’s heritage and the use of technology to promote national principles. In addition, it educates generations and the society about the importance of the UAE’s heritage by utilizing Augmented Reality.
Commenting on the occasion, Hussein Freijeh, General Manager of Snap Inc. in MENA, said: “On behalf of everyone at Snap, I’d like to congratulate the UAE on its 51st National Day. In celebrating this milestone, we are proud of this great partnership with the Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Application Office that demonstrates the role that platforms and digital technologies like Snapchat can play in addressing environmental challenges. Through such initiatives, we highlight how an immersive AR experience that advocates for the common good can go a long way in creating a lasting impression on a user’s mind. We also showcase how technology can play a role in creating more awareness locally while providing the community with the resources to become a part of the solution.”


The Ghaf tree has great historical and environmental significance and is deeply rooted in the cultural ethos of the UAE. Through the power of AR technology, Snap is celebrating the country’s rich history and heritage while reinforcing its commitment to supporting UAE’s environmental agenda. According to a recent study by Snap and Ipsos, 79% of consumers in the UAE are interested in using AR to learn more and better understand the world around them.
To participate in the initiative, the UAE community is encouraged to try out Snapchat’s UAE National Day AR activation, by first, opening the Snapchat app; scanning the Snapcode to access the Ghaf Tree lens; taking the pledge to preserve the National Tree of the UAE; flipping the camera to rear view to try out the AR activation; and using soil, seeds, and water step-by-step to nurture the Ghaf. Once done, a Ghaf tree starts growing in the user’s space. The tree grows to a larger-than-life-size and the user is commended on being part of the initiative.

Published 2 years ago on  November 28, 2022 By  Zac Amos  Table Of Contents The tax industry is an exciting place for artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to flourish. Tax professionals must prepare and file millions of returns each year, but people aren’t the best at repeating things meticulously. They want to be creative and not just follow a script.That’s why automation has been extremely useful in cleaning up repetitive tasks — especially when calculating standard deductions. However, it also provides insights into how accurate filings can be in the tax world.Applying AI and Automation to Tax Preparation and ComplianceTax preparation and compliance is an area where the industry has applied AI with notable success. These processes rely on algorithms combing through large tax data sets to find patterns and identify anomalies. These capabilities have already helped streamline processes like risk assessment and compliance — making them more efficient for accountants and auditors.Here are some ways tax experts can apply AI in tax preparation and compliance.1. Automates Tax EntriesTax season can be stressful with all the forms and requirements. Therefore, it’s up to you and your accountant to report everything correctly. AI can take some of that pressure off and automate the tedious process.AI automates tax entries directly into your accounting software or business system so you don’t have to manually enter every single data point.It also eliminates human error in inputting data by providing an audit trail of every user action. AI can detect discrepancies between two sets of numbers so there’s no mistake in processing the tax returns.2. Classifies Tax-Sensitive TransactionsAI can classify transactions according to their taxability. One survey found that 86% of taxpayers have found this helpful in automating their transactions. It works by identifying transactions that are taxable and nontaxable. Then, it matches products and services to the appropriate tax category, improving calculation accuracy.Users can further automate this process using other technologies like natural language processing and machine learning.3. Predicts the Future of Tax LiabilitiesMachine learning is a type of AI that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions using algorithms. In the tax industry, it’s useful for analyzing notices from regulators. It can identify patterns in the tax lien process to predict future liabilities.It can also help with identifying tax fraud and evasion. Analyzing large data sets can connect unrelated pieces of information that may otherwise have gone undetected.4. AI Identifies Possible Deductions and Tax CreditsAI also helps users identify possible deductions and tax credits. It may not be able to determine the validity of these claims, but it can help you determine whether or not it’s worth pursuing.This feature can be especially useful regarding business expenses.The IRS has several databases that list all legitimate deductions and credits. Still, they’re not always easy to navigate. It can take hours to sift through these pages to find one deduction or credit to apply to an individual’s situation.Therefore, AI can do all the heavy lifting in this aspect.5. Helps With More Accurate Tax ForecastingAI and machine learning can help tax professionals make more accurate forecasts. Identifying how tax policy changes, economic conditions and business growth impact a company’s financial situation provides a clearer picture of what to expect in the coming year.This feature is particularly helpful as businesses face various changes that Congress and the IRS have placed.Can AI Automate Everything in the Tax Industry?It’s important to note that AI can’t automate all tasks — at least not yet. There are many processes that it can automate, but some areas remain challenging for machines. Therefore, taxes still require humans to do certain tasks.For example, audits are a common type of tax-related process. They require humans to determine whether someone owes money on their return or they fundamentally misunderstand how taxes work.Audits make it difficult for computers to determine whether a person has deliberately misled the government or made an honest mistake in filing taxes. This is something that only human judgment can do well right now.Fraudulent returns often require careful review by trained professionals who understand how people might cheat on their taxes using various loopholes.Another example where taxes require human intervention is building appeals cases. When you receive a valuation you disagree with, you can appeal to lower it. However, it’s not as simple as asking. You must provide evidence to support your claim, which is a job for an experienced tax team.Will We Still Need Tax Professionals in the Future?The tax industry is a complex and dynamic one. Even if people can use AI to automate certain aspects of tax preparation, there will always be a need for human interpretation and expertise — at least, for the foreseeable future.For example, an AI system can calculate your income taxes in seconds by crunching through data. However, it takes someone with experience to know the types of deductions you're eligible for — and which expenses you can include in your business.In short, there will still be a need for tax professionals. However, they will have to adapt to the technology and learn new skills to become more efficient. They will also need to work with AI, meaning they must understand the software and train it in certain areas of expertise.Elevate Your Tax Processes With AIAI has a profound impact on the tax industry. However, it’s not perfect, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution to automating your taxes. The best way to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing its drawbacks is to keep an open mind.At the same time, you’ll still need the expertise of a tax professional to guide you through the process wherever necessary.

However, there is a dark side to AI art that is often overlooked. This dark side includes the potential for AI art to be used for political propaganda, to create fake art, and to infringe on copyrights..In recent years, AI has become more and more involved in the world of art. Artificial Intelligence can now create realistic images, videos, and even sculptures. Artificial intelligence art is sometimes indistinguishable from art created by humans. Some people believe that AI will eventually replace human artists altogether..However, there is a dark side of artificial intelligence art. Because AI is powered by data, it is biased against underrepresented groups. For example, if an AI is trained on a data set of predominately white male faces, it will more likely create art that is biased towards white male faces. This could lead to a future where the art world is dominated by AI-created works that are biased against women and people of color..While AI art is still in its early stages, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and dangers that it poses. This article will explore the dark side of AI art and how it could impact the art world in a negative way..Following are some of the aspects of Artificial intelligence art and its impacts.1.AI Bias.Since AI algorithms are built by humans, they can have a built-in bias by those who either intentionally or inadvertently introduce them into the algorithm. If AI algorithms are built with a bias or the data in the training sets they are given to learn from is biased, they will produce results that are biased. This reality could lead to unintended consequences like the ones we have seen with discriminatory recruiting algorithms and Microsoft's Twitter chatbot that became racist. As companies build AI algorithms, they need to be developed and trained responsibly..2.Loss of Certain Jobs.While many jobs will be created by artificial intelligence and many people predict a net increase in jobs or at least anticipate the same amount will be created to replace the ones that are lost thanks to AI technology, there will be jobs people do today that machines will take over. This will require changes to training and education programs to prepare our future workforce as well as help current workers transition to new positions that will utilize their unique human capabilities.3.A shift in Human Experience.If AI takes over menial tasks and allows humans to significantly reduce the amount of time they need to spend at a job, the extra freedom might seem like a utopia at first glance. However, in order to feel their life has a purpose, humans will need to channel their newfound freedom into new activities that give them the same social and mental benefits that their job used to provide. This might be easier for some people and communities than for others. There will likely be economic considerations as well when machines take over responsibilities that humans used to get paid to do. The economic benefits of increased efficiencies are pretty clear on the profit-loss statements of businesses, but the overall benefits to society and the human condition are a bit more opaque.4.Global Regulations.While our world is a much smaller place than ever before because of technology, this also means that AI technology that requires new laws and regulations will need to be determined among various governments to allow safe and effective global interactions. Since we are no longer isolated from one another, the actions and decisions regarding artificial intelligence in one country could adversely affect others very easily. We are seeing this already playing out, where Europe has adopted a robust regulatory approach to ensure consent and transparency, while the US and particularly China allows its companies to apply AI much more liberally.5.Accelerated Hacking.Artificial intelligence increases the speed of what can be accomplished and in many cases, it exceeds our ability as humans to follow along. With automation, nefarious acts such as phishing, delivery of viruses to software, and taking advantage of AI systems because of the way they see the world, might be difficult for humans to uncover until there is a real quagmire to deal with.6.AI Terrorism.Similarly, there may be new AI-enabled forms of terrorism to deal with: From the expansion of autonomous drones and the introduction of robotic swarms to remote attacks or the delivery of disease through nanorobots. Our law enforcement and defense organizations will need to adjust to the potential threat these present..It will take time and extensive human reasoning to determine the best way to prepare for a future with even more artificial intelligence applications to ensure that even though there is potential for adverse impacts with its further adoption, it is minimized as much as possible..As is the case with any disruptive event, these aren't easy situations to solve, but as long as we still have humans involved in determining solutions, we will be able to take advantage of the many benefits of artificial intelligence while reducing and mitigating the negative impacts. .Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

 Key Features of Data Virtualization Solutions
There are several features to consider when shopping for a data virtualization tool. They include:
Fully integrated
Data virtualization solutions integrate the data and processes of all aspects of your organization – from master data management to business intelligence. This means that information is always current, accurate, and seamlessly accessible across the enterprise.
Comprehensive
A data virtualization solution provides a single point for accessing all data types, including transactional, analytic and structured/unstructured data sources. The ability to query by either metadata or content makes it easy to access just the suitable dataset without performing complex searches through multiple databases.
Centralized deployment of rules
Different departments within an organization may have different views on how data should be organized, processed and accessed. Data virtualization software gives you central control over these decisions so organizations can take advantage of data no matter where it resides in its raw form.
Business users don’t need training in specific programming languages; they can create custom data models, views, queries and reports with drag-and-drop simplicity. The fact that there is one version of the truth for all team members removes potential disagreements over data definitions and opportunities to work around IT rules by sending inquiries directly to individual databases.
Access controls
Data virtualization software offers flexible security options for controlling who has access to data. It also provides role-based controls (such as access privileges based on roles) to give users only the rights they require to perform their job functions.
Zero latency
Most data virtualization solutions offer zero latency querying, even when combining datasets stored in disparate systems. Allowing interactive, ad hoc exploration and analysis of datasets as they are being loaded dramatically reduces query timeframes and frees up scarce IT resources for other projects.
Easily consistent
Data virtualization software keeps creating, distributing and maintaining master data consistent and error-free because it supports integration between corporate applications such as CRM, ERP and OLAP tools.
Data transformation
With data transformation, you can quickly and automatically convert your data into the format required by any downstream system. This eliminates the need to manually reformat data whenever you want to use it in a different system.
Multidimensional analysis
Data virtualization software enables this analysis, which involves examining multiple perspectives on a set of data simultaneously. This allows analysts to explore and analyze trends and relationships in ways that would not otherwise be possible. As part of this capability, data virtualization also stores subsets of data from each dimension, allowing them to be combined and analyzed.

 Benefits of Data Virtualization Software
Data virtualization software offers several benefits that can help companies improve their data management and analysis. This includes easily accessing data from all sources, which is often difficult or impossible in the absence of data virtualization software.
It also provides an environment where different data types can be analyzed and queried relatively easily and simplifies storing, managing and accessing this information.
Data virtualization solutions can also eliminate many time-consuming tasks associated with maintaining complex databases and spreadsheets by centralizing disparate datasets. These features, combined with other benefits like mobility and scalability, make data virtualization software an invaluable asset for any company looking to simplify its processes.
This enables businesses to make better decisions by accessing more accurate and complete information. Other benefits include:

Ability to generate reports faster as the process does not require the same manual intervention as with traditional technologies.
Improve decision-making processes by merging disparate datasets.
It allows companies to meet compliance requirements for data reporting across organizational units or jurisdictions.
Flexible enough to adapt as new hardware or software becomes available.

 Choosing the Right Data Virtualization Tool for your Enterprise
There are different types of data virtualization tools available, but not all tools are created equal.
Choosing the right data virtualization tool depends on understanding how much flexibility is required by your company’s business practices; however, there are some general guidelines to follow when shopping around for this type of solution.

Make sure that any data virtualization software can work with other critical enterprise applications such as ERP or CRM.
Choose a provider that offers multiple access levels to ensure everyone has the appropriate level for their job function.
Make sure you’re getting value for money because it can get expensive quickly when deploying large amounts of technology across an organization.
Be sure to check out customer reviews before making any final decisions. These reviews can help determine whether the product is worth the cost.
Find out about training and support options offered by each vendor before buying.
Ensure that training is included in the package price and that you’ll have 24/7 access to support staff after purchase. It’s also helpful if vendors provide templates or plug-ins that make it easier for new users to use the data virtualization tool without having extensive technical knowledge.

Finding the perfect data virtualization software for your enterprise can be challenging with so many factors involved. However, considering these five features can go a long way toward finding success in the data virtualization sector.
