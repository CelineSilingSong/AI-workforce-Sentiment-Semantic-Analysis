But that’s not the only way they use AI technology to enhance the buying and selling experience on their site. Devin Wenig, eBay President and CEO wrote in 2016, “I believe that commerce, in particular, will be the focus of some of the most immediate and exciting applications of AI.” If recent developments are any indication, eBay is jockeying to be the industry leader for AI implementations in online e-commerce. 








The Amazing Ways eBay Is Using Artificial Intelligence To Boost Business Success

20+ Years of Data 
With an estimated 179 million active buyers, 1.2 billion live listings and tens of millions of sellers across 190 markets, eBay is where the world goes shopping. The company was founded in 1995 and since then has played an important role in creating “an inclusive and accessible commerce platform.” With numerous acquisitions and technology advances over the years, eBay is one of the world’s top 10 e-commerce companies and hired Jan Pedersen, formerly of Twitter and Microsoft, as vice president and chief scientist, artificial intelligence in 2018. The company used two decades of data and customer behavior insights to train its AI algorithms. These algorithms continue to get smarter every time a buyer and seller interact on the platform.  
How eBay Uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 
eBay uses artificial intelligence in personalization, search, insights, discovery and its recommendation systems along with computer vision, translation, natural language processing and more. They take a four-pronged approach with artificial intelligence: “improve the customer experience, build and deploy the right infrastructure for the unique needs of eBay, apply core AI and domain AI science to all that we do, and ensure everything is done in service of the customer experience.” 
PROMOTED
Here are a few specific examples of how they use artificial intelligence. 
Improve the buyer experience: AI-powered tools anticipate the needs of buyers, recommends items and inspires shoppers. With fine-tuned personalization abilities, the site tries to make the shopping experience customized to the needs of every shopper. A part of this was introducing Interests, the ability for shoppers to personalize their shopping experience based on their passions and styles. 
Enhance search: eBay uses AI to understand the context of a search and then provide a full spectrum of relevant products. With computer vision, the company was able to add image search to its capabilities and made camera phones e-commerce devices to allow buyers to use images as a search query. As part of the app, artificial intelligence will help shoppers find items similar to the one they were looking at. 
Platform as a service: eBay provides the cutting-edge AI-powered tools for sellers so they don’t have to and to level the playing field for sellers who would never be able to compete with others who had this technology. Data, metrics and analytics information is managed on the platform and can be used by the seller. 
Optimize pricing and selling: Machine learning can help sellers identify the best prices, when they should list a specific product and when to market themselves to better attract buyers. 
Machine translation: Languages are no barrier between buyer and seller on eBay thanks to the company’s machine translation capabilities. It’s so good that the time to process orders for international clients has reduced significantly. 
Advertisement engine: Promoted listings on eBay and advertisements off the site are all powered by AI algorithms to improve the purchase journey and help buyers discover more of eBay’s inventory. 
Leverage deep learning: While eBay has used AI for the past decade, there were still complex problems they were unable to solve. With the advances in deep learning, the company has been able to scale to larger and more complex data sets which ultimately allows them to process billions of data points and make their services even better. 
Augmented reality to simplify shipping: Finding the optimal box for shipping your item just became easier with eBay’s augmented reality technology on their app. This feature allows you to place a real-world item into a virtual shipping box. 
All of this investment in artificial intelligence is good for eBay’s business as well. AI is driving incremental sales “north of $1 billion per quarter” according to Tom Pinckney, VP of applied research at eBay. That helped the company record a net income of $763 million for the fourth quarter of 2018.  Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",The Amazing Ways eBay Is Using Artificial Intelligence To Boost Business Success,Enterprise & Cloud,The Amazing Ways eBay Is Using Artificial Intelligence To Boost Business Success,True,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IntroductionOver the course of several decades, the use of computational approaches for medical applications has increased steadily. In specialities which focus on image analysis for medical diagnostics such as radiology and pathology, considerable effort has been put towards the development of algorithms that can assist the clinician in image interpretation for diagnosis, prognostication, and production of clinical reports.1 Advances in machine learning approaches have given rise to powerful learning algorithms, collectively termed artificial intelligence (AI). A subset of AI platforms using deep learning approaches have developed powerful capabilities in specific domains as demonstrated by achievements in the games of chess, shogi, and Go, amongst other.2,3 The success of deep learning in these domains has stimulated intense interest in the development and application of intelligent systems for real-world applications in many fields, including health care. In recent years, various groups have published reports of deep learning applications for fields such as medicine,4 radiology,5,6,7,8 dermatology9,10 ophthalmology,11 and pathology.12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 In diagnostic fields such as radiology and pathology, AI carries the potential to transform the clinical practice of physicians. In pathology specifically, AI-based diagnostic platforms may perform image analysis for tissue histology, analyse molecular outputs from diagnostic tests such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), and integrate these with clinical and/or radiological characteristics to improve the predictive and prognostic power of traditional pathology approaches.24,25The perspectives of practising clinicians and diagnosticians on the integration of AI into medical practice are poorly understood. This is especially true in pathology, where only recently has a whole slide imaging system produced by Philips been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).26 Given the possibility that AI systems will become integrated into diagnostic pathology, we felt it was timely and important to begin evaluating and understanding the attitudes, opinions, and feelings of practising pathologists and trainees around this technology. Differences in physician perspectives across specialties and other demographic parameters could directly impact the rate and effectiveness of implementation, and better clarifying these will help to ensure the priorities of all stakeholders are considered. Specifically, pathologists’ concerns about impacts on job security, ability to adapt to novel technologies, and impact on clinical and research careers can be more effectively addressed by hospitals and pathology departments if they are well understood. To this end, we performed an online survey of pathologist colleagues on topics regarding incorporation of AI into clinical practice, its impact on research, and pathologists’ projections for the future of pathology training and teaching.ResultsRespondent demographicsSurvey responses were collected from a total of 487 respondents in 59 countries (Fig. 1a). The majority of respondents practiced in Canada (119, 24.9%), USA (106, 22.2%), and the UK (50, 10.5%). Respondent age was spread over a wide range of age groups, with most frequent age group being 30–35 (97, 20.0%), and relatively smaller numbers below the age of 30 (45, 9.30%) and over the age of 66 (25, 5.2%) (Fig. 1b). We received a slightly increased number of male respondents (260, 53.7%) compared to female respondents (223, 46.1%). 23.7% of respondents reported having practiced less than 5 years, 19.3% between 6 and 10 years, and relatively fewer respondents had practiced for longer periods of time (Fig. 1d). Most respondents were practicing pathologists (241, 49.6%) or residents/fellows (124, 25.5%). While a minority of respondents answered “Other” (31, 6.4%), some of the responses included positions that could be grouped with “practicing pathologist”. Most respondent specialties were reported as general pathology, anatomic pathology, neuropathology, or multiple sites/other. Most were academic pathologists (342, 70.5%), relatively fewer were community pathologists (103, 21.2%), and the remaining practiced within other settings including government, military, or industry. Respondents were overall more likely to come from larger practices, with most coming from groups with >25 members (148, 30.5%), and relatively fewer from smaller practices with only 29 (6.0%) from groups of 21–25, 52 (10.7%) from groups of 16–20, 83 (17.1%) from groups of 11–15, 100 (20.6%) from groups of 5–10, and 67 (13.8%) from groups of less than 5. Respondent results are summarized below, and select graphical depictions can be found in Fig. 2.Fig. 1Demographic data of survey respondents. a City of pathology practice/training of all survey respondents (473 responses, 14 skipped), (Maps data ©2018 Google). b Age distribution of survey respondents (484 responses, 3 skipped). c Gender demographic of respondents (484 responses, 3 skipped). d Years of pathology practice (including training) of survey respondents (481 responses, 6 skipped). e Reported positions held by survey respondents.

Overall, concerns about displacement and negative career impacts were limited; many felt AI would not impact employability (184, 38.0%) or would create new positions and increase employment prospects (205, 42.4%). A smaller number reported being concerned (85, 17.6%) or extremely concerned (10, 2.1%) that AI-tools would displace human jobs. Most respondents did not feel AI-tools would impact compensation (317, 65.6%), though a minority felt compensation would be negatively impacted (80, 16.6%). Overall, many respondents predicted integration of AI into diagnostic workflow within the next five years (191, 39.8%) or ten years (196, 40.8%), with the remaining predicting implementation within 15 years (51, 10.6%) or greater than 20 years (23, 4.8%). Regarding impacts of AI-tool implementation on relationships with colleagues, most respondents either felt that use of AI-tools would not impact the way they were viewed by colleagues (210, 43.6%), or that their adoption of new technology would be welcomed (197, 40.9%). A minority felt that implementation would have a negative impact on the way they were viewed by colleagues (75, 15.6%). Regarding feelings about patient perspectives, most believed patients would have no opinion (246, 51.0%) or would be excited about its use (140, 29.1%).Perspectives on clinical implications of AI-tool useMany respondents felt that with appropriate training, AI tools could increase (280, 58.0%) or even dramatically increase (66, 13.7%) diagnostic efficiency. A relatively smaller cohort felt efficiency would not be impacted (30, 6.2%), would be negatively impacted (4, 0.8%), or were unsure of impact on efficiency (103, 21.3%). Despite these positive attitudes towards AI tools, most respondents still felt that diagnostic decision making should remain a predominantly human task (231, 48.3%), or shared equally with an AI algorithm (121, 25.3%), while a smaller percentage felt that AI-tools should take a dominant role (97, 20.3%). Similarly, regarding the possibility of machine error, many respondents acknowledged concerns about the possibility of unpredictable results or artefact-related errors. Relatively few respondents did not feel concerned about AI-tool errors (119, 24.8%), or believed AI error rates would be lower compared to humans (48, 10.0%). Overall, a majority of pathologists felt that the use of AI-tools combined with human inputs for generation of diagnostic reports would help to decrease the rates of reporting errors (256, 53.0%). When asked about the role of AI-tools in quality assurance (QA) initiatives at their institutions, many felt AI would provide an additional level of QA (330, 68.6%), while relatively fewer felt AI-tools would have no impact on QA (120, 25.0%). Finally, in terms of medico-legal responsibility for diagnostic errors made by a human/AI combination, opinions ranged considerably, with 209 (43.7%) believing the platform vendor and pathologist should be held equally liable, 240 (50.2%) believing responsibility remained primarily that of the human, and finally 29 (6.1%) agreeing that the platform vendor should primarily be liable. These relatively split opinions suggest this still needs to be authoritatively resolved before the introduction of these tools into clinical practice.Perspectives on impacts of AI-tools on research and trainee developmentA large percentage of respondents were supportive of implementation of AI into their practices if it resulted in an increase in time spent on academic or research pursuits (448, 93.3%), compared to a minority who were not (11, 2.3%), or were unsure/other response (21, 4.4%). Nearly half of respondents anticipate that the implementation of AI will permit increased research productivity and allow pathologists to answer questions that were previously not possible (259, 53.6%), while a smaller number felt there would be no impact (99, 20.5%) or a negative impact (6, 1.24%). With respect to impacts on trainee education, many respondents felt training duration would decrease (30, 6.24%), while many others felt training duration would increase (49, 10.2%), or with the addition of training in informatics during residency/fellowship (344, 71.5%). A significant number felt that they would need to dedicate more time to training residents given an expanded tool set (119, 24.7%), with a smaller number agreeing that teaching responsibilities would decrease due to improved teaching efficiency (47, 9.8%). Interestingly, with regards to impact on clinical skills or trainees and practitioners, responses were mixed, with some respondents expressing concern that AI tools would erode pathologists’ skill (126, 26.1%), while others felt AI tools would enhance development of ‘traditional skills’ (101, 21.0%), or would not affect clinical skills (164, 34.0%).Perspectives on implementation of AI-toolsViews on the setting in which AI-tools will be used varied, with some believing AI will be used primarily in academic settings (199, 41.3%), while the remaining majority believing usage would be similar in community and academic practices (174, 36.1%). With regards to ease of uptake and implementation, many respondents felt that AI tools will be relatively intuitive with little need for training (109, 22.7%), while others felt training from a platform representative would be of help (202, 41.1%), or a dedicated course/workshop would be necessary (139, 29.0%). This is a relatively important finding among the overwhelmingly positive respondents and signals a need for more educational resources and conferences for physician education. Relatively few believed lack of knowledge regarding AI would a pose significant difficulty (25, 5.2%), or would be an absolute barrier to implementation (5, 1.0%). In terms of preparation, many respondents had exposure to some research in the area, with 123 (25.6%) having attended/read 1-2 talks/papers on the subject, 3–5 (101, 21.0%), 5–10 (73, 15.2%), or rarely greater than 25 (45, 9.4%).Statistically significant associationsApplication of Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) testing revealed a number of statistically significant associations between respondent demographic characteristics and perspectives on application of AI tools in pathology. Our testing demonstrated that compared to females, male respondents carry a more optimistic outlook on integration of AI into practice (D = 0.26, n = 259, p < 0.001), and are more likely to adopt before formal validation/support attained (D = 0.27, n = 221, p < 0.001). This interest amongst male respondents could be correlated with their reported expectation that AI could improve cost-effectiveness (D = 0.12, n = 221, p < 0.01), personal efficiency (D = 0.11, n = 221, p < 0.01), and quality assurance (D = 0.17, n = 164, p < 0.001). Males also reported subjectively feeling more comfortable with adopting the technology (D = 0.15, n = 219, p < 0.001); and believed patients could become excited about AI-diagnostics with educational sessions (D = 0.15, n = 220, p < 0.001). Men were additionally more inclined to shift balance of slide interpretation towards AI-tools (D = 0.11, n = 219, p < 0.02), were more optimistic errors would become less frequent with implementation of a highly skilled independent AI tool (D = 0.19, n = 166, p < 0.001), and more likely to feel using AI tools would garner respect from colleagues (D = 0.15, n = 221, p < 0.001). Compared to community pathologists, academic pathologists were more optimistic about AI-tool integration (D = 0.14, n = 100, p < 0.001), more likely to adopt before formal validation/support attained (D = 0.25, n = 98, p < 0.001), and more likely to anticipate cost-effectiveness (D = 0.14, n = 101, p < 0.05), and quality assurance (D = 0.19, n = 83, p < 0.01). We did not find a significant difference between the distribution of male and female respondents in this later analysis to account for these differences (χ2 test, p = 0.33). When respondents were grouped into age over and under 40 years of age, respondents over 40 years old were more optimistic errors would become less frequent with implementation of a highly skilled independent (D = 0.12, n = 150, p < 0.05) or assistant AI tool (D = 0.13, n = 159, p < 0.01). Respondents over 40 predicted earlier integration of AI tools into their personal practice (D = 0.16, n = 196, p < 0.001), and pathology practice more broadly (D = 0.13, n = 197, p < 0.01). This result was somewhat unexpected and we believe it is confounded by the increased number of older respondents being male (66% (male) vs 49% (female) χ2 test, P < 0.001). Finally, given strong representation from British, American, and Canadian pathologists, we performed subgroup comparisons between these three countries. The only significant finding was that of slightly increased interest in AI technologies amongst US respondents compared to Canadian (D = 0.19, n = 114, p < 0.001), and somewhat reduced concern about potential job displacement from US respondents compared to Canadian (D = 0.16, n = 114, p < 0.01). Comparison of trainee responses (resident, fellow) to practicing respondents (staff pathologists, site directors, and department heads) failed to find significant differences. Similarly, subgroup comparisons between generalists (general pathology, anatomic pathology) and subspecialty pathologists (neuropathology, cardiovascular pathology, etc.) did not find significant associations or differences.DiscussionThis survey was developed to begin gauging the pathology community’s perceptions, level of understanding, concerns, and opinions on the emerging use of AI in pathology practice, research, and training. To our knowledge, this is the largest published survey of the international pathology community of its kind. We do however acknowledge the shortcomings of the survey approach used in this study. In distributing this voluntary and anonymous survey by the methods described, it is not possible to calculate a survey response rate, or quantify non-response bias in our data. Certainly, the possibility that respondents are more likely than non-respondents to hold strong opinions or emotions on this issue is a real one, and should be considered. As a further limitation, respondents to our survey almost universally practice in North America and Europe, and so the perspectives of South American, African, and Australasian pathologists are significantly under-represented. Additionally, we appreciate that specific wording of some our survey questions have the potential to bias or polarize results to some degree. Several questions attempted to gauge respondents’ levels of excitement or concern, rather than dispassionately quantifying respondent’s predictions or perceptions of the likelihood of various scenarios (e.g., question 23: “Are you concerned that AI will eventually replace pathologists”). We used questions of this nature because we were interested in clearly identifying the emotional reactions and outlook of pathologists on AI, given extensive conversations in both media and academic literature about impacts of this technology on diagnostic specialties. However, we recognize that quantification of emotional reactions or outlook are not surrogate objective measures of pathologist’s predictions about implementation scenarios for AI in pathology. Our inability to definitively confirm the authenticity of respondents to our survey is an additional limitation (common to many large-scale surveys of this kind), and is acknowledged. Finally, while we did utilize KS analysis to evaluate differences in perspectives amongst our respondent demographic subgroups, we appreciate that these differences are likely to be fluid, and to change considerably as technologies evolve.The common prediction of a relatively short interval to implementation of these tools suggests that early and pre-emptive measures to facilitate smooth implementation may be of significant value for forward-thinking pathology departments. For example, many respondents believe AI-tools will become useful for improvement of QA initiatives, suggesting a need to delineate how these technologies should be formally validated and adopted. Respondents frequently agreed that some education and training, either from an industry representative (41.1%) or through a dedicated course/workshop (29.0%) would help to facilitate safe and efficient adoption. Early efforts to implement educational presentations and formalized workshops may help to ease anxiety, increase awareness, and hopefully permit valuable pathologist-input into design and integration approaches. From a marketing perspective, these data suggest that platform developers will need to focus on demonstrating efficacy and safety of their technology, with little need to persuade pathologists that AI is a useful tool for their practices.Several important concerns were raised by respondents in the comment sections (see Supplementary File 2). One important point raised by several respondents is that of limited utilization of digital pathology workflows in many institutions around the world. Digitized image data forms the basic informational input for AI-histology tools, and is a requisite for their use. Commonly cited barriers to integration of digital pathology include prohibitive cost analyses, perceived lack of impact on patient outcome, regulatory barriers, and reticence of pathologists due to concerns surrounding comfort, speed, and efficacy of digital systems.27 Even for institutions with digital pathology platforms, technical limitations such as lack of 3D whole slide scanners (many rely on 2D planar scanners), image variability between scanning devices, and technical artefacts may present additional hurdles.28 Interestingly, if AI diagnostic platforms can be shown to robustly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency for patients and hospitals, the elimination of these technical barriers (ie. implementation of a digital pathology platform) may become an expectation for any hospital committed to delivering world-class health care to its patients.The legal implications of AI platforms in medicine, both from a regulatory and malpractice standpoint were a frequent theme amongst respondents. Considerable regulatory legislation can be expected to arise if a non-experimental AI-histology tool were brought to market, which may have implications for tool development and implementation. Additional concerns about attribution of medico-legal responsibility for errors occurring in AI-assisted workflows were raised, with some respondents concerned that platform vendors would not be held appropriately responsible for errors caused by their technology. Historically, a significant number of pathology errors precipitating malpractice suits have been those made in the analytic phase (i.e., false positive and false negative diagnoses), which conceivably could be both intercepted, and caused by AI-tool contributions.29 Regarding this issue, nearly half of respondents believed that pathology errors made in cases with AI-platform contributions, both pathologist and vendor should be held equally liable and a small minority even believed that the vendor alone should be responsible. The remaining half felt that responsibility should remain solely with the pathologist. Approaches to both regulatory and medicolegal aspects of AI-tool implementation remain unclear. Perhaps the most instructive legal precedents for these issues will be found in the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles, where lawmakers, industry representatives, and the public are working through the legal implications of self-driving technologies.30Examining our data in retrospect, there are a number of important questions which should be considered by future investigators performing surveys of a similar nature. Understanding the perspectives of pathologists on how reimbursement schemas should adapt to the implementation of AI-based tools is of considerable importance to all stakeholders in the field. Designing questions to achieve insight into which individuals or demographic groups would be most likely to be early adaptors of these tools could focus attention on these groups, and ensure that ‘early experiences’ are captured and evaluated for broader benefit of the community. Surveying pathologists more specifically on how AI-tools could be integrated into their personal clinical practice would highlight areas of focus for developers and hospitals. Finally, the evolution of the relationship between histopathology and AI tools may be informed heavily by the availability of pathologists in a particular region or institution. For example, a 2017–2018 workforce census in the UK has identified staff shortages as a critical concern,31 and thoroughly investigating perspectives of providers in these practice settings on how AI tools relate to these challenges would be valuable. Of note, subgroup differences were not identified between UK pathologists and their North American counterparts in our survey data.In conclusion, we present a survey of pathology colleagues around the world from a variety of demographic and practice backgrounds. While we identified some differences in perspectives depending on age, gender, and practice type, there appears to be general enthusiasm amongst respondents for the use of AI as a diagnostic tool in pathology practice, and concern about impacts on job security is relatively low. Most respondents envision the eventual implementation of AI-tools as decision support tools used by human diagnosticians, not in place of. Several concerns about technological barriers, especially limited current day usage of digital pathology platforms in many centres, and concerns about AI tool errors and medico-legal responsibility were raised, suggesting that these will require further attention before effective implementation can be achieved.MethodsAnalytical methodsAn anonymized survey consisting of 43 questions was created using the online SurveyMonkey tool (https://www.surveymonkey.com) (Supplementary File 1). Pathologists listed as faculty members on Canadian university websites were invited by email to complete the survey. Given limited response using this approach, we created a generic link and requested it be shared amongst pathologists at pathology departments throughout Canada. We additionally shared the survey on the Twitter platform, at meeting presentations, and on the popular neuropathology blog (http://neuropathologyblog.blogspot.com/). Further, we contacted 95 pathology associations worldwide to request distribution of our survey to their membership, of which the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), Association for Pathology Informatics (API), and the European Society of Pathology (ESP) agreed to distribute the survey. These efforts to achieve maximal distribution resulted in a final survey respondent count of 487 individuals. All responses were obtained voluntarily (i.e., not institutionally enforced) from professional colleagues and anonymized (de-identified, aggregated, and tabulated) prior to analysis. This study, therefore, met the exclusion criteria of the Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement for research necessitating a review by an institutional research ethics board. Survey results were tallied for each question and described as an aggregate percentage result for reporting and discussion. Two sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov testing was performed to estimate statistically significant associations between demographic parameters (age, gender, practice type, and career stage) and patterns of responses.32

",,,,,,"{'headline': 'Physician perspectives on integration of artificial intelligence into diagnostic pathology', 'description': 'Advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) carry the potential to make significant contributions to health care, particularly in diagnostic specialties such as radiology and pathology. The impact of these technologies on physician stakeholders is the subject of significant speculation. There is however a dearth of information regarding the opinions, enthusiasm, and concerns of the pathology community at large. Here, we report results from a survey of 487 pathologist-respondents practicing in 54 countries, conducted to examine perspectives on AI implementation in clinical practice. Despite limitations, including difficulty with quantifying response bias and verifying identity of respondents to this anonymous and voluntary survey, several interesting findings were uncovered. Overall, respondents carried generally positive attitudes towards AI, with nearly 75% reporting interest or excitement in AI as a diagnostic tool to facilitate improvements in workflow efficiency and quality assurance in pathology. Importantly, even within the more optimistic cohort, a significant number of respondents endorsed concerns about AI, including the potential for job displacement and replacement. Overall, around 80% of respondents predicted the introduction of AI technology in the pathology laboratory within the coming decade. Attempts to identify statistically significant demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, type/place of practice) predictive of attitudes towards AI using Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) testing revealed several associations. Important themes which were commented on by respondents included the need for increasing efforts towards physician training and resolving medical-legal implications prior to the generalized implementation of AI in pathology.', 'datePublished': '2019-04-26T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2019-04-26T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '7', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-019-0106-0', 'keywords': ['Health care', 'Health occupations', 'Medicine/Public Health', 'general', 'Biomedicine', 'Biotechnology'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-019-0106-0/MediaObjects/41746_2019_106_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-019-0106-0/MediaObjects/41746_2019_106_Fig2_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'npj Digital Medicine', 'issn': ['2398-6352'], 'volumeNumber': '2', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'Nature Publishing Group UK', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Shihab Sarwar', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Anglin Dent', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Kevin Faust', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Maxime Richer', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research', 'address': {'name': 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Ugljesa Djuric', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research', 'address': {'name': 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Randy Van Ommeren', 'url': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7948-7530', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research', 'address': {'name': 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'randy.vanommeren@mail.utoronto.ca', '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Phedias Diamandis', 'url': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5291-9068', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'University of Toronto', 'address': {'name': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research', 'address': {'name': 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, MacFeeters Hamilton Centre for Neuro-Oncology Research, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, {'name': 'University Health Network', 'address': {'name': 'Laboratory Medicine Program, Department of Pathology, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'p.diamandis@mail.utoronto.ca', '@type': 'Person'}], 'isAccessibleForFree': True, '@type': 'ScholarlyArticle'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Logistics in the military encompasses more functions than most people realize. In modern warfare, that means large quantities of data to sift through in order to make decisions regarding supply, transport, communications, and so on. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in one or more areas in logistics could help speed up that process and make it more agile. Although AI and ML could have great benefits for military logistics, the military has focused on AI and ML applications in other areas. The military has been slow on the uptake, and it often accepts an amber status for its logistics in active war zones. However, integrating AI for logistics in the military comes with its attendant concerns, although they are not the same as those when using AI for surveillance, intelligence, or weapons. The issues with AI for logistics have to do with inherent unpredictability and vulnerability to exploitation. Data scientists and engineers are making great progress in AI and ML with impressive results, but it is far from foolproof. This lack of certainty has until recently prevented more enthusiastic employment of available AI and ML solutions. A directive requiring all AI-based systems to have a human overseer or operator at all times should mitigate, but not eliminate, the specter of compromised and dangerous technology.   That said, the fact that the biggest adversaries of the US are aggressively pursuing the use of AI and ML in their own defense systems, and that these same systems face the same risks and vulnerabilities, might present unique opportunities for the Department of Defense (DoD) to level the playing field, so to speak. Be that as it may, the DoD is addressing the issue of using AI for logistics in the US military, spearheaded by the newly formed Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC). The authors of the “Summary Of The 2018 Department Of Defense Artificial Intelligence Strategy” point out that “Other nations, particularly China and Russia, are making significant investments in AI for military purposes…The  United States, together with its allies and partners, must adopt AI to maintain its  strategic position, prevail on future battlefields, and safeguard this order.” This article will run through some of the areas in logistics where AI is either in pilot mode or in active operation. The areas for discussion will include: Preventive maintenance Cloud services Supply chain management Medical aid Driverless resupply We begin our analysis with a discussion of preventative maintenance. Preventive Maintenance JAIC director Air Force Lt. Gen. John N.T. “Jack” Shanahan stated, “we want to identify some smart automation initiatives that could provide near-term dividends in terms of increased efficiencies and effectiveness for back-office functions.” One important AI logistic initiative under JAIC is preventive maintenance, particularly for fighter jets. An early version of automated preventive maintenance for the military was the F-35 fighter jet test performed byLockheed Martin back in 2015. Below is a 2:50-minute video showing the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) at work:  There is no mention of AI or ML, but Air Force Chief Scientist Gregory Zachariasconfirmed AI is the driving force behind the “smart” system. The system will probably get a lot “smarter,” probably with supportive AI software from defense contractor C3.ai. The AI company currently has nine projects with the DoD. The military uses ALIS and, potentially, the C3 AI Suite for aircraft. However, if the pilot programs prove successful in the long term, the military might easily customize these and similar technologies to accrue the same benefits for other types of vehicles and equipment. We recently posted a more in-depth article on predictive analytics in the military for these other uses. Cloud Services A central repository of information might sound like a bad idea for the military, but in the world of logistics, it is necessary. It means savings in time, effort, and money if logisticians have all the information they need to make informed decisions when moving supplies and equipment to support troops. In line with this, the Army contracted IBM to provide cloud services as well as access to Watson to store and process logistics data coming from various sources. Logistics Support Activity, or LOGSA, (now Logistics Data Analysis Center or LDCA) Commander John Kuenzli stated in 2017: Capabilities like Watson make it a very exciting time for us. This can be a way to free up our analysts from some of the more technical work, to let the machine do some of that and to leverage the analysts’ professional expertise to look up and look further toward where the Army is going. The idea is to use the cloud to upload sensor data from vehicles and equipment and perform “conditioned-based maintenance (CBM),” which is a repair-when-needed approach, made possible with AI-driven data analysis. Below is a 4-minute proof of concept video on 360 Stryker combat vehicles from IBM:  While the idea of CBM falls under preventive maintenance, the bigger picture in this particular use of AI is in the move of military data into the cloud. According to DoD Chief Information officer Dana Deasy, data access is the key to effective warfare today. He explained: One of the things traditional computing has always had a problem with is the warfighter sitting out on the tactical edge, [with the] cloud sitting [elsewhere]. Now imagine a world where we can take that compute power with new applications on top of it, and put the cloud right into the hands of the tactical fighter on the edge. That’s why the cloud is so important to us. In 2019, that early initiative has bloomed into a multi-billion single-provider contract for secure cloud storage and software under the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) with several commercial companies vying for it. Unfortunately, legal problems are keeping the DoD from going forward with it. Supply Chain Management The government can also become a victim of fraud as much as any civilian, and perhaps more so because of the sheer volume of its acquisitions worth about $350 billion a year. For the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), this is a big problem, as it provides what the military needs, such as weapons, repair parts, and fuel, as well as disposes of surplus equipment. As the DLA receives an average of a million bids a day, it can be fatally easy for some questionable transactions to get through. To address this issue, the DLA turned to AI and ML software to sort through the mountain of private and public data to identify and flag suspicious or anomalous suppliers. DLA Logistics Operations Vice Director Michael Scott claimed its Business Decision Analytics (BDA) tool has made a big difference. In 5 months of operations: It has identified more than 350 high-risk CAGE codes or supplier entities. It’s probably one of our top concerns right now from a process perspective is the rise in the number of fraudulent or bad actor companies who are trying to get into our business. This new tool has been very helpful in identifying that from the onset and allowing us to put controls in our systems to not allow them to get business from DLA. It is unclear if the DLA developed the BDA tool in-house or contracted it out to one of several infotech and AI companies awarded contracts under the J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) program. Medical Aid Immediate medical aid is not always available on the battlefield. It may be a lack of actual medics in the area, injuries beyond the skills of a medic, or a matter of triage, where medical personnel prioritize the most badly injured. AI might possibly provide some answers in that area of logistics. AI in medicine is a well-established field in the commercial sector, but not so much in the military. Efforts are underway to correct this imbalance, with the Army’s Telemedicine & Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) heading the charge. The TATRC recently awarded Charles River Analytics with a contract to develop an AI system that would monitor, diagnose, and treat victims of traumatic injury in the battlefield. Dubbed the Automated Ruggedized Combat Casualty Care (ARC3) system, it will not be a fully automated medical AI, but rather software that can help medics in diagnosing injuries, monitoring patients, and providing treatment when immediate evacuation of the patient is not possible. The system is currently under development. Charles River also snagged a contract to develop the Ensemble Prediction for Combat Casualty Care (EPIC3) mobile app. The idea is to provide the medic with some decision support when it comes to handling traumatic injury. In its award, Charles River stated it “uses an ensemble of classifiers, frequently tuned via machine learning to predict life-threatening and difficult-to-detect injuries. EPIC3 purportedly presents the steps to treat those injuries through a simple, easy-to-use interface that tailors itself to the needs and skill level of the user.” This software is under development as well. AthenaGTX claimed it is in its final stages of based development for its Automated Critical Care System (ACCS). The company described it as a “system of systems” that “integrate patient physiological monitoring with interventions controlled by software algorithms to provide automatic medical care of critically injured warfighters.” Below is a 49-second video of what it will look like:  The company also has a wearable device it claimed could help in battlefield triage. Called the Wireless Vital Signs Monitor (WVSM), it records the vitals of a patient and transmits it to compatible devices. There is no record that either of these products were developed under funding from the military, however. Driverless Resupply Drones are making a lot of noise in the AI space, but mostly for surveillance. What most people probably do not realize is that the military is looking seriously at self-driving vehicles to resupply outposts and bases under the Autonomous Ground Resupply program. This would spare human drivers from the hardships and risks of a supply convoy. The army already awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to Robotic Research LLC to develop autonomous kits. Below are two short videos showing what a driverless supply would look like:   However, sometimes it is better to go as the crow flies, and the Army Research Laboratory is also looking into using aerial drones instead of land vehicles under the Joint Tactical Aerial Resupply Vehicle (JTARV). Of course, the loads would have to be much less, but it could get to places quicker than a ground vehicle could. To this end, the military is working with Malloy Aeronautics to use its quadcopter (“hoverbike”) as the first JTARV. The ideal JTARV would be able to carry up to 800 pounds, go as fast as 60 mph, and for up to 125 miles. Below is a 4:25-minute video showing the capabilities of the US Military Hoverbike Prototype 2017.  As researchers acquire a better understanding of how AI and ML work, the use case of AI for logistics may become more robust. Until then, the military could still reap the benefits of AI and ML if it ensures the security and safety of its software and data.   Header Image Credit: Department of Defense Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at UBS - Current Applications and InitiativesUBS is a Swiss multinational investment banking and financial services company ranked 30th on S&P… Artificial Intelligence in the Chinese Military - Current InitiativesThe Chinese military, or People's Liberation Army, is focusing heavily on artificial intelligence.

A recent study from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco showed that the U.S. labor market is ""at or beyond its full potential."" While that might be good news for the economy, it's not for the tech companies still out there, searching desperately for qualified talent.Related: 4 Ways Artificial Intelligence Boosts Workforce ProductivityResearch firm Korn Ferry predicted that companies in technology, media and telecom will face a talent shortage of 1.1 million by 2020. By 2030, that number will grow to 4.3 million, the report said; and the result will be intense competition for a dwindling pool of tech professionals. The same survey showed that insufficient staff is already holding back digital transformation at 54 percent of companies surveyed.



Skilled coders, of course, won't materialize out of thin air. So, instead of hoping that traditional recruiting tactics will solve their mounting talent shortage, companies should consider a new approach -- one that looks for alternatives to the human talent companies will always need but may have to struggle mightily to find. That approach: artificial intelligence.When AI is a human equivalentI've seen the effects of talent shortages firsthand during my career in app development. It's something my own company has struggled with, in fact. Unfortunately, I think the outlook is even worse than the numbers imply.


The university pipeline is not graduating nearly enough knowledge workers to fill even the present demand. Last year, there were more than a half million unfilled computer-related jobs, and relying on foreign-born workers has not been the best option due to tougher immigration restrictions.What if instead of trying to recruit a recent graduate who commands a six-figure salary, you could rely on technology to do the job? Artificial intelligence has advanced to the point that it can emulate the output of knowledge workers, not just perform repetitive manual labor.Related: A VC Perspective - How Valid Is the Threat of Artificial Intelligence on the Job Market?Already, we are seeing AI that can handle coding on its own. You identify an objective, and the program then autonomously develops a framework, generates code and finds the ideal mixture of APIs and SDKs. AI might not be able to replace a human coder entirely, but it can already increase his or her productivity.


As the talent pool dwindles, AI can pick up the slack and replace the talent that could not otherwise be replaced. It's not a panacea for all staffing problems, but it just may help you boost your efficiency and productivity, cut time to market and improve product quality -- all without your having to make new hires.AI and the future of workTech is not the only industry figuring out how to use AI to remain relevant and productive moving forward. Self-driving trucks, for example, promise to eliminate hazards from the road, delays from delivery schedules and the challenges companies experience in finding qualified drivers. That said, even industries that were not formerly considered technology-based are becoming just that.Fast food is such an example of industries now adopting new technology. Turnover in that food industry is high, but robots in the kitchen will never choose to leave. For example, I work with a company that is developing a robotic arm and sensor system that can cook the perfect burger with complete consistency. Robotic cooks mean smaller kitchens, lower labor costs and more affordable food prices for everyone. Because of this, these robotic cooks can support human ones without eliminating them.While we shouldn't expect to see robots walking through the office any time soon, we should embrace AI in all of its forms throughout the workforce. Remember, technology isn't displacing workers -- it's stepping in where labor is needed.


Are you ready to employ AI?Employers should be cautiously optimistic about AI. It may well have a big impact in many places, but that doesn't mean every workflow is ready to be automated. Use these strategies to employ AI where it's most effective in your company:1. Identify your biggest pain points. Know your most persistent problems and how they might be exacerbated by talent shortages. Each department is led by someone who can give insight into what that department needs and where it's hurting. Talk to these employees. Their knowledge and these conversations can serve as the basis for organizational charts, to help your company identify its greatest deficiencies and see how AI systems might cover your biggest unmet needs.An example? Illustrating the possibilities that come from identifying areas in which a company has room to grow, the Associated Press began automating its reporting on earnings rather than having people do that task manually.The result: The press service was able to write 12 times more stories.


2. Analyze job postings to see where you could fill the void. Look at your company's open job postings to see where AI might be able to fill roles for which you can't find qualified candidates.There are more than seven million unfilled positions in the United States right now, which means that a growing company -- or even a stable one -- will naturally need to replace employees who are bouncing to different jobs or those who retire. That said, growing companies are in dire need of more human capital in their offices to stay on a steady path to growth.AI can assist in areas where candidates aren't available. For example, the App Association's 2018 State of the App Economy report revealed that there is just one computer science graduate for every eight available computing jobs. Yikes: Don't suffer shortages like that where you don't have to.By analyzing which roles you have open and which you're struggling to fill, you'll find areas for AI to step in and fill your need.


3. Let AI consultants help you see how automated solutions can fill the gaps. In our case, we went to academics who were actually writing algorithms, white papers and dissertations on this subject. In academia, people have more time to drill down on research and development for their theories and aren't constrained by the need to please stockholders or attain commercial success. They can therefore be key players as you acquire knowledge and eventually adopt AI for your workplace.For example, around 50 people from Carnegie Mellon's robotics lab joined Uber to help that company build self-driving cars. Some of the university's top talent made the move to be a part of the project, providing expertise and insights to the ride-hailing company as it embarked on a new journey with AI.Overall, there will likely be two types of companies in the future: those that adopt AI and use it to become more efficient, and those that choose not to use it, leaving the real possibility they will be left behind. My money is on the prior group, whose people will also have to be adaptive and willing to integrate technology into their workflows.Related: These 5 Companies Have Added Robots to Their Workforce 


In other words, AI solves talent shortages, but that's just the start. This technology is poised to disrupt entrenched industries, redefine consumer expectations and optimize everything you do. It's more than your solution for the future -- AI has already begun ushering in a completely new paradigm.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Human resources has been slower to come to the table with machine learning and artificial intelligence than other fields—marketing, communications, even health care. But the value of machine learning in human resources can now be measured, thanks to advances in algorithms that can predict employee attrition, for example, or deep learning neural networks that are edging toward more transparent reasoning in showing why a particular result or conclusion was made. The value beyond numbers for CEOs and managers is the power in understanding what’s actually happening within a company i.e. with their people. As Glint’s Justin Black articulated in a webinar for the Human Capital Institute (HCI), executives and leaders need information that helps them point people in the right direction; information—sales data, KPIs, etc.—change over time, and machine learning can react faster than people in helping draw out the insights and inferences that might otherwise take reams of manpower or not be uncovered at all. Though not an exhaustive list, below is an outline of solid examples of machine learning and artificial intelligence applications at work in human resources today, along with developing and near-future applications. Current Machine Learning Human Resources Applications Applicant Tracking & Assessment Applicant tracking and assessment has topped the list in early machine learning applications, especially for companies and roles that receive high volumes of applicants. Glint is not an AI company, but they use AI tools to help companies save money and provide a better work experience. Machine learning tools help HR and management personnel hire new team members by tracking a candidate’s journey throughout the interview process and helping speed up the process of getting streamlined feedback to applicants. Peoplise is another solution for helping companies calculate fit score for new talent, combining tools like digital screening and online interview results  to help hiring managers arrive at decisions. While competition for the best people has driven many HR departments to use algorithmic-based assessments, a CEB article on using machine learning to eliminate bias cautions that human oversight is still of paramount importance. It’s not enough to act directly on data insights, but to use this information in tandem with driving question such as:  1) how I can link applicant traits to business outcomes; 2) which outcomes should be our focus when hiring; and 3) can predictions (hiring and otherwise) be made in an unbiased way. Attracting Talent Attracting talent before hiring has also seen an upswing in machine-learning based applications in the past few years. Black, who is Glint’s senior director of Organizational Development, named LinkedIn as an example of a company using one of the most common versions of basic machine learning—recommending jobs. Other job-finding sites, including Indeed, Glassdoor, and Seek use similar algorithms to build interaction maps based on users’ data from previous searches, connections, posts, and clicks. PhenomPeople is one example of a suite of machine learning-based tools that helps lead potential talent to a company’s career site through multiple social media and job search channels. Black notes that this is really just one step past a keyword search, albeit a big step computationally, as there’s a lot more to do. Attrition Detection Understanding people and why they decide to stay at or leave a job is arguably one of the most important questions for HR to answer. Identifying attrition risk calls for advanced pattern recognition in surveying an array of variables. In the earlier mentioned HCI webinar, Black describes a hypothetical situation of identifying specific risk factors based on scores to an employee survey. If a human were to try and detect attrition risk among female engineers in Palo Alto with less than 2 years of tenure, the variance analyses to reach that conclusion are innumerable, like finding a needle in haystack, but machine learning allows us to connect these dots in seconds, freeing HR representatives to spend time supporting teams instead of analyzing data.  Glint’s employee engagement platform Advances in NLP have included the ability to process large amounts of unstructured data, and algorithms can also do things like identify emotional activity in comments and tease out prescriptive comments, or actionable suggestions. Black describes “prototypicality” algorithms that can pull out individual comments that represent the sum of what everyone’s saying, allowing companies to get a broadly inclusive but digestible pulse on company processes and specific issues. JPMorgan is apparently one of several financial institutions that has also put into place algorithms that can survey employee behavior and identify “rogue employees” before any criminal activity takes place, an obviously more insidious form of attrition with dire consequences—watch the interview with Bloomberg Reporter Hugh Son as he discusses these new safeguards with Bloomberg Technology.    Individual Skills Management/Performance Development Machine learning is showing its potential in boosting individual skill management and development. While there is definitely room for growth in this arena, platforms that can give calibrated guidance without human coaches save time and provide the opportunity for more people to grow in their careers and stay engaged. Workday is just one example of a company building personalized training recommendations for employees based on a company’s needs, market trends, and employee specifics. Black elaborates that these types of performance development assessments are useful when actually read, which is why this type of machine-based feedback has been successful for individuals. But this becomes more difficult at the level of the organization, where it’s almost impossible to make sense of enormous amounts of varying data; this is an area where machine learning is evolving, with an increased focus on the overall performance of the corporate lattice. Future Machine Learning Human Resources Applications Enterprise Management As alluded to in the last example, enterprise management and engagement based on machine learning insights is already here in early forms but has yet to be taken to scale.  KPMG promotes its customized “Intelligent Enterprise Approach”, leveraging predictive analytics and big data management to help companies make business decisions that optimize key KPIs and other metrics. re:Work, which provides best workplace practices and ideas from Google and other leading organizations (including KPMG), is an excellent resource for staying up-to-date on new tools and case studies in this space. Google’s People Analytics department has been a pioneer in building performance-management engines at the enterprise level. From an early stage, the team (led by Prasad Setty) posed existing questions—for example, what’s the ideal size for a given team or department—but focused on finding new ways to use data in order to help answer these questions. In turn, People Analytics has helped pave the way for solving fundamental business problems related to the employee life cycle, with a focus on improving “Googlers'” production and overall wellness. As outline by Chris Derose for The Atlantic, over the last half of a decade, the team has produced insights that have led to improvements in company-wide actions, such as: Limiting the number of interviews required for an applicant (more than four didn’t lead to higher quality) Revealing optimal organizational size and department size Better managing of maternity leave (Google saw a 50 percent decrease in defections) Creating on-boarding agenda for an employee’s first four days of work, with increased productivity levels of up to 15 percent Post-Hire Outcome Algorithms CEB notes that the ideal hiring algorithm would predict a post-hire outcome (for example, reducing time taking customer service calls while keeping customer satisfaction high) rather than just matching job requirements with items on an employee’s resume or pre-hire assessment results. The article goes on to note that it’s sometimes the counterintuitive aspects that predict job performance, information that a machine is better at finding through analysis than human inference. For example, CEB describes a model created for a call center representative role that linked call center experience to resulting poor performance. While a link to the source or actual model would be helpful, the idea is interesting and reflects machine learning’s strengths in “invisible” pattern recognition Internal Management When Talent Analytics Chief Scientist Pasha Roberts discussed the role of predictive analytics in human resource management with Emerj in 2016, he brought up the internal movement of employees within a company as an issue unique to HR and analytics. “You can use agent-based modeling to simulate and look at how people can move within a company…and be better able to hire a person at the entry-level that will be likely to move through corporate ladder,” said Roberts. While there are early systems in place, more data over time should lead to a more robust and  scalable model for internal management over the next five years. Increased Behavior Tracking and Data-Based Decision Making  Ben Waber, president and CEO of Humanyze and also a past guest on Emerj, talked about the increasing use of IoT wearable data in the workplace. These types of gadgets are more common at the enterprise level—bluetooth headphones and smart ID badges, for example—and companies are continuing to add sensor technology to the workplace in order to collect data. This is an area that Waber researched while serving as a visiting scientist at the MIT Media Lab, using data collected from smart badges to look at things like employee dialogue, interaction, networks within a company, where people spent their time, etc. It would seem that privacy might be a concern, but technologies like smart badges are starting to proliferate quickly (with vendors like Atmel, in the below video, introducing new and updated apps for Android phones). This type of data, says Waber, allows us to pose and answer crucial business-driving questions that we couldn’t ask before, such as ‘how much does my sales team talk to my engineering team?’    Things to Keep in Mind: Machine Learning in Human Resources Google People Analytics Lead, Ian O’Keefe,  told a story at the People Analytics & Future of Work conference in January 2016 about his team’s efforts to quantify things like efficiency, effectiveness and employee experience by looking at hiring decisions, team climate, and personal development. In the end, his team found that people armed with better data make better decisions than algorithms alone can do. Well-designed AI applications, says Black, have three main cross functions: main expertise, data science expertise, and design/user experience expertise. At present, very few providers do all three of these well. The best solutions today and in the near future don’t replace humans, but emphasize scaling better decision making with the use of machines as a tool and collaborator. Our survey of machine learning in human resources illuminates the development of a more people-centric approach, paving the way for more more valuable programs and less wasted time; reduced bias in programs; less administration and more individual development; and the ability to act proactively rather than reactively, moving seamlessly from the level of the individual to the organization and back again.   Image credit: Corporate IT Related Posts Machine Learning in Surgical Robotics - 4 Applications That MatterThe application of robotics in surgery has steadily grown since it began in the 1980s.… Machine Learning in the Asian Pharmaceutical Sector - Current ApplicationsMcKinsey estimated that embarking on digital transformation to restructure value chains and drive R&D innovation… Machine Learning in Orthopedics - Current ApplicationsThere are few companies claiming to offer artificial intelligence solutions to orthopedics companies.

Atul Jalan, Founder of Manthan, believes artificial intelligence will change the world like nothing else has so far. In this video interview with YourStory Business Editor Vishal Krishna, he reveals how technology will change the way we look at the normal and why machines will soon dominate man. Vishal Krishna1847 StoriesFriday April 26, 2019 , 4 min ReadSerial entrepreneur Atul Jalan has made a big business out of understanding the problems businesses face and offering specific solutions. The Founder of Manthan, which offers artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics as a service, has authored the book Where Will Man Take Us? The Bold Story of the Man Technology is Creating. He strongly believes that common and fundamental knowledge will forever be challenged by AI. Launched in 2003, Manthan designs prescriptive analytics applications powered by AI on cloud for customer-facing businesses. Aiming to be the 'Chief Analytics Officer' for consumer industries worldwide, its advanced analytics platforms and solutions help businesses traverse the data-to-result path. With over 170 customers across 21 countries, the company has managed to convert 'analytics as a service' into a 'platform play'.Atul Jalan, MD, ManthanAlso read: Here’s how India is working towards the future of AI and machine learningIn this candid video interview with YourStory, Atul outlines that humans invent stories and technologies, and - in the process - our way of living changes very rapidly.Early technologies like the fire, wheel, plough, saddle, printing press, steam engines, and gasoline engines changed the world around us. Now, with the combination of new technologies like genomics, AI, and quantum computing, man and machine are coming together to script a new chapter in the history of man.“People will feel disconnected to the changes around them. A new ethical mode of morality will be required over the next 10 years. Look at connected cars; they will require new laws. Is the algorithm responsible for the accident? It changes the whole dynamic of who is responsible,"" Atul says.Sign up for our exclusive newsletters.Subscribe to check out our popular newsletters.* indicates mandatory fieldsHe adds that capitalism, socialism, and communism were born out of the industrial revolution that began in the 17th century. With AI and genomics, there are possibilities of a completely new ideology giving shape to human narratives.Today, AI is narrow; it recognises patterns and makes recommendations. But, for real AI to exist it has to pass the Turing Test, a test of a machine’s ability to “exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human”. This essentially means the machine can fool man into believing that the decision is really being made by him/her. Sounds just like Blade Runner, doesn't it? These are some of the tough questions Atul Jalan places before everybody.“Algorithms today are going to mislead humans even more because they are forming their own groups that cater to their biases on social media,” Atul says. For example, when one searches the internet with the question “Is Trump bad?”, the algorithm only shows posts that suggest he is “bad”. Similarly, if one searches for “Is Trump good?”, the search engine only throws up posts or content relevant to the context of “good”. Biases are a formation of the preconceived questions we have about the person; the algorithms heighten these feelings.Atul speaks about the progress of man, thanks to technology, and has high praise for people like Alan Turing for being among the first to say that machines would dream one day. Quoting Isaac Asimov, he says science fiction has created the chance for humans to dream of a future that will change mankind through technology.He is categorical that technology will change the way we look at the normal. Be it work, life, marriage, sex or our relationship to the government, everything will change. He adds that the union of man and machine will happen sooner, and that machine will soon dominate. What does that hold for our future? Atul leaves us pondering about the imminent dawn of a new, strange epoch.Watch the interview with Atul here:

In this candid video interview with YourStory, Atul outlines that humans invent stories and technologies, and - in the process - our way of living changes very rapidly.

Early technologies like the fire, wheel, plough, saddle, printing press, steam engines, and gasoline engines changed the world around us. Now, with the combination of new technologies like genomics, AI, and quantum computing, man and machine are coming together to script a new chapter in the history of man.

“People will feel disconnected to the changes around them. A new ethical mode of morality will be required over the next 10 years. Look at connected cars; they will require new laws. Is the algorithm responsible for the accident? It changes the whole dynamic of who is responsible,"" Atul says.

He adds that capitalism, socialism, and communism were born out of the industrial revolution that began in the 17th century. With AI and genomics, there are possibilities of a completely new ideology giving shape to human narratives.

Today, AI is narrow; it recognises patterns and makes recommendations. But, for real AI to exist it has to pass the Turing Test, a test of a machine’s ability to “exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human”. This essentially means the machine can fool man into believing that the decision is really being made by him/her. Sounds just like Blade Runner, doesn't it? These are some of the tough questions Atul Jalan places before everybody.

“Algorithms today are going to mislead humans even more because they are forming their own groups that cater to their biases on social media,” Atul says. For example, when one searches the internet with the question “Is Trump bad?”, the algorithm only shows posts that suggest he is “bad”. Similarly, if one searches for “Is Trump good?”, the search engine only throws up posts or content relevant to the context of “good”. 

Biases are a formation of the preconceived questions we have about the person; the algorithms heighten these feelings.

Atul speaks about the progress of man, thanks to technology, and has high praise for people like Alan Turing for being among the first to say that machines would dream one day. Quoting Isaac Asimov, he says science fiction has created the chance for humans to dream of a future that will change mankind through technology.

He is categorical that technology will change the way we look at the normal. Be it work, life, marriage, sex or our relationship to the government, everything will change. He adds that the union of man and machine will happen sooner, and that machine will soon dominate. What does that hold for our future? Atul leaves us pondering about the imminent dawn of a new, strange epoch.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  The K-12 online tutoring market is a growing sector and is projected by market research firm Technavio to reach $120.67 billion by 2021. Growing numbers of students are taking college entrance exams such as the SAT and tutoring industry giants such as Khan Academy are helping students meet their test prep goals. However, personalization of the online tutoring experience has not been fully adopted across platforms. Today, artificial intelligence is beginning to help shape this approach. In this article we explore examples of tutoring platforms which integrate AI. We cover three major categories of tutoring applications that should be of interest to business leaders in the education space: Chatbots as Tutors and Teachers Machine Learning for Educational Data Analytics and Quality Monitoring Machine Learning for Matching Tutors with Students For each application we provide a company overview, explanation of how the platform functions and outcome data and/or results where available. Each example is organized under a sub-heading which serves as a quick reference when navigating through the article. (This article will focus exclusively on AI applied to virtual learning and tutoring. Readers interested in a general exploration of AI in Education may find our more broad article “Examples of Artificial Intelligence in Education” to be an informative read.) Chatbots Duolingo – Chatbot for Learning Foreign Languages In October 2016, Duolingo officially announced the release of three iPhone compatible chatbots designed to help foreign language learners gain fluency and confidence in speaking in French, Spanish and Italian.  Consistent with traditional bots, users interact with the app though prompts using natural language. However, the company claims its chatbot is more unique due to its ability to “accept and react to thousands of unique responses” instead of a more limited range of prompts. A screen shot of DuoLingo’s conversational prompts on iPhone Features include a “help me reply” option that provides users with suggested responses if he or she is ever unsure how to respond during a language chat. Unfamiliar words can also be clicked on for realtime translations or pronunciations during chats. The company claims it has always used machine learning to help personalize each lesson delivered through its platform. Specific examples include: Determining which sentences will help a user best improve his or her weakest language skills Recommending immersion practice documents (translations) based on a user’s progress Estimating the quality of a translation-in-progress  To date, the company reports that it services over 150 million users. An independent research study conducted by Roumen Vesselinov, PhD and John Grego, PhD on the effectiveness of Duolingo for learning Spanish suggests that the platform is an effective tool.  The same research team has conducted a series of effectiveness studies on competing language software programs including Babbel and Rosetta Stone. The impact of Duolingo’s chatbots (on engagement, revenue, learning outcomes, etc) has yet to be reported. EdTech Foundry – Chatbot Acts As Teaching Assistant EdTech Foundry, a Norway-based tech company has recently released Differ, a chatbot designed to assist students in higher education. The system is designed to provide quick answers to student questions that tend to recur each semester.  According to the company’s website, questions range from general administrative questions to more detailed questions about syllabi and course work expectations. In addition to answering questions, the chatbot occasionally suggests academic articles and further reading to students that pertain to their coursework. The chatbot also suggests direct ways that a student can contribute to their class such as posting in forums.  In the short video below, Kristian Collin Berge, EdTech Foundry CEO, discusses how he used the Differ chatbot to as a teaching assistant in his classroom to increase student engagement:  To function, the chatbot uses algorithms and must accumulate and process student questions and student-teacher activity over time to improve its ability to make useful recommendations. The company claims that its pilot program results demonstrated five times higher student engagement on messages posted by a bot as compared to a human teacher.  Contrary to some concerns about how technology can affect a student’s experience with course work Bill Gates is among proponents of the technology. He suggests chatbots have great potential for achieving increased student engagement because of how they are designed to communicate with their users. While we’ve covered the chatbot efforts of Google and Facebook in relative depth, education is – admittedly – a rather new use-case without the budget or the conversational volume of the world’s big tech giants. We hope that the use-cases and open source technologies from leading tech companies will increasingly make their way into education and other less funded domains. Time will tell. Machine Learning for Data Analytics and Quality Monitoring Thirdspace Learning – AI Used for Feedback on Math Tutoring Instruction Founded in 2012, Thirdspace Learning is self-described as the largest one-on-one online math tutoring platform in the U.K. As of 2016, the company is reportedly integrating artificial intelligence into its operations. The purpose is to better track student progress and to optimize its services. While a specific timeline has not been reported, the company aims to provide its online tutors with feedback on their tutoring performance in real-time using artificial intelligence.   For example, if a student misunderstands a concept or if a tutor skips an important step, Thirdspace wants AI to identify the gaps and alert the tutor before the issue progresses.  On the data collection front, company founder Tom Hopper has stated that the ThirdSpace Learning records every tutoring session amounting to thousands of hours every week. To provide additional context, according to the company’s website, over 400 math specialists have been recruited and trained and over 100,000 hours of math tutoring has been delivered to date. Robust data collection improves the ability of an algorithm to “learn” the parameters of a data set and enables it to make better recommendations. It is plausible that Thirdspace is aiming to increase its data to lay a solid foundation for its AI implementation efforts. This would be particularly applicable to understanding student learning styles and tailoring math tutoring in an increasingly personalized way.  Thinkster Math – AI Used for Feedback on Math Tutoring Instruction Thinkster is a math tutoring platform that integrates artificial intelligence and machine learning to help math coaches track student performance. According to its website, Thinkster uses AI to help visualize a student’s thought process as he or she works on a math problem.  The tutoring platform records student work and tracks the steps a student chose to solve a math problem. As a result, math coaches can identify problem areas and inform strategies for improving student performance. The objective is to personalize each student’s learning experience based on performance data.  For example, consider a word problem involving 3 apples, 4 oranges and 5 carrots and a student is asked to calculate the total amount of fruit. Thinkster’s curriculum is designed to include “conceptually unrelated numbers (or distractors).” In this example the 5 carrots would be the distractor. The platform would track the student’s ability to solve similar problems which include distractors to achieve overall skill mastery in this area. The 3 minute video below provides a succinct overview of the Thinkster platform featuring a simulated walk-through of a student using the platform and how Thinkster records and analyzes the student’s performance:  The details of how AI and machine learning are specifically impacting the business model are not clearly discernible from the company’s website or Linkedin page.  iTalk2Learn: Machine Learning Used for Fraction Solutions iTalk2Learn is an online math tutorial system designed for elementary students. A collaborative project developed in Europe, the system developers claim machine learning is used to structure personalized lesson plans.  The program focuses extensively on fractions, which according to the developers, remain a barrier to progression in the study of mathematics for a disproportionate number of students. The program’s Fractions Lab reportedly emphasizes visual representations of fractions and real-world application of fraction concepts. Through the use of its seven modalities, the program claims to  balance structured activities with interactive, practice-based work. iTalk2Learn explains the software requirements and basic components to it’s program on their platform page. Much of the company’s software is available on GitHub The program model incorporates features such as speech recognition. The machine learning technology is currently calibrated for English users only. Currently in a trial phase, students were recorded while solving problems involving fractions. The developers are analyzing transcripts from these recordings to “teach” the system to recognize common questions and speech patterns. The company claims that a German speech recognition iTalk2Learn is in the works.  As a machine learning based program, the developers of iTalk2Learn emphasize real-time analysis of their users’ experiences and results. For example, this would be achieved by monitoring how a student solves a problem involving fractions and providing feedback specific to that student’s approach. Mostly through anecdotal reports from some teachers, the company claims instances of higher student engagement and confidence in fraction work in “certain classrooms.” Matching Tutors with Students Brainly – Machine Learning Used to Match Student Problems with Content Experts Brainly is a global online learning community where students can post academic questions and community members can offer solutions. The platform is reportedly using machine learning algorithms to match problems with content experts. Human moderators are content specialists who provide oversight and monitor the quality of solutions provided by community members.  This 1 minute video below provides an overview of how the Brainly online learning community works:   Brainly aims to personalize each user experience and minimize low quality content. This is an important feature of the learning community’s brand but also an ambitious task. According to its website, Brainly receives 80 million unique visitors each month across over 35 countries. “The whole point of Brainly is to use data and technology to focus the attention on a very precise and specific problem. So Amazon, for instance, wants you to look at more and more stuff and to do things in quantity. But Brainly wants to do the opposite. We want to use machine learning to create a fully personalized learning path, to identify precisely where a student is stuck or confused or unclear, then hone in on that one specific problem and find a solution.” -Professor Chirag Shah of Rutgers University, (March 2017) The company has partnered with professionals with experience in AI and machine learning such as Chirag Shah, Ph.D. of Rutgers University to help achieve its goals.  MyTutor – Algorithm Used to Match Students With an Ideal Tutor In collaboration with University College London’s (UCL) Institute of Education, the online tutoring site MyTutor, has reportedly developed an AI-powered system to streamline the process of connecting students to their ideal tutor. After signing up, a prospective student is prompted with a series of questions pertaining to his or her personality type. The collected responses are processed using an algorithm that matches students to tutors based on compatibility. Examples of compatibility parameters include creativity, logical thinking and confidence. The system can then use these descriptors to automate the interview process and complete a match. CEO James Grant has stated that the program is founded on the idea that a complementary dynamic between students and their teacher is integral to academic success.  The short 1:11 minute video below demonstrates MyTutor in action:  One professor suggests that a limited understanding of the technology behind MyTutor’s platform may lead some parents to become concerned about providing details about their child’s personality online. Despite these challenges MyTutor claims that it has achieved a 93 percent success rate with users and boasts an average of five stars from its 43,000 user ratings. Concluding Thoughts AI is steadily being introduced into the online tutoring experience and is providing methods personalization and improving the quality of services delivered through data analytics. Despite the deluge of chatbots entering the market across industries, tutoring bots may have a promising future in the coming years (though we’re far from achieving human level sophistication in chatbots any time soon). Bots in the smart virtual learning sphere are subject to a greater degree of consistent utilization and learning opportunities compared to other industries which may receive occasional traffic. Personalization of the learning experience is a general theme across applications. Another important theme to highlight is integration of AI and human interaction. Smart virtual learning  platforms do not appear to be aiming for AI to replace human instruction but rather to supplement and enhance the human-to-human experience. A 2016 report published by Pearson on AI in education complements our observations and advocates for wider adoption of AI at scale:  “Drawing on the power of both human and artificial intelligence, we will lessen achievement gaps, address teacher retention and development, and equip parents to better support their children’s (and their own) learning. Importantly, doing this will require much more than borrowing the language of AI – we need to go deep, harnessing the power of genuine AIEd, and then working to apply it in real-life contexts at scale.” – Intelligence Unleashed: An Argument for AI in Education Similarly, a 2016 report on education published by the World Economic Forum suggests that machine learning is among the technological advances which have strong potential for personalizing instruction and improving social and emotional learning. The National Education Association is among advocates of developing social and emotional skills for improving student outcomes: “Social and emotional skills are critical to being a good student, citizen, and worker. Workforce demands aside, many call for the 21st century classroom to be student-centered and to support individual learning needs. Moreover, students’ ability to learn well depends not just on instruction, but also on factors such as the school climate, a sense of belonging with peers, positive relationships with educators, and the feedback they receive.” – The National Education Association As more students access smart virtual learning tools, machine learning has the potential to become increasingly useful to handle the large amount of data and to provide tutors with constructive feedback. Quality monitoring is always critical when providing academic support and this will become more apparent as the market becomes increasingly competitive.   Header image credit: PKHS Schools Related Posts Examples of Artificial Intelligence in EducationThough yet to become a standard in schools, artificial intelligence in education has been taught… Smart City Artificial Intelligence Applications and TrendsThanks to the relative ease with which local governments can now gather real time data,… Artificial Intelligence Plus the Internet of Things (IoT) - 3 Examples Worth Learning FromThe Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to fall into the general pit of… Everyday Examples of Artificial Intelligence and Machine LearningWith all the excitement and hype about AI that’s “just around the corner”—self-driving cars, instant… Artificial Intelligence at Wells Fargo - A Brief OverviewWells Fargo has begun a number of AI initiatives, some they've created in-house and some… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.
