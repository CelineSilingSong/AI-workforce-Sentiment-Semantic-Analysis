According to Autonomy, such a policy could also help to avoid mass unemployment and reduce widespread mental and physical illnesses.Will Stronge, the director of research at Autonomy, said: “Too many studies of AI, large language models, and so on, solely focus on either profitability or a jobs apocalypse. This study tries to show that when the technology is deployed to its full potential, but the purpose of the technology is shifted, it can not only improve work practices, but also improve work-life balance.”The research found that 28 million workers, or 88% of Great Britain’s workforce, could have their working hours reduced by at least 10% through the introduction of LLMs.The local authorities of City of London, Elmbridge and Wokingham are among those that, according to the thinktank, hold the highest potential for workers, with 38% or more of the workforce able to reduce their hours in the coming decade.AI is coming for our jobs! Could universal basic income be the solution?Read moreA similar study conducted in the US, also by Autonomy, found that 35 million American workers could also move to a four-day week inside the same time frame. It found that 128 million workers, 71% of the workforce, could have their working hours reduced by at least 10%. States including Massachusetts, Utah and Washington were found to have the potential for a quarter or more of their workforces to move to a four-day week using LLMs.Congressman Mark Takano, who has introduced a 32-hour work week bill to the US Congress, said: “Fundamental changes are coming to our workforce due to AI and automation. It will take government action to ensure gains in efficiency are felt by all workers, regardless of industry or skill level.”In the UK and the US, Autonomy calls on public- and private-sector employers to take advantage of a “significant opportunity to become world leaders in the take-up of workplace AI”, and to view this as an opportunity to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of workers. It also calls on policymakers to take action.Stronge said: “What I think would be really impressive would be a robust AI industrial strategy, with automation hubs where trade unions, industry and experts in this tech get together to say: ‘We’re going to boost productivity, and this is also going to be something which delivers for the workers.’”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe future of workArtificial intelligence (AI)Work-life balanceComputingWork & careersnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve PhillipsLiveUS election live updates: top congressional Democrats to endorse Kamala Harris – reportBeyoncé gives permission to Kamala Harris to use song on campaign trail – report",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative AI won't replace data analysts


Generative AI isn't going to replace data analysts. It can help analysts be more effective, but it lacks human insights and knowledge to properly do the job.

Generative AI will not replace data analyst jobs, nor will it replace people in many other fields, especially ones requiring human empathy and insight. Data analysis may seem like a technical role on a surface level, but the reality of the job is nuanced.







The process involves more than crunching numbers; it requires an understanding of the human elements behind the data. Whether it's analyzing customer behavior or detecting fraudulent activity, a human analyst's ability to empathize and understand the motivations, fears, ambitions and interests of others can lead to compelling insights. Insights can go beyond what is immediately apparent in the raw data and require an element of human judgment and understanding that AI currently lacks.
AI can process massive amounts of data and provide quantitative analysis. It cannot understand the subtleties of human behavior, cultural nuances or the complexities of human motivations and desires. Human factors often have a significant effect on the data and are areas where human analysts excel.
Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Bard can simulate text generation to a human-like standard, and they have the potential to automate some of the tasks that data analysts currently perform. Generative AI also has limitations, such as its inability to understand the full context of data. As a result, data analysts must interpret the results of generative AI and make decisions based on the data.

Current abilities and limits of generative AI
Generative AI cannot perform the nuanced work of analysts. Analyst work requires a synthesis of visual, numerical and tacit knowledge, which analysts cannot convey through text alone. The training data that generative AI models use limits the text that they can generate. Generative AI also cannot analyze raw data or produce original visualizations, and any insights it provides come from language patterns in the training data.
Another concern with generative AI models is accuracy. Without human oversight, the text outputs from AI can contain logical gaps, biased perspectives and factual errors it inherits from the training data. Accuracy depends on the quality and diversity of the training data. Biased or inaccurate training data causes the data sets to be biased or inaccurate as well.
AI models struggle to keep up with the real world: Training or retraining a model takes a great deal of computing power, time and money. As the world changes, the AI model falls behind until it's retrained. Even GPT-4 is only trained on data up to 2021. The irony is ChatGPT has little insight into its effects on business, the economy and intellectual life since its launch in November 2022.
Generative AI models also lack the critical thinking skills and insight to question the validity or relevance of its source material, which is an essential skill for a data analyst. A core component of data literacy is checking the quality of data and identifying potential biases.
As a result of limitations, generative AI models should not be a substitute for human analysts. Instead, the models are a tool to help analysts generate text, identify patterns and explore data. With human oversight, generative AI models can be an asset. Without human engagement, they mostly churn out repetitive, formulaic summaries of their existing knowledge.


How generative AI affects the analyst role
It will be some time before AI replaces human analysts because of its limitations. But human analysts can use AI as a valuable assistant in their work right now.
Code generation
Generative AI can suggest code to extract, clean and analyze data, which helps automate some repetitive tasks. It lacks the deep understanding of context, business goals and interdependencies required to design complex, scalable and maintainable code architectures. It can help an analyst who may need to work in multiple languages or diverse architectures, generating helpful code for quick review.
Data modeling
Given the right information, AI can propose data structures such as tables, especially for analytic schemas such as stars and snowflakes. Although AI can identify patterns within data and suggest tables, the task of defining efficient and effective data structures often needs human intervention.
AI can struggle to get it right the first time because it does not have the same understanding of the data as a human analyst. An analyst understands the nature of the data, its relationships and how to best model it for a specific use case. Analysts' knowledge is essential for defining efficient and effective data structures. It might be too much work to describe the necessary details to the AI program, but the human analyst can work with an intuition for potential use cases.
Human analysts often are wrong on the first iteration too, but they start with a richer understanding of the problem.
One interesting use of AI is to recommend analytical methods. Analysts must validate the suitability of a suggested method for the problem, account for business needs, data constraints and possibly even budget constraints for compute and storage.
Suppose an AI system is analyzing customer purchase data to increase sales. It sifts through massive data sets and identifies a pattern: Customers who buy a laptop often also buy a wireless mouse. Consequently, the AI recommends that bundling the products together in a promotional offer might lead to increased sales.



Smart analysts can use AI as a tool to augment their abilities rather than perceive it as a threat to their roles.




The human data analyst -- using specific business knowledge and experience -- can complement the AI-generated insight. They know that the laptop has a high profit margin and the mouse has a low profit margin. A bundle could increase sales, but may dent overall profit. They might suggest a tweak to the AI's strategy: Instead of a bundle, offer the mouse at a discount, perhaps with a coupon, only after the customer has bought a laptop. The proposal maintains the profitability of the laptop and the overall sales might still increase due to the perceived deal. The human analyst can also provide context about supply chain constraints, seasonal trends or upcoming marketing campaigns the AI might not be aware of.
With new insight, analysts can prompt the AI again and see if it has more, or similar, recommendations.


The near-term future of AI in data analysis
AI can enhance -- rather than replace -- the role of data analysts. Analysts can dedicate more time to strategic work as automation helps carry out routine data tasks. But AI is not accountable for its own errors. Responsibility and blame still rest with humans.
Human judgment, coupled with a healthy dose of skepticism and business acumen, continue to be indispensable assets AI cannot replace. Smart analysts can use AI as a tool to augment their abilities rather than perceive it as a threat to their roles.
Today, AI can automate repetitive tasks, provide insights into large data sets, help draft initial reports, write code snippets and propose potential routes for analysis. As AI advances, the industry might look forward to more sophisticated assistance in data analysis. AI can suggest potential data sources, generate effective test data, or drive operational and tactical decisions.
Even if generative AI reduces the number of analysts required, the key role of the human analyst remains. Their knowledge of the specific context, ability to apply critical thinking and deep understanding of human needs remains, even with new advances. The human analyst's role is not obsolete. It's more essential to ensure their organization harnesses generative AI's potential effectively and responsibly.

When ChatGPT was released in November 2022, it sparked many conversations and moral panics. These centre on the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the information environment. People worry that AI chatbots can negatively affect the integrity of creative and academic work, especially since they can produce human-like texts and images.
ChatGPT is a generative AI model using machine learning. It creates human-like responses, having been trained to recognise patterns in data. While it appears the model is engaging in natural conversation, it references a vast amount of data and extracts features and patterns to generate coherent replies.
Higher education is one sector in which the rise of AI like ChatGPT has sparked concerns. Some of these relate to ethics and integrity in teaching, learning and knowledge production. 
We’re a group of academics in the field of media and communication, teaching in South African universities. We wanted to understand how university students were using generative AI and AI-powered tools in their academic practices. We administered an online survey to undergraduate students at five South African universities: the University of Cape Town, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Stellenbosch University, Rhodes University, and the University of the Witwatersrand. 
The results suggest that the moral panics around the use of generative AI are unwarranted. Students are not hyper-focused on ChatGPT. We found that students often use generative AI tools for engaged learning and that they have a critical and nuanced understanding of these tools. 
What could be of greater concern from a teaching and learning perspective is that, second to using AI-powered tools for clarifying concepts, students are using them to generate ideas for assignments or essays or when they feel stuck on a specific topic. 
Unpacking the data
The survey was completed by 1,471 students. Most spoke English as their home language, followed by isiXhosa and isiZulu. The majority were first-year students. Most respondents were registered in Humanities, followed by Science, Education and Commerce. While the survey is thus skewed towards first-year Humanities students, it provides useful indicative findings as educators explore new terrain. 
We asked students whether they had used individual AI tools,  listing some of the most popular tools across several categories. Our survey did not explore lecturers’ attitudes or policies towards AI tools. This will be probed in the next phase of our study, which will comprise focus groups with students and interviews with lecturers. Our study was not on ChatGPT specifically, though we did ask students about their use of this specific tool. We explored broad uses of AI-powered technologies to get a sense of how students use these tools, which tools they use, and where ChatGPT fits into these practices. 
These were the key findings:

41% of respondents indicated that they primarily used a laptop for their academic work, followed by a smartphone (29.8%). Only 10.5% used a desktop computer and 6.6% used a tablet.
Students tended to use a range of other AI-powered tools over ChatGPT, including translation and referencing tools. With reference to the use of online writing assistants such as Quillbot, 46.5% of respondents indicated that they used such tools to improve their writing style for an assignment. 80.5% indicated that they had used Grammarly or similar tools to help them write in appropriate English. 
Fewer than half of survey respondents (37.3%) said that they had used ChatGPT to answer an essay question.
Students acknowledged that AI-powered tools could lead to plagiarism or affect their learning. However, they also stated that they did not use these tools in problematic ways.

      ChatGPT is the push higher education needs to rethink assessment





Respondents were overwhelmingly positive about the potential of digital and AI tools to make it easier for them to progress through university. They indicated that these tools could help to: clarify academic concepts; formulate ideas; structure essays; improve academic writing; save time; check spelling and grammar;  clarify assignment instructions; find information or academic sources; summarise academic texts; guide students for whom English is not a native language to improve their academic writing; study for a test; paraphrase better; avoid plagiarism; and reference better. 
Most students who viewed these tools as beneficial to the learning process used tools such as ChatGPT to clarify concepts related to their studies that they could not fully grasp or that they felt were not properly explained by lecturers.

Engaged learning
We were particularly interested to find that students often used generative AI tools for engaged learning. This is an educational approach in which students are accountable for their own learning. They actively create thinking and learning skills and strategies and formulate new ideas and understanding through conversations and collaborative work.

      'Please do not assume the worst of us': students know AI is here to stay and want unis to teach them how to use it




Through their use of AI tools, students can tailor content to address their specific strengths and weaknesses, to have a more engaged learning experience. AI tools can also be a sort of personalised online “tutor” with whom they have “conversations” to help them understand difficult concepts.
Concerns about how AI tools potentially undermine academic assessment and integrity are valid. However, those working in higher education must note the importance of factoring in students’ perspectives to work towards new pathways of assessment and learning.

The deliberate collision of two game-changing technologies has the potential to upend the technology industry and bring about a new era of business disruption and innovation. Few industries will be spared this transformation, and it will create completely new value and risks. Hyperbole? I don’t think so. In the future, artificial intelligence is likely to become supercharged by quantum computing. It’s a partnership that could change the world.


The growing wonder and value of artificial intelligence (AI), triggered by the broad availability of generative AI in late 2022, is understandable. Uses of this software such as the creation of remarkable human-like text and graphics can often exceed the hype. That’s saying something for the technology industry that too often gets ahead of itself. Frequent and mesmerizing new updates to generative AI and the innovation that quickly follows demonstrates that this technology is evolving at breakneck speed.

But, despite the introduction of faster microchips to feed its hunger, AI is ultimately constrained by our ability to continue to squeeze more processing power from silicon-based hardware. It’s just a limitation of physics. That said, let’s recognize that classical computing, based on transistors and electricity, has served us all well and powered the information age to date.

PROMOTED
If AI could be powered by a new generation of computing power—quantum processing—then it would leave today’s innovation in the dust.

That day may be coming sooner than you think. It may not be next year, but could we see practical applications within the next decade?
Quantum computing, an entirely new way of processing information, when combined with AI, has the potential, without exaggeration, to bring about a new computing revolution. Transformation may be an understatement.

Today, quantum computing isn’t a term that’s particularly familiar to those outside the technology and physics worlds, but it soon will be. This form of computing, still in its relative infancy, originates out of quantum mechanics, the behavior of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. Leveraging this science to power a new form of computing began in earnest in the 1970s. By the 1980s, notable scientists such as Paul Benioff, Yuri Manin, Richard Feynman, and David Deutsch, established the core principles. By the late 1990s, the first functioning quantum computers emerged.

Instead of processing information in terms of 1s and 0s—called bits—and doing it serially, which is how classical computing works, quantum computers use qubits which can represent a 1 and a 0 simultaneously. Like a guitar, bits are similar to playing one note at a time, whereas, qubits play several notes together. With enough qubits, quantum computers could theoretically be millions of times faster than the fastest microchip computers today.

But quantum computing isn’t confined anymore to research labs, although technological hurdles must still be overcome. Big tech firms such as IBM, Microsoft, and Google, and many compelling market entrants such as IonQ and D-Wave Systems, provide capabilities that can be used today. That said, usage is still fairly specialized and often experimental in nature. Practical uses today can be found in pharmaceutical development, cybersecurity, financial services, and weather forecasting.
There’s a lot of optimism that the pace of quantum computing innovation will continue to accelerate, and we could see mainstream adoption by the end of the decade. That’s just around the corner.
Independent of artificial intelligence, quantum computing is going to be a big deal. However, coupled with AI, it will be a gamechanger.
Revolutionary innovation is not an exaggeration.
In the interim, work to integrate artificial intelligence with quantum computing will continue. Research is nascent and non-trivial technological hurdles exist.
Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) — and in particular, its subset research area Quantum Machine Learning (QML) — will use new quantum-designed algorithms with superpowers that result in much more powerful AI models. As QAI gradually emerges, we can expect significant improvements in the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of AI. We should also anticipate the emergence of completely new and surprising business capabilities.
At first, the benefits will be reaped by certain industries and needs, particularly those with optimization requirements. But later, as QAI becomes more mainstream, almost every enterprise will need to have a strategy.
An example of work-in-progress today is a partnership between IonQ and Hyundai who are researching the use of QAI to process images such as road signs.
For learning and experimenting, Google currently offers a platform, TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ), for prototyping hybrid quantum-classical AI models.
Rather than playing catch-up when QAI arrives, organizations should have the technology on their radar and follow developments closely. Those lucky enough to have an innovation lab or equivalent, should consider some experimental and research work, if only for the purposes of acquiring skills and knowledge.
The high level of interest from industry and the pace of scientific research clearly suggests that QAI is coming, and the question will be whether you are ready. It’s probably closer than you think and it’s likely going to be a very big deal.

The answer depends on what we do todayNov 16, 202352% of workers surveyed by Randstad believe AI will help their career growth and promotion.Image: Getty Images/iStockphotoSander van't NoordendeCEO, RandstadShare:Our ImpactWhat's the World Economic Forum doing to accelerate action on Jobs and the Future of Work?Crowdsource InnovationGet involved with our crowdsourced digital platform to deliver impact at scaleStay up to date:Jobs and SkillsFollowArtificial Intelligence (AI) is already encroaching on many people's lives and careers.Despite that, just 13% report that they have been offered training in AI-related skills.To manage the coming change to the world of work, we must examine how we approach training, define work, help employees transition and manage our social safety net.Artificial Intelligence (AI) will touch all of our lives sooner or later, and autonomous technology has already affected vast swaths of the global workforce in meaningful and subtle ways.However, with its full potential yet to be realized, workers are increasingly trying to establish whether AI is a friend or foe. The truth lies in between.AI is already affecting many people by helping them get work done more quickly and efficiently. It’s doing so by enhancing decision-making, communication, collaboration and other skills. At the same time, mass disruption of the labour market is expected in the near future.Have you read?Responsible AI governance can be achieved through multistakeholder collaborationAI is finding its voice and that's bad for democracy4 ways AI can super-charge sustainable developmentFriend or foe? Here's what workers thinkAccording to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023, 23% of jobs will be affected by churn — a mix of roles added and eliminated in the next five years. While it may seem like a daunting development for those affected, AI’s accelerated development is like any other technologies before it: exciting, concerning and, ultimately, beneficial to the global economy.There is widespread agreement even among the world’s workers. In a recent poll by Randstad, the Workmonitor Pulse, 52% of workers surveyed believe AI will help their career growth and promotion, rather than lead to the loss of their jobs. Additionally, 47% are excited about the prospect of AI in the workplace — more than the 39% who are worried. One-third are already using AI tools at work, and 53% believe their role and industry will eventually be swept up in the AI revolution.Many people are already using AI in their work — and that figure is set to grow. Image: RandstadWhile workers expressed excitement about what the future may bring, they also want help with transitioning to an AI-empowered future, specifically learning to thrive in this new age: 55% say they need learning opportunities to future proof their careers, and this sentiment was the highest among those aged 35-44, of which 60% felt this way. In contrast, people aged 55-67 are the least likely to feel this way at 47%.A majority — 59% — said they have the right skills today to make use of the latest technology, while 17% said they do not. A significant training gap remains between what workers need versus what they are receiving. Nearly 22% of workers say they want learning and development support to use AI, but just 13% reported receiving it during the past 12 months. This is a significant deficiency, given that 37% say they will leave their jobs if their expectations for skilling are not met. Among Gen Z respondents, 47% said they would do so.The AI revolution will be more disruptive to the labour market than many of the technologies that came before it. If policy-makers, employers and workers are not ready to embrace the forthcoming changes, they will be left behind. This could lead to elevated unemployment and talent shortages at the same time. The skills gap has been growing for years, and AI could exacerbate market inefficiencies if the global community doesn't act.Less than 1 in 5 people has been offered AI training in the last year, despite the technology rapidly growing in influence. Image: Randstad4 ways to prepare the workforce for AIWe must help people successfully transition to an AI-powered economy, ensure businesses close the skills gap and enable the labour market to operate at optimal levels. To do so, a coordinated effort is needed to address the AI revolution in four key areas:1. Training and developmentPeople are both excited and apprehensive about the impact of AI on their jobs. Policy-makers, employers and workers must understand how technology will transform their particular interests and develop appropriate strategies and tactics. Skilling regiments must focus on how to use AI, where to deploy it and its ethical limitations. Effective change management must guide such efforts to help people move into new roles and work.2. Redefining workA key change AI will bring is how we regard work. Today it can be linear and sequential, but AI will perform tasks in parallel at speeds and scales that are hard to fathom. This means the work that people currently perform must be reconfigured so they can focus on higher-value tasks that can’t be automated. At the same time, organizations need to rethink how to best amplify human skills using innovative tools. For example, AI systems can free up doctors by transcribing notes, entering and organizing patient data into portals and other time-consuming tasks. Each organization will need to explore what is possible with current and future technology.3. Employment transitionWith many jobs caught up in labour-market churn over the next five years, employers and policy-makers must coordinate efforts to help affected workers to adapt. Whether this is in the form of redeployment or upskilling, significant support is needed. Recognize what skills clusters individuals belong in and shift them to growth areas within that cluster. Similarly, identifying other industries in which their skills are needed can help displaced workers discover a new career path.4. Social safety netsFor those unable to transition to new roles, social protections must be provided. Even AI’s most vociferous advocates have raised concerns about the impact on the loss of income and jobs, especially for so-called lower-skilled workers. Even those who can move into new careers and lines of work may experience some financial disruptions. Employers and governments should provide both bridge aid as well as long-term benefits. Avoiding mass job losses is pivotal to broader acceptance and adoption of AI in the future.The future of work will certainly involve widespread use of AI, which will help people perform work more quickly and efficiently. This can’t happen, however, without giving them the right skills, a new way of working, sustainable career paths and social support during the transition. Technology has always been a powerful enabler of the global economy — but we must use it in a responsible and ethical way that leaves no one behind.

Even as the popularity of generative AI continues to grow, there is an urgent need for enterprises to clearly define policies to prevent employees from using unauthorized tools, which can potentially put businesses at risk. This is a key result of the recent Salesforce survey of around 14,000 full-time in 14 countries.
A little over a quarter (28%) of workers are using generative AI at work and over half of them are using it without any approval or authorization from their employers, the survey revealed. Significantly, another 32% of those surveyed said they plan to start using generative AI soon. The survey was conducted as part of the Generative AI Snapshot Research Series, “The Promises and Pitfalls of AI at Work.”
A key reason for the growing usage of generative AI is the realization that it significantly helps increase employee productivity. The users of generative AI realize its importance, with 71% saying that it makes them more productive at work and 58% believing that the technology makes them more engaged at work.











 
 
 
Interestingly, almost 50% of the surveyed employees said developing expertise in generative AI will help increase their job satisfaction, make them more sought after at the workplace, and improve their earnings.

All this bodes well for the growth of the technology. Generative AI can potentially add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy, according to McKinsey.  
Lack of policies makes enterprises vulnerable to security risks
Even as the usage of generative AI continues to rise, the lack of policies and clarity on the safe and authorized tools is increasing the security risks for enterprises. In a survey conducted by Salesforce earlier this year, 73% of the respondents said they believed that generative AI comes with security risks. Inaccurate results, coupled with infringement of intellectual property rights, are some of the other risks related to generative AI.











 
 
 
The usage of unauthorized and banned generative AI tools was highest in India, with 64% of surveyed employees across industries using them to advance their careers, the Salesforce survey said. On the other hand, the Netherlands recorded the lowest usage of unauthorized generative AI tools, with just 43% of surveyed employees using them.
The lack of clearly defined usage policies is making enterprises vulnerable to these risks and preventing them from realizing the vast potential of generative AI. About 79% of the companies do not have clearly defined policies regarding the usage of generative AI, according to the Salesforce survey. Out of these, 15% have loosely defined policies for using generative AI for work and 37% of those surveyed have no policies on using generative AI at work and the remaining 27% have no idea.  
Unethical use of generative AI
As the usage of unauthorized generative AI increases, employees are engaging in unethical activities including passing AI-generated work as their own. Nearly 64% of those surveyed passed off generative AI work as their own and 41% of the workers may consider overstating their generative AI skills to secure a work opportunity.











 
 
 
A significant lacuna emerging in the Salesforce survey is the lack of training. Nearly 70% of the workers have neither completed nor received any training on using generative AI safely and ethically at work. “With clear guidelines, employees will be able to understand and address AI’s risks while also harnessing its innovations to supercharge their careers,” Paula Goldman, chief ethical and humane use officer at Salesforce, said in a blog post.

One of the biggest concerns around the increasing power and popularity of AI tech over the past couple of years is whether it will take jobs away from humans, as it is proven to be capable of taking on more of the tasks that humans currently perform. A recent  survey from LinkedIn  found nearly half of European workers are expecting AI to make a major impact on their working lives within the next year. Generative text AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard can write whole articles or business plans in seconds, producing a close approximation of what a human can do when fed the right prompts and information. Image generation tools meanwhile can conjure up photorealistic pictures nearly instantaneously, raising questions about job security for human artists and illustrators. But the new report from Autonomy, an independent think tank that looks at the future of work and economic planning, sets out a more promising vision of AI’s impact on our working lives. In its GPT-4 (Day Week) report, the authors suggest 8.8 million workers in the UK - 28 per cent of the workforce - could be working 32-hour, four-day weeks thanks to AI. A further 27.9 million meanwhile - representing 88 per cent of the country’s workforce - could have working hours reduced by at least 10 per cent too. AI could usher in new work benefits Autonomy made its calculations using the 1.5 per cent annual productivity increase from AI that was estimated by Goldman Sachs  in a recent study  on the topic of AI and GDP, as well as data from the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Information Network (O*NET). The Autonomy report outlines two forecasts for leveraging AI to boost productivity while delivering better conditions for workers, specifically looking at how the ideas could be rolled out in local authorities in the UK. The two scenarios are a 20 per cent reduction in working hours while keeping the same pay for workers, or one in which worker productivity increases by 10 per cent, enabling a 10 per cent reduction in working hours, while keeping the same pay. “Our research offers a fresh perspective in debates around how AI can be utilised for good,” said Will Stronge, director of research at Autonomy. “A shorter working week is the most tangible way of ensuring that AI delivers benefits to workers as well as companies. If AI is to be implemented fairly across the economy, it should usher in a new era of four-day working weeks for all”. Various  four-day week trials  are either underway or have been recently completed, with the majority of results pointing towards either maintained or improved levels of productivity, with substantial benefits for worker well-being.

Three Ways Generative AI Can Bolster Cybersecurity


				The machine learning technology taking the world by storm can help defend networks from intruders, too.

  Human analysts can no longer effectively defend against the increasing speed and complexity of cybersecurity attacks. The amount of data is simply too large to screen manually.
Generative AI, the most transformative tool of our time, enables a kind of digital jiu jitsu. It lets companies shift the force of data that threatens to overwhelm them into a force that makes their defenses stronger.
Business leaders seem ready for the opportunity at hand. In a recent survey, CEOs said cybersecurity is one of their top three concerns, and they see generative AI as a lead technology that will deliver competitive advantages.
Generative AI brings both risks and benefits. An earlier blog outlined six steps to start the process of securing enterprise AI.
Here are three ways generative AI can bolster cybersecurity.
Begin With Developers
First, give developers a security copilot.
Everyone plays a role in security, but not everyone is a security expert. So, this is one of the most strategic places to begin.
The best place to start bolstering security is on the front end, where developers are writing software. An AI-powered assistant, trained as a security expert, can help them ensure their code follows best practices in security.
The AI software assistant can get smarter every day if it’s fed previously reviewed code. It can learn from prior work to help guide developers on best practices.
To give users a leg up, NVIDIA is creating a workflow for building such co-pilots or chatbots. This particular workflow uses components from NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for building and customizing large language models.
Whether users customize their own models or use a commercial service, a security assistant is just the first step in applying generative AI to cybersecurity.
An Agent to Analyze Vulnerabilities
Second, let generative AI help navigate the sea of known software vulnerabilities.
At any moment, companies must choose among thousands of patches to mitigate known exploits. That’s because every piece of code can have roots in dozens if not thousands of different software branches and open-source projects.
An LLM focused on vulnerability analysis can help prioritize which patches a company should implement first. It’s a particularly powerful security assistant because it reads all the software libraries a company uses as well as its policies on the features and APIs it supports.
To test this concept, NVIDIA built a pipeline to analyze software containers for vulnerabilities. The agent identified areas that needed patching with high accuracy, speeding the work of human analysts up to 4x.
The takeaway is clear. It’s time to enlist generative AI as a first responder in vulnerability analysis.
Fill the Data Gap
Finally, use LLMs to help fill the growing data gap in cybersecurity.
Users rarely share information about data breaches because they’re so sensitive. That makes it difficult to anticipate exploits.
Enter LLMs. Generative AI models can create synthetic data to simulate never-before-seen attack patterns. Such synthetic data can also fill gaps in training data so machine-learning systems learn how to defend against exploits before they happen.
Staging Safe Simulations
Don’t wait for attackers to demonstrate what’s possible. Create safe simulations to learn how they might try to penetrate corporate defenses.
This kind of proactive defense is the hallmark of a strong security program. Adversaries are already using generative AI in their attacks. It’s time users harness this powerful technology for cybersecurity defense.
To show what’s possible, another AI workflow uses generative AI to defend against spear phishing — the carefully targeted bogus emails that cost companies an estimated $2.4 billion in 2021 alone.
This workflow generated synthetic emails to make sure it had plenty of good examples of spear phishing messages. The AI model trained on that data learned to understand the intent of incoming emails through natural language processing capabilities in NVIDIA Morpheus, a framework for AI-powered cybersecurity.
The resulting model caught 21% more spear phishing emails than existing tools. Check out our developer blog or watch the video below to learn more.

Wherever users choose to start this work, automation is crucial, given the shortage of cybersecurity experts and the thousands upon thousands of users and use cases that companies need to protect.
These three tools — software assistants, virtual vulnerability analysts and synthetic data simulations — are great starting points for applying generative AI to a security journey that continues every day.
But this is just the beginning. Companies need to integrate generative AI into all layers of their defenses.

Is there a catch?Supported byAbout this contentPhilippa KellyThu 16 Nov 2023 10.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 16 Nov 2023 10.03 ESTShareThe idea of a guaranteed income for all has been floating around for centuries, its popularity ebbing and flowing with the passing tide of current events. While it is still considered by many to be a radical concept, proponents of a universal basic income (UBI) no longer see it only as a solution to poverty but as the answer to some of the biggest threats faced by modern workers: wage inequality, job insecurity – and the looming possibility of AI-induced job losses.Elon Musk, at the recent Bletchley Park summit, said he believed “no job is needed” due to the development of AI, and that a job can be for “personal satisfaction”. Economist and political theorist Karl Widerquist, professor of philosophy at Georgetown University-Qatar, sees it differently.“Even if AI takes your job away, you don’t necessarily just become unemployed for the rest of your life,” he says. “What happens is you go down in the labour market, you start crowding the lower-income professions.”Widerquist believes, at least in the short term, that the growth of AI will push white-collar workers into the gig economy, and into other forms of poorly paid, insecure work. Such a shift in the workforce would, he fears, drive down wages and conditions, while increasing inequality.Why not give people who have good alternatives the opportunity to reduce work, or not work at all?Loek Groot, economistA UBI policy in response to AI and automation would address the failure of employers to distribute the spoils of economic growth – propelled, at least in part, by automation – fairly among workers, says Widerquist.Some go further still, pointing to UBI as a dividend due to workers for their role in the development and dissemination of knowledge used to train AI models such as ChatGPT. “Why,” asks Scott Santens, editor of website Basic Income Today, “should only one or two companies get rich off of the capital, the human work, that we all created?”If, in the future, workers do find themselves made redundant by automation and unable to secure new positions, UBI offers a similarly promising option, says Loek Groot, associate professor of economics of the public sector at Utrecht University.In a study conducted by Groot and fellow researchers in the Netherlands between 2017 and 2019, unemployed individuals who were previously in receipt of social assistance were given a basic income. The study indicated increased participation in the labour market. This was not solely due to the financial support provided by UBI, but to the removal of conditions – and sanctions for failing to fulfil said conditions – traditionally imposed on job seekers, says Groot.Specifically, participants who were exempt from obligations to find and accept work were more likely to secure a permanent contract – in contrast with the type of insecure work highlighted by Widerquist.While UBI experiments do not generally show that the policy encourages workers to entirely leave the labour market, higher payments have led to some people reducing their working hours. This, Groot says, should not be considered a bad thing. “Why try to push everyone into paid work, if you can objectively see that there are not enough jobs around?” he asks. “Why not give people who have good alternatives the opportunity to reduce work, or not work at all, and cash in the basic income?”“Good alternatives” include the opportunity to upskill or retrain. It’s also possible that the policy could redefine what society has historically considered work. Caregivers – predominantly women – could be remunerated for traditionally unpaid labour, such as raising children or caring for elderly relatives.View image in fullscreenGrace, a retired 65-year-old, takes care of her cow in Bondo region, western Kenya. Grace receives 75 cents (62p) a day as part of a large-scale universal basic income study by American NGO GiveDirectly. Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty ImagesIn Kenya, the world’s largest UBI scheme has been providing almost 5,000 people with a payment of about 75 cents (62p) a day since 2017. Organised by GiveDirectly and funded by donations, the experiment will run for 12 years. Tavneet Suri, a member of GiveDirectly’s research team and professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says she has so far seen some surprising results.“We do see people leaving low wage jobs,” she says. “They are going and starting businesses, and the businesses are doing great because there’s money around.” This unexpected wave of entrepreneurship has also had a positive impact on those taking jobs that pay wages, as a shrinking of the available workforce has led to an increase in salaries.“In a developing country, if we see a 20% increase in businesses, that’s people who are going to pay taxes,” says Suri. “Because farmers [who make up a high percentage of Kenya’s workforce] are not taxed in general, suddenly you have a bunch of people showing up in tax brackets, and they’re buying stuff. And one of the biggest pieces of revenue for the government is actually sales tax.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The distinction between a machine and a robot is still not clearRosanna Merola, International Labour OrganizationSuri and her colleagues also report that workers have not left the labour market, and that local economies have been boosted by increased buying power. Despite this, Suri is cautious. In a country where poverty remains far more pressing for workers than automation, she says a government-backed UBI programme must be shown to be truly beneficial before being seriously considered.For countries where automation is a greater concern, Rosanna Merola, a macroeconomist and researcher at the International Labour Organization, has considered a very different approach: a robot tax. In a 2022 research paper, Merola described the possibility of taxing companies that replace workers with robots in order to fund a UBI as “philosophically appealing”, if currently unrealistic.“At this stage, proposals on how to implement a robot tax in practice remain very nebulous,” she says. “Legislators are likely to deal with the complexity of defining what constitutes a ‘robot’ and how to tax it. The distinction between a machine and a robot or between a computer program and AI is still not clear.”Despite this, Merola does believe that the concept of a robot tax could be extended to apply to AI in more recognisable forms – large language models such as ChatGPT, for example. She suggests that companies that use AI to automate tasks, make decisions or perform services might be subject to taxes on the profits or revenue generated through AI-driven processes. Or, governments might tax the collection, processing or sale of data on which AI heavily relies, with a portion of this revenue used to mitigate the technology’s impact on displaced workers.View image in fullscreenHumanity painted out of the picture by robots. Is it time for a ‘robot tax’? Illustration: Andrea Ucini/The GuardianJoe Chrisp, a researcher at the University of Bath’s Universal Income Beacon, feels that conversations surrounding automation in work can sometimes resemble a “counsel of despair”. Crisp does believe that a UBI could deliver positive outcomes for workers, but describes himself as a “friendly sceptic”.While some argue that AI could drive workers into the gig economy, and that a UBI could help to lift them out, Chrisp says that such a policy risks “facilitating the proliferation of these types of jobs, rather than incentivising people to find more stable work”.AI having ‘positive impact’ on UK jobs but could increase regional inequalities, says reportRead moreAnd, on the topic of a possible UBI model, he is once again sceptical, describing even the most modest proposals as likely to require large increases in taxation, and therefore as “difficult to sell”.Research from thinktank Autonomy shows a modest UBI scheme would probably require higher contributions from the most well-off, but would not result in a net increase to taxation. “That model is effectively cost neutral, and would halve child poverty and pensioner poverty,” says Will Stronge, director of research at Autonomy. “But I think it wouldn’t be high enough to achieve some of the more expensive cultural changes.”Chrisp agrees that in the medium term, there must be a strategy to help workers to secure new roles in a changing economy. And, in the shorter term, a safety net for those same workers must be found. However, he is not convinced that a single policy could provide the solution to an issue as complex as the impact of AI on work.“Personally, that vision of a UBI providing lots of people who can’t find any job in the labour market with a secure income indefinitely, I find that quite depressing,” he says. “Capitalist economies are very good at continuing to generate things that people can do to earn a wage, it’s just a question of whether those are good jobs or not – and that we can’t really know.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe future of workUniversal basic incomeArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingWorkers' rightsfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve PhillipsLiveUS election live updates: top congressional Democrats to endorse Kamala Harris – reportBeyoncé gives permission to Kamala Harris to use song on campaign trail – report",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forward-looking leadership lessons for using AI emerge for effective leaders through recent conversations with three visionary professors in the UK at the TWIN AI Roundtable hosted by Lloyd’s Lab, including what types of jobs are AI-resilient, how to frame education for AI users, and how to use AI to increase human wellbeing and flourishing while managing risk:


1. What types of jobs are AI resilient – In a recent article, Professor David Shrier of Imperial College Business School wrote about AI-resilient jobs with Julian Emanuel and Marc Harris of Evercore ISI. The team consolidated academic and economic data spanning 160 million U.S. jobs, 20 industries, 250+ subsectors and 800+ occupations, examining how workers used 52 abilities in 41 activities to complete their jobs. Their analysis found that cognitive abilities (such as information ordering and memorization) are more at risk to be better performed by AI than a human being. By contrast, creative- or strength-based abilities (such as originality, oral expression, or explosive strength) have a lower risk of being replaced by AI. The more social interaction and empathy that a job requires, the less risk; and, the more physical labor is entailed in a job, the less risk it has (subject, in the latter case, to the possibility of robotic automation).

From an industry perspective, AI risk to jobs is greater in high value-added service sector jobs such as legal, computer and mathematical, and business and financial operations occupations; and this risk is lower in more manufacturing-oriented sectors. Overall, the researchers estimated that generative AI-driven tools can leverage 32% of each job’s function on average across the entirety of the U.S. economy to improve productivity. By 2032, as much as $12 trillion of global GDP will be created through integrating and applying artificial intelligence. With such large-scale disruption, effective CEOs and Boards of Directors are building capabilities and launching AI initiatives immediately to stay competitive.

2. How to frame AI education for users – Professor Sue Black, OBE, of Durham University, is an award-winning computer scientist, champion of women in STEM, and digital skills expert who led the campaign to save the UK’s Bletchley Park. In a recent article, she outlined several key principles in framing education for AI users. First, help users understand that technology often is not a problem, but the way people use it can be. It is essential for those using the technology to understand what it is intended to do (for example, generative AI is not a search engine; it is a sentence and code completer), as well as how it is used, who controls it, and who has built and tested it. For example, users should understand why generative AI creates “hallucinations” and how to minimize them. Second, identify biases in computer data and models. When Sue Black’s team first accessed generative AI models, they found the tools to be powerful and potentially positive; however, when investigating whether any types of prompts generated bias, it took only a few prompts (and a few seconds) to identify bias. Effective leaders educate as many people as possible about the risk of bias, so that users can recognize and address bias before it begins. Third, support AI users to be continuous learners and teachers at the same time. In the current environment, individuals benefit from continually updating themselves on “What’s the latest thing that I should be looking out for?” and from being able to find things for themselves. It is important for leaders and users alike not to get deterred by tech jargon or to fear technology.

3. Using AI to increase human wellbeing and flourishing – Professor Keyun Ruan of New York University is Google Cloud CISO and co-founder of the Happiness Foundation and haia.ai in Oxford, England. In her paper and subsequent book on cybernomics, she set the scene for better understanding how technology (and AI specifically) contributes to human productivity and flourishing, as well as risks. She notes that with AI technology, it is likely that people will work less on routine and mundane tasks and more on higher-level thinking and problem solving, enabling them to be more productive, healthier, and potentially live longer. Therefore, AI technology (when used appropriately) can create new prospects and exploration. History demonstrates that if tools are used effectively, there will be considerable benefits. Economic theories for both human and risk factors suggest that increased education and accessibility to AI lead to higher and more sustainable economic value. Further, society is at a historical turning point, defined by human relationships with the technological tools they have invented. There is great opportunity through collective imagination to reflect and reinvent the growth mindset, shifting from focus from external materialistic production to inward human fulfillment and wellbeing. The next stage of the technology-driven industrial revolution is likely about human empowerment with technology at the center. Effective leaders recognize problems and opportunities as human-driven rather than technology-driven, and guide technology (and the people using it) to address them.

Amazon confirmed Monday that it is planning to lay off several hundred workers at its Alexa division as part of a shift in focus to generative AI.
The company’s emphasis on developing generative AI systems has resulted in the release of new offerings, like the tool rolled out in September to generate copy listings for users selling items on the company’s e-commerce platform. The application is fueled by a large language model (LLM) that Amazon has been developing internally,  originally to support the Alexa smart assistant.
But in a statement Monday, the company said its latest round of job cuts will impact staff working on Alexa-related efforts. “Several hundred roles are impacted, a relatively small percentage of the total number of people in the Devices business who are building great experiences for our customers.”











 
 
 
Amazon noted that there are more than half a billion Alexa devices in customers’ homes. “Our investments in generative AI are bringing our vision for an even more intuitive, intelligent, and useful Alexa closer than ever before,” the company said. “As we continue to invent, we’re shifting some of our efforts to better align with our business priorities, and what we know matters most to customers—which includes maximizing our resources and efforts focused on generative AI. These shifts are leading us to discontinue some initiatives, which is resulting in role eliminations.”

Amazon has already undertaken multiple rounds of layoffs in the last 12 months and this is not the first time Amazon’s devices and services team, which includes those working on the company’s Echo devices and Alexa, has been cut back. Employees in this department were part of 18,000 jobs Amazon axed at the start of 2023.
In March, the company announced it would be laying off an additional 9,000 workers, with the cuts affecting employees at AWS, PXT (People Experience and Technology, Amazon’s HR arm), Advertising, and Twitch, the livestreaming service purchased by Amazon in 2014 for nearly $1 billion.

Of organizations that use hybrid cloud, 68% have established formal, organization-wide policies around generative AI, The Harris Poll working on behalf of the IBM Institute for Business Value found in a news report published in November. The Cloud Transformation Report, released Nov. 20, tracked trends in the intersection between hybrid cloud, generative AI, sustainability and tech skills.
The survey was conducted virtually, with 3,018 IT and business decision-makers in 12 countries and across 23 industries participating in May and June 2023.

Hybrid cloud supports generative AI workloads
For IBM, hybrid cloud infrastructure is key because it can support generative AI workloads – as long as organizations have a strategy to do so.
“The success of this technology (generative AI) remains dependent on organizations having the skills and infrastructure needed to build and utilize compute-intensive technology,” said Rohit Badlaney, general manager of IBM’s cloud product and industry platforms group, in an email interview with TechRepublic. “Organizations must formalize their AI strategy and create clear, organization-wide policies to address their generative AI approach.”
The report found that 73% of tech leaders in government, 69% of tech leaders in manufacturing and 68% of tech leaders in consumer goods already have generative AI strategies. Banking and financial markets, insurance, life science, electronics and automotive have been slower to adopt organization-wide generative AI strategies.

IBM offers its watsonx platform running on IBM Cloud and GPU options on IBM Cloud as a service. Other companies that offer similar services and infrastructure include Amazon, Google, SAP and Databricks.
“Enterprises that are looking to successfully scale AI must consider the data – data is growing exponentially and it’s everywhere – across multiple clouds with multiple vendors, on premises and at the edge,” said Badlaney. “Successful adoption boils down to data management and workload placement.”
How tech leaders can build on their cloud experience to include generative AI
To find a balance between generative AI and an organization’s current cloud strategy, technology leaders can:

Create an organization-wide strategy on how to work with generative AI and align it with other digital transformation.
Move sensitive workloads from public to private or on-premises clouds if needed for security or compliance.
Address cybersecurity concerns that come up around generative AI.

Business leaders should focus on what outcomes they want around generative AI.
“Leaders must understand what they are trying to achieve through AI before they can create the foundation necessary to put the pieces together and drive those outputs,” said Badlaney.

“Technology leaders need to have a clear view of current compute capacity levels, and data storage and processing requirements,” Badlaney said. “This will allow them to better create a holistic strategy that aligns with security, compliance and performance needs.”
Similarities between hybrid cloud adoption trends and generative AI adoption trends
The rise of hybrid cloud and the rise of generative AI are similar in that they face the same difficulties, the IBM Institute for Business Value and The Harris Poll said. Of the cloud leaders surveyed, 45% said cybersecurity or privacy and confidentiality were concerns when adopting generative AI.
Sustainability is a must-have in enterprise tech
Sustainable computing is no longer just nice to have, Badlaney said – it’s becoming a “must-have” for enterprise customers.
In its study of cloud considerations, the IBM Institute for Business Value and The Harris Poll found organizations are challenged to improve sustainability while processing large amounts of data such as generative AI workloads. Of the global cloud leaders surveyed, 42% said they use the cloud to help deploy, track and manage sustainability goals internally; of those, 36% say cloud will have the largest impact on their sustainability strategy compared to other technologies. Many global cloud leaders (86%) surveyed think open innovation between business partners is the biggest driver of sustainable initiatives.
Hybrid cloud can fit into sustainability initiatives, particularly if renewable electricity is used along the supply chain. In an ideal world, cloud computing would allow for physically aggregated hardware and more efficient operation.
Cloud skills remain a concern
Finding people with the right cloud skills can be a challenge, 58% of global decision makers said. Of the organizations surveyed, 72% have created new positions to meet the need for cloud skills. Highly-regulated industries such as banking and financial markets (79%), chemicals and petroleum (79%) and transportation and travel (81%) are even more likely to create new positions to fill the need for cloud skills. Upskilling can help employees use transformational technologies, including hybrid cloud and generative AI, more effectively.

Microsoft is integrating Copilot generative AI capabilities into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service and other Dynamics 365 applications.
The Copilot capabilities, unveiled at the vendor's annual Ignite conference this week, are intended to provide field service professionals and frontline workers with quicker access to information they need to perform their work or complete job orders, according to the company.







Frontline workers can struggle to find the information they need to perform their day-to-day jobs, according to Microsoft, listing it as a top five disruptive issue in its most recent Work Trend Index annual report.
Copilot functionality in D365 Field Service will be available as a public preview in December, with general availability to come later. Frontline workers such as operators or service technicians can ask questions in plain English via the Copilot interface in Teams and then receive information back from the D365 Field Service application, such as job status updates, parts information and job instructions.
Microsoft also unveiled Copilot in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides this week, which brings mixed reality and generative AI to manufacturing operations. Field service technicians and operators can query Copilot Guides in plain English, and the AI will surface relevant information based on a curated set of documentation, according to the company.
The information is aimed at helping technicians with tasks such as troubleshooting and can provide step-by-step instructions to complete work. Guides is also integrated with HoloLens 2 mixed reality, which provides holographic overlays to guide how tasks should be completed.
Copilot in Dynamics 365 Guides is currently in private preview on HoloLens 2.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides will integrate Copilot generative AI with HoloLens 2.






Generative AI in field service makes sense
Generative AI makes sense as a field service capability, said Aly Pinder, research vice president at IDC, because it's an area that has struggled with trends such as a retiring workforce and the increasing use of third-party contractors for service work.
""Generative AI tools like Copilot can help that expertise evolve quickly, despite lack of tenure or time spent with an organization or on machine,"" Pinder said. ""This is an opportunity that could be a differentiator for the market.""
For example, field service management has suffered from a lack of skilled technicians, and companies have had to rely on contractors and gig workers, he said. Having an on-demand set of intelligence that technicians can generate via AI when they are working on equipment that they have not seen before can be valuable to enterprises.



In the frontline at the field technician level, you need to have knowledge at [your] fingertips, on demand and personalized for the asset you're fixing or for who you are and your skill base.

""In the frontline at the field technician level, you need to have knowledge at [your] fingertips on demand and personalized for the asset you're fixing or for who you are and your skill base,"" Pinder said.
Microsoft's challenge with the addition of Copilot into D365 Field Service will be making it stand out in a field where a number of vendors are introducing generative AI capabilities for specific service applications, he said. However, Microsoft has an advantage because of the application suite that it already supports and the integrated nature of the D365 platform.
""Microsoft should be able to position these capabilities in a broader lens by solving user challenges across the data flow of the organization, as opposed to just solving an individual use case,"" Pinder said.
The Copilot capabilities should make the Field Service functionality more attractive for D365 customers because it will be embedded, he said.
""It will only accelerate adoption if it's embedded and a user who's already a customer just sees it fit into their already installed use case within their Microsoft environment,"" Pinder said.
The Copilot generative AI capabilities in D365 Field Service doesn't look all that different from what other vendors are now including, said Predrag Jakovljevic, an analyst at Technology Evaluation Centers. For example, Salesforce is adding generative AI assistants into all of its applications.
However, field service management presents a good generative AI use case, as do applications like sales and customer support, he said.
""Generative AI is especially useful for field technicians to produce the reports when the work is done or before going to work, when you can query the [large language models] via natural language prompts to give you the customer history or that device's repair history,"" Jakovljevic said. ""In sales, it is about generating introductory emails, meeting notes or checking the prospect's past interactions, and so on.""
In field service, generative AI can also help create documentation for future repairs, he added.
Most enterprise applications that have field service functionality such as D365 and those from IFS and Salesforce are now including generative AI, but Jakovljevic agreed that Microsoft could have an advantage because of its technology ubiquity.
""However, they will all reach parity soon if not already,"" he said.

While the public’s attention has been captured by AI chatbots, a quiet revolution has been brewing in the sciences. One of the most promising fields AI is impacting is biology—long dominated by the tradition of the “wet lab,” which favors pure experimental data over computer simulation. Deep learning is changing that. It enables computers to understand complex patterns in data and generate ideas based on those patterns, and that’s making AI more and more central to experimental biology. There is no field more complex in its patterns than biology, so AI is the perfect tool for understanding it. And—as a host of new companies are showing—engineering it.

Oddly enough, even the success of large-language models, or LLMs, like ChatGPT could be seen as evidence of AI’s ability to understand biological complexity. After all, language is a product of a particular biology—ours. The text on which ChatGPT is trained is just one of many complex forms of data produced by biological systems. In nature, this complexity reaches up from the smallest working parts—our proteins, our DNA—but also extends up through cells, organs, to physiology, disease, and behavior. 
AI, with the right data, can span all of these scales and make sense of the data we collect on all of them. It’s poised to accelerate basic science, the business of biotechs, the behemoth pharmaceutical companies, and the broader bioeconomy.
A 2020 paper from San Francisco-based industry leader OpenAI investigated what factors had the biggest impact on LLM performance. Three variables determined how well they learned: 

Compute—the number of CPU cycles spent training a model. 
Parameters—the number of learnable features in a model.
Dataset—the number of examples used in training the AI model.

The amount of “compute,” or the computing resources required, and the number of parameters can be dialed up by computer scientists as needed. But the same is not true of datasets. AI for biology can’t draw on gobs of pre-existing data like the creators of ChatGPT did by scraping the internet for everything it contained. While there is useful biological data in public research databases, it’s not enough. AI can only craft solutions to problems similar to what it has seen, and in biology, there is still a lot we don’t know.

In the new AI-driven era, research efforts must be purposefully organized to generate the right data for AI models.

AlphaFold, the breakthrough protein structure prediction program from Google’s DeepMind, was trained using existing public databases like the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a massive collection of basic structural data on the molecules of life. But it only learned what the PDB contained, which tends toward smaller, soluble proteins that fold into a compact, globular shape. AlphaFold doesn’t do well predicting the structure of a number of important classes of protein. For example, it has difficulty figuring out protein-protein interactions (an important consideration for designing drugs). Nor is it necessarily adept at snapshotting how a single protein can change shape (which can be critical for function). And the structures of proteins which span cell membranes are more difficult to predict because relatively few have actually been solved. These important problems won’t go away without new data.
While databases like PDB have come about as post hoc efforts to organize data produced by academics pursuing their disparate biological interests, in the new AI-driven era, research efforts must be purposefully organized to generate the right data for AI models. While some of these efforts will take the form of large-scale public research projects, akin to the Human Genome Project, others will be small and focused, carried out on proprietary data inside companies. Still others, like the Human Immunome Project, which seeks to use machine learning to build models of the human immune system, could take another form, like a public-private partnership.
(Editor’s note: The author’s partner Linda Avey has recently joined the board of the Human Immunome Project. Proto.life founder Jane Metcalfe is the chair of HIP’s board.)
AI models driving wet lab experiments is a trend we’re going to see more of in the coming years. It will be quite different from the kind of generalist AI models inside ChatGPT and Midjourney. Those projects are built from large corpuses of publicly accessible data, are general purpose, and are expensive to train. The marrying together of wet lab techniques with AI—“wet AI”—is the opposite of “dry” AI models like ChatGPT in many ways. They will be small (not large), special purpose (not general), built from specially created proprietary datasets, (rather than pre-existing public ones), and many will be trivially cheap to train—not costing between $30 million and $100 million like many LLMs. Although they will be small and private, they are on track to have enormous impact. 
Wet AI gives companies a proprietary advantage compared to LLM and image generation AI companies. The latter are built on public data, and that means others can copy them. For example, Facebook released LLaMA, an open source model that exceeds the latest version of ChatGPT on most non-coding or math reasoning prompts, and open source developers and academics have seized on it, building new and better versions. And other companies like San Francisco-based Anthropic have entered the market with their own proprietary LLMs. This dynamic causes investors to worry that these high-flying companies may collapse under their own weight as competitors and new methods drive down profits. The wet AI approach relies on a different business model built on highly proprietary technologies that produce billion-dollar products protected by patents.

AI Versus Antibiotic Resistance
AI can help overcome both scientific and financial hurdles to tackle this serious threat to global health.







Along came the biologists…
Computer scientists were among the first to recognize AI’s application to biological problems. In 2008, Abe Heifets, the founder of Atomwise, was a computer science graduate student with an office across the hall from the godfather of modern AI, Geoffrey Hinton. His work wasn’t initially focused on AI, but he saw that something interesting was going on across the hall, and he had the early insight that by representing proteins as images of atomic structures, he could use image processing AI—convolutional networks—to discover drugs that fit in the active sites of proteins. 
Daphne Koller, the first AI hire in Stanford’s computer science department, took an early interest in biology and was one of the first scientific advisors to 23andMe. From the beginning, she reasoned that AI could sort high-throughput data and human genetics to find and prioritize targets. She focused these efforts in Insitro, one of the earliest AI-driven biotech companies.
Computer scientists paved the way, democratizing the tools and methods for a new wave of engineers and scientists. Chemists and biologists realized that AI could augment their work. For example, a common technique for discovering drugs is to screen libraries of compounds for desirable properties—binding to the right target, how they interact with tissues and get into cells, their stability, or their distribution in the body. While screening has been a workhorse method for scientists, it’s limited by the cost of producing compounds and doing experiments. By training generative AI on screening data, scientists can explore orders of magnitude more chemical structures, finding compounds with improved properties.
A clever combination of science and AI
One company taking this approach is Unnatural Products (UNP)—which in full disclosure is a company I have invested in. UNP was started by graduate students out of the lab of Scott Lokey, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Lokey focused on a special class of natural compounds—peptide macrocycles. These are short proteins that have been “cyclized,” or turned into a ring. That ring structure gives them special properties, locking the peptide into a semi-rigid structure that forms more stable bonds with its binding target. The ring is also more resistant to degradation than linear peptides but leaves enough flexibility to allow shape changes that give macrocycles a peculiar knack for slipping into cells, where they can bind to important targets. Nature has harnessed these structures because of their drug-like properties.
Cyclosporine is one example. It’s a well-known drug given to people with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and organ transplants. Produced by the fungus Trichoderma polysporum, it binds to proteins that mediate the immune response. Cyclosporine seems to be used by the fungus to help it infect insects, but doctors now use its immunosuppressive functions to prevent tissue rejection in organ transplant patients.

Scott Lokey of University of California, Santa Cruz. Lokey Lab
Cyclosporine is one of about 100 or so pharmacologically useful macrocyclic compounds. Almost all of them are from natural sources. Despite the success of cyclosporine, drug developers avoided macrocycles because they were perceived to be too complex to engineer. This perspective was reinforced by Pfizer’s top chemist, Christopher Lipinski, in his famous “Rule of 5,” which says that an orally available drug must not have more than one violation of several criteria Lipinski determined after reviewing the company’s successes and failures. Any time Pfizer’s scientists tried to build compounds which were larger than a certain size, or had too many hydrogen bonds, they failed, largely due to the inability of those molecules to get into cells where they could act. These rules all but exclude macrocycles as useful drug candidates because they are guaranteed to violate Lipinski’s first and third criteria.
Yet Lokey was undeterred and convinced that there must be a way to engineer what nature had shown us. Some of his colleagues thought he was plotting a risky course outside of the mainstream, but he doggedly pursued this vision over decades, continuing to hack away at the problem, and developing the technology for building large libraries of these compounds, a critical step in the drug discovery process.
Two of Lokey’s graduate students, Cameron Pye and Josh Schwochert, were instrumental in developing clever parallel synthesis and screening techniques. But even with these advances, screening only accesses a small part of the chemical space. They realized that by training AI on the data from their screening experiments, they could search a much larger space of molecules. 
Macrocycles are peptides, short chains of about 8–20 amino acids. Although there are only 20 different types of natural amino acids, bioengineered macrocycles can include “unnatural” ones —hence the name of their company (Unnatural Products)—which can push that number to hundreds of thousands. This represents a huge set of possible compounds. For example, a library of macrocycles each 10 amino acids long, where each position is one of 100,000 unnatural amino acids would contain 100,00010, or 1050, different molecules. That is around the number of atoms that constitute the entire globe we call Earth.
Synthesizing just one copy of each molecule in such a library would require a mass the size of Jupiter. So screening is only feasible for a tiny fraction of this number—billions of compounds rather than more than a billion billion billion billion billion of them. AI can discover patterns in screening data that enable it to suggest an ideal drug candidate that had never actually been synthesized or screened. As a result, Unnatural Products has been able to create compounds that both bind very tightly (i.e., with “picomolar” dissociation constants) and remarkably, get through cell membranes, breaking Lipinski’s famous rule.

Wet AI uses experiments to get you to the ballpark and AI to get you to the seat in the stadium.

Macrocycles combine the best properties of large and small molecules. Over the last 20 years, antibodies have become popular in drug development. They are very specific, but must be injected and can’t access the inside of cells. Toxicity sometimes results because their mechanism of action is indirect—antibody makers target molecules on the outside of the cell which they hope will influence the key molecule inside the cell. But this indirect strategy sometimes doesn’t work and can trigger unwanted side effects.  On the other hand, small molecules, which can be taken in pill form, obey Lipinski’s rules and can get inside cells but they’re unspecific, so they often require higher doses and can produce toxicity because of “off-target” effects. Macrocyclic peptides are a kind of Goldilocks drug: neither too big nor too tiny but rather just the right size for drug development—large enough to bind very specifically but small enough to sneak inside cells.  
This application of wet AI uses experiments to get you to the ballpark and AI to get you to the seat in the stadium. It’s a remarkable combination of scientific ingenuity and computer science knowhow that enables a fundamentally new ball game. A large team of medicinal chemists at Merck spent 10 years designing one macrocyclic peptide—a feat so impressive it was nominated by their peers as “molecule of the year” in 2021. Techniques like the one Unnatural Products is pioneering are finding thousands of such molecules with better properties in less than a third of the time, with a much smaller team. It’s a taste of things to come.
Although the numbers seem large, wet AI models like this will be tiny and relatively inexpensive to build compared to models like ChatGPT. A typical model is a thousand times smaller, only ~50Mb versus 570Gb for ChatGPT. But there is obviously huge value in these small models.
While this kind of model is built on a one-off basis for each protein, more general foundation models could give insights into basic properties of a company’s technology.  For example, by collecting tissue distribution data for a drug library, an AI model could be trained to generate drug candidates which also target the right cells. This will be more costly than the kind of screens UNP is currently doing, but it could pay off in spades. Failure of a drug to get to the right tissue is a common cause of failure to get through the FDA review process. 
Wet AI is also going to drive investment in general use foundation models. AlphaFold was trained on public data culled from years of work by labs pursuing disparate biological problems, but there are gaps that will be most efficiently closed by focused public efforts. Mark Murcko, the former CTO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is promoting the concept of prizes to convince labs to focus on structures of key proteins that affect toxicity, what he calls the “avoidome.” These are proteins that drug developers don’t want their molecules to interact with. Many of these are proteins that span cell membranes and represent difficult targets for structural biologists, but they are not impossible. Methods like cryo-EM combined with other experimental techniques can get us there. Wet AI could drive public efforts akin to the Human Genome Project, which published the first final reference genome of our species 20 years ago, or the NIH’s All of Us project, which aims to collect genomic data and other health information from a million people. In the coming era, scientists will drive large-scale public data collection efforts to serve the needs of AI models. 
Wet AI isn’t just about drug discovery. It also has a critical role to play in health and the emerging synthetic biology-driven bioeconomy. The most exciting aspect of wet AI, however, is that it promises to turn the molecular world into a programmable medium. That could have far reaching impacts, giving us the ability to imagine new categories of products based on engineered biology. I’ll cover these topics in future posts.

Over the past few months, the company has been rolling out various AI initiatives, ranging from integrating the technology into customer reviews to offering services enabling developers to construct their own AI tools on its AWS cloud infrastructure.In September, Amazon introduced a new version of Alexa, incorporating additional generative AI features. The layoffs disclosed on Friday will affect staff in the United States, Canada, and India.This comes after recent job reductions in Amazon’s gaming and music divisions, contributing to the 27,000 employees the company let go in the latter part of last year and earlier this year. The Alexa unit at Amazon was also affected by those earlier layoffs.The cuts to Amazon Music began in October, when the division eliminated communications roles, and are distinct from the earlier layoffs, according to another person familiar with the matter.The reductions in Amazon’s music division signaled an increasing shift of focus to another streaming platform: Prime Video. “We also have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business in its own right as we continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for Prime members,” Jassy said last month during Amazon’s third-quarter earnings call.(With inputs from AP)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the age of AI, remember to think like a human

A UNLV professor considers the present — and possible futures — of artificial intelligence

Don't miss the big stories. Like us on Facebook.



When Chat GPT-4, the artificial intelligence language-learning model, entered the American consciousness last spring, the internet quickly went on Armageddon watch. To believe the doomsayers, we were witnessing nothing less than a baby Skynet — the evil computer network from the Terminator films — take its first breath.
You know the story. The machines humans make become more powerful, are entrusted with more responsibility and then reach a moment of sentience where they look around, self-aware, and decide human beings are:
A) Idiots. B) Evil. C) Expendable.
… And, more or less, nuke the lot of us.
So what are we really dealing with here? The developer, Open AI, says that Chat GPT-4 — the latest in a series of language-learning models (LLMs) the organization has developed since 2018 —“can generate, edit, and iterate with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a user’s writing style.” The LLM can handle 25,000 words of text, “allowing for use cases like long form content creation, extended conversations, and document search and analysis.”
Already, Chat GPT-4 can score a 163 on the LSAT, good enough to probably get into Top 20 law schools such as Georgetown, Vanderbilt and the University of Southern California.
In practice, this AI can help you write a report or paper, draft an email and summarize articles or other research. It can sort of do your work for you. It can also analyze and create images.
Of course, there’s a leap from the language-learning model of Chat GPT-4 to real, creative human intelligence. The dream (or nightmare) of Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, in which machines can, as Open AI puts it, “outperform humans at most economically valuable work” is still on the horizon.
But the horizon may get here sooner than we wish. Last year, a Google engineer claimed that company’s AI chatbot, LaMDa, was already sentient. (The company denied this; the engineer was later fired.) Earlier this year, an organization called the Future of Life Institute released a much-reported-upon open letter signed by such prominent figures as Elon Musk, Andrew Yang and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The letter, which as of mid-August had 33,000 signatures, called for a six-month moratorium on training AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. “Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth?” the letter asked. “Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization?”
In an op-ed for Time magazine, Eliezer Yudkowsky, at the Berkeley, California-based Machine Intelligence Research Institute, argued the six-month moratorium was not bold enough. Only a complete shutdown will do. “Many researchers steeped in these issues, including myself, expect that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI, under anything remotely like the current circumstances, is that literally everyone on Earth will die.”
We seem unlikely to consider these warnings. There’s too much at stake. Too much money to be made. Too many nations vying for power — economic, political, military.
Maybe it won’t end as Yudkowsky predicts. I’d draw your attention to another trope in science fiction: the inverse relationship between human behavior and machine behavior. As machines act more human, the humans around them act more like machines. This is part of the central thrust of 2001: A Space Odyssey, where clever, personable HAL interacts with a pair of monotonous, blank astronauts onboard a spaceship headed to Jupiter, while the rest of the crew exists in cryo-sleep like frozen meat. It’s only when the computer suffers a nervous breakdown and threatens the mission that the astronauts rouse themselves to creative action — and thus to human dignity.
Here, the machines don’t aspire to be more than human, some coldly calculating thing beyond empathy or love. They just want to be us. Best-case scenario? You wind up with Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation. He’s pretty cool; he actually reminds humans what’s special about being human.
Then again, HAL does go crazy and kills most of the crew.
According to a survey of 1,000 college students from Best Colleges, 43 percent have used ChatGPT or a similar AI application — and of those, half have used AI tools to complete schoolwork. Yet 57 percent “do not intend to use or continue using AI to complete their homework.”
I teach in the journalism program at UNLV. Along with the rest of the university, we are discussing how to handle AI in our classrooms. After the Terminator scenario, one of the next things people worry about is students simply phoning in their work. I joke with colleagues that we may soon see a world where artificial intelligence writes student papers — and artificial intelligence grades student papers.
But. Unexpectedly, my colleagues tell me that their students are reticent about using AI. As for its potential to corrupt, the students I’ve known over the years are mostly hardworking and conscientious. They want to learn, they want to improve, and they take pride in doing the work well. Is there a place for AI to aid them in these goals?
I asked a knowledge management program I use, Notion, which is running GPT-3, to tell me whether AI should be used to help students complete assignments.
Here’s what it told me:
“AI can help students to work more efficiently and effectively. It can provide personalized feedback and suggestions for improvement, and can also help to identify areas where students may be struggling. Additionally, AI can help to level the playing field for students who may not have access to traditional resources or who may have learning disabilities that make it difficult to complete assignments on their own.
“On the other hand … some worry that it may lead to a reduction in critical thinking skills or an over-reliance on technology. There may also be concerns about the accuracy and fairness of AI grading systems, particularly when it comes to subjective assignments such as essays.
“While it can certainly be a useful tool, it is not a replacement for human teachers or the critical thinking skills that are essential for success in any field.”
A perfectly reasonable, anodyne answer. If nothing else, Chat GPT-4 could enjoy a long career in politics. Good teachers likely would spot the “down the middle” blandness of this response — especially one with perfect grammar — and question the source. And yet, we already turn to prototype AI software to aid us. What teacher would take any student seriously who didn’t check their work with their word processor’s spelling and grammar check, which does a lot of the tedious work of copy editing and proofreading for them? For that matter, what editor or manager in any setting would respect their employee for submitting work without these checks?
I send interview notes off to a service that transcribes them for me, by computer, sparing me the indignity of line by line, four-finger typing transcription. That’s me trying to be a robot, you see, and the computer saying, “Nah, bruh, I got this …”
In the end, wherever we’re headed, AI is about work. Whether we’re talking schoolwork or on-the-job work, AI is just the latest automation technology that challenges us to think about what work means to us. Do we dream of a future when work has been made obsolete, or one when it’s been made more fulfilling?
LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman co-wrote a book with Chat GPT4, Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI, in which he noted the following: “Much of what we do as modern people — at work and beyond — is to process information and generate action. GPT-4 will massively speed your ability to do these things, and with greater breadth and scope. Within a few years, this copilot will fall somewhere between useful and essential to most professionals and many other sorts of workers.”
Processing information sounds sexy, but really that translates to the tedious, encroaching actions of the Digital Knowledge Economy that we all know so well: manipulating spreadsheets, sharing Google Docs, emails and PowerPoints, computer files, navigating tech support and a billion passwords.
The promise of AI is that it can save us from a world full of useless jobs and tasks, what the late anthropologist David Graeber referred to as bullshit jobs: “It’s as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs just for the sake of keeping us all working.”
It’s not so much whether you have a bullshit job or not … it’s that all of our jobs have some element of BS built in. Paperwork and procedures. It’s unavoidable, the normal, hungry maw of bureaucracy.
Can Chat GPT-4 — or -5, -6, etc. — take this off our plates, so that we might arrive on some sun-washed shore where work becomes more creative, more rewarding, less alienating? A world where AI isn’t used to fake a paper no one wants to write but to aid a student in deep, rigorous thinking? A world where work feels a little less like work and a little more like an enterprise that we have a real stake in, one that, moment by moment, day by day, is novel, challenging, valuable and draws out our best?
If we devise work that makes us feel like human beings, maybe there’s a way forward. If we devise work that makes us feel like machines, better machines are on the way. ◆

Crabill sent it to his boss for review and filed it with the Colorado court.“I was over the moon excited for just the headache that it saved me,” he told The Washington Post. But his relief was short-lived. While surveying the brief, he realized to his horror that the AI chatbot had made up several fake lawsuit citations.Crabill, 29, apologized to the judge, explaining that he’d used an AI chatbot. The judge reported him to a statewide office that handles attorney complaints, Crabill said. In July, he was fired from his Colorado Springs law firm. Looking back, Crabill wouldn’t use ChatGPT, but says it can be hard to resist for an overwhelmed rookie attorney.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“This is all so new to me,” he said. “I just had no idea what to do and no idea who to turn to.”💻Follow TechnologyFollowBusiness analysts and entrepreneurs have long predicted that the legal profession would be disrupted by automation.

Here’s what to know.SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Stressed-out lawyers are turning to chatbots to write tedious briefs. Law firms are using AI language tools to sift through thousands of case documents, replacing the work of associates and paralegals. AI legal assistants are helping lawyers analyze documents, memos and contracts in minutes.The AI legal software market could grow from $1.3 billion in 2022 to upward of $8.7 billion by 2030, according to an industry analysis by the market research firm Global Industry Analysts. A report by Goldman Sachs in April estimated that 44 percent of legal jobs could be automated away, more than any other sector except for administrative work.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut these money-saving tools can come at a cost. Some AI chatbots are prone to fabricating facts, causing lawyers to be fired or fined, or to have cases thrown out. Legal professionals are racing to create guidelines for the technology’s use, to prevent inaccuracies from bungling major cases. In August, the American Bar Association launched a year-long task force to study the impacts of AI on law practice.“It’s revolutionary,” said John Villasenor, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s center for technological innovation. “But it’s not magic.”AI tools that quickly read and analyze documents allow law firms to offer cheaper services and lighten the workload of attorneys, Villasenor said. But this boon can also be an ethical minefield when it results in high-profile errors.Story continues below advertisementIn the spring, Lydia Nicholson, a Los Angeles housing attorney, received a legal brief relating to their client’s eviction case. But something seemed off. The document cited lawsuits that didn’t ring a bell. Nicholson, who uses they/them pronouns, did some digging and realized many were fake.AdvertisementThey discussed it with colleagues and “people suggested, ‘Oh, that seems like something that AI could have done,’” Nicholson said in an interview.Nicholson filed a motion against the Dennis Block law firm, a prominent eviction firm in California, pointing out the errors. A judge agreed after an independent inquiry and issued the group a $999 penalty. The firm blamed a young, newly hired lawyer at its office for using “online research” to write the motion and said she had resigned shortly after the complaint was made. Several AI experts analyzed the briefing and proclaimed it “likely” generated by AI, according to the media site LAist.Story continues below advertisementThe Dennis Block firm did not return a request for comment.It’s not surprising that AI chatbots invent legal citations when asked to write a brief, said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a computer scientist and the director of the Center for Technology Responsibility at Brown University.Advertisement“What’s surprising is that they ever produce anything remotely accurate,” he said. “That’s not what they’re built to do.”Rather, chatbots like ChatGPT are designed to make conversation, having been trained on vast amounts of published text to compose plausible-sounding responses to just about any prompt. So when you ask ChatGPT for a legal brief, it knows that legal briefs include citations — but it hasn’t actually read the relevant case law, so it makes up names and dates that seem realistic.Story continues below advertisementJudges are struggling with how to deal with these errors. Some are banning the use of AI in their courtroom. Others are asking lawyers to sign pledges to disclose if they have used AI in their work. The Florida Bar is weighing a proposal to require attorneys to have a client’s permission to use AI.One point of discussion among judges is whether honor codes requiring attorneys to swear to the accuracy of their work apply to generative AI, said John G. Browning, a former Texas district court judge.Browning, who chairs the State Bar of Texas’s task force on AI, said his group is weighing a handful of approaches to regulate use, such as requiring attorneys to take professional education courses in technology or considering specific rules for when evidence generated by AI can be included.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementLucy Thomson, a D.C.-area attorney and cybersecurity engineer who is chairing the American Bar Association’s AI task force, said the goal is to educate lawyers about both the risks and potential benefits of AI. The bar association has not yet taken a formal position on whether AI should be banned from courtrooms, she added, but its members are actively discussing the question.“Many of them think it’s not necessary or appropriate for judges to ban the use of AI,” Thomson said, “because it’s just a tool, just like other legal research tools.”In the meantime, AI is increasingly being used for “e-discovery”— the search for evidence in digital communications, such as emails, chats or online workplace tools.Story continues below advertisementWhile previous generations of technology allowed people to search for specific keywords and synonyms across documents, today’s AI models have the potential to make more sophisticated inferences, said Irina Matveeva, chief of data science and AI at Reveal, a Chicago-based legal technology company. For instance, generative AI tools might have allowed a lawyer on the Enron case to ask, “Did anyone have concerns about valuation at Enron?” and get a response based on the model’s analysis of the documents.AdvertisementWendell Jisa, Reveal’s CEO, added that he believes AI tools in the coming years will “bring true automation to the practice of law — eliminating the need for that human interaction of the day-to-day attorneys clicking through emails.”Jason Rooks, the chief information officer for a Missouri school district, said he began to be overwhelmed during the coronavirus pandemic with requests for electronic records from parents litigating custody battles or organizations suing schools over their covid-19 policies. At one point, he estimates, he was spending close to 40 hours a week just sifting through emails.Story continues below advertisementInstead, he hit on an e-discovery tool called Logikcull, which says it uses AI to help sift through documents and predict which ones are most likely to be relevant to a given case. Rooks could then manually review that smaller subset of documents, which cut the time he spent on each case by more than half. (Reveal acquired Logikcull in August, creating a legal tech company valued at more than $1 billion.)AdvertisementBut even using AI for legal grunt work such as e-discovery comes with risks, said Venkatasubramanian, the Brown professor: “If they’ve been subpoenaed and they produce some documents and not others because of a ChatGPT error — I’m not a lawyer, but that could be a problem.”Those warnings won’t stop people like Crabill, whose misadventures with ChatGPT were first reported by the Colorado radio station KRDO. After he submitted the error-laden motion, the case was thrown out for unrelated reasons.He says he still believes AI is the future of law. Now, he has his own company and says he’s likely to use AI tools designed specifically for lawyers to aid in his writing and research, instead of ChatGPT. He said he doesn’t want to be left behind.“There’s no point in being a naysayer,” Crabill said, “or being against something that is invariably going to become the way of the future.”Share207 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

What is Artificial Intelligence and Its Importance in Today’s World?
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of an algorithm or digital computer system to carry out tasks that would generally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, natural language processing, decision-making, and more. AI technology has advanced significantly in recent decades, enabling machines to think more like humans.
Businesses harness AI for numerous purposes, like automating activities, increasing output, and optimizing decisions through data analysis.

Employment-Based Immigration to Get an Important Update with Biden’s Artificial Intelligence Executive Order

Posted by American Immigration Council Staff | Nov 17, 2023 | Business & the Workforce, Employment Based, High Skilled



 


Written by Steven Hubbard, Senior Data Scientist and Leslie Dellon, Senior Attorney (Business Immigration)
The White House’s recent executive order on artificial intelligence marks an important shift in employment-based immigration law, signaling the beginning of a potentially transformative process.
As one component of the process, President Biden has required the Department of Labor (DOL) to issue a request for information (RFI) by December 13 to consider updates to the Schedule A list of occupations. The RFI is to request input in “identifying AI and other STEM-related occupations.” This is a major step that invites public and expert engagement to shed light on the nuances of updating the list—a provision that has remained unchanged since 1991.
The modernization of the Schedule A list could be instrumental in addressing the urgent employment gaps the United States currently faces.
Understanding Schedule A
Schedule A is an important component of the employment-based immigration process in the United States. Established in the 1960s, it was designed to help the country attract foreign talent to fill labor shortages in various high-demand occupations and industries. When an occupation is listed on Schedule A, the Secretary of Labor has already established the need for workers, so certain time-consuming steps in the labor certification process are eliminated. An employer includes the labor certification application with its petition to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to sponsor the foreign worker.
The existing Schedule A list in Group I comprises just two occupation groups—physical therapists and professional nurses. Schedule A also has a Group II for certain workers in the sciences or arts.
However, the Schedule A list has not seen significant updates since 1991, rendering it outdated and disconnected from the current labor market realities. In today’s rapidly evolving job landscape and the added impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a pressing need to reevaluate and update this list.
Updating the Schedule A List of Occupations
To navigate these challenges effectively, DOL should adopt a data-driven approach to updating the Schedule A list rather than creating a static list of which occupations currently are experiencing shortages. This means leveraging comprehensive labor market analytics to ensure the list accurately reflects the occupations where shortages are most acute. By analyzing trends in unemployment rates, employment growth, wage patterns, and job vacancy rates, the DOL can pinpoint sectors that are experiencing critical shortages and require intervention.
Countries like the United Kingdom and New Zealand have successfully employed such strategies. These nations adjust their shortage occupation lists regularly, considering extensive labor market research and input from key stakeholders. This dynamic approach allows for a responsive immigration system that adapts to the changing economic landscape and skill demands.
Modernization of Schedule A extends beyond the immediate benefits of filling job vacancies. It signifies a commitment to maintaining the United States’ status as a hub for innovation and progress. By attracting international talent in high-demand fields like STEM and healthcare, the U.S. can ensure that it has the skilled workforce necessary to drive forward advancements in these critical areas.
A data-driven update to Schedule A could also inform broader economic strategies, including the development of targeted workforce training programs and industry-education partnerships. Such strategic planning could facilitate the upskilling of the domestic workforce to meet future demand, thus complementing the contributions of international talent.
The White House’s AI executive order marks a pivotal moment in employment-based immigration, with the potential to reshape the labor certification process. Updating Schedule A through data-driven updates aligns with current economic conditions and offers predictability and flexibility to the employment-based immigration system. This step can help the United States address critical workforce gaps, stimulate economic growth, and remain competitive on a global scale. It’s a win-win for both international talent and U.S. workers alike.
However, unless Congress also modernizes the employment-based immigrant visa categories, with their annual limits creating lengthy wait times before many foreign workers can become U.S. lawful permanent residents, these workers may still seek opportunities in other countries.
