Artificial intelligence has made its way to literature



 







Machines started by offering us recommendations on what to read, and now they’re capable of writing poetry, stories and even screenplays. Computers have gone from tools to help human creators to becoming creative entities themselves, explains Ramón López de Mántaras in the book “The Next Step: Exponential Life”, which can be downloaded at no charge on BBVA OpenMind’s website.

A recent survey conducted by the Future of Life Institute’s AI Impacts project predicts that artificial intelligence will be capable of writing a best seller by 2050. But there’s no need to wait that long to read literature written by software.
Google has been working with Stanford University and the University of Massachusetts to improve machines’ natural language. To do so, researchers have introduced artificial intelligence to more than 11,000 novels. The first step was for the software to understand the variances of human language. Once this goal was achieved, they gave it two sentences – a starting sentence and a closing sentence – from which the machine wrote several poems, as they explain in their report.
A robot’s creation reaches bookstores 
The Chinese publishing company Cheers Publishing has gone a step farther, offering the collection of poetry “Sunshine Misses Windows”, signed by the previously unknown author Microsoft Little Ice, for sale in bookstores. This algorithm created by the computer giant memorized more than 500 sonnets, from which it created 10,000 poems. Of these, 139 were published. Some of the poems have been shared on social networks under different pseudonyms. Very few Internet users were able to identify the nature of the author of poems such as the one below:
“The rain is blowing through the sea
A bird in the sky
A night of light and calm
Sunlight
Now in the sky
Cool heart
The savage north wind
When I found a new world…”
WASP is an artificial intelligence software that was created by Pablos Gervás, who holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Complutense University of Madrid.  This researcher has spent 17 years perfecting his robot poet. WASP has learned to write, inspired by sonnets from Spain’s Golden Age. His creator says that the purpose of his research is to understand the structure of poetry and study the creative process, to make writers’ work easier. They are not trying to replace poets, as their writing lacks emotion.
Robots’ rap 
Poetry is not the only field where artificial intelligence dominates. Several researchers from Aalto University in Finland have created DeepBeat, software that is capable of writing rap lyrics. This program uses machine learning techniques to create lyrics to songs by combining lines from other songs that already exist, as well as different types of beats. On the project’s website, users can suggest a word or beat from which to create a song.





















DopeLearning: A Computational Approach to Rap Lyrics Generation





 



In Japan, computers are already participating in literary competitions. The Nikkei Hoshi Shinichi Literary Award allows non-human authors to present their work without the judges knowing the nature of the competitors. Of the 1,450 applications they received in the last edition, 11 were partially written by a machine. One of them, “The Day a Computer Writes a Novel” made it past the first round of the contest.
“I writhed with joy, which I experienced for the first time, and kept writing with excitement. The day a computer wrote a novel. The computer, placing priority on the pursuit of its own joy, stopped working for humans.”
The judges of the competition say that even though they are incredibly well structured, novels of this kind are still really lacking when it comes to describing the psychology of the characters.
A machine screenwriter named Benjamin
Artificial intelligence has already made it to the world of movies, and not just as part of the plot. Scientist Ross Goodwin and his team have created a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which renamed itself Benjamin. The first screenwriting software has already released its first debut film, a short film called Sunspring, directed by the filmmaker Oscar Sharp




















Sunspring, a Sci-Fi Short Film





 



In the words of Sharp, the result of this experiment has been “a combination of the delusions of a madman and a poetic absurdity that is strangely appealing.” Sunspring uses disconnected phrases and its characters answer to the names of H, H2 and C. However, its creators decided to present it at Sci-Fi London, where it was selected as one of the 10 best short films.

Toyota AI Ventures Invests in AI Start-ups
With initial funding of $100 million, Toyota AI Ventures invests in tech start-ups and entrepreneurs around the world that are committed to autonomous mobility, data and robotics. Toyota’s investments help accelerate getting critical new technologies to market. One of the organization’s investments is in May Mobility, a company that is developing self-driving shuttles for college campuses and other areas such as central business districts where low-speed applications are warranted. This is just one of the services that could blaze a trail to fully autonomous vehicles of the future.
Additionally, Silicon-based Toyota AI Ventures contributed funding as well as mentorship, incubation facilities and validation to Nauto, a company that’s creating a shared data platform to prevent accidents caused by distracted driving; SLAMcore, a visual tracking and mapping algorithm developer for smart tech; Intuition Robotics, an organization that creates social companion technologies that are accessible and intuitive for seniors; Boxbot, a company that’s building self-driving delivery robots; and more. Like many disruptors, Toyota AI Ventures seeks out other innovators to tackle important challenges to propel the latest technologies.
PROMOTED
AI Enhancements to Automobiles
Innovation has always been omnipresent at Toyota from its earliest days and it’s clear the company is continuing that innovative tradition. While Toyota was originally a company that produced wooden hand looms, the majority of people know the company for its automobile division. Their aim is to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to make “cars an object of affection again” as soon as 2020 and is investing $1 billion in self-driving cars and AI between now and then to achieve it. Through Toyota’s investments in tech start-ups such as Perceptive Automata it hopes to create the technology to allow autonomous vehicles more human-like intuition when they are on the road more similar to how human drivers interact with pedestrians.
Toyota’s Concept-i fully electric autonomous vehicles demonstrate the company’s “Learn, Protect, Inspire” philosophy. The Concept-i artificial intelligence system, nicknamed “Yui,” learns about its driver by listening to conversations, monitoring social media activity and schedules, and analyzing facial expressions and driving habits to sense when a driver might be sleepy or stressed or what might enhance the driver’s comfort and then adjusts lighting, music or to the seats accordingly. The full vision is “intelligent talking cars” where cars equipped with AI can have conversations back and forth with passengers.
Toyota also announced the Concept-i Ride for users with wheelchairs or other disabilities and the Concept-i Walk, that’s designed for pedestrians to use on sidewalks similar to a Segway. Both additions to the Concept-i product line feature the same sensing abilities as the Concept-i vehicle.

In an effort to bring AI efficiency to ridesharing, Toyota has collaborated with Japan Taxi to test out its new AI-propelled taxi dispatch system. Not only does the company expect to enhance Tokyo’s taxi service, company leaders believe the driving data and real-time video will be instrumental in boosting efficiency and profits.
Toyota and Robotics
As a result of deep learning technologies and the millions of images uploaded to the internet via social media and other websites, machines are getting better at being able to “see” like a human. Toyota’s Human Support Robot (HSR) algorithms help it understand the world and can be life-changing for individuals with impaired mobility. The company also announced a T-HR3 humanoid robot, a third-generation version that uses an immersive “Master Maneuvering System” that mirrors a human user’s movements or can operate autonomously to support humans in a variety of settings.
Toyota is also innovating warehouse logistics with automation and artificial intelligence for lean approaches to material handling. With AI on board every vehicle, the future of logistics is when the right truck or piece of equipment—pallet drone, mid-lifter, ultra-lifer—is used for the right task every time. The company’s innovations aim to minimize energy use, prevent delays and eliminate waste thanks to teamwork between trucks, lifts, loaders and other equipment.

In the past few years, artificial intelligence has advanced so quickly that it now seems that hardly a month goes by without a newsworthy AI breakthrough. In areas as wide-ranging as speech translation, medical diagnosis and game play, we have seen computers outperform humans in startling ways. This has sparked a discussion about what impact AI will have on employment.Related: Artificial Intelligence Is Likely to Make a Career in Finance, Medicine or Law a Lot Less LucrativeSome fear that as AI improves, it will supplant workers in the job force, creating an ever-growing pool of unemployable humans who cannot economically compete with machines in any meaningful way. This concern, while understandable, is unfounded.



AI will be the greatest job engine the world has ever seen.Technology has progressed nonstop for 250 years, and in the U.S. unemployment has stayed within a narrow band of 5 to 10 percent for almost all that time, even when radical new technologies such as steam power and electricity came on the scene.


AI is the most empowering of all technologies because it effectively makes anyone who uses it smarter. It increases the productivity of anyone who can apply it to their job. Once again, you hear the same refrain: ""It will destroy jobs."" And sure, you can look around and find jobs that it might well eliminate, such as order taker at a fast-food restaurant. But, that is not in any way the entire story.No, the whole story involves the other part of the equation. What will this technology enable?Related: AI Won't Replace Us Until It Becomes Much More Like UsConsider the ATM. If you had to point to a technology that looked as though it would replace people, the ATM might look like a good bet. It is, after all, an automated teller machine. And yet, there are more tellers now than when ATMs were widely released. How can this be? Simple: ATMs lowered the cost of opening bank branches, and banks responded by opening more, which required hiring more tellers.


This is one of the fundamental dynamics of technology and employment. As technology lowers costs, people respond by one of two things: They either buy more of the item (as banks did with branches) or they spend their saved money elsewhere, creating new jobs in those areas.In this manner, AI is going to create many millions of jobs that are far beyond my meager ability to imagine. But, examples already abound. For instance, AI is getting really good at language translation. What do you expect that to do to the demand for human translators? According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, it is skyrocketing. Why? If you lower the cost of basic translation to nearly zero, the cost of doing business with those who speak other languages falls. Thus, it emboldens companies to do more business overseas, creating more work for human translators. AI may do the ""simple"" translations, but humans are needed for the nuanced kind.In fact, the BLS forecasts faster-than-average job growth in many occupations that AI is going to have a large impact on: accountants, forensic scientists, geological technicians, technical writers, MRI operators, dietitians, financial specialists, web developers, loan officers, medical secretaries and customer service representatives, to name a very few. These fields will not experience job growth in spite of AI, but through it. These are all areas in which AI can aid humans and increase their productivity and wages.Related: 4 Industries That Are Being Disrupted by AIBut, just as with the internet, the real gains in jobs will come from places where our imaginations cannot yet take us.But, what of the skills gap? Will AI eliminate low-skill jobs and create only high-skill ones? This is far from certain, but let's entertain the idea. If this happens, are all those low-skill workers unemployable? Far from it.The relevant question is whether most people can do a job that's just a little more complicated than the one they currently have. If you agree with me that the answer is yes, then no worries. The whole workforce just shifts up a notch. Everyone, from entry level to PhD, just moves up the job ladder a bit. This is exactly what happened with the industrial revolution: Farmers became factory workers, factory workers became factory managers, and so on.New jobs created at the top are opportunities for everyone to get a promotion.


A January 2018 Accenture report ""Reworking the Revolution"" estimates that new applications of AI combined with human collaboration can boost employment worldwide 10 percent by 2020.Electricity changed the world, as did mechanical power, as did the assembly line. No one can reasonably claim that we would be better off without those technologies. Each of them bettered our lives, created jobs and boosted wages. AI will be bigger than electricity, bigger than mechanization, bigger than anything that has come before it. It, too, will make the world a better place and, yes, create jobs.

Art-market history was made late last month when a work created using a neural network—one type of technology now commonly, if somewhat reductively, classified as an artificial intelligence—sold at Christie’s auction house in New York for $432,500.
The print was made using a form of machine learning called a Generative Adversarial Network, or a GAN (which you can read more about here). The Christie’s sale wasn’t the first time a work using so-called AI has been sold at auction, but it did mark the first time that a major auction house paid attention to the field—and helped drive the price up to nearly half a million dollars. 
The sale has also stirred controversy in the close-knit generative-art community. Many artists working in the field point out that Obvious, the collective behind the AI that made the pricey work, was handsomely rewarded for an idea that was neither very original nor very interesting. The savvy marketers behind the sale seemingly took advantage of the fact that the wider public is not very educated about the sector. Even the Christie’s expert who put the sale together admitted that he first learned about Obvious’s work from an article that appeared on artnet News in April.
As for the other major auction houses, a spokesman for Bonhams, interestingly, told us it is not considering hopping on the algorithmic trend now or in the future. Neither Sotheby’s nor Phillips responded to requests for comment on the matter.
While we wait for the next AI-generated work to hit the block, there’s a lot more to learn. To find out about the interesting work being created with machine learning—and the complex boundaries it’s pushing—we’ve assembled a list of nine pioneering artists to watch.
 
Mario Klingemann

WHO: Klingemann is an artist whose preferred tools, rather than a paintbrush and paints, are neural networks, code, and algorithms. He taught himself how to program in the ’80s, so you could see his algorithms as Outsider AI-artists. (Just kidding!) He’s currently an artist-in-residence at Google Arts and Culture (which brought us that viral art historical face-matching app). He also runs a gallery space in Munich called Dog & Pony, and his works have been shown at the Ars Electronica Festival, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, London’s Photographers Gallery, and the Centre Pompidou, among others.
WHAT: Klingemann works with generative models (i.e. GANs) a lot, which he sees as “creative collaborators.” Recently, he collaborated with one of these neural network partners as well as a more traditional artist, Albert Barqué-Duran, on a project titled My Artificial Muse. The project sought to create a computer-generated “muse” to inspire a painting. For this, Klingemann trained his network on a database of more than 200,000 photographs of human poses until it was able to generate new ones. Then, based on the information it was fed about poses and paintings, the network generated an image, which was scaled up and then painted in mural form during a live performance by Barqué-Duran.
WHY: In exploring machine learning, Klingemann hopes to understand, question, and subvert the inner workings of systems of all kinds. He has a particularly deep interest in human perception and aesthetic theory, subjects he hopes to illuminate through his work creating algorithms that show almost autonomous creative behavior.
 
Anna Ridler
Tulips from Mosaic Virus (2018). Image courtesy the artist.
WHO: Ridler has a more traditional artistic background than some of the others on this list. She has degrees from the Royal College of Art, Oxford University, and University of the Arts London. Although her work essentially uses the same code architecture as Klingemann’s, she generates her own data sets to train her models rather than using existing images. She says this gives her more “creative control” over the end result. Creating bespoke data sets is demanding: it consumes around 60 to 70 percent of the total time it takes her to create a work. She’s shown her work at Ars Electronica, Tate Modern, and the V&A, among other institutions. 
WHAT: Ridler usually uses GANs, as she believes they produce some of the most visually interesting results. For her current project, Mosaic Virus, she’s using something called spectral normalization (a new technique that helps the algorithm generate better-quality images). She created a training set by taking 10,000 photos of tulips over the course of tulip season and categorizing them by hand. Then, she used the software to generate a video showing her tulips blooming—but their appearance was controlled by the fluctuations in the price of bitcoin, with the stripes on the petals reflecting the value of the cryptocurrency. The work draws historical parallels between the “tulip mania” that swept Europe in the 1630s (when prices for tulips with striped petals caused by the mosaic virus soared) and the current speculation on cryptocurrencies. For other works, such as The Fall of the House of Usher, she trained her neural network on her own ink drawings.
WHY: “The most interesting part of working with machine learning is the way that it repeats your idea back to you, but in a way that is looser and wilder and freer than I could ever make by myself,” Ridler tells artnet News. “Looking at the work that I’ve made with AI is always like catching a glimpse of yourself in a mirror before you recognize that it is you—you but also not you.”
 
Robbie Barrat



WHO: Barrat is a 19-year-old artist and coder who currently works in a research lab at Stanford University. He is notable not only for his youth, but also for the humor and originality of his creations. When he was in high school, he created this rapping neural network trained on Kanye West’s entire discography. Back in 2017, he also uploaded the code for a very similar project to the one Obvious just cashed in on at Christie’s for anyone to play around with (which is looking increasingly suspect for Obvious). Another of his models, interestingly, misinterpreted the data set of nude portraits that it was fed, giving too much attention to things like rolls of flesh and bellybuttons to generate a series of trippy, Francis Bacon-esque nudes.
WHAT: For a recent project, Barrat has been working at the intersection of fashion and machine learning. Using Balenciaga’s catalogues as training data, he is having a series of neural networks generate new outfits, and even a brand new runway show. So far, he tells artnet News, “the outfits that the machine makes are a lot more strange and more asymmetric than anything Balenciaga has put out.” He and a designer collaborator Mushbuh are currently working with a factory in Pakistan to make some of the algorithm-generated designs a reality. I don’t know about you, but I can definitely see the shin-bag becoming a thing.
WHY: Like other artists working with machine learning, Barrat sees AI as a tool or medium. He views it as a collaboration between artist and machine.
Tom White

WHO: Tom White is a New Zealand-based artist who is currently working as a lecturer in computational design at the University of Wellington. He specializes in “creative coding” and was included in the first mainstream gallery show dedicated to art made using artificial intelligence, which we wrote about earlier this summer.
WHAT: White works with neural networks called Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs. These networks are used in today’s computer vision applications to give modern machine-learning systems the ability to perceive the world through vision—for example, systems that filter obscene images from your Google search. In his work, White investigates the perceptual abilities of these systems by finding abstract forms that are meaningful to them. Trained on a set of images of real-life objects, the machine creates abstract representational prints until the forms created register as the specific objects, such as a starfish or a cabbage, when they are run through other AI systems to confirm. Some of the results register as “very likely obscene” when they are run through systems trained to filter obscene content, even though they might not register that way to us humans. See the above “obscene” print by White for reference.
WHY: White says working with artificial intelligence is like coming up against a staunchly different culture with completely foreign ways of seeing. In his own words, “By using AI techniques to generate my prints, I both learn and communicate how these systems differ in what they understand visually. This gives some insight in how the intelligences we are creating often agree but sometimes differ in their understanding of the world we share.”
 
Helena Sarin

WHO: Sarin is a traditional artist who uses GAN variants to transform and enhance her own pencil-on-paper sketches. She has been building commercial software for a long time, but only recently, with the discovery of GANs, has she been able to align her twin passions of coding and art.
WHAT: Sarin pretty much exclusively uses something called CycleGAN, a GAN variant that does image-to-image translation. She essentially trains a network to transform images with the form of one data set to have the textures of another data set. For example, she translates her photos of food and drink into the style of her still-lifes and sketches of flowers. She explains that one of the perks of using CycleGAN is that she can work in high resolution, even with small data sets. Plus, the model trains relatively quickly.
WHY: “As a software engineer and an artist, I always wanted to combine these two tracks of my life,” Sarin explains. “But the generative art in processing was too abstract for my taste. On the other hand, the generative models trained on my art keep producing organic folksy imagery that almost never fails to excite and surprise me.”
 
Gene Kogan

WHO: Kogan is an artist and programmer interested in how generative systems, computer science, and software can be used creatively for self-expression. He collaborates on several open-source software projects and lectures about the intersections of code and art. He’s also literally written the book on machine learning for artists.
WHAT: Like many of the people on this list, Kogan trains neural networks, a popular type of machine-learning software, on images, audio, and text. He says his primary goal is to develop generative models, or to help teach the software to output fresh, varied work based on inputs. He is particularly interested in cross-pollinating media—teaching the neural networks to output music based on a drawing of an instrument, for example. 
WHY: “It lets me try to find out interesting things about the collective mind or ‘hive mind,’ a bank of knowledge composed of all of our data,” Kogan explains of AI’s appeal. “I am interested in the collective imagination, what we reveal about ourselves by our data in aggregate. I am also interested in using neural networks to create new forms of interaction which can respond to rich sensory data, like vision, sound, and natural language.”
 
Samim Winiger

WHO: Winiger is a self-described “designer and code magician” who used to produce dance music for the likes of Diplo and Shaggy. The Berlin-based developer, who doesn’t define himself as an artist per se, is known for his experiments with artistic computational creativity experiments.
WHAT: Winiger says his network of choice “very much depends on the occasion.” (They range from Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) to Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) to Dimensionality Reduction techniques (TSNE etc.) and beyond, but we won’t get into that here.) Recently, he’s been using neural networks to explore “DeepFakes,” living hoaxes created by software taught to, say, swap one person’s head onto another’s body in one or more images. Once it has been trained on enough examples for the task at hand, a machine can produce an entire video hoax without the need for frame-by-frame manipulation on the programmer’s part. (In fact, since some DeepFake software now uses graphical interfaces—think: clicking and dragging icons—rather than coding, almost anyone can do this now.) Just for artnet News, and for fun, he trained a custom neural network he calls “DeepGagosian,” which places the face of the famous art dealer Larry Gagosian in different scenes. He’s used this to insert Mr. Gagosian into a few unusual contexts, such as a drug gang bust and a gathering of heads of state (see above).
WHY: Asked to pinpoint the most interesting part of working with neural networks for creative purposes, Winiger says: “When using machines to assist with the creation of creative artifacts, questions of authorship and agency are very much blurred. By using augmentation tools, the human creator is (in the best case) freed up to focus on the core message of the piece.” And with generative toolboxes like DeepFakes becoming more readily available, gone are the days when you needed mad Photoshop skills to pull off a convincing faked image (like the ones in DeepGagosian). Winiger explains: “We are currently at a major inflection point, where the cost of high quality image manipulation has dropped to close to 0. This concludes a 100+-year relationship with photography, where the common ‘photography equals reality’ assumption is breaking down.”
 
 Sofia Crespo

WHO: Crespo is a Berlin-based artist and art director. Her previous work includes Trauma Doll, an algorithm-powered doll that “suffers” from PTSD, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. As a coping mechanism, the doll creates collages using pattern recognition from online texts including memes, philosophical texts, and news headlines.
WHAT: Crespo is currently working on a project called Neural Zoo, which explores how creativity combines known elements in a specific way in order to create something entirely new. In her view, the creator in this case would be the algorithm itself, but with a human artist as its muse. “Isn’t all art made by humans an execution or reshaping of data absorbed through biological neurons?” Crespo asks. “How can we continue to inspire machines to create art for us as emotional human beings?”
WHY: “An interesting thing this experience gave me is the change of perspective in the design role,” Crespo says. “I originally went from designing a layout and features for an image, to actually designing the data and letting a program decide those features by itself. I guess my role became trying to anticipate what the model could create with the given data, and it never stops surprising me.”
 
Sougwen Chung
Sougwen Chung, Drawing Operations (2017). Courtesy the artist.
WHO: Chung is a Canadian-born, Chinese-raised, New York-based interdisciplinary artist and former research fellow at MIT’s Media Lab. She’s currently E.A.T.’s artist-in-residence in partnership with the New Museum and Bell Labs. Her work, which spans installation, sculpture, drawing, and performance, explores mark-making by both hand and machine in order to better understand the interactions between humans and computers. She has exhibited at institutions including The Drawing Center in New York and the National Art Center in Tokyo.
WHAT: For her current project, Drawing Operations, Chung uses Google’s TensorFlow, an open-source software library used for machine learning, to classify archives of her own drawings. The software then transfers what it has learned about Chung’s style and approach to a robotic arm that draws alongside her. She’s also working on a few new projects using pix2pix (a neural network trained to produce variations on an image, like the nighttime version of a daytime photo) and sketch-rnn (which tries to continue or complete a digital sketch based on where the human leaves off) to expand on this idea of human and machine collaboration.
WHY: “As an artist working with these tools, the promise of AI offers a new way of seeing,” Chung explains. “Seeing as self reflection, seeing through the ground truth of ones own artworks as data. There is a lot of talk about biases evident in AI systems and that is absolutely true within AI systems trained on art. You could describe visual language as a kind of visual bias, a foregrounding of the subjective view of the artist. By translating that into machine behavior, I am attempting to create a shared intersubjectivity between human and machine.”

Culture, Creativity and Artificial Intelligence were discussed at an expert seminar in Rijeka, Croatia on 12-13 October 2018. The seminar “E-relevance of Culture in the Age of AI”, organised in the framework of the Croatian Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, offers sector-specific input to the Council of Europe’s work on artificial intelligence.
In the presence of the representatives of the Ministry of Culture of Croatia, experts, practitioners/ artists and policy makers from the Steering Committee for Culture, Heritage and Landscape (CDCPP) discussed orientations for working towards a culture of responsible innovation, empowering citizens and laying the foundations for the emergence of a modern Leonardo da Vinci. Questions for debate included:

How can culture maintain its important human imprint and guidance role in a time where AI already heavily impacts people’s creativity?
Can it contribute to a more human- and citizen-centred technological future by proposing and developing alternative concepts?
How does AI impact on the perception of human uniqueness/genius, the role of artists, intellectual property? Can culture still represent a mirror of society in a time when AI intelligence blends with human creativity?

Experts, including Régine Debatty, Luba Elliott, Philippe Kern, Davor Misković, Matteo Pasquinelli, Felix Stalder, Vuk Ćosić and Gerfried Stocker, shed light on AI-related challenges and opportunities that actually present not just a technical revolution, but also a cultural and social one.  
The seminar highlighted that:
1. Arts & Culture need to be part of the dialogue about information society (be it about digital transformation at large, or AI in particular).
2. Arts & Culture are providing essential contributions to the deliberations about our common technology-influenced future, both in terms of realistic insight (through critical media art) and sense of direction (reflexive and holistic approach).
3. Arts & Culture stimulate active engagement and creativity in citizens and hence diversity in production, against the odds of global cultural standardisation and homogenisation.
4. Arts & Culture are an irreplaceable means of expression of the human genius, its iinite innate inventiveness and creativity, its power of self-determination and its manifest human rights.
5. Arts & Culture are key vectors in generating the necessary social intelligence and emancipation to accompany new life practices marked by increasing human- machine interaction.
***
Indeed, artists and cultural workers can elaborate alternative models of development, with a cultural agenda - beyond economic/commercial logics. They are able to reveal a multiplicity of readings, narratives and views and they attract media attention. As the seminar agreed, they will not easily be replaced by machines “although some AI generated art work may look more convincing than work shown at Art Fairs”..
Yet, people seem to appreciate the physical presence of a human, the imperfection of human creation and the concepts, narration, intention, effort and biographical context coming from humans.
However, AI might have a substantial impact on cultural and creative industries (music, film, journalism, design,…), challenging prevailing business models. Also, power inequalities in terms of representation may grow, due to uneven archival traditions in different world regions: cultures with strong archival traditions will be able to better feed the data needs of AI systems and hence be more ""present"" in global perception and markets.
A current initiative in Rijeka to teach AI about a threatened local language can serve as good practice and inspire similar initiatives at protecting and promoting European cultural diversity. Hence, combining high-quality business and technology assets with ethics and values would provide the competitive edge for a -also commercially successful- European model that should be robust since built on long-standing values rather than mere commercial rules.
In all this, communication seems key. Mostly, people seem either to fear loss of control through AI, or simply ignore the challenges involved. There was also a mythological dimension to AI and at the same time, a rational one: people vote for being operated on by robots rather than doctors, given the higher success rates of AI-based surgery. But when it comes to the nursing, people clearly prefer the human touch.
The event also hosted the exhibition opening of “Anatomy of an AI System”, a map that guides through the birth, life and death of an individual networked device based on a centralised artificial intelligence system, created by Vladan Joler, Share Foundation founder and Professor at the University of Novi Sad.
The results of the Rijeka expert seminar on Culture, Creativity and Artificial Intelligence will be conveyed to the Council of Europe’s forthcoming conference “Governing the Game Changer – Implications of AI development on human rights, democracy and the rule of law” (Helsinki, 26-27 February 2019).

Researchers in Leeds have been awarded a £10.1m investment from UK Research and Innovation to expand a digital pathology and artificial intelligence (AI) programme across the North of England.
The programme aims to explore new ways of speeding up the diagnosis of diseases – including cancer – through the application of AI.
It will also address whether regional clinical pathology services can be better integrated to support improved patient outcomes.
The investment was secured following a bid led by Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and the University of Leeds.
The organisations form part of a wider consortium called the Northern Pathology Imaging Co-operative (NPIC), established to foster collaboration in diagnostics across clinicians, academia and health technology companies.
Sir Alan Langlands, vice-chancellor of the University of Leeds, said: “Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust is a global leader in the area of digital pathology for cancer diagnosis, thanks to the close links with academic researchers.
“We are now expanding this digitisation across the north through this exciting partnership between universities, the NHS and industry. Going forward, new technologies such as artificial intelligence have the potential to transform how we diagnose cancer and other diseases, and the University is making great advances in this area.”
NPIC comprises nine NHS hospitals, seven universities, nine medical technology companies and Swiss company Roche Diagnostics.
The investment was announced on 6 November by Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), as part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund.
Dr Yvette Oade, chief medical officer at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said the investment presented “a huge opportunity for Yorkshire to lead in this new area and further enhance our position as a hub for medical technology”.
Dr Oade added: “This is a really exciting step for patients because computers using artificial intelligence can be trained to recognise the patterns of disease.
“Machines will support clinically trained pathologists to diagnose cancer faster, better and at lower cost.
“We can also explore how to use digital pathology as part of precision medicine to ensure patients receive treatments tailored to their disease.
Pushing the joined-up agenda
The project also aims to develop more integrated ways of working across regional clinical pathology services.
NPIC said it would involve the public regarding the use of anonymised images for AI research. It will also help inform the development of a national pathology exchange, which will allow pathology images to be shared between NHS sites nationally similar to efforts underway in NHS Scotland.
Geoff Twist, managing director for Roche Diagnostics, said: “We are delighted to be a partner in this pioneering project that will introduce digital pathology and AI to a large network across the North of England covering a population of approximately 15 million people.
“This is a true collaboration with partners from across healthcare delivery and industry, coming together with a common goal to improve diagnostic capabilities to offer cancer patients the best care possible. The ultimate aim is to develop an exemplar model that can be replicated across the UK for the benefit of cancer patients.”
Health Secretary and health IT fanatic, Matt Hancock, added: “Artificial intelligence will play a crucial role in the future of the NHS – and we need to embrace it by introducing systems which can speed up diagnoses, improve patient outcomes, make every pound go further and give clinicians more time with their patients.
“As part of our long-term plan, we will transform the NHS into an ecosystem of enterprise and innovation that allows technology to flourish and evolve.”

 The NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller visited Beijing on 24-26 October 2018 and participated in 8th Xiangshan Forum. Speaking at a special session on Artificial Intelligence, Gottemoeller highlighted how technological advances provide challenges as well as opportunities and discussed how NATO is working to ensure it stays ahead of the curve. “We do this by working together, among our 29 members and with our partners and international organisations. And of course, we work with the private sector to take full advantage of the latest innovations and to maintain our technological edge”. 






NATO’s Strategic Command located in Norfolk Virginia, Allied Command Transformation, is leading NATO’s work on innovation and disruptive technologies, including big data, artificial intelligence, and robotics. “We know that we cannot fight tomorrow’s threats with today’s tools”, Gottemoeller said.  “Defending ourselves is no longer about just looking at a map and deciding where to position troops and equipment. We need to defend ourselves in the digital age, and in the age of artificial intelligence. That work is incredibly complex. And we are thinking about it in terms of both policy and practice”.
The Deputy Secretary General said that NATO continues to adapt in order to remain at the forefront of new technologies. “On the positive side of the ledger, we are drawing on AI-related technologies to improve our response to natural disasters”, she said. “At our disaster response exercise in Serbia in early October, NATO successfully tested disaster relief tools powered by artificial intelligence. These are incredibly powerful means to help save lives. We had drones flying over the site where the disaster occurred. They sent the information collected to other machines to process the images and the data collected in order to identify victims on the ground at record speed”. 
During her visit, the Deputy Secretary General met with senior Chinese officials and delivered a lecture at the PLA National Defence University. Gottemoeller also met with officials from NATO member and partner countries.

Retailing giant Amazon Inc. is a top of mind organization using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to drive innovation and create market disruption. So it came as a bit of surprise when it was reported in October that the company had decided to scrap its new AI-driven recruiting tool. The tool was designed to give potential job candidates a rating from one to five stars, but the team behind the HR engine discovered it was not rating candidates for software developer and technical jobs in a gender-neutral way. Female candidates were consistently scored lower.
The reason? The tool was working with a dataset of resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period, most of which came from men, reflecting male dominance in the tech industry. Even after neutralizing certain terms, the development team behind the tool could not guarantee it wouldn’t find other ways to introduce gender bias in hiring recommendations.
Amazon’s experience with the tool underscores both opportunities and risks involved with the emergence of AI into all aspects of business operations, from customer service to human resources. It also draws attention to the need for greater diversity and gender balance in the field of AI research itself and its applications.





        AI is driving innovation across industries and work functions
    



Using AI to drive innovation in companies and how AI is transforming the modern workforce are two themes of discussion at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit in Montreal on November 5-6. The location for these discussions was apt, given that Montreal is increasingly regarded as a leading global hub for research in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Broadly speaking, artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine to observe information from its environment, which it can then use to learn, solve problems and make decisions. In many industries, AI is doing cognitive work that was formerly the province of human workers making decisions. These are just a few.

AI applications are common and growing in industries where there is already a labour shortage. Agriculture is a good example. Robots are being developed to harvest crops at higher volumes and at a faster pace than humans, perform crop and soil monitoring, and machine learning models are being developed to predict environmental impacts on crop yield.
 Industries ranging from retail to travel and hospitality that have high-touch customer service requirements are increasingly using chatbots as part of their customer experience.
Energy and mining companies are using cognitive AI to reduce friction from port scheduling and to track tankers to determine when they leave port, where they’re going, and how much petroleum or liquified natural gas they are transporting.
AI can be used in software development help. Functions here include modeling new applications with the right architecture and user experiences, or analyzing the business value and impact for the organization. 

The rise of automation and technology holds many potential advantages for Canadian exporters, including lower costs and new efficiencies.





        Risks of artificial intelligence
    



But automation also poses risks for the global economy.
Advances in AI and machine learning have accelerated in recent years, increasing the potential applications into areas long thought of as human-only jobs. Automation and technology is now considered one of the top risks Canadian exporters have to manage as they move into new markets.
If automation and technology expand at a rapid pace, large numbers of people could be quickly out of work.
The example of Amazon’s failed recruiting engine highlights another potential pitfall of artificial intelligence: biased data sets. IBM, for example, is working on building machines that apply human values and ethics to decision-making to overcome biases, such as gender bias.





        Women exporters and innovation
    



For Canadian companies looking to compete in the global economy, continual innovation is key to developing a unique selling proposition and maintaining relevance. Innovation is also closely tied to the success of your export strategy. In fact, research shows Canadian companies that sell outside of Canada are 25 per cent more innovative on average compared to companies that don’t.
Innovation can be a key to greater export success for Canadian women entrepreneurs. Our research shows that while 13.5 to 16% of Canadian SMEs are owned by women, only 7.5% of them sell their products or services outside of Canada. Women entrepreneurs face unique barriers to exporting and recognition of their innovation is one of them.
Research co-funded by BMO, the Government of Canada, Carleton University and The Beacon Agency found that most policies and financial assistance programs currently equate innovation solely with technological advances, and therefore don’t consider how women are innovating much more broadly. Additionally, many women entrepreneurs interviewed said they don’t feel welcome or included in the focus of mainstream networks, incubators and accelerators. They also feel there is an underrepresentation of female mentors and potential investors.





        Canada’s AI landscape
    



A major challenge for Canadian companies that want to leverage AI is talent. Research shows that 42% of startup businesses in Canada plan to adopt AI into their business, but face major barriers in the time, cost and skills required to keep up with rapidly advancing technology. Similarly, an IBM survey of 5,000 CEOs found that 63% say they lack the talent to confidently manage AI, while 60% say adoption has been hindered by customer trust and compliance concerns.
Development of AI capabilities and know-how for Canadian small and medium-sized business to help them scale and be globally competitive is central to the government’s innovation strategy.





        Pan-Canadian AI strategy
    



The Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy is designed to increase the number of highly-skilled researchers and graduates, by enhancing research capabilities and discoveries through collaboration across three centres of excellence. It also seeks to demonstrate global leadership around the economic, ethical, policy and legal implications of AI advancement.
The strategy is led by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) with $125 million support from the federal government.





        Canada’s AI Supercluster
    



As part of Canada’s Innovation and Skills plan the federal government has invested $950 million over five years to support business led innovation superclusters. One of the five superclusters is the AI-Powered Supply Chains Supercluster (SCALE.AI), based in Quebec and encompassing the Quebec-Windsor corridor.
The mission of SCALE.AI is to bring the retail, manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure, and information and communications technology sectors together to build intelligent supply chains through artificial intelligence and robotics. Its main goal is to help Canadian small and medium-sized businesses scale up and help ensure Canada is a globally competitive export leader. Over 100 companies, institutions and associations are working together to achieve this goal.
A key objective of SCALE.AI is fostering more diversity and inclusion in the field of AI through college and university curriculums and employee re-skilling programs.

ScrapingAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhen Robots Ring the BellShare full articleRead in appOne of Universal Robots’ collaborative robots recently rang the closing bell while surrounded by Robo Global executives in a celebratory moment at the New York Stock Exchange.By Janet MorrisseyNov. 7, 2018When Robo Global’s team recently gathered at the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate the fifth anniversary of its robotics index and exchange-traded fund, it marked the event in true robotic fashion: A robot, propped on a table, reached out its arm and rang the closing bell as 15 company executives applauded wildly next to it.This clever, eye-catching gesture was aimed to show the world how easy — and increasingly common — it is for humans to work alongside robots.“It was symbolic,” said Travis Briggs, chief executive of Robo Global’s operations in the United States. “We’re in the first inning of this transition to automation and artificial intelligence, and there is a massive amount of growth potential.”Indeed, robotics and automation are no longer viewed as a passing fad or a cool technology for geeks to gush over. Instead, more companies are turning to artificial intelligence to boost productivity and stay relevant in a fiercely competitive market. Experts call it the fourth industrial revolution and compare today’s robotics in the workplace to the early days of the internet.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt a recent conference hosted by Robo Global, experts showed photos and videos of robotic prototypes of all shapes and sizes: Robots that climb stairs and around corners to find an object and A.I.-laced pills that can retrieve foreign objects from a person’s stomach. They even included a video of a woman, with electrodes attached to her head, using thoughts to tell a robot where to place an object.“We’re starting to see robots and automated systems penetrate every sector of the economy,” said Jeremie Capron, director of research at Robo Global. “The pace of change is really accelerating, so, yes, it’s a revolution.”Robo Global, which researches, advises and invests in robotics, automation and A.I. companies, knows all about the sector’s growth. Since setting up its Robo Global Robotics & Automation Index ETF (Robo), which tracks more than 80 companies, the corporation reports that its assets have soared to $3.46 billion from $43 million its first year.Several other robotic ETFs, like iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (IRBO) and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic ETF (BOTZ), have since been established to tap this growing sector.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe phenomenon strikes both admiration and fear into a nervous American work force: A video by Boston Dynamics, showing human-looking robots running and jumping over blocks, drew more than five million views on YouTube in one week this fall. Yet many Americans, who grew up watching science fiction and “Terminator” movies in which robots were the enemy, worry about robots stealing their jobs.“‘Terminator’ and those kinds of images have a significant impact on the way people perceive technology,” said Raffaello D’Andrea, professor of dynamic systems and control at ETH Zurich University, and a co-founder of Kiva Systems, a robotics company that was sold to Amazon.A recent report, “The Future of Jobs 2018,” by the World Economic Forum, forecasts that machines will perform more than half of all current workplace tasks by 2025, up from 29 percent today. It also predicts that 75 million jobs will be displaced by 2022, but that 133 million jobs will be created. Of the new jobs, 54 percent will require new skills.A McKinsey Global Institute report is gloomier, predicting that by 2030, as many as 800 million people worldwide may have been displaced by automation and will need to find new jobs.The retail giant Amazon was one of the earliest to embrace this technology, with its $775 million acquisition of Kiva — now called Amazon Robotics — in 2012. Amazon had been under pressure to deliver orders to its Amazon Prime customers within the promised 48-hour window without losing money, Mr. Capron said. Amazon immediately deployed 3,000 robots into its fulfillment centers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We need advanced technology and automation to meet customer demand — it’s that simple,” said Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics.The robots wander up and down the aisles, bringing shelves of items directly to associates to package and ship, significantly slashing costs and shortening the time to process and deliver an order. Today, Amazon has more than 100,000 robots navigating 26 fulfillment centers around the world.ImageInside Amazon’s fulfillment center in Kent, Wash., where robots transport shelves of products to the people who will pack and ship them.Credit...Grant Hindsley/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“Amazon delivered more than five billion items under two business days in 2017 to their Prime program members, based on our research, including discussions with Amazon Robotics,” Mr. Capron said. All of this bolstered customer loyalty and demand, resulting in more orders, sales revenue and jobs.Mr. Brady said it was a myth that automation always destroys jobs.“Since the acquisition of Kiva, we’ve added 300,000 full-time jobs globally,” he said. “Last year alone, we added 130,000.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAs robots have become faster, smaller, cheaper and safer in recent years, more and more companies — large and small — have been seeking robotics to step up productivity, increase precision or cut costs, said Stuart Shepherd, regional sales director for Universal Robots USA and chairman of the Association for Advancing Automation.The average hourly cost of a manufacturing worker to an employer is $36 in the United States, while the hourly cost of a robot is $4, according to a recent Pew Research report.All Axls Machining, a business in Dallas, was struggling to find enough workers to operate its metal-fabrication equipment and to sand and inspect metal parts manually for the medical, aerospace, defense and industrial sectors.Without workers to run the machines and the assembly lines, production lagged. “After 5 p.m., we’d have a skeleton shift, with only half the machines running,” said Gary Kuzmin, the company’s owner. “It was costing me orders that I couldn’t get to my customers on time.”But then Mr. Kuzmin discovered Universal Robots, which makes collaborative robots, or cobots, which are small, affordable and designed to operate safely side by side with workers. They are easy to program to do multiple tasks and allow the company to crank out parts around the clock.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAfter introducing the robots, one job that was expected to take six months to complete was finished in less than half that time, Mr. Kuzmin said. “We saw a 60 percent profit increase on that job alone.”The company became so adept at programming the robots for different jobs that it formed an All Axls Robotics unit, which sells its specially programmed robots to other machine shops.Mr. Kuzmin said the increased productivity allowed him to hire — rather than fire — more workers, boosting his work force to 22 from 16.Early in 2017, another company, Zippertubing, of Chandler, Ariz., was having a tough time finding extra workers to help fulfill a big automotive order for its cable management products.“We had a lot of people who would come in, work for maybe a week, and then leave because they didn’t like the repetitive work environment,” said Tim Mead, operations manager at Zippertubing. It brought in Universal Robots’ cobots and immediately saw productivity surge.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It used to take three people to do all of the operations that the robot now does,” Mr. Mead saidThe robots have also increased the company’s accuracy in spotting faulty manufactured parts. When operators look at thousands of parts a day, they sometimes become “snow-blind” to defects, Mr. Mead said. But that never happens to robots.In certain sectors — consumer electronics, automobile manufacturing and logistics — “we’re moving into an era where automation has really gone from a competitive advantage right now to absolutely necessary,” Mr. Briggs said. “Automate or fail.”ImageA worker monitoring a robotic arm as it operates inside a factory in Huaian, China.Credit...ReutersAll of this has stoked fears, especially among Americans, that robots, automation and A.I. will throw millions of people onto the unemployment line.Some industry experts play down these concerns, saying that in any industrial revolution, jobs are lost and new ones created.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Fifty years ago, or even 15 years ago, who knew what an app developer was, or the amount of programming that we’d need,” Mr. Briggs said.Over the next decade, the biggest job losses will most likely affect low-skilled workers performing repetitive tasks, like machine operators, assembly line workers, dishwashers, drivers and preparers of fast food. Certain white-collar areas, like data entry, accounting and payroll, will suffer as well.Demand, however, will probably surge for data analysts, software developers, web designers, IT experts, e-commerce specialists, health care providers, entrepreneurs and social media experts, according to the World Economic Forum report. Sectors that involve human skills, like sales, marketing, customer service and even art and entertainment, will also be in high demand, the report said.While new jobs will offset losses, retraining and education will be critical. As many as 375 million workers globally will need to change job categories and learn new skills to survive the transition, according to the McKinsey Global Institute report.“The days are gone where somebody learns to do a task, and that’s what they do for the rest of their life,” Mr. D’Andrea said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow quickly and how deeply A.I. and robotics penetrate the job market will ultimately dictate how rapidly people need to be retrained.“History tells me that every prior technological revolution has resulted in more wealth and more jobs,” Mr. Capron said. “So it would have to be very different this time around for history not to repeat itself.”But A.I. has its critics. The visionary billionaire Elon Musk has described it as humanity’s “biggest existential threat,” while the renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who died this year, predicted that “the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.” Mr. Musk is particularly concerned about the use of A.I. to develop autonomous lethal weapons that could select targets without human intervention — a development with potentially apocalyptic repercussions.Mr. D’Andrea said A.I. was a long way off from being a real threat. He does believe, however, that regulations will be needed to safeguard its use in autonomous weapons.Mr. Briggs was less concerned. “I think Elon Musk is being overly dramatic,” he said, noting that he did not believe that A.I. should be regulated. “I think regulation is a slippery slope — it certainly stifles creativity.”A correction was made on Nov. 12, 2018: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the company that owns a robot that rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange. It is owned by Universal Robots, not by Robo Global.A correction was made on Dec. 5, 2018: In an earlier version of this article, the second reference to a professor at ETH Zurich University and co-founder of Kiva Systems, a robotics company, was incorrect.

As part of a regular series powered by Dell Small Business, BetaKit asks business leaders to share their advice for growing small businesses.

Vancouver-based Finn AI is no stranger to scaling for success – the FinTech and AI company, which provides chatbots and personalized banking software for financial institutions, previously won the Serge Kampf Entrepreneurship and Innovation Award at Capgemini’s InnovatorsRace50. 
Fresh off the company’s recent $14 million Series A round of funding, co-founder and COO Natalie Cartwright discussed with BetaKit how she sees the future of consumer-facing artificial intelligence (hint: it’s not The Terminator), as well as better ways to serve data back to your customers.
What were some of the biggest struggles you had getting your business off the ground in the early days?
“I don’t think we’re going to reach the Terminator or anything, but it’s going to be other types of technologies where there’s lot of data and you can make predictions.”
I think it’s a bit of a catch-22 – once things are up and running, it’s not easy to maintain them, but the struggle is how you get from zero to 100. It’s about trying to grow a business incrementally, and that includes all the different stages: the financing, how do you get enough money to be able to grow, how do you get enough employees to be able to move, how do you get your product to a stage where it can actually be put forward? It’s all those different pieces, but it’s also trying to scale appropriately over the right amount of time.
A second big piece that’s undervalued is the psychological journey that you go through – the doubts, the fear, the excitement, the wins and losses. There’s lot of things that I think people speak to more often, but those were two pieces that I didn’t expect as much.
 How does Finn AI define its culture, and what does it do to foster that culture?
The fundamental vision of our company is to ensure the financial well-being of 100 million people by 2025. We do that through working with banks to help their users improve their financial well-being; we help banks move up the value chain. 
It’s not helping them with new channels or existing channels, but instead really thinking about how they can help people better manage their money with things like financial literacy coaches or information about what’s actually going on with bank accounts. We have this really nice opportunity where we can do something where you feel like you’re doing something good for the world, but it also solves a real business problem. 
I think the people and the culture are a real reflection of that, and also a reflection of the type of technology we work with, which is a lot of artificial intelligence and machine learning. We also have lots of stuff that isn’t artificial intelligence and machine learning, and that’s a scenario that’s very new and moving very quickly. We’re very much a learning organization where people are very eager to try new things.
Natalie Cartwright with co-founder Jake Tyler.
Another thing we’re focused on is making sure that we serve the world, too. We work with banks across four continents and in three languages. In our business, we really have to have a diverse workforce, so when we talk about diversity, we talk about that from different dimensions. When we think about diversity, it’s from the perspective of trying to bring a convergence of ideas around the table. We acknowledge that bringing together diversity on a number of dimensions is more challenging to put together, because we don’t necessarily share the same ideas, but that means we just talk with each other more. You fundamentally build a ground-layer respect in bringing so many different ideas, and bringing so many ideas together to solve big problems makes it stronger.
What do you think is the next big trend in technology and how will it impact the way we live and work? 
We work in artificial intelligence and in FinTech, but consumer expectations are really about to change. The way that I would describe it is that we’re at the stage of artificial intelligence – consumer-facing artificial intelligence – where we’re going to see it fail very quickly. It changes technology in that data becomes much more valuable than it’s ever been before, and consumers will be happy to share data with you to the extent that they think that you’re using the data to better serve them. So, I don’t think people are going to tolerate companies having that valuable data but not actually using it to better help consumers.
“I think what the next generation looks like is, ‘how happy did I make this customer today?'”
I think we’re going to see wins when people figure out how to use data to better serve people. Two great examples of that are Netflix recommendations and Spotify recommendations, where you get value out of them knowing what movies you’re watching or what music you’re listening to, because they can then serve you better recommendations.
That’s what we’re doing in the banking world. There’s lots of information about how you’re spending money, where you’re spending money, where you might be having trouble with your money, and there’s lots of ways to serve that data back to people in a proactive way, so they can avoid certain situations or optimize their finances. But the principle will be that you have to provide a much more proactive and predictive experience for customers when you’re using their data and that can play out in lots of different ways.
So where do you think the future is headed when it comes to artificial intelligence?
I don’t think we’re going to reach the Terminator or anything, but it’s going to be other types of technologies where there’s lot of data and you can make predictions. There’ll be an enhancement of AI, and what we’ll need more of is human deference around that, so it’s not like everything is suddenly AI. 
It’s very similar to when ATMs rolled out, and there was this narrative of “oh, now tellers will disappear.” But that’s not true – what happened was that people went to get their cash from an ATM, and the metrics for tellers weren’t, “how many customers did I serve today?” or “how many products did I serve today?” And I think what the next generation looks like is, “how happy did I make this customer today?”

While the artificial intelligence invasion is a beneficial development, it has always brought along with it concerns of human jobs being occupied by machines. In a latest development, the World's first AI news anchor has been unveiled. Jointly developed by Xinhua and Chinese search engine company Sogou, the AI news anchor has a male image modeled on a real anchor with Xinhua called Zhang Zhao.

The AI news anchor imitates the voice, facial expressions and actions of a real person and looks like a professional news reader. The AI news anchor learns from live broadcasting videos and can read texts as naturally as a professional news anchor all by himself.
“The development of the media industry calls for continuous innovation and deep integration with the international advanced technologies. I will work tirelessly as texts will be typed into my system uninterrupted. I look forward to bringing you the brand new news experiences,” says the AI news anchor in a video shared by Xinhua News Agency on Twitter.
While the AI news anchor has managed to create ripples with people lauding the new technology, there are others who have raised concerns of such a technology stealing jobs meant for humans. “China Unveils An Artificial Intelligence Virtual News Anchor. The replacement of humans with AI programs for jobs is just a matter of time now,” says William Okafor, a web developer, on Twitter.

Several other are calling this development as an ‘exciting’ yet ‘scary’ technological advancement. “Who's that journalist who said our jobs were not at risk....yet? Hehehe. The revolution might actually be televised,” tweeted Moderator and Host at BBC Africa Georgie Ndirangu.
Nevertheless, there a few who are welcoming this development for it may prove to be extremely beneficial for cash strapped media houses. The AI news anchor can pick up news from across different platforms, work for 24 hours a day, improve efficiency, and get much better over the coming years thus saving media houses a lot of time and money. Although the artificial intelligence product currently looks dull and mechanical, experts are of the view that it will gradually get better and become more lifelike. “As an AI news anchor under development, I know there is a lot for me to improve,” says the AI news anchor in another video.
However, what do you as viewers have to say about this development? Will the advent of AI lead to job loss or create new jobs? Is it a necessary trend that will need to be adopted regardless of the collateral damage it may cause? Do let us know in the comment section below.
