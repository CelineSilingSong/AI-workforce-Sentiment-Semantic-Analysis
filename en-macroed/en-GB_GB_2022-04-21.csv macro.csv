With the endless promotion of artificial intelligence by analysts, media, and vendors, one can be forgiven for assuming AI is proliferating across and running enterprises far and wide. However, the reality is beyond simply automating narrow applications — such as credit scoring, upselling recommendations, chatbots, or managing machine performance — AI still has a limited range, and barely begun to achieve its full potential as a true augment to human intelligence and talent.


That's the takeaway from recent panel discussion hosted by New York University Center for the Future of Management and LMU institute for Strategy, Technology and Organization, joined by Daron Acemoglu, professor at MIT; Jacques Bughin, professor at the Solvay School of Economics and Management; and Raffaella Sadun, professor at Harvard Business School.

“I am not that excited about the narrow applications of AI,” says Sadun. “I’m not excited about the dumb approach of automating one process and them claiming that you are on a different tier of technology.”

At the moment, “AI is being pushed too much into automating narrow tasks, where there are not a lot of productivity gains and a lot of displacement,” Acemoglu agrees. For the most part, “AI is being used at a narrow process level as a cost-cutting measure. That does not really work very well at scale, and is really not the best way of using AI. But a lot of managers are doing that. Many firms investing in AI, bit doing it the wrong way.”

AI will start reaching its potential when it aligns broader human and machine intelligence, says Acemoglu. “Machines need to become a tool for the selection and presentation of the right type of information, for leveraging the skill, judgement, creativity, and social learning and situational learning of humans,” he says. “Very few organizations are doing that. There is a failure of these organizations, but more importantly, it’s a failure in the field of AI,"" says Acemoglu. ""Managers are following what AI leaders are telling them. And AI leaders are not discussing this type of use of AI. They are hyping up cost-cutting process-level AI use. In that sense, we are in an AI trap.""

The embrace of a broader and more meaningful AI needs to start at the top, where there is still much resistance, Sadun says. “There are too many leaders and executives who think about AI as a technology, not as about a lever for organizational change,” she explains. “And they have no idea how the technology is actually used by their employees. People who are really using AI effectively in their firm spent time on the shop floor, seeing how the technology is used by people. They get a sense of the software and the hardware change that needs to be there for people to actually leverage AI.”

Embracing AI needs to be an organizational transformation. “It requires different skills — not just coding skills,” Sadun says. “It’s much more about the soft skills. The ability to coordinate knowledge that comes from different pockets of the organization. I’m surprised that even some organizations are getting it right. It’s actually a really tough issue.”
The companies that are using AI to its full potential “are thinking about incorporating new input,” says Sadun. They are thinking about training, making sure that the technology is actually usable, and can leverage continuous self-improvement. Fundamentally, it’s about the technologies that think about a human and a machine as a team.”

My personal favorite was a holiday-themed romantic comedy script, in which a ""business man,"" whose ""hands are briefcases,"" courts a ""single mother,"" who ""cannot date because of a snow curse.""Advertisement · Scroll to continueThis human-created work imitating artificial intelligence is almost certainly entitled to copyright registration. But what if someone actually created a bot to review 1,000 hours of romantic comedies and create a script amalgamating its learnings? Would that script be entitled to copyright registration? According to the U.S. Copyright Office's Copyright Compendium, ""the Office will refuse to register a claim if it determines that a human being did not create the work,"" so the answer is currently no.Advertisement · Scroll to continueStephen Thaler, a Ph.D. in Physics and the founder, president, and CEO of Missouri-based technology company Imagination Engines Incorporated, is trying to change the U.S. Copyright Office's policy against copyright registration of AI-created works.Thaler is a pioneer in creating artificial intelligence machines, including three versions of the ""Creativity Machine"" and the Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience, nicknamed DABUS. DABUS is one of the world's most-advanced AI systems because it not only compiles and analyzes existing information to produce optimal combinations, but also forms and tests consequence chains of each of the potential outcomes. Put simply, DABUS is to traditional AI what 3D is to 2D.Ad Break Coming Up

Continue watchingExiled Chinese businessman Guo convicted of fraudafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGEThaler specifically piqued the interest of intellectual property lawyers because of his high-profile efforts to protect the fruits of the Creativity Machines' and DABUS's labors, both in patent offices around the world and in the U.S. Copyright Office.Circa 2014, DABUS had seen thousands of photographs and was able to generate original artwork based on its machine learning. On a particular project, Thaler used the ""random snipping of connections within DABUS to simulate a dying brain."" DABUS generated two-dimensional artwork that it named ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise."" Despite looking like a floral-covered railway tunnel to the human eye, DABUS captioned (and apparently envisioned) the artwork as: ""This facility was decommissioned in 1975. Administrative offices to right were abandoned then. Note the trans-dimensional rippling effect.""In November 2018, Thaler filed a U.S. copyright application to register the two-dimensional artwork, listing ""Creativity Machine"" as the author and himself as the claimant, based on his ownership of the Creativity Machine.In August 2019 and March 2020, the U.S. Copyright Office refused to register ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise"" because the work ""lacks the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim."" In May 2020, Thaler's counsel submitted a second request for reconsideration, which was evaluated by the Copyright Review Board, the tribunal responsible for hearing appeals of copyright registration refusal decisions and the final level of appellate review within the U.S. Copyright Office.On Feb. 14, 2022, the Copyright Review Board (CRB) rejected Thaler's argument that the human authorship requirement was unconstitutional and unsupported by case law and issued a decision upholding the Copyright Office's refusal to register ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise.""Although the precise question of whether AI-generated artwork could be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office appeared to be a question of first impression, the CRB leaned heavily on supposedly analogous CRB and federal court decisions involving works produced by nature and natural processes, such as a living garden, a jellyfish's depictions, and a monkey's photography.The CRB also relied on U.S. Supreme Court decisions from 1884, 1954, and 1973 (long before AI existed) defining an ""author"" as ""he to whom anything owes its origins"" and 1976 Copyright Act language referring to an author's children, widow, grandchildren, and widower — ""terms that 'all imply humanity'"" — as judicial and legislative precedent.And thus, even in the absence of an express human authorship requirement within the Copyright Act, the CRB held that ""[b]ecause copyright law as codified in the 1976 Act requires human authorship, the [w]ork cannot be registered."" The CRB also rejected work-for-hire arguments.Considering that Thaler's primary challenge to the Copyright Office's human authorship requirement was constitutionality, it was highly unlikely that the Copyright Office would have simply reversed its longstanding construction of the Copyright Act. Such a stark pivot in copyright policy will likely take the intervention of multiple federal courts or Congress.When Thaler's patent applications for AI-generated inventions were refused registration by the U.S. Patent Office, Thaler filed a lawsuit against the USPTO and its then-Acting Director under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing ""the USPTO is belatedly adopting luddism."" Reading the tea leaves, it appears likely that Thaler will soon file a complaint against the U.S. Copyright Office and the Register of Copyrights under the Administrative Procedure Act in the Eastern District of Virginia challenging the CRB's decision or appeal the CRB's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.And although the Copyright Office has occasionally reversed course in settlement of federal court lawsuits filed against it under the Administrative Procedure Act, such a reversal seems unlikely here because of the landmark nature of such a potential decision.Notably, Thaler could have touted his human contribution to the overall creation of the machine-generated artwork (for example, classifying the Creativity Machine as ""merely being an assisting instrument""), but instead represented that ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise"" was ""autonomously created by artificial intelligence without any creative contribution from a human actor.""This unequivocal statement appears to have been intentionally made to directly pressure test the U.S. Copyright Office's human authorship requirement, rather than creating a potential middle ground for joint authorship between AI and humans and leaving the question of 100% AI authorship unresolved.In a footnote, the Copyright Review Board noted that ""the Board does not need to determine under what circumstances human involvement in the creation of machine-generated works would meet the statutory criteria for copyright protection."" But it is reasonable to expect that issue to be squarely in front of the Copyright Review Board sooner than later.Unless and until the federal courts or Congress change the law with respect to copyright registrability of AI-generated works, the Copyright Review Board's decision presents more questions than it answers. For example, what can third parties do with AI-created works such as ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise""? Are such works to be treated like public domain works, free for anyone to commercialize?Likewise, although federal courts require a copyright registration as a prerequisite to the filing of a copyright infringement lawsuit, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which permits reporting of infringing user-generated content to a social media website (or other website with third-party content) does not. Accordingly, it is unclear whether sending a DMCA infringement notice to a website alleging infringement of an AI-generated work runs afoul of the DMCA's prohibition against bad-faith notices, following the CRB's ruling.Finally, if AI-created works are not registrable as copyrights because they lack human authorship, are they likewise exempt from copyright infringement, at least until they are exploited?The law typically lags technological advances, and artificial intelligence technology is no exception. As humans create artificial intelligence, and their artificial intelligence creates inventions and works of value, we can expect ample legal activity around the world seeking to protect the fruits of the artificial intelligence's lucrative labor. Thaler's ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise"" fight is likely only an entrance to artificial intellectual property jurisprudence.Disclaimer: This article is presented for informational purposes only and it is not intended to be construed or used as general legal advice nor as a solicitation of any type.Joel Feldman is a regular contributing columnist on trademark and copyright law for Reuters Legal News and Westlaw Today.Jumpstart your morning with the latest legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket newsletter.

The most important development in human history will take place not too far in the future. Artificial intelligence, or AI for short, will become better (and cheaper) than humans at most tasks. This will generate enormous wealth that can be used to fill human needs.
However, since most humans will not be able to compete with AI, there will be little demand for ordinary people’s labour-power. The immediate effect of a world without work is that people will lose their primary source of income and whatever meaning, mastery, sense of belonging and status they get from their work. Our collective challenge is to find meaning and other ways to reliably get what we need in this new world.

What you just read is the prevailing story among both optimists and pessimists around the development of AI. The story can and should be challenged. (For an excellent challenge, see Divya Siddarth, Daron Acemoglu, Danielle Allen, Kate Crawford, James Evans, Michael Jordan, E. Glen Weyl’s How AI Fails Us.) However, here I will focus on what the story takes to be our challenge: How do we ensure that ordinary people continue to experience a growing standard of living and sense of meaning in a world without work?
Although it is not always recognised, a satisfactory answer to this challenge requires answering two related but distinct questions.

The easy question is to find possible, realistic replacements for work as a source of income and meaning.
The hard question is how to go from here to there, to make the possible actual. I call this AI’s transition problem.

Not only is the transition problem harder to solve. Replacing workers with AI may prevent any realistic solution to the challenge AI presents. This is AI’s transition paradox. The paradox, in short, is that the more workers who are replaced by AI, the more difficult it becomes to build the institutions that are necessary to make the lives of ordinary people better in a world without work. Without a solution to the transition paradox, the AI future will be dystopian.
I will flesh out the transition paradox in more detail. But first, how do we solve the easy question?
The easy question
OpenAI Co-Founder & CEO Sam Altman speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2019. CC BY 2.0
There are several possible answers to the easy question, which recall is the task of finding possible, realistic replacements for work as a source of income and meaning.
One attractive model is proposed by Sam Altman, OpenAI co-founder and CEO. In the essay “Moore’s Law for Everything,” he argues for giving everyone a stake in the AI economy. By increasing taxes on profitable companies and property, one could fund a basic income, a universal, unconditional income paid monthly to all citizens or residents independent of whether they work or not.
One possible hurdle with the basic income solution is that people may like their jobs and prefer to receive income through work than through welfare. Not only do many people find meaning and belonging in their work. Many find it demeaning to receive welfare. Unemployment is among the major sources of lasting unhappiness.
Finding meaning, belonging, and happiness without work might nevertheless be a solvable problem, as suggested by e.g. John Danaher in Automation and Utopia Human: Flourishing in a World without Work.
Many retired people already live on a form of basic income. They are no less happy than working people. Indeed, they report being happier. Of course, a reason for this may be that they have earned their time of leisure. A more plausible explanation is that when we are no longer expected to work, and our peers no longer work, not working is no longer a marker of failure or a cause of anxiety about the future.
Other groups that are happy without work include adolescents and young adults. Indeed, a notable finding in happiness research points to a happiness U-curve over our lifetimes. Younger and older people are happier than people in their prime working age. The happiness U-curve is evidence that we can live good lives without work.
The hard question
David G. Blanchflower, Is happiness U-shaped everywhere? Age and subjective well-being in 145 countries. Journal of Population Economics 34, 575–624 (2021)
Altman’s answer to the easy question is to tax property and capital and provide people with a generous basic income. If we can solve the problem of finding happiness outside work, we have a satisfactory solution to the easy question. However, the harder question, how to get from here to there, remains unresolved. This is what I call AI’s transition problem.
To answer the hard question, we need to understand how institutions are built. An obvious source of insight is the historical record. How did we build institutions that have proven to distribute the gains from trade for the benefit of ordinary people, such as welfare states, regulation of working time, coordinated wage setting, and free or subsidised health care and education?
The optimistic take
Steven Pinker, Enlightenment Now, Penguin Books 2018, 108
The transition problem is rarely discussed explicitly by tech optimists. However, their implicit view finds a voice in Steven Pinker’s recent book Enlightenment Now. According to Pinker, social expenditure on institutions like education, health care and social insurance is the inevitable result of economic growth.
These are the things we want more of when we become richer. And since rich countries are predominantly democratic and thus responsive to citizens’ needs, rich countries provide people with what they want. This is evident from the statistics: The richer countries become, the more they spend on opportunity enhancing and equalising institutions.
Let us connect Pinker’s view with the prevailing story of AI replacing workers that we began with. With growing unemployment, the existing social insurance and taxation programs will be unsatisfactory in providing people with what they need.
In response, political elites will want to find new ways to tax wealth and provide people with other sources of consumption power. These elites may either be motivated by the same sense of noblesse oblige that the AI developers in Silicon Valley profess to be motivated by, or they will be forced to do it by people demanding change.
The realist take
Another, and in my mind, more plausible, the view is less optimistic. Institutions that increased the well-being of ordinary people were not given on a silver platter; they had to be fought for. They result from a long struggle, in many cases spearheaded by organised labour.
Indeed, democracy itself results from the struggle for improved conditions for ordinary people. The fight for political rights went hand in hand with improved working conditions and other social rights.
This struggle depended on several factors: One factor was working people’s ability to coordinate and organise, and crucially their power to stop production through coordinated strikes. Another closely related factor was the political elites’ fear of revolution, strengthened by the 1917 revolution in Russia. A third was policies that supported full employment, increasing workers’ bargaining power.
The transition paradox
Labor-Strikes-Minneapolis, circa 1934. In public domain
If we accept the view that new institutions must be fought for through organised struggle, we face a transition paradox. When workers are increasingly replaced by AI, their power to push for necessary changes in the existing institutions for the benefit of ordinary people weakens.
When more people are unemployed, there will be more demand for the jobs that need to be met by humans, driving down wages and weakening organised labour. The immediate effect of fewer workers and lower pay is a reduction in government revenue.
Governments are run on tax on labour income and consumption. As suggested by Altman, this can be mitigated by taxing property and capital. But without political pressure, a reduction in the tax base is more likely to lead to cuts in government expenditure, the very thing that is necessary to fund expensive basic income schemes.
It is notable that even in the heyday of social democracy and organised labour, governments did little to tax capital and land. To believe that this will change in an age of weakened labour seems naïve at best.
Furthermore, it is not like governments have much success in taxing the very companies spearheading the AI revolution. If governments cannot tax them in their current state, we have no reason to believe they will be able to tax them when they become bigger and more powerful, and the wealth of nations is entirely dependent on their success.
Democracy’s demise
But will not democracy solve the problem, as the Pinker story suggests? If a sufficiently large share of people is unemployed, they could, through voting, force politicians to implement a basic income.
This assumes, however, that unemployed people will coordinate their interests and demand the necessary changes. An alternative view is that people will lose faith in the system or try to find convenient scapegoats in immigrants or foreign powers.
Even more bleakly, the day ordinary people have no other power than their votes, we have no guarantees that democracy survives. As long as wealth is built by ordinary people and they are necessary to protect the country against foreign invasion, ordinary people have real power. Historically, ordinary people’s ability to work and fight to provide the material basis upon which they demanded and gained, through struggle, a right to a say in the collective decisions that shape their future. However, if workers no longer are needed to sustain economic growth or protect the country against invasion, how will they keep their claim to power? If someone moves to take their rights away, how will they resist?
Empowering AI
An upshot of the transition paradox is that its solution cannot be an after-thought to the development of AI. AI needs to be developed and implemented with the transition paradox in mind. Developing AI must be geared to strengthen the forces that can push for reforms to make ordinary people better off.
This means that AI needs to be developed by and for workers to increase their productivity and control over the means of production. (See, e.g., Anton Korinek and Joseph Stiglitz and Siddarth et al.’s How AI Fails Us). We ignore the distribution of power at our peril.

To engage customers in a personal way, at a very large scale, AI or machine learning is essential. Chatbots and intelligent assistants are already leading client interactions, and AI-generated content is around the corner. AI also enables the analysis and interpretation of data at a speed and volume beyond human capabilities. Algorithms are continuing to improve as well, accelerating optimization in near real-time. As AI improves, use-cases are only going to increase.
Artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing leverages machine learning to make automated decisions. With AI, brands can boost the ROI of marketing campaigns through predictive modeling, advanced segmentation, and personalization.

Why AI marketing matters
AI has transformed digital marketing and reduced the risk of human error while streamlining marketing campaigns. To truly connect with customers, you’ll still need the human touch — especially concerning compassion, empathy, and storytelling. However, when it comes to certain aspects of marketing, like predictive analytics and digital advertising, AI is capable of incredible things. For example, when your goal is to understand your customers’ needs and match them to appropriate products or services, this is where AI shines.
A 2020 McKinsey survey found that those working in marketing and sales had the third-highest rate of AI adoption. What’s more, the survey reported that “A small contingent of respondents coming from a variety of industries attribute 20 percent or more of their organizations’ earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to AI.”
Since then, AI use in marketing has continued to grow. As rates of use increase, if you don’t consider implementing these technologies, your brand risks being left behind. Your competitors will adopt AI strategies to improve their business outcomes, allowing them to increase sales, boost customer retention, and more effectively launch new products.

Benefits of artificial intelligence in B2B marketing
There are plenty of artificial intelligence marketing tools designed specifically for business sales, allowing B2B vendors to leverage the power of personalization, machine learning, and more. From AI-powered workflows to automated next best action features, AI is helping companies solve challenges specific to B2B.
Here are some of the benefits of artificial intelligence in B2B marketing.
Campaign ROI. With the help of AI technology, B2B marketers can better predict the performance of data and campaigns. They can then make suggestions for optimizing those campaigns to reach the maximum ROI. When leveraged effectively, marketers can use AI to transform their marketing campaigns, extracting the most valuable insights to act on them in real-time — for example, analyzing the most effective ad placements to increase engagement.
Better informed decisions. Data integration automation replaces manual processing to enable faster, real-time decision-making. The goal is to gain promptly actionable customer insights. For example, with the help of predictive analytics, you can access buying patterns that help forecast purchasing decisions. Since these buying patterns are often more complex to spot in a B2B model than in a B2C model, the help of AI can be a game-changer.
Marketing metrics. The ability to track the effectiveness of campaigns can significantly affect your marketing ROI. Artificial intelligence can help monitor the outcomes of countless customer touchpoints, thus supporting campaign optimization.
Better data management. AI marketing tools also help to significantly reduce the risk of improper data interpretation, support optimal data integration, and eliminate data silos. An AI marketing tool is software that leverages AI technology to automate decisions based on collected data.
Components of artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence encompasses various features and capabilities that can scale your marketing programs. Here are some of the main components.
Machine learning. Unlike task automation, which is fairly limited, machine learning relies on algorithms trained to use large quantities of data to make complex predictions and decisions. Machine learning models can decipher text, recognize images, perform audience segmentation, and even anticipate how customers are likely to respond to various initiatives. More importantly, as the name implies, it can correct and improve itself without supervision (although some human supervision is often involved).
AI-powered platforms. Many marketing platforms today have AI “baked in,” using it to analyze and drive insights across large pools of data. Most of the large marketing suites have AI components providing cross-platform support for the solutions the suites offer. Examples are Salesforce’s Einstein and Adobe’s Sensei.
Platforms to perform specific kinds of work are also available, for example, AI-powered content creation platforms. Some solutions offer draft content for emails or specific social media platforms, such as Twitter. Other solutions optimize content for SEO.
Big data and analytics. Collecting data is one thing — effectively analyzing it is another. AI presents one solution to the challenge of analyzing and interpreting data at a scale beyond the reach of human beings. Using AI in B2B marketing can efficiently analyze immense amounts of data, link that data, recognize patterns, and drive predictions. The more data AI is given, the better it can learn and improve., but there is still a lack of emotional intelligence. For this reason, as well as the need for human supervision (e.g., data stewardship, the maintenance of data catalogs, etc.), people continue to play a vital role in data management and analytics.
Examples of artificial intelligence in marketing
Many companies across all industries are implementing unique AI marketing strategies. Here are some common examples.
AI chatbots. STCHealth uses intelligent chatbots to answer vaccine-related questions and help people access their immunization records. Botco.ai, an automated, AI-powered conversational marketing platform, made the seemingly impossible possible. Thanks to this automated platform, the company saved approximately 52,000 human hours across two million chatbot interactions.
Visual intelligence. The eBike manufacturer Serial 1 used Vizit, a visual intelligence platform that uses machine learning and AI to help the company determine what images resonate most with consumers. As a result, Serial 1 was about to optimize digital assets and boost website conversions by 98%. This use case is a prime example of how AI marketing leads to better decision-making.
AI platforms for SMBs. Mailchimp uses a tool called Smart Platform, bringing AI to the SMB market. Some of the latest tools allow SMBs to automate content creation, gain access to dynamic recommendations and leverage a new customer journey builder.
Frequently asked questions about AI marketing
While AI technologies have been around for decades, many brands still wonder how to apply them to their marketing processes. Here are some of the most common questions people ask.
How does AI differ from automation? AI is software that is designed to mimic human thought processes and solve problems. Automation, on the other hand, refers to technologies that follow programmed rules to accomplish tasks at scale with little to no human intervention.Brands use both of these tools to improve their marketing processes. AI, with its machine learning capabilities, can help marketers optimize demand generation and increase personalization by analyzing customer behaviors. Automation is designed to help these teams accomplish more repetitive tasks at scale.  Do marketers need AI? In our digital world, marketers need better ways to understand audiences across different devices and channels. And while brands can still engage with their customers without AI, it’s going to become increasingly harder to scale these efforts as technologies evolve. AI is essential if brands are to engage with prospects and customers as individuals, but do so at scale.  What are some AI marketing challenges? As mentioned, not every member of the marketing team needs to have an extensive understanding of AI to enjoy its benefits. However, if brands don’t have at least one person working with them who has this experience, it can prove difficult to incorporate it into your systems. Brands also may not have the tools to handle the data and resource requirements of AI technologies. That’s why so many marketers are turning to marketing work management platforms and other helpful technologies to more effectively manage these demands.

How artificial intelligence is changing the marketing landscape
Companies can accomplish much by implementing artificial intelligence in marketing campaigns, strategies, and tools.
Whether your goal is to study consumer behavior on your website or develop tailored advertising campaigns, AI can play a pivotal role. Many digital marketing strategies can benefit significantly from these technologies, ranging from social media to SEO.
Some of the ways that AI continues to change the marketing landscape include:

Customer acquisition and the need for personalized marketing: The digital world is fueled by data now more than ever, especially as the number of people online continues to abound with growth.
Customer service through chatbots: Customers want their needs to be taken care of immediately, and the use of AI to power chatbots has enabled some businesses to handle customer inquiries more effectively while reducing the role of human agents.
Advertising campaigns: Campaigns can now be more precisely optimized and targeted.

As AI continues to evolve, there are disruptions in day-to-day marketing operations. However, it’s likely that AI technology will continue to enable sophisticated marketing strategies for years to come.

The FIA’s plans to incorporate artificial intelligence into spectator safety have been put on hold due to the challenge involved with developing suitable technology.
Plans unveiled under Jean Todt’s leadership of international motorsport’s governing body to have the system in place for the start of this season have proved unrealistic. FIA rally director Andrew Wheatley admitted the project was ongoing, but confessed no new launch date had been agreed.
“The artificial intelligence camera project is still in development,” he said. “There was a 12-month development process where the intention was for it to be fitted in the car and we would be monitoring the information.













“That is not happening and we are behind schedule with that. The technology involved in getting the camera small enough that it doesn’t fill the screen is a challenge. So we’re still using the same system which is Nico [Klinger, FIA deputy safety delegate] following the in-car cameras.”
Asked when the system could be in place, Wheatley added: “We are working towards that. I think it’s a significant challenge, let’s put it that way. The prototype was good but the problem is identifying what is a human and identifying what is, for example, a post.”
While the FIA waits to implement the AI initiative – an initiative which will have cameras in every car specifically designed to use artificial intelligence to monitor the movement of fans between cars in the stages – Wheatley was quick to praise the work of Klinger.













Klinger uses onboard camera technology to do the same job, checking on spectators moving towards the road between the stages.
Wheatley shared a powerful but very real example of how important the new safety system will be.
“In Catalunya, on the powerstage last year, Gus Greensmith went through the stage and Nico noticed something underneath the Armco [barrier],” he said. “It was, basically, the back of a mobile phone.
“Using the system they’ve got, they can reverse back frame-by-frame-by-frame and he identified it was someone holding a mobile phone underneath the Armco at road level, they were lying at road level.













“Between Gus and the next car going through, which was Thierry Neuville in nine minutes, they were able to contact the marshal on the location, he was able to go to the corner, find the guy, move him, get him back up to the safe location.
“Then [Marco] Bulacia came through, locked up on the corner and went into the barrier and damaged the barrier at exactly, exactly the location the guy was lying on the floor.
“The concept is really good, the problem is there’s so much pressure on Nico sitting in front of a screen watching. We can’t have 10 Nicos sitting in line watching the image, we need to try to work with technology to understand how we can make that easier.”

Children born today should expect to live through their 100s, and that has all sorts of implications for education, work, financial, lifestyle, family, and the workforce has not quite adapted to all these new changes.” – Susan Wilner Golden (Video: Washington Post Live)“I look to Denmark as one of the great models. They have an initiative that is multi-year, all facets of longevity including helping people work longer, national digital liberty campaigns. They’re really a model, and some other countries have implemented their model.” – Susan Wilner Golden (Video: Washington Post Live)“I see a role for everyone to help in this. Certainly educational institutions, not for profit organizations, government as well, and private companies. We all have a role in determining our future. We are all responsible for what we can do as organizations.” – Katia Walsh (Video: Washington Post Live)“It is absolutely imperative that we have diversity in the field of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the result of humans, its humans that create the code, it’s humans that use the data, and humans are limited, humans have bias. And therefore, we do everything we can to minimize the bias… We do so in three ways: one is diversity of people… we also use a diversity of data sets… and then the third way is… the diversity of tools… which is one reason we always want to include open source tools.” – Katia Walsh (Video: Washington Post Live)Susan Wilner GoldenLecturer, Stanford Graduate School of Business, and Director of dciX at the Stanford Distinguished Careers InstituteKatia WalshSenior Vice President & Chief Strategy and Artificial Intelligence Officer, Levi Strauss & CoContent from AARPThe following content is produced and paid for by a Washington Post Live event sponsor.

In the auto industry, for example, they’ve long been the most precise and reliable welders and painters. Sitting in place and doing the same job, over and over, has historically been automation’s sweet spot.But, with the explosion in artificial intelligence, robots are coming to understand more complex, nuanced tasks. And they are increasingly able to navigate, both inside and outside. In agriculture, robots are not only plowing fields, but can now recognize weeds and zap them with lasers. In hospitals, robots are doing everything from fetching supplies for nurses to helping surgeons direct their instruments more precisely.A 2020 World Economic Forum report predicted that robotics and automation would displace 85 million jobs globally in the coming five years. Yet, it also predicted that the technologies would create 97 million new jobs—generally ones requiring more skills and education.Sure enough, that’s creating a lot of very-human anxiety. A 2021 Morning Consult poll found that 48% of Americans fear that automation will reduce the number of jobs. That fear was higher among adults earning less than $50,000 annually and those without a college degree.“The people who have skills, who have training, they can get a job,” says Lionel P. Robert Jr., a professor at the University of Michigan Robotics Institute. “The people at the low end—when those jobs go away, they just have less options to find another job.”As everyone knows, the supply chain is under tremendous pressure with a boom in consumer spending. E-commerce exploded as the pandemic lockdowns set in, and it continues to grow rapidly (up 14.2% from 2020 to 2021). Demand is accelerating the deployment of already advanced robots, and nowhere are the prospects for automation stronger than in two particular sectors: warehousing and trucking.The automatic warehouse“Moving pallets around, moving forklifts around, moving boxes around in fulfillment centers—that’s an area where we’ve seen just massive robotic explosion,” says Matthew Johnson-Roberson, director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Amazon operates its own in-house robotics company to push the tech forward. And a growing cadre of startups, such as Berkshire Grey, Covariant, Dexterity, and Plus One Robotics, are offering automation services to the rest of the industry.Take, for instance, the “put wall”—an array of cubbies that workers sprint to fill up with customer orders. Berkshire Grey now offers a robotic put wall that automatically fills the cubbies and transfers the completed orders for shipping. It can handle the same amount of orders with just one-third as many employees, the company claims.And as robot AI gets better at recognizing and handling a greater variety of packages, the role for humans will continue to shrink. “We have a robotic field where we have hundreds of bots that actually work together. There’s no humans at all,” says Sri Solur, chief product officer at Berkshire Grey, which counts Walmart, Target, and FedEx among its clients. People only enter the picture when the system gets stuck, such as a jammed conveyor belt.But for now, as the warehouse business keeps growing, the amount of work far outstrips what the machines can handle. Despite automation, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects warehouse employment to grow by 7% from 2020 to 2030. And warehouses are raising pay and adding perks to attract and retain workers for these exhausting jobs.advertisementRobo truckersGoods have a long way to travel to and from warehouses, and the work of truckers is grueling. One of the job’s downsides is the monotony of highway driving—but such dull duties are, again, the sweet spot for automation. Several well-funded companies, including Aurora, Plus, TuSimple, and Google sister company Waymo, are testing automated driving systems.Some companies have proposed first automating the highway part—which comprises over 90% of long-haul trucking—and using human drivers to handle the trickier navigation around cities. But Aurora, which collaborates with FedEx, Uber Freight, and Werner, says that it will be able to automate the entire trip by the end of 2023. “We think you have to actually do driving that is useful,” says Aurora CEO Chris Urmson (who previously led Google’s self-driving car project). “And that means it has to start somewhere and end somewhere.”Rachel Binder, a senior intelligence analyst at CB Insights, says that the highway part of trucking could soon be automated, but she expects full autonomy to take another 5 to 10 years. And it takes a long time for technology to go from possible to ubiquitous. “The investment necessary to create a fleet of robots that would meaningfully change the dynamics in the labor market is significant,” says Johnson-Roberson about automated trucking.If automation fully takes over the trucking industry, it could ultimately replace up to 400,000 jobs, according to a 2020 Cornell University study. But will people miss those jobs? Even today, it’s hard to find people to take them. In 2021, the U.S. had about 80,000 unfilled driving positions, estimates the American Trucking Associations.Jobs are going away—somedayToday, economic, demographic, and cultural forces are uniting to push demand for labor-saving robotics at the same time that burgeoning AI technology is making radically smarter machines possible. Robots always start with the most mundane tasks. But as technology evolves, even roles that require a fair amount of human dexterity and judgement are falling under that definition.None of this is happening in the next year or two, though. The 5, 10, or more years it takes for robots to catch up in both capability and numbers offer time for the current and next generation of workers to learn more advanced skills beyond what machines can do. And those skills could earn them more money, in more interesting jobs. Rather than people losing their employment to machines, the machines may simply fill in for occupations that people no longer want to do anyway.Recognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards!

A new panel of experts has been assigned to advise President Joe Biden on artificial intelligence. Among them is Carnegie Mellon University Dean Ramayya Krishnan.The National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee is composed of 27 experts in academia, labor, industry and civil society. They will counsel the president on topics including the current state of the country's AI competitiveness, the state of science around AI, and AI workforce issues.Ramayya Krishnan is the dean of CMU's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. He also serves as faculty director of the Block Center for Technology and Society, which earlier this month launched a responsible AI initiative. CMU has been a leader in AI research and development since the technology was first invented.

“I’m excited, and I’m proud to represent the region and CMU in this effort,” Krishnan said. “And contribute my expertise to what I think is a really important public policy issue.”The committee members were nominated by the public as expert leaders across a wide range of AI-relevant disciplines. Other advisors include leaders from Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Salesforce, the AFL-CIO, IBM Corporation and the Markle Foundation. Committee members will serve three-year terms but could serve an additional term at the discretion of the secretary of commerce.The committee is a requirement of the National AI Initiative Act of 2020. Members will help the U.S. stay competitive in new AI development, research and uses according to Don Graves, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce.“Artificial intelligence presents a new frontier for enhancing our economic and national security, as well as our way of life. Moreover, responsible AI development is instrumental to our strategic competition with China,” said Graves. “At the same time, we must remain steadfast in mitigating the risks associated with this emerging technology, and others, while ensuring that all Americans can benefit.”Among the key priorities of the committee will be thinking about new innovations that keep the U.S. at the forefront of developing AI technology and implementing it in new ways.Krishnan argues transparency and responsible use of the technology will be important to get more sectors of the economy up to speed on the advantages of using AI in the workforce. “That’s going to be a key driver of how AI is actually going to be a huge competitive advantage for us as a nation,” he said.The group will think of ways to provide new employment opportunities in artificial intelligence as well as how to better educate the public about the benefits of the technology.

“There’s this huge opportunity for us,” Krishnan said. “To allow for people to acquire the skills that would allow for pathways to economic prosperity.”A smaller subcommittee will soon be appointed to consider matters related to AI in law enforcement, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. The smaller group will advise the president on topics such as bias, data security, legal standards and how to adopt AI for security or law enforcement. The group will focus on ensuring “that AI use is consistent with privacy rights, civil rights and civil liberties, and disability rights.”""AI is already transforming the world as we know it,"" said Alondra Nelson, the head of the Office of Science and Technology and deputy assistant to the president at CMU. ""The expertise of the NAIAC will be critical in helping to ensure the United States leads the world in the ethical development and adoption of AI, provides inclusive employment and education opportunities for the American public, and protects civil rights and civil liberties in our digital age.""
