Comment
AI art is on the rise – but how do we measure its success?

In the essay ‘Art in the Time of the Artificial’ (1998), Frieder Nake, a pioneer of computer-generated art, describes the bewilderment surrounding Georg Nees’s works at the first exhibition of computer art in Stuttgart in 1965. Uneasy questions confronted Nees’s drawings, created using a plotter following a programmed pattern to generate geometrical figures – was this authentic art? Who should be considered its author? We still appear to be asking the same questions today; the image itself is often outweighed by the process that constructs it.
In a moment when the information we consume and our patterns of digital behaviour are largely influenced by algorithmic processes, why does AI (artificial intelligence) art still confound us? Perhaps because the algorithmic image as aesthetic object takes us beyond the capacity of AI as a functional tool, turning it into a medium itself. The more interesting question might not be about who creates the art but why we consider it to be art in the first place. How do we surpass the obsession with whether AI art can convince us of its humanness and instead consider its larger implications on what we value as creativity? Unfortunately, the commercial positioning of AI art still emphasises spectacle and kitsch.

So, when ‘Gradient Descent’, an exhibition at Nature Morte gallery in New Delhi (until 15 September) presented itself as ‘the first ever art exhibition in India to include artwork made entirely by artificial intelligence’, I was slightly wary. The exhibition, curated by the research collective 64/1, brings together coders and artists like Mario Klingemann, Memo Akten, Tom White and Anna Ridler, for a mini-survey of the visual possibilities of neural-network AI, which seeks to recreate the mechanics of cognition in the human brain. Klingemann, probably the most recognisable of the group, has been building these kinds of programmes for years, which he ‘trains’ on massive amounts of visual data to eventually create an output that, in the work on view here, continually merges his own webcam self-portraits with those of Old Masters. The video is titled 79530 Self Portraits: each successive image mutates to integrate the previous one at a giddy pace, facial features floating in a distorted, Baconesque world.
Tom White’s Perception Engines project plays with classification systems and idioms of abstraction. His radial, blob-like prints, produced by feeding procedural algorithmic drawings through another algorithm, bring the AI into conversation with itself, a complex mimesis of dialogue that almost approaches what human creativity might look like in the mirror of artificial intelligence. London-based Jake Elwes takes this dialogue further in Closed Loop, a two-channel video from 2017 that distills the circuitry of perception. An indistinct, pastel image, created by training a generative neural network on 14.2 million photographs, appears on one screen while words, similarly drawn from a huge dataset, assemble as a descriptive response on the other. The image then slowly reconfigures to match the language in an exchange that is both intimate and enthralling – and observing it vaguely voyeuristic.

These works push the limits of vision, delineating how we tend to assign meaning to an art object, and bringing into question the possibility of a kind of creative production that can exist outside the human framework, or as an extension of it. Elsewhere, however, ‘Gradient Descent’ gets tangled in the final product and the shock of the machine, with artworks that self-consciously remind us that they were created using AI. Memo Akten’s Deep Meditations (2018) falls into this trap. Using photographs from Flickr and the Google Art Archive, the work is an interesting demonstration of style transfer – where the machine learns the template of one (or in this case, tens of thousands of) images and blends this into a new image – at work, but is a hollow display of AI’s most basic capabilities.
The gallery has valid commercial reasons for this curatorial farrago, with the rapid rise of financial interest in and visibility of AI art over the last couple of years. This autumn, Christie’s will become the first auction house to sell an algorithmic work. IBM and Google have invested millions into labs to explore the creative capabilities of neural networks. Last year, MoMA looked back to the beginnings of machine-made art with the exhibition ‘Thinking Machines: Art and Design in the Computer Age, 1959–1989’, while the Grand Palais in Paris recently concluded its vast, immersive exhibition on ‘Artists & Robots’.

However, this fascination with the final image and the complex functionalities of AI can often make us forget the viewer in the process. As critic Mike Pepi put it in Frieze: ‘Art, after all, is little more than institutionalized agreement among one or more subjects to call something as such […] Its only unifying property, then, are its human subjects.’ How can AI art transcend this agreement, and bring the viewer into its fold in more meaningful ways?
At an exhibition of new media art at the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, located a few kilometres from Nature Morte, I saw two such works that attempted to do exactly this. Sonia Khurana’s imposing House Anatomy (vertical spin) (2014), a stack of screens playing a loop of ant colonies moving in algorithmic patterns. The viewer’s body is brought into sharp contrast with the pictures onscreen, creating an agitated experience of scale. In Nandita Kumar’s Emotive Sounds of the Electric Writer project (2013–15), viewers were invited to write letters that were converted into inkblots, in turn fed through an algorithm that transformed them into a musical score. Kumar’s work thus considers the multisensorial implications of digital and analogue forms of correspondence, keeping the human at the centre of its technology.
AI art is at a precipice, where we are still largely uncertain about its role as tool, medium, or independent creative entity. The acceptance of AI will be contingent on our own dynamic understanding of changing aesthetics in the digital age, of which spectacle may ultimately be an indelible part.

It’s now generally accepted that as artificial intelligence (AI) advances into fields of work that were formerly considered skilled labour, a huge number of manual and white collar jobs are likely to disappear. 
These are the kinds of jobs that require learning and applying patterns, unemotional calculation and mechanistic problem solving. Think: medical diagnosis, legal contracts and engineering.

      AI doctors and engineers are coming – but they won't be stealing high-skill jobs




Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins recently suggested AI will free us up to focus on the caring work uniquely suited to humans.  
Currently much care work is low paid, unpaid or invisible – and mostly done by women. It requires creativity, empathy, relationship building, and emotional and spiritual labour. I argue the advent of AI has the potential to herald a revolution in how care work is valued in society, and ensure this kind of work is spread more evenly across genders. 
Care work underpins our economy
Market democracies may prioritise economic growth, but care is at the core of what makes us human. 
Economists might assume that we are all homo economicus (individuals who maximise rational utility), but we could also be cast as homines curans (humans who care).
Political science professor Joan Tronto describes care as:

a species activity that includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair our “world” so that we can live in it as well as possible. That world includes our bodies, ourselves, and our environment, all of which we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web.

Care is the work that builds and sustains this web. It’s done within families to provide the basic needs of life. It nurtures children, supports the elderly, and supplies the “emotional labour” needed to keep households going. 
But care work also happens in professional life – and not just the care professions of nursing or childcare. 
Administrative tasks that support the collective efforts of university departments are one example. Doing the dishes in the tea room is another. More important is the daily work of building community and mutual support, fostering our being-in-common.

In the home and workplace, it’s care work that attends to the social relations underpinning institutions and organisations, farms and marketplaces, offices and factory floors. Without this largely invisible and unpaid care work, the economy would not function. 
As Yale anthropologist James Ferguson notes: 

the receipt of unconditional and unearned distribution and care must always precede any productive labour.

In other words, care comes first. Without it we wouldn’t be unable to function as organisations, manage our farms, run our factories, or participate in any kind of waged labour.
Robots can’t care
Care work is not well suited to new technologies. It requires empathy.
While AI can mimic human emotions, it’s a long way off from being able to genuinely empathise. Robot empathy is based on deceit: it can make you think it cares in order to shape your emotional responses. For ethicist Rob Sparrow, that also means it’s fundamentally unethical to rely on robots to provide care.
But if AI takes over the task-based and calculative work that people now do, could the essential, largely feminised, work of care begin to be more valued? 
There are some signs this could happen.

The business world is paying more attention to the importance of empathy in the workplace. Research reveals the diversity of contemporary economic practices beyond capitalism, and is showing us how much of our economy is reliant upon putting care first. 
Around the world, examples of community economies – livelihood practices that actively build and sustain communities rather than seeking profit – are changing economic systems. 
In academia and the not-for-profit sector, new organisational structures are being shaped around appreciation for the whole human being, with collaboration not competition as the defining mode of interaction. 
These examples demonstrate the possibility of reconfiguring our economies towards a future where an ethics of care comes first.
Lessons from the global south
As we anticipate a new definition of the uniquely human skills people bring to the workplace, it’s worth drawing on the knowledge of societies that place more value on community networks and interpersonal relationships than western culture does.  
When asked to talk about their livelihoods, gender equity and their aspirations for the future, women and men in the Pacific focus on relationships. What concerns them most is the ability to contribute to community, to share what they have, and for the different contributions of women and men to be given equal value. 
We can learn from this.

As robots and AI “take our jobs”, the care work that underpins all workplaces – and homes, and schools, and communities – ought to come to the fore. This would offer a long overdue corrective for our love affair with the rational, utility-maximising individual – and provide opportunity and motivation for more men to shoulder a greater share of the load.
Realising we are more homines curans than homo economicus gives us a chance to properly value the care work that’s at the heart of our economies.

Proponents suggest that lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWs)  might cause less “collateral damage,” while critics warn that giving machines the power of life and death would be a terrible mistake.Last month’s UN meeting on ‘killer robots’ in Geneva ended with victory for the machines, as a small number of countries blocked progress towards an international ban. Some opponents of such a ban, like Russia and Israel, were to be expected since both nations already have advanced military AI programs. But surprisingly, the U.S. also agreed with them.Picking SidesIn July, 2,400 researchers, including Elon Musk, signed a pledge not to work on robots that can attack without human oversight. Google faced a revolt by employees over an Artificial Intelligence program to help drones spot targets for the Pentagon, and decided not to continue with the work. KAIST, one of South Korea’s top universities, suffered an international academic boycott over its work on military robots until it too stopped work on them. Groups like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots are becoming more visible, and Paul Scharre’s book Army of None, which details the dangers of autonomous weapons, has been hugely successful.But the government’s argument is that any regulation would be premature, hindering new developments which would protect civilians. The Pentagon’s current policy is that there should always be a ‘man in the loop’ controlling any lethal system, but the submission from Washington to the recent UN meeting argued otherwise:“Weapons that do what commanders and operators intend can effectuate their intentions to conduct operations in compliance with the law of war and to minimize harm to civilians.”  So the argument is that autonomous weapons would make more selective strikes that faulty human judgements would have botched.“Most people don’t understand that these systems offer the opportunity to decide when not to fire, even when commanded by a human if it is deemed unethical,” says Professor Ron Arkin, a roboticist at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Arkin suggests that autonomous weapons would be fitted with an “ethical governor” helping to ensure they only strike legitimate targets and avoid ambulances, hospitals, and other invalid targets.Arkin has long argued for regulation rather than prohibition of LAWs. He points out that in modern warfare, precision-guided smart weapons are now seen as essential for avoiding civilian casualties. The use of unguided weapons in populated areas, like the barrel bombs dropped by the Syrian regime, looks like deliberate brutality. Smarter is better, and an autonomous system might just be better than a human one.Robotic VisionThe greatest promise for smarter machines comes from deep learning, an AI technique that feeds massive amounts of sample data to a neural network until it learns to make necessary distinctions. In principle, deep learning might help distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, valid targets and invalid ones. Arkin warns that much more research needs to be conducted before fielding them in lethal systems, but there are already systems which can outmatch humans in recognition tasks.Australian beaches are now guarded by Little Ripper quadcopter drones equipped with an AI system known as SharkSpotter developed by the University of Technology in Sydney. This automatically scans the water for sharks and alerts the human operator when it sees something dangerous. SharkSpotter can identify humans, dolphin, boats, surfboards, rays, and objects in the water and tell them apart from sharks.“The system can detect and identify around sixteen different objects with high accuracy. These advanced machine learning techniques significantly improve aerial detection accuracy to better than 90 percent,“ says UTS researcher Nabin Sharma. This compares to about 20-30 percent for a human operator looking at aerial imagery, though the SharkSpotter’s identification is still checked by a human before raising the alarm. In combat, a drone operator squinting at a screen may struggle to tell whether people on the ground are insurgents with AK-47s or farmers with spades. Arkin says humans have a tendency toward “scenario fulfillment,” or seeing what we expect to see, and ignoring contradictory data in stressful situations. This effect contributed to the accidental shooting down of an Iranian airliner by the USS Vincennes in 1987.“Robots can be developed so that they are not vulnerable to such patterns of behavior,” says Arkin.At the very least, these AI-guided weapons would be better than current ‘smart bombs’ which lack any discrimination. On August 9th a laser-guided bomb from the Saudi coalition struck a bus full of schoolchildren in Yemen, killing forty of them.“Recognition of a school bus could be relatively straightforward to implement if the bus is appropriately marked,” says Arkin. “There is no guarantee it would work under all conditions. But sometimes is better than never.”A Flaw in the MachineNoel Sharkey is professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield and chair of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control. As a leading voice against AI weapons, he remains unconvinced that AI would be an improvement over current weapons technology.""After all of the hype about face recognition technologies, it turns out that they work really badly for women and darker shades of skin,"" says Sharkey. ""And there are many adversarial tests showing how these technologies can be easily gamed or misled.”This was demonstrated in 2017 when some MIT students found a way of fooling an image-recognition system into thinking a plastic turtle was a rifle.Today current artificial intelligence cannot make better battlefield judgements better than humans, but AI is getting smarter, and one day they could theoretically help limit the loss of innocent lives caught in the crossfire.“We cannot simply accept the current status quo with respect to noncombatant deaths,” says Arkin. “We should aim to do better.”Sharkey disagrees that autonomous weapons are the tools that will eliminate collateral damage, referencing a principle known as Marten’s clause. This clause states that ""the human person remains under the protection of the principles of humanity and the dictates of the public conscience.” This means that however well machines work, they should not be  making life-and-death decisions in warfare.“A prohibition treaty is urgently needed before massive international investment goes into LAWs,” says Sharkey. With DARPA announcing a new $2 billion investment in ""next wave"" military AI, time is running out.The  U.S. decision to back the development of ‘killer robots’ is a controversial one, and the argument is far from over. But if LAWs are fielded first, we may find out the hard way which side is right.

A child is presented with a picture of various shapes and is asked to find the big red circle. To come to the answer, she goes through a few steps of reasoning: First, find all the big things; next, find the big things that are red; and finally, pick out the big red thing that’s a circle.
We learn through reason how to interpret the world. So, too, do neural networks. Now a team of researchers from MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Intelligence and Decision Technologies Group has developed a neural network that performs human-like reasoning steps to answer questions about the contents of images. Named the Transparency by Design Network (TbD-net), the model visually renders its thought process as it solves problems, allowing human analysts to interpret its decision-making process. The model performs better than today’s best visual-reasoning neural networks.  
Understanding how a neural network comes to its decisions has been a long-standing challenge for artificial intelligence (AI) researchers. As the neural part of their name suggests, neural networks are brain-inspired AI systems intended to replicate the way that humans learn. They consist of input and output layers, and layers in between that transform the input into the correct output. Some deep neural networks have grown so complex that it’s practically impossible to follow this transformation process. That's why they are referred to as ""black box” systems, with their exact goings-on inside opaque even to the engineers who build them.
With TbD-net, the developers aim to make these inner workings transparent. Transparency is important because it allows humans to interpret an AI's results.
It is important to know, for example, what exactly a neural network used in self-driving cars thinks the difference is between a pedestrian and stop sign, and at what point along its chain of reasoning does it see that difference. These insights allow researchers to teach the neural network to correct any incorrect assumptions. But the TbD-net developers say the best neural networks today lack an effective mechanism for enabling humans to understand their reasoning process.
""Progress on improving performance in visual reasoning has come at the cost of interpretability,” says Ryan Soklaski, who built TbD-net with fellow researchers Arjun Majumdar, David Mascharka, and Philip Tran.
The Lincoln Laboratory group was able to close the gap between performance and interpretability with TbD-net. One key to their system is a collection of ""modules,"" small neural networks that are specialized to perform specific subtasks. When TbD-net is asked a visual reasoning question about an image, it breaks down the question into subtasks and assigns the appropriate module to fulfill its part. Like workers down an assembly line, each module builds off what the module before it has figured out to eventually produce the final, correct answer. As a whole, TbD-net utilizes one AI technique that interprets human language questions and breaks those sentences into subtasks, followed by multiple computer vision AI techniques that interpret the imagery.
Majumdar says: ""Breaking a complex chain of reasoning into a series of smaller subproblems, each of which can be solved independently and composed, is a powerful and intuitive means for reasoning.""
Each module's output is depicted visually in what the group calls an ""attention mask."" The attention mask shows heat-map blobs over objects in the image that the module is identifying as its answer. These visualizations let the human analyst see how a module is interpreting the image.   
Take, for example, the following question posed to TbD-net: “In this image, what color is the large metal cube?"" To answer the question, the first module locates large objects only, producing an attention mask with those large objects highlighted. The next module takes this output and finds which of those objects identified as large by the previous module are also metal. That module's output is sent to the next module, which identifies which of those large, metal objects is also a cube. At last, this output is sent to a module that can determine the color of objects. TbD-net’s final output is “red,” the correct answer to the question. 
When tested, TbD-net achieved results that surpass the best-performing visual reasoning models. The researchers evaluated the model using a visual question-answering dataset consisting of 70,000 training images and 700,000 questions, along with test and validation sets of 15,000 images and 150,000 questions. The initial model achieved 98.7 percent test accuracy on the dataset, which, according to the researchers, far outperforms other neural module network–based approaches.Importantly, the researchers were able to then improve these results because of their model's key advantage — transparency. By looking at the attention masks produced by the modules, they could see where things went wrong and refine the model. The end result was a state-of-the-art performance of 99.1 percent accuracy.
""Our model provides straightforward, interpretable outputs at every stage of the visual reasoning process,” Mascharka says.
Interpretability is especially valuable if deep learning algorithms are to be deployed alongside humans to help tackle complex real-world tasks. To build trust in these systems, users will need the ability to inspect the reasoning process so that they can understand why and how a model could make wrong predictions. 
Paul Metzger, leader of the Intelligence and Decision Technologies Group, says the research “is part of Lincoln Laboratory’s work toward becoming a world leader in applied machine learning research and artificial intelligence that fosters human-machine collaboration.”
The details of this work are described in the paper, “Transparency by Design: Closing the Gap Between Performance and Interpretability in Visual Reasoning,"" which was presented at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) this summer.

DataArtificial IntelligenceInsights What makes functional programming a viable choice for artificial intelligence projects?

By Prasad Ramesh -   September 14, 2018 - 2:00 pm 13555 0 










6 min readThe most common programming languages currently used for AI and machine learning development are Python, R, Scala, Go, among others with the latest addition being Julia. Functional languages as old as Lisp and Haskell were used to implement machine learning algorithms decades ago when AI was an obscure research area of interest. There wasn’t enough hardware and software advancements back them for implementations. Some commonalities in all of the above language options are that they are simple to understand and promote clarity. They use fewer lines of code and lend themselves well to the functional programming paradigm.
What is Functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming approach that uses logical functions or procedures within its programming structure. It means that the programming is done with expressions instead of statements. In a functional programming (FP) approach, computations are treated as evaluations of mathematical functions and it mostly deals with immutable data. In other words, the state of the program does not change, the functions or procedures are fixed and the output value of a function depends solely on the arguments passed to it.
Let’s look at the characteristics of a functional programming approach before we see why they are well suited for developing artificial intelligence programs.
Functional programming features
Before we see functional programming in a machine learning context, let’s look at some of its characteristics.

Immutable: If a variable x is declared and used in the program, the value of the variable is never changed later anywhere in the program. Each time the variable x is called, it will return the same value assigned originally. This makes it pretty straightforward, eliminating the need to think of state change throughout the program.
Referential transparency: This means that an expression or computation always results in the same value in any part/context of the program. A referentially transparent programming language’s programs can be manipulated as algebraic equations.
Lazy evaluation: Being referentially transparent, the computations yield the same result irrespective of when they are performed. This enables to postpone the computation of values until they are required/called. This means one could evaluate them lazily. Lazy evaluation helps avoids unnecessary computations and saves memory.
Parallel programming: Since there is no state change due to immutable variables, the functions in a functional program can work in parallel as instructions. Parallel loops can be easily expressed with good reusability.
Higher-order functions: A higher order function can take one or more functions as arguments. They may also be able to return a function as their result. Higher-order functions are useful for refactoring code and to reduce repetition. The map function found in many programming languages is an example of a higher-order function.

What kind of programming is good for AI development?
Machine learning is a sub-domain of artificial intelligence which deals with concepts of making predictions from data, take actions without being explicitly programmed, recommendation systems and so on. Any programming approach that focuses on logic and mathematical functions is good for artificial intelligence (AI).
Once the data is collected and prepared it is time to build your machine learning model.. This typically entails choosing a model, then training and testing the model with the data. Once the desired accuracy/results are achieved, then the model is deployed. Training on the data requires data to be consistent and the code to be able to communicate directly with the data without much abstraction for least unexpected errors.

For AI programs to work well, the language needs to have a low level implementation for faster communication with the processor. This is why many machine learning libraries are created in C++ to achieve fast performance. OOP with its mutable objects and object creation is better suited for high-level production software development, not very useful in AI programs which works with algorithms and data.
As AI is heavily based on math, languages like Python and R are widely used languages in AI currently. R lies more towards statistical data analysis but does support machine learning and neural network packages. Python being faster for mathematical computations and with support for numerical packages is used more commonly in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Why is functional programming good for artificial intelligence?
There are some benefits of functional programming that make it suitable for AI. It is closely aligned to mathematical thinking, and the expressions are in a format close to mathematical definitions. There are few or no side-effects of using a functional approach to coding, one function does not influence the other unless explicitly passed. This proves to be great for concurrency, parallelization and even debugging.
Less code and more consistency
The functional approach uses fewer lines of code, without sacrificing clarity. More time is spent in thinking out the functions than actually writing the lines of code. But the end result is more productivity with the created functions and easier maintenance since there are fewer lines of code. AI programs consist of lots of matrix multiplications. Functional programming is good at this just like GPUs.
You work with datasets in AI with some algorithms to make changes in the data to get modified data. A function on a value to get a new value is similar to what functional programming does. It is important for the variables/data to remain the same when working through a program. Different algorithms may need to be run on the same data and the values need to be the same. Immutability is well-suited for that kind of job.
Simple approach, fast computations
The characteristics/features of functional programming make it a good approach to be used in artificial intelligence applications. AI can do without objects and classes of an object oriented programming (OOP) approach, it needs fast computations and expects the variables to be the same after computations so that the operations made on the data set are consistent.
Some of the popular functional programming languages are R, Lisp, and Haskell. The latter two are pretty old languages and are not used very commonly. Python can be used as both, functional and object oriented. Currently, Python is the language most commonly used for AI and machine learning because of its simplicity and available libraries. Especially the scikit-learn library provides support for a lot of AI-related projects.
FP is fault tolerant and important for AI
Functional programming features make programs fault tolerant and fast for critical computations and rapid decision making. As of now, there may not be many such applications but think of the future, systems for self-driving cars, security, and defense systems. Any fault in such systems would have serious effects. Immutability makes the system more reliable, lazy evaluation helps conserve memory, parallel programming makes the system faster. The ability to pass a function as an argument saves a lot of time and enables more functionality. These features of functional programming make it a fitting choice for artificial intelligence.
To further understand why use functional programming for machine learning, read the case made for using the functional programming language Haskell for AI in the Haskell Blog.

The intelligence community is using artificial intelligence to help manage the exponential increase of data.

Artificial intelligence is poised to fundamentally alter the way agencies meet their missions, especially so for data-heavy departments like those in the intelligence community.To ensure continuity across the 17 disparate agencies that make up the IC, program managers looking for AI solutions are adhering to the concept of AIM, or Augmenting Intelligence using Machines.“With that, we’re auditing routine functions that analysts, curators, collectors have manually done in the past to free them up to perform more intelligence,” La’Naia Jones, IC deputy chief information officer, said at the annual Tech Trends Conference hosted by the Professional Services Council. “Common sense, right? Sounds much easier than it is.”Jones noted information gathering is part of the mission sets of each IC component, meaning lots of data.“There is no big data analytics without a large amount of data. We need the machines to help us read and understand the data and we need the humans to look at it overall,” she said. “The amount of data is just increasing exponentially.”During a roundtable with reporters, Jones explained the nature of AIM, which a way of thinking, not a technology or program office. But that thought process is essential to the success of any AI initiative, she said.“When you speak of AIM, it’s a concept, it’s a vision, it’s an idea, it’s a way of doing business,” she said. “We’re partnering within the architectural division to leverage the reference architectures so that … whatever they set up is compliant and shareable amongst the other agencies … It’s not a stovepipe solution.”Many agencies and programs are also working with academia, particularly at the local level, Jones said.“In everything we do, we’re always looking at: how can we collaborate, how can we integrate, how can we work together, how can we team?” she said. “How can we better work this problem or these issues together so that way we don’t create the same problems?”During her presentation, Jones offered three examples of how AI is being used within the AIM framework by IC agencies today.At the National Security Agency, AI is being used to augment human language processing. Jones said commercial tools have only come so far, and NSA has unique problems, including complex languages and degraded audio.“NSA has retooled the process to integrate AI across the board,” she said, changing “the way the workflow is performed and to create a continuous training set for the machines.”The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is using AI tools to sort large amounts of imagery and pull out specific targets, such as enemy safehouses and airfields—work that has been done manually by analysts in the past. The new tools enable those analysts to do more of what they’re best at: analyzing data.“We’re moving the analysts from counting things to thinking about it,” Jones said. “Of course, a computer can tell us an airfield is empty but it can’t tell us why.”Jones also offered an example from the National Reconnaissance Office, which is using AI to find the kernels of useful information in the troves of data the agency collects daily.“This is helping to detect activity and automating tasks for expansive collection systems,” she said. “We can assure that most of the data that we collect is in the best interest of our analysts, to provide the best intelligence to the decision-makers.”As with the other IC agencies, NRO’s efforts fall in line with the AIM process, Jones said.“It’s looking at what your mission goals are—what you’re trying to achieve—and then can you use automated intelligence, can you use AIM—this philosophy, this process, this way of doing business—in order to improve that? Can any efficiencies be gained? Can we use that in order to push the envelope further?” Jones said.

Consider some of the latest additions of legal technology:

 	A voice-activated personal assistant such as the RightsNOW App that handles legal research questions. While an interesting and useful tool, it needs to come with tough security.
 	Or the chatbot DoNotPay applicatio. This application was intended to help fight parking tickets, and it has contested over 160,000 tickets across London and New York, for free. DoNotPay now also helps people sue Equifax in small-claims court.
 	Contract Intelligence (COIN), that analyzes documents in seconds allowing for  significant cost savings. COIN replaced hundreds of human lawyer-hours in interpreting commercial loan agreements.

However, artificial intelligence is not new to the legal profession. Many lawyers already implement numerous technologies. For example, predictive coding is often used in e-discovery, and natural language processing is used in legal search. In fact, many legal pundits suggest that an attorney who ignores artificial intelligence (AI) does so at their own peril.

While AI is indeed not new, the latest offerings may come with a twist. New legal tech creates questions and concerns about ethics. Law and ethics rules have not yet caught up with existing technology.

Ethical issues raised by artificial intelligence

Some of the ethical issues faced by attorneys today are:

 	The duties of diligence and competence – Attorneys need to understand how the different technologies work. Lawyers need a working knowledge of what a program does to understand what outcome they can get by using it and what capabilities and limitations the AI tool may have.
 	Duties of supervision – Attorneys working with others on a case have a duty to ensure that work is done competently. This means not solely relying on AI for an accurate outcome. It also means supervising the use of AI.
 	Duties of comprehension  Not everything can or should be done by AI. It is up to the attorney to know what can and cannot be done and act accordingly.
 	Duty of knowing where to draw the line –Drawing a line between automation as a case strategy versus automation being used to augment case management.
 	Duty of knowing how far to use such technology –Utilizing technology correctly and appropriately is key. Law firms need to know when something may prove to be a risk for their firm and/or their clients.
 	Duty to ensure client privilege and confidentiality – Today, AI powered tools are used to share confidences. This needs to raise concerns about the security of hosted data, storage in the cloud and data commingling.
 	Unauthorized practice of law – Legal chatbots powered by AI are at the leading edge of controversy but are proving to be very useful in that they can fight parking tickets, draft privacy policies, advise crime victims or write up a non-disclosure agreement. The user triggers the AI powered chatbot by talking, which then simulates a conversation. This technology, if it is created or maintained by a lawyer is problematically viewed as the unauthorized practice of law.
 	The duty of inclusion and diversity – These two factors are critical for implementing justice. When programming AI may end up being biased because when AI is “trained,” it is trained using human actions and decisions, which are already biased by the person(s) who made the decision.
 	The duty of legal training and education – Attorneys must competently keep up to speed with changes in the law and legal practice matters. This means staying abreast of legal technology. An attorney needs to know what they may expect to come out, or put another way, at least see and understand the risks and benefits of such technology.

In an effort to make headway in changing ethics rules, more than 30 states have added to their Model Rules of Professional Conduct the proviso that “[t]o maintain the requisite knowledge and skill, a lawyer should keep abreast of changes in the law and its practice, including the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology.”

One thing is for sure. No matter what happens when introducing AI to the law, the only way it is going to work is if the human and AI gurus work together. AI is here to stay. Lawyers of the future will need to use AI.",N/A,"Artificial intelligence (AI), a process that mimics certain operations of the human mind, is transforming legal ethics. However, using emerging and

The Future of Collaboration in the Artificial Intelligence Era

The Future of Collaboration in the Artificial Intelligence Era
How humans collaborate with one another has been closely linked to technological progress.
Before the invention of the telephone, we had to be in the same room to communicate in real-time – and prior to the internet, we had to be in the same building to share our designs, new ideas, or other documents.
Collaboration has always been a moving target, and in modern times we shouldn’t be surprised that new technological innovations are again shifting how humans work and coordinate together.

The New Collaboration Cycle
Today’s infographic comes to us from Schneider Electric, and it shows that humans are no longer making things using a linear approach.
Instead, modern collaboration is a cyclical process with no defined start or end points – and it often involves more users and stakeholders, continuous access, and an increasingly decentralized workforce. 
The 24/7 Knowledge Factory
All around the world, the way that teams work together is changing.

Instead of always being centralized at a local level, teams are adding talent from around the world who bring diverse perspectives and new ideas to the table.
The modern organization never sleeps – it has people from different countries, time zones, and cultures all working together to create new designs or products simultaneously.
Collaboration on projects is happening in real-time, at all times of the day, and this has several benefits. It brings together a broader range of skills and perspectives, makes teams more customer-centric, reduces errors and wasted money, and enhances both decision-making and product development cycles.

Working Together is Changing
How are teams collaborating 24/7 in real-time from locations around the world?
VR/AR
Designers, engineers, and other team members can collaborate in parallel, using mixed reality as a common medium. 
Collaborative Intelligence (AI)
Multi-agent, distributed systems where each agent, human or machine, is uniquely positioned, with autonomy to contribute to a problem-solving network.

Advanced Modelling (3D and 4D printing)
Design and manufacturing can be integrated seamlessly, even to customize individual items. 4d printing (fourth dimension: movement) is a new frontier where printed objects adapt to various circumstances.
Crowd-based Collaboration
Design is no longer siloed and can be democratized between different stakeholders. Further, teams can work simultaneously from all over the world.
Computer Supported Collaborative Design (CSCD)
The synchronous sharing of information and interaction with ideas, in an AI-driven, data-intensive environment. Here, problem solving, data and service “agents” support, or replace, labor intensive work and possibly the human traits of intuition and decisi, as well.n making.  

The Next Wave
How humans work together is changing, but also shifting is how humans and AI will collaborate together.
The new technological landscape creates many questions and uncertainties for companies today:

Will new “collaborative” technologies really change how we engage, and innovate with, our colleagues?
Will a hyper-networked, always-engaged global collaborative environment create “too many cooks in the kitchen”?
With more opportunity to get involved in processes, how does the role of the end-customer change?
Will traditional design and implementation switch to being more service-based, as time goes on?

What are generative adversarial networks (GANs) and how do they work? [Video]

By Richard Gall -   September 11, 2018 - 11:51 am 0 6599 




3 min readGenerative adversarial networks, or GANs, are a powerful type of neural network used for unsupervised machine learning. Made up of two competing models which run in competition with one another, GANs are able to capture and copy variations within a dataset.
They’re great for image manipulation and generation, but they can also be deployed for tasks like understanding risk and recovery in healthcare and pharmacology.
GANs are actually pretty new – they were first introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. Goodfellow developed them to tackle some of the issues with similar neural networks, including the Boltzmann machine and autoencoders.
Both the Boltzmann machine and autoencoders use the Markov Decision Chain which has a pretty high computational cost. This efficiency gives engineers significant gains – which you need if you’re working at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.
How do Generative Adversarial Networks work?
Let’s start with a simple analogy. You have a painting – say the Mona Lisa – and we have a master forger who wants to create a duplicate painting. The forger does this by learning how the original painter – Leonardo Da Vinci – produced the painting.
Meanwhile, you have an investigator trying to capture the forger and ‘second guess’ the rules the forger is learning.

To map this onto the architecture of a GAN, the forger is the generator network, which learns the distribution of classes while the investigator is the discriminator network, which learning the boundaries between those classes – the formal ‘shape’ of the dataset.
Applications of GANs
Generative adversarial networks are used for a number of different applications.
One of the best examples is a Google Brain project back in 2016 – researchers used GANs to develop a method of encryption.
This project used 3 neural networks – Alice, Bob, and Eve. Alice’s job was to send an encrypted message to Bob. Bob’s job was to decode that message, while Eve’s job was to intercept it.
To begin with Alice’s messages were easily intercepted by Eve. However, thanks to Eve’s adversarial work, Alice began to develop its own encryption strategy – it took 15,000 runs for Alice to successfully encrypt a message that could be deciphered by Bob that Eve couldn’t intercept.
Elsewhere, GANs are also being used in fields such as drug research. The neural networks can be trained on the existing drugs and suggest new synthetic chemical structures that improve on drugs that already exist.
Generative adversarial networks: the cutting edge of artificial intelligence
As we’ve seen, GANs offer some really exciting opportunities in artificial intelligence. There are two key advantages you need to remember: GANs solve the problem of generating data when you don’t have enough to begin with and they require no human supervision.
This is crucial when you think about the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, both in terms of the efficiency of running the models, and the real-world data we want to use – which could be poor quality or have privacy and confidentiality issues, as much healthcare data does.

                I remember a story about Revenue Canada employees joking about ruining someone’s life. There are also a number of examples of malicious prosecution sitting out there. Maybe a computer isn’t such a bad idea. On the other hand, given the stunning disaster of the federal government payroll software, I shouldn’t be quite so sanguine. Also concerning is the Treasury Board White paper’s note about the transparency of deployment ... 9 months out there and the CBC needs a FOI request to learn about it? So much for transparency.

                @Doug Thomson Regardless, if this is designed to assess the likelihood of a successful litigation, the 1% will be safe again ... they are seldom pursued ... it will be the little fish again. The little fish can’t afford a cadre of $ thousand per hour lawyers to fight their battles, so records will ensure their cases are ready wins for RC.
