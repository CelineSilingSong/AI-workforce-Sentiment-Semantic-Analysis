AI was all the rage dominating last month’s Davos knocking the perennial favorite of blockchain technology off the Promenade and making it look ""very last year."" The conversations focused on “the serious strides in global collaboration on governance and setting the right guardrails.”


This echoed the U.S. Executive Order (E.O.) 14110 on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence in 2023, and U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's message at the global AI Safety Summit 2023 that the “future of AI is safe AI.”

Not a moment too soon for this message, with Nvidea, the leader of the Mag 7, experiencing a 16 percent share price bump following record fourth quarter sales with co-founder and chief executive Jenson Huang commenting, ""Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point, demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.""

PROMOTED
Many are talking about how AI is implemented and how it affects everyday lives, but the message of ""safety first"" does not quite reconcile with the ongoing disruption and upheaval in the jobs market coupled with the investment potential of generative AI.

Recent data from the website Layoffs.fyi which tracks the tech jobs market shows generative AI is even hitting employment levels among the feted tech giants. Around 34,000 jobs have been lost so far this year by companies including Microsoft, Snap, and eBay as they have switched investment into generative AI at the expense of other parts of their business.

A total of 138 tech companies have cut jobs this year, according to Layoffs.fyi, demonstrating how AI, or to be precise, the desire to invest in AI, is disrupting the tech jobs market.
Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek has said, “We need to become more efficient by deprioritizing some of the existing things, but we also need to invest in some of the new.”

Enterprise software company SAP, has announced a “company-wide transformation” including cutting around 8,000 jobs as it increases its focus on AI.
Pitchbook data on investment in startups last year shows AI startups attracted one out of every three dollars invested in the U.S. in 2023 as investors competed to back companies developing AI technology following the stunning debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Venture investors took a bigger slice of a shrinking cake as total investment dropped to $170.6 billion from $242.2 billion in the previous year. OpenAI and Anthropic alone accounted for 10 percent of the total deal value.

Generative AI is very much focused on sectors such as media, marketing and law where ""text"" is an important part of the business.
The brutal verdict from Ken Smythe, founder of Next Round Capital summed it up, “AI names are trading at a premium. Some software names are trading at a premium. Meanwhile, food and grocery delivery and crappy consumer concepts are all trading down 95 percent from their last round.”
AI continues to disrupt in new ways hitting venture capital and startups just as much as traditional tech giants, and to be frank, it looks a pretty volatile experience. Where the AI “safety first” policy of world leaders resonates is in the highly regulated and controlled investment management industry.
AI: The Next Frontier For Investment Management
Consultancy Deloitte is convinced about the disruptive impact of AI on investment management claiming it is the “the next frontier for investment management.”
Research by Ocorian has found that almost all alternative asset fund managers believe AI will be important to the growth of their business over the next five years with 43 percent surveyed believing it will be very important. More than one in three (34 percent) say they have conducted very successful tests of AI in projects within their firms.
The London Stock Exchange says generative AI is a “powerful business changing tool” for investment management identifying five key areas where it will have an impact: legal and consulting, software and IT, research and development, sales and marketing, and manufacturing.
AI can sift through legal documents and support due diligence while it can reshape how software codes are written. It can speed up research and boost social media marketing and draft technical sales collateral. AI models can reorganise the processing of tasks currently carried out manually.
For all the talk, fund managers admit that in the financial services industry is only at the beginning of the AI journey. BNP Paribas has said that while it is “using AI in a number of areas” it is at the same time keeping a close eye on the associated risks”.
Risk, the domain investment managers must master to make money for investors, is the key word to bear in mind and a guide to how the investment management industry is already using AI. Ironically enough, using AI to help better understand the risks and impact that AI will have on (other) industries in order to better risk adjust investments, is an emerging hot topic among risk boffins.
AI Is On The March In A Highly Regulated Industry
AI is on the march in investment management, a highly regulated industry, and along with the use of alternative data such as credit card spending and employment data, such as average salaries and hiring plans, AI is regarded as increasingly key for fund managers to generate higher returns as they look for ways to use data to differentiate themselves in the market.
The scope of AI use cases are also expanding to seek to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs, to handling other aspects of the fund management industry service offering including investor engagement.
AI's biggest use case is in risk management where it can give managers tools to improve compliance and risk management functions while automating data analysis, including external data, to better anticipate major market events and scenarios.
Ocorian’s research with alternative fund managers shows compliance and regulation is regarded as the area most likely to provide a role for use of AI. Survey respondents ranked compliance and regulation first above sales and marketing activity, recruitment, administration, identifying and reviewing investments, and client servicing and reporting, as the functions that AI will have the most impact on over the next five years.
More than nine in ten (92 percent) alternative investment managers are already using AI as part of risk and compliance procedures. Around one in ten (11 percent) started doing so more than two years ago. Over half (55 percent) started two years ago, and 24 percent started between one and two years ago.
Joe French, Managing Director and Head of Financial Crime at Ocorian, says, “The majority of alternative fund managers have already been using AI within their compliance and risk procedures for around two years. When used for the right type of tasks, AI can transform the ability of over-stretched, under-resourced compliance teams.”
His view is backed up by further specialist research Ocorian conducted among compliance and risk professionals. It interviewed senior leaders and senior compliance and risk executives at alternative fund manager firms which collectively manage around $132.25 billion assets under management working across the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Brazil, Singapore, Hong Kong, U.A.E, Turkey, Quatar, and Saudi Arabia.
More than nine out of 10 (92 percent) interviewed indicated they are already making use of AI in their organisations with more than half (55 percent) indicate they started using AI two years ago. Among the few who admit to not using AI around 71 percent plan to do so within six months.
The regulation and compliance professionals working in investment management identified transaction monitoring as the biggest area where AI can be applied while other key areas highlighted were staff filings, communication monitoring, and internal capital and liquidity monitoring.
World Economic Forum Managing Director Jeremy Jurgens, writing about AI after this year’s Davos meeting. said, ""there’s a need for nuance beyond polarized narratives” in respect of the debate about AI.
The nuance for investment management is that AI is already contributing to the development of this highly regulated and controlled industry, but not necessarily in the areas one might first think of.

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses neural networks, deep learning models, complex algorithms, and large and varied training datasets to produce original content based on user input.
The content that generative AI creates includes written text, images, video, audio, music, synthetic data, and computer code, with new use cases and products emerging on a near-daily basis.
Generative AI has recently garnered widespread attention because major breakthroughs in the technology are accelerating and now reaching the general public.
For example, OpenAI’s ChatGPT — which is publicly available in both free and paid versions — can generate grammatically correct and logical text responses that appear to be written by humans, and OpenAI’s DALL-E tool can produce photorealistic images based on user descriptions. Other companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have also developed sophisticated generative AI tools that can produce authentic-looking text, images, or computer code with minimal human intervention or technical know-how.
In this guide, we’ll talk through more of what generative AI actually is and how it works, as well as some practical tips for understanding how it can be used and how your business can benefit from incorporating this technology into your workflows and routines.

How Does Generative AI Work?
Generative AI models work through the training they receive from massive training datasets and neural networks, which teach the models how to reason in ways akin to a human brain. For some of these models, researchers feed enormous volumes of data — words, pictures, music, or other content — into a deep learning system called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. The supervised neural network sifts through the data and uses a system that rewards successes and penalizes errors, mistakes, and failures.
Over time and with frequent fine-tuning and improvements, a generative AI model can learn how to identify and understand complex relationships. Beyond GAN, other common generative AI model training techniques include transformer-based model training and diffusion model training.
Once a model has received its initial training and is released, users may access it in different ways and for different reasons. If it’s an AI chatbot like Gemini or ChatGPT, for example, users may choose to access the tool from their desktop or a mobile app, requiring little to no additional investment or hardware to get started. All they need to do is input their queries, being sure to write clear, natural-language inputs; these tools will generate responses accordingly.
If the customer is more interested in using a foundation model so they can develop or fine-tune their own models and project use cases, they’ll likely need to work with the original vendor’s API keys and documentation. They may also need to invest in GPUs, CPUs, and other high-powered computer hardware and software in order to operate these tools in their own environments.

Historical Evolution & Significance of Generative AI
Artificial intelligence research began to take shape during the 1950s when Alan Turing and other scientists began to explore ways to create computing frameworks that could duplicate human thinking.
By the 1960s, so-called Markov models began to appear. These probability-based algorithms could generate speech or text based on basic mathematical models, though with limited success. By the 1990s, more sophisticated AI technologies and foundational tools were appearing, including early AI chatbots and the first recurrent neural network architecture.
In the 2010s and 2020s, the development of transformer-based architecture, GPUs, and advances in deep learning have ushered in far more advanced AI. Today, recurrent neural networks can generate content in a way that approximates — and in some cases exceeds — the output of human artists, musicians, and writers.
At this point, artificial intelligence and generative AI are fundamentally reshaping the way people and businesses act, interact, and process information. Whether they’re simply experimenting with free generative AI chatbots or they’re fine-tuning and embedding complex generative AI tools in their enterprise environments, a significant number of business professionals and casual users alike have begun to use generative AI tools in their daily lives. As these tools continue to mature, their benefits expand into areas like pharmaceuticals and drug discovery, healthcare and diagnostics, and generative AI cybersecurity protections.

Generative AI vs. AI
In essence, generative AI is a narrow type and application of the broader artificial intelligence umbrella of technologies.
Generative AI technology is specifically designed and trained to generate new content. In contrast, AI as a whole encompasses a wide range of use cases and applications, including robotic process automation, AI-supplemented cybersecurity, sentiment analysis, predictive maintenance, image recognition, and chatbots with either predetermined or generative responses.
Both of these AI technology types can effectively support human users with a variety of tasks and goals, yet at this time, both types of technology are not mature, consistent, or autonomous enough to stand in for humans.

5 Key Generative AI Techniques & Models
The best generative AI techniques and models all depend on what you’re trying to accomplish and if you’re planning to train your own models from scratch or fine-tune an out-of-the-box solution. Learn more about some of the model architectures and related training techniques:

Transformer-based model training: Through a combination of attention mechanisms — which allow models to analyze data all at once rather than sequentially — and encoders and decoders, generative models are trained to create logical, original content in the style of training data. This type of model training is most commonly used for text and code generation models. Model example: Gemini (formerly Bard).
Variational autoencoder (VAE) training: Input data is sent to a latent space (latent variable generative model training) where the model can more easily learn how to accurately depict images and audio. Model example: Certain iterations of DALL-E.
Autoregressive model training: Trained to sequentially predict the most logical next segment of data. This type of model training is most commonly used for coding and developer use cases. Model example: GitHub Copilot.
GAN model training: Two different generative AI models compete to generate the most accurate data and outputs; their ongoing competition trains them both to produce better data over time. Model example: Artbreeder.
Diffusion model training: A type of latent variable generative model, diffusion model training involves diffusing original data with noise and slowly removing it to create new data that closely resembles the old data. Model example: Stable Diffusion XL.

3 Real-World Generative AI Use-Case Examples
Generative AI can be used for much more than simple text generation and Q&A. In business contexts, users are beginning to take advantage of generative AI capabilities for these use generative AI cases and many more:
Advanced Data Analytics & Recommendations
Rather than simply providing predictive and prescriptive analytics results, generative AI data analytics solutions can pull data from more locations and provide smart explanations and recommendations for how to improve these numbers in the future. Marketing, sales, e-commerce, and product development teams are using this type of tool to help them brainstorm new solutions for better customer engagement.
Video & Image Generation
AI image and video generators are popping up all over the place and are being used for everything from just-for-fun creative projects to social media posts to video game graphics. With intelligent editing tools, natural-language-driven content creation, AI avatars, and voice synthesis, these modern media creation tools make art and video projects more accessible to more users.
Compare two of the leading image generation solutions: Midjourney vs. DALL-E: Best AI Image Generator
Coding & App Development
Several generative AI platforms have been developed with the needs of advanced and novice developers in mind. These tools allow users to create new code through natural language requests. Similarly, they can troubleshoot existing code, automate code completions, and receive recommendations for how to further optimize their coding projects, all through chat and natural language interfaces.
5 Benefits of Generative AI
When it’s used thoughtfully and with clear goals in mind, generative AI offers users a range of unique benefits, including the following:
Operational Efficiencies
Generative AI assistants and copilots are great at assisting users with routine tasks that can take up a lot of time. Some of the work that AI can now help with includes taking and summarizing meeting notes, updating content in documents and spreadsheets, and sifting through emails to determine which ones are most urgent. With AI handling some of these types of tasks, employees have more time to focus on more strategic tasks for the business.

Accessible Tools for Brainstorming
If you’re feeling stuck on a project or are a solopreneur who needs someone to bounce ideas off of, several generative AI tools are up to the task. Inflection’s Pi, for example, is a capable conversational AI agent that does a good job of handling contextualized, back-and-forth conversations. While it won’t be the best solution for artists who want to talk about or work through their projects, text-based queries work well here.
Scalable Content Generation
When generative AI chatbots and models are given clear instructions for content generation, the initial drafts they produce are often close to human quality and take a fraction of the time.
For example, ChatGPT can draft a 2,000-word article on a complex topic — even including relevant headers — in less than a minute.
These tools can be used to generate different kinds and quantities of content as well. For instance, if you are experiencing a creative block as a social media manager, with just a few pieces of information fed into a generative AI tool, you can generate dozens of social media caption options to help you move forward.

In-depth Data Analytics & Recommendations
Generative AI data analytics tools go beyond other data tools’ features, offering intelligent recommendations for how to improve data in future iterations. These analyses can happen in real time, so users can quickly pivot their marketing or sales strategies if AI detects issues with their current strategies.
Coding & Product Development Support
Whether you’re a new developer or an experienced coder looking to work through complex problems, generative AI tools are quickly becoming accurate coders, especially for code completion and quality assurance tasks. This can also be incredibly helpful for product and app development when scalable, repeatable code production on a timeline can be difficult for human task forces.

Some Limitations of Generative AI
While generative AI can complete many tasks similarly to how a human would do them, these tools still have limitations that can impact your results and possible projects:

AI hallucinations: Because of how generative AI models are trained, they may occasionally give a completely false or bizarre answer to user queries with the utmost confidence – these are known as AI hallucinations. It’s important to fact-check AI content, especially if it sounds strange.
No independent thinking capabilities: Generative AI tools are not autonomous thinkers, though their responses sometimes sound like they’re coming from a human. They are incapable of original thoughts — all content they generate is based on the training data and algorithms running in the background.
Little historic data storage and retrieval: While some generative AI tools store conversational history for a limited time, many do not store historic data in a way that users can easily access. As such, it’s difficult for users to continue or recall past conversations with AIs as they might do with a friend.
Limited cybersecurity and data security protections: Some generative AI tools have basic security and compliance features built in, but most will not have the enterprise-level data security protections that users require. These users will need to invest in third-party, comprehensive cybersecurity solutions for the best possible results.
Biased training data: Generative AI tools are only as good as the datasets and algorithms that train them. If data is sourced in an incomplete, inaccurate, or unethical manner, the resulting content generated by the tool may reflect those biases and errors.
Rare citations and sourcing information: Generative AI isn’t the most reliable way to go about serious research, especially since most of these tools do not mention any specific citations or references when stating a fact.
Lack of real-time data: Though this is changing quickly with tools like Google’s Gemini, most generative AI tools are not connected to the internet or other real-time data sources. This means that the answers they provide may not take into account recent, relevant events.

Top 8 Best Practices for Generative AI
The following generative AI best practices can benefit both business leaders and individual users of this type of technology:

Set policies: Set an AI policy that details AI governance, AI ethics, and usage rules for your organization.
Ensure standards: Protect and determine standards for your data proactively.
Staff training: Train employees and any other users on generative AI tools and how and when to use them.
Stay aware of regulations: Pay attention to industry-specific, regional, national, and international regulations and compliance laws, especially as these rules evolve around AI technology.
Monitor content: Quality-check generated content against reliable sources to ensure accuracy.
Select partners carefully: Partner with ethical AI technology providers that transparently discuss how they train their models and source their data.
Evaluate models: If you choose to develop your own models, establish a process for periodically evaluating model performance; ideally, add a peer review component so all users can share feedback if something is amiss.
Specific prompts: Be specific when prompting for the best possible outcomes.

Risks & Ethical Considerations for Generative AI
Not surprisingly, the rise of Generative AI has unleashed concerns, especially in the ways that it can effectively mimic the work and conversations of humans. Learn more about some of the possible risks of generative AI and ethical concerns that come with the rise of generative AI:
Inaccuracies & Hallucinations
For reasons mostly unknown at this time, the complex training that generative AI tools receive can occasionally cause them to hallucinate, or produce wildly inaccurate (and sometimes offensive) content.
AI-generated content requires human review because it isn’t always complete or accurate, even if it sounds fairly logical. Blindly plugging in text generated from an AI tool into your projects could lead to a variety of problems, ranging from accusations of bias to legal issues related to plagiarism.
Deepfakes & Misinformation
Generative AI tools for images, videos, and audio synthesis are being used to create more believable deepfakes, or digital media that convincingly mimics an actual person to their detriment. With the maturity and believability of this technology, deepfakes and similar generative AI products have been used to falsely incriminate world leaders, create explicit and offensive imagery of celebrities, and more.
Legal Issues & Plagiarism 
Businesses must be cautious about the types of music, images, and other materials they use when derived from generative AI. Because these models are often trained on data or actual content produced by writers, musicians, and painters, this usage can raise questions about ownership, control, and copyright.
For this reason, generating a photorealistic image that’s similar to the specific style of an artist could raise questions or even lead to a lawsuit or public backlash. There are also growing concerns about AI-enabled plagiarism in academic settings.
Privacy & Security
AI privacy Issues and AI cybersecurity concerns are at the forefront of generative AI. Some data that’s used to train generative AI models may inadvertently contain private data or information that could be exposed at a later date. This danger may come in the form of a model’s initial training data or in the data it collects from user queries and submissions.
Equally concerning: cybergangs and other criminals have already begun to use generative AI to produce highly convincing documents, software, and images that become part of social engineering campaigns.
Societal & Environmental Impact 
The overall impact of generative AI on the workforce and society at large is prompting serious discussion. Some observers, such as New York Times technology columnist Kevin Roose, have raised concerns about the technology being used to manipulate humans in harmful and destructive ways. In addition, critics have voiced concerns about the technology carrying out its own dangerous acts if it achieves higher levels of autonomy.
Currently, there are many concerns about the processing power and requirements to produce this type of technology as well; some AI companies are coming forward with greener production methods, but at this time, there’s little regulation for this industry that is already harming the environment at scale.

Top 3 Generative AI Tech Providers
While many generative AI leaders, including AWS and IBM, have come to the fore in recent months and years, these three are the clear front runners today:

OpenAI: A startup that has blossomed into a multi-billion-dollar empire, OpenAI is the force behind GPT-4, ChatGPT, DALL-E 3, and several other content generation tools. Its focus areas include text, image, and code generation.
Microsoft: Long a leader in the business and enterprise technology space, Microsoft has quickly made a name for itself in generative AI, especially through its strategic and close partnership with OpenAI. Its Copilot technologies, including Copilot for Microsoft 365, provide intelligence AI assistance to users across a variety of workplace tasks.
Google: Google (Alphabet) was one of the earliest generative AI technology pioneers with its 2017 paper that established the basis for modern transformer-based architecture. Today, it offers users access to a tool called Gemini, a direct ChatGPT competitor that can supplement its responses with real-time data and images from the internet.

Beyond these larger enterprises, many other companies and early startups are creating interesting generative AI solutions.

The Future of Generative AI
While nobody can predict the exact trajectory of generative AI, it’s already clear it will profoundly impact businesses and society at large. As the technology advances, its capabilities and relevant industry use cases continue to expand. Nowhere is this more evident than in the pharmaceutical drug discovery and medical diagnostics companies that are releasing new solutions and use cases regularly.
Years from now, it’s possible that generative AI will produce better final drafts than professional writers and generate better art and design projects than professional human artists and graphic designers. In many ways, we may see generative AI take over jobs in both creative and industrial fields that were previously handled by human workers. However, we’ll likely see the creation of new jobs as well, especially for work like AI quality assurance, training, and testing.

Determine your goals and hopeful outcomes for AI usage: Before investing in expensive tools and possible hardware and software to get started, first decide what kind of generative AI your organization wants and when, how, and why it will be used. This will help you narrow your search to the most useful tooling options.
Research available tools and AI vendors: Your search should focus on the reputation of vendors and tools, the relevance of tools to your organizational goals, and how well prospective tools align with your compliance and ethical requirements.
Select AI model(s) that work for your organization: Now it’s time to select a model that will align with your goals as an organization. Beyond focusing on models from reputable AI vendors, you’ll also want to consider your unique requirements, like budget and the level of technical skill within your workforce to use these kinds of tools.
Determine how to integrate AI with your current tool stack: Though you can still get a lot out of standalone generative AI solutions, businesses will be able to do more with their data and projects if they select a model that integrates directly with their most-used applications, documents, and other company resources. Many AI vendors offer accessible API keys, plugins, and other integration options to help you unify your tech stack with AI.
Develop an AI usage and governance policy for your organization: To make sure everyone is on the same page about how AI should be used within the organization, create a comprehensive policy and distribute it throughout your workforce. This policy should detail any roles or responsibilities, how to use data in a way that complies with relevant regulations, and more.
Train and provide resources to all users for appropriate AI usage: Simply handing a policy to your employees is not enough to enforce proper AI use. That’s why it’s a good idea to train relevant stakeholders on how they can use AI to make their workflows more efficient and effective.

Dive Brief:

Job seekers hitting the market with generative AI skills command an average salary boost of 47% compared to competitors without them, according to an Indeed report published Wednesday. The company reviewed job posting salary data on its platform.
Technology workers who are competent in generative AI can expect average salaries of up to $174,727, according to the company’s analysis.
Generative AI sits alongside other key skills earning job seekers a salary premium including deep learning, computer vision and knowledge of specific software languages and frameworks such as Rust or PyTorch.





















Dive Insight:
The job market fluctuations of 2023 are giving way to more stability this year, as enterprises resume once-deferred projects and spin up AI implementations. Job seekers with tech chops benefit from these efforts amid a shortage of specialized talent.
Data scientists, machine learning engineers and software engineers are some of the roles that require these sought-after skills.
″Half of the highest-paid skills in tech are AI-specific, which suggests that job seekers with AI skills can stand out in a competitive job market, and potentially earn more than their counterparts,” the company said in the report.
Employers across sectors of the economy had nearly 400,000 active tech job postings in January, an uptick of nearly 34,000 from the previous month, according to CompTIA data. 
The scarcity of AI-related tech skills available in the market is causing a rift between talent demand and supply, said Brian Jackson, research director at Info-Tech Research Group.
“The number of data scientists available on the market, people with that real mathematical level understanding of how to model data, and bring in data warehouses… that’s a big talent shortage,” Jackson said.
Enterprise leaders can address the talent gap through upskilling and training opportunities. Despite interest in these opportunities, less than 1 in 4 developers say their employers provide time for upskilling or learning AI skills, according to a HackerRank survey.

Many Australians remain skeptical about the effects of generative AI on their careers.A significant gap in areas like generative AI and cybersecurity poses challenges for employers and employees alike.Australian businesses and the workforce must adapt to the evolving digital landscape through strategic training and the development of new skills.Generative AI’s marketing narrative has caught everyone’s attention, heralding a new era where it reshapes business strategies, particularly in learning and development. This comes at a critical juncture, where acquiring digital skills is beneficial and essential for businesses and their workforce. However, a recent study has highlighted a surprising trend: many Australians seem to underestimate the impact this technology could have on their professional lives.A collaborative study conducted by RMIT Online and Deloitte Access Economics has shed light on an alarming gap in Australians’ understanding of generative AI’s potential to disrupt existing job roles. This lack of awareness is especially concerning, given the rapid pace of digital transformation across industries.The skills gap in digital competencies among both employers and employees is becoming increasingly apparent. Employers have noted a particular shortage in digital skills within their organizations, with a significant emphasis on generative AI, machine learning, data science, coding, and cybersecurity. This scarcity has led businesses to offer a considerable premium for these in-demand skills. Meanwhile, employees have acknowledged an even more acute shortage of digital skills, exacerbating fears about future job security in the face of emerging technologies.IS USING GENERATIVE AI AT WORK CHEATING?Muhammad Zulhusni | 23 February, 2024  Generative AI in the workplace: Use and relevanceThis growing demand for digital skills underscores the urgency with which the Australian economy needs to address these skill shortages. Reports by Deloitte and the Australian Computer Society (ACS) project that an additional 1.3 million digital skills will be required by 2030 to keep pace with AI and data analytics advancements. This necessity is mirrored in the workforce’s sentiment, where most recognize the looming integration of technologies like generative AI into their daily tasks.Despite the clear trajectory towards a more digitally integrated workplace, nearly half of the employees surveyed admit to having never used generative AI in their current roles, often citing its perceived irrelevance to their work. This viewpoint starkly contrasts with studies indicating that most occupations will eventually interact with these technologies. Employees do recognize the importance of digital literacy for their future success, although they underestimate the value of specific skills like data science and analytics.The report reiterates the disconnect between employees’ current use of generative AI and their understanding of its relevance, despite widespread indications of its impending impact across various occupations. Furthermore, Deloitte’s research reveals that a mere fraction of Australian businesses feel fully equipped to adopt and utilize AI technologies effectively.With digital skills in high demand, businesses are prepared to offer premiums for candidates proficient in data and digital competencies. This readiness highlights the critical skill gap in the Australian workforce, further magnified by the advent of AI and other pivotal technologies. RMIT Online’s CEO, Nic Cola, stresses the importance of proactive reskilling and upskilling to navigate the challenges posed by these technological shifts.Echoing the need for a swift response to the evolving digital landscape, John O’Mahony of Deloitte Access Economics points out the unique advantages of generative AI in enhancing traditional learning and development. Its capability to produce customized content can significantly boost employee learning efficiency and knowledge retention.Facing the future: The urgent need for strategic workforce developmentDespite these insights, many employers have yet to introduce generative AI training within their organizations, underscoring a broader unawareness or hesitancy towards embracing these technologies. This reluctance occurs even as specific industries are poised for rapid and profound changes due to this revolutionary technology, emphasizing the critical need for a strategic approach to workforce development in the face of digital transformation.Generative AI stands out from prior technological advancements with its ability to process vast amounts of unstructured data, eliminating a significant hurdle for business adoption. Its capability to generate new, multimodal content from straightforward user prompts opens up intelligence use to a wider audience, without requiring a background in computer science.Currently, a mere 5% of Australian businesses are completely ready to integrate and utilize AI in their workflows. However, a substantial portion of the workforce and student body—32% of employees and 58% of students—already engage with generative AI, pushing its adoption across various sectors.The main economic advantage of generative AI lies in its ability to enhance productivity by automating mundane and labor-intensive tasks. According to Deloitte’s survey on generative AI, regular users of these tools can save an average of 5.3 hours weekly. Those equipped with the skills to effectively employ the technology are at the forefront of these productivity improvements, with 59% of employees planning to enhance their generative AI skills within the following year.HERE’S HOW ENTERPRISES COULD EMBRACE GENERATIVE AI AND CLOUD TECH IN 2024Dashveenjit Kaur | 9 November, 2023Towards a generative AI-ready Australia: Bridging the training gapHowever, there’s a noticeable disparity between employees’ enthusiasm to learn about generative AI and businesses’ investment in training and adopting these tools. 78% of companies surveyed have not offered generative AI training, or are unaware of such initiatives within their organizations. Additionally, 17% do not foresee providing training on generative AI at any point.This gap in training exacerbates potential risks associated with generative AI, such as data breaches, inaccuracies, and copyright issues, with 53% of employees expressing concerns over privacy when using the technology in their roles.Nevertheless, investment in AI by Australian companies is expected to surge to AU$27.5 billion by 2030, a seven-fold increase. This investment aims to maximize generative AI’s benefits by training employees on tailored models that securely and responsibly incorporate the company’s data. It also seeks to enhance workplace training and experiences through AI, thereby attracting and retaining employees adept in generative AI technologies.Generative AI’s impact on skill demand varies across roles and industries, depending on how it’s applied. For instance, generative AI could affect 98% of sales tasks but only 3% of finance-related tasks in the retail industry. In cases where generative AI augments tasks rather than fully automating them, employees with basic technical skills, like coding and prompt design, can significantly benefit.Five key industries—financial services, ICT and media, professional services, education, and wholesale trade—are poised for rapid and transformative changes due to generative AI, representing 26% of the Australian economy or nearly AU$600 billion in economic activity.Although coding has been a highly sought-after skill in Australia for the past decade, the rise of no-code generative AI tools is making programming skills more accessible to the broader workforce. This shift underscores the growing importance of soft skills, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication, alongside technical abilities.Top five in-demand skills for professionals from January to July 2023 (Source – RMIT Online)Generative AI is also expected to generate new job roles, especially in managing customized AI models, necessitating specialized data skills. The demand for professionals capable of designing AI models, monitoring outputs, and ensuring training data is diverse and balanced is set to rise sharply. Projections from Deloitte and the ACS anticipate a 179% increase in demand for advanced data analytics skills and a 268% surge in high-performance computing skills by 2030.

Generative AI exploded into the public consciousness at the end of 2022 with the release of ChatGPT, but by that point it was already causing problems for artists and illustrators. They only gotten worse as the AI hype took off over the past year.You’ve probably heard the story by now: AI companies indiscriminately took a ton of copyrighted material off the web without anyone’s permission, trained models on all that data, then acted like they weren’t to blame when people started using image generators like DALL-E and Midjourney to create works in the same style as artists whose work had been stolen to train them. But there’s another piece to that: it isn’t just an insult to those artists; it’s actively taking work away from them.To learn more about the impact these AI tools have had on artists and how people in the profession are fighting back, I spoke to award-winning concept artist Karla Ortiz. She not only has an impressive resume that spans mediums and includes work with companies like Marvel, Ubisoft, and Wizards of the Coast, but she’s been at the forefront of the campaign against generative AI. Ortiz was one of three names on the first class action lawsuit launched against AI image generators back in January 2023 and her activism hasn’t stopped there.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Generative AI and AI-generated media have been in the news a lot for the past year or so. When did you come across these tools and when did you start to realize they would become an important issue for illustrators and concept artists like yourself?I became aware of generative AI around April 2020. I came across a website called Weird Wonderful AI and it was promoting this thing called Disco Diffusion and it had something called the Artist Studies. In those Artist Studies, I saw the names of so many of my peers, people that I knew personally, and one of the things that really blew my mind was that there were some similarities to their work. I thought at first it must be some kind of university thing and I wanted to know more about it, so I reached out to some of the actual artists that are on this list, and to my shock, they didn’t know what I was talking about.This place had studied those artists without the artists even knowing about it. So we looked into who was making these and we found out they were also selling merchandise that suspiciously looked just like the studies they were doing — mugs, NFTs, you name it. The folks that were on these studies were like, “Hey, listen, we reached out to them.” We were like, “Hey, can you take their name down? They didn’t want to be a part of this.” But these folks straight up ghosted us. That was my first introduction to generative AI.Fast forward to August and September of 2022, when Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion were really blowing up, and because the first interaction had left such a bad taste in my mouth, I was like, “Okay, let me research these guys and see what’s up.” What I found was disturbing. Basically these models had been trained on almost the entirety of my work, almost the entirety of the work of my peers, and almost every single artist that I knew. I spent various afternoons being like, “What about this artist? There they are in the dataset. What about that artist? There they are in the dataset.” To add insult to injury, these companies were letting users and in some cases encouraging users to use our full names and our reputations to make media that looked like ours to then immediately compete with us in our own markets.The thing that a lot of people don’t know is that like artists like myself were already feeling the effects of this in our industry back in August 2022. Rumors started to pop up that people had lost jobs, and then rumors became anecdotal quotes where it’s like, “Yes, I actually lost this.” I knew of students who had lost their internships because companies decided to use generative AI. That took various forms in the entertainment industry, in music, in illustration. Even that same winter of 2022, the San Francisco Ballet did a whole marketing campaign for The Nutcracker — which is huge — and it was completely generated via Midjourney. But that’s someone’s job. That’s high profile. That could have gone to a photographer or an illustrator.Can you tell us what goes into being a concept artist and what the response of your profession has been?A concept artist essentially solves visual problems for a production or a client. It starts with a description from the books, and then eventually a description from the script. From there on, rather than give that to VFX or to costume and spend a lot of money to build these things to then find out they’re going in the completely wrong direction, you start with either a drawing or a painting. That’s literally it. That’s the job. So basically, I’m there to problem solve for a director or a production what something could look like. That could be for characters, clothing, creatures, or environments. All of these things require paintings. We’re often some of the first people in pre-production and, more often than not, we usually push the look of a full picture, sometimes even doing something called keyframes, which are actual moments in the film. We’re kind of like the unsung heroes for a lot of moviemaking because the work influences all other departments.So that’s our role, but you can see how that role of providing imagery to solve a visual problem from text to image becomes immediately at risk from tools or models that explicitly do that. For those models to explicitly do that while utilizing the names of people who work in these industries is especially egregious.I’m a board member of the Concept Art Association, which is this wonderful little association, and I brought the concerns to them. Immediately, the Concept Art Association wanted to do a town hall. I think it was like early September 2022. We didn’t know much about it, but I did get to bring in a machine learning expert, in this case Abhishek Gupta from the Montreal AI Ethics Institute, and I just had a conversation with him where I’m like, “Here’s all the information I gathered. Is this bad? Is this okay?” And he was horrified. He didn’t know how bad the training data was for these models, how exploitative they were, and the actions the companies were allowing the users to engage in. That’s been the case with many other machine learning experts that we’ve spoken to. That gave us the motivation to be like, “It’s not us being upset without knowing the details. Now we know the details. Now we know how this works. This is bullshit.”“The act of writing is not typing”An interview with John Lopez about AI and the writers’ strikeDisconnectParis MarxFrom there, my path branched out in many different ways. On one end, I helped the Concept Art Association elevate their efforts. They focus on legislation, so they’ve been hitting DC, they’ve been hitting government officials. The other branch that I took was the litigation side. I became one of the first three plaintiffs on a class action lawsuit. At the time, it was against DeviantArt, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. Runway ML was added to it as well. While also still trying to make a living, this thing has become my part-time job.In October, I went to an artist convention called Lightbox, and one of the things that got to me was veterans in this industry basically said what I knew to be true, because I myself had gone through a project like this, that pitch work is dead. Pitch work is basically when a director, writer, producer, or any combination of those get together with an artist and say, “We want to pitch to studios and we need imagery.” All of that has now been given to generative AI. I was part of a pitch work production. I was working closely with the director. It was going awesome. This was during the height of the of the strikes, so it would have been welcome work. But as soon as I gave my quote — gone. They totally disappeared, and their entire pitch deck was already full of generative AI from Midjourney. So many people are saying, “Who cares if I can’t copyright this? Who cares if this is exploitative? Who cares if this is replacing the people I’ve worked with for decades? I’m still going to use it.” It’s pretty bad.Can you talk a bit more about the risk that generative AI poses to artists like yourself and how you’re already seeing it change the work of illustrators?For starters, people just aren’t working as much as they were before. I especially worry for people who are starting in their careers. The bigger companies, the ones who have access to big legal teams, they’re not touching this because they know this is a fucking mess. But that doesn’t mean that their outsourcers are following those guidelines or their marketing teams are following those guidelines. But they’re not touching it. It’s a lot of the middle or sometimes even smaller companies that don’t have access to those legal teams that are implementing generative AI right away and that means a lot of artists have been laid off or have had their duties slashed in half.For example, I’m a contractor. I’ve been part of three different productions that have utilized generative AI at some capacity — and they’re big, so there goes my theory. But the problem is that I charge by the hour and whenever generative AI was utilized, it was utilized to slash those hours. They’ll say, “Here’s what you did and here’s what this model did,” side by side to the director. I can show maybe six or seven images tops, while the thing showed a hundred images. Regardless of whether it was chosen or not, that took time away from me, from the art team, and from all the other contractors to take the time to develop new visuals. That already diminished our roles and our earnings.Then you have, again, a lot of students that are transitioning from student to professional and they rely on a lot of the smaller jobs as well. But those are the ones that are most likely using generative AI right now. Recently I was looking at like Global Game Jam, which is a world-renowned game jam that is usually a great start for artists. They’re being sponsored by Leonardo AI, which is entirely fueled by Stable Diffusion. They’re saying to generate assets on it and that completely cuts the ability for new artists to get their foot in the door.There’s a bit of a creative working ecosystem where there are natural cycles to someone getting their start to then having enough experience to gain a higher level in their career and make a living out of it. All of those doors are now starting to close because of generative AI. With the works that generative AI makes, the metric isn’t whether something is artistic or has quality, because if that were the case then people would win. The metric is the market itself. When you have a team trying to slash costs who say, “I could hire this artist full time, that’s a whole year’s worth of salary, or I could just pay a little subscription fee,” they’re going to go for the model.Veterans who should be respected for the incredible contributions to our industry have been approached by high-profile production houses being like, “Can you paint over this Midjourney image? Oh, and we’ll pay you half.” That’s happening right now. At least in film, there’s at least some good pay a person can make a living off, and that’s now being lowered. And it’s going so much faster than any of us ever imagined. There’s a lot of angst and depression, even among actual professionals who are like, “I’ve given my whole life to this. It’s a lifetime of work.” And then for some company to say, “That lifetime of work, that dedication, it’s now mine. We’re gonna compete against you, we’re gonna make insane amounts of money off your work, and you don’t have to have a say.” That’s fucking a lot of people up. It’s a really tough time.I can only imagine. You talked about how you’ve been involved in a lot of organizing around generative AI and even litigation against some of these companies. Can you tell me a bit more about the work you’ve been doing and the impacts that you’ve seen from it?I’ve come to realize my coping mechanism is action. I’ve been so lucky that so many wonderful people have also been working extremely hard and have acted. There’s been a sense of solidarity and organizing from artists in a way that I haven’t seen in a really long time. Artists in particular, we’re uniquely at risk in ways that other creative endeavors aren’t. A lot of us are contractors, we don’t have a clear union. For concept artists in particular, our unions are split in two. We’re between the Art Directors Guild and the Costume Designers Guild. Oftentimes we’re in the same union as our bosses, and some of those bosses really want to use generative AI. The unions are trying to work that out, and I hope they do. But the majority of us are contract and we don’t have the same protections that the recording industry might have or SAG-AFTRA might have or the Writers Guild might have that.Because of that lack of protections, we’ve banded together and advocated for ourselves in a way that has been very inspiring and very hopeful. Last year, the Concept Art Association said, “We need to be in DC because we have to have a voice.” And we’re like, “Let’s just do the same thing that other companies do. Let’s hire a lobbyist. Let’s hire someone who has the connections.” So we did a fundraiser and 5,000 people from all around the globe gave them enough to be able to fund a full year of lobbying; a full year of action, a full year of events. Because of that I got to go to the Senate and I got to testify. I got to be in the same room as the Stable Diffusions and the Adobes. I was definitely the poorest person there because next to me was the top lawyer from the recording industry, the policy person for Stability, and the top lawyer for Adobe. But it was impactful. I got to tell the senators exactly what had happened and exactly how we were affected. Between that and a lot of different conversations behind the scenes with congressmen, staffers, regulatory agencies, and so on, that little organization has made a huge splash.Generative AI closes off a better futureUrsula Le Guin said we must be able to imagine freedom. AI traps us in the past.DisconnectParis MarxThere’s a continued push to form alliances between artists groups and artists coalitions. There’s the Human Artistry Campaign, a coalition of 140 different artist groups. Trying to tell everybody it’s not enough to just get your creative sector safe, we’re in this together, that’s been interesting. I’m tired, I really just want to paint all day. But again, it’s existential. I’m very happy to know I’m not the only one. I hope that’s enough to make some solid changes.In terms of those changes, what do you think is going to be necessary to rein in these companies and these tools? Do you think regulation is necessary? Do you think litigation will deliver that? And is there anything the public can do to help move that cause forward?It’s not a “one solution,” it’s an “all solutions” type of situation. We need legislation. We need regulation. We need litigation. We need education. We need public relations. We need the public to be like, “No, I will not support your product if it contains generative AI because it’s an exploitative technology that is meant to replace the same people who’ve worked on the things that we’ve loved for so long.” Eventually it’s coming for anyone whose work will be digitized.In terms of litigation, we need the courts to look at this and say, “This kind of exploitative practice of indiscriminately grabbing whatever data we can see on the internet and say, ‘Oh, it’s publicly available, so I could profit from it’ — even if that data is copyrighted, biometric, private. That’s not okay.” Companies should not be able to get away with this, and I feel like the court should be unanimous in that decision and say, “It’s not okay to train models off the work of people who do not want to be part of it and who were never even asked.” We also need relief and payment from all these companies who made all this profit on the back of artists and the back of people that didn’t even want to be a part of it. Those companies need to pay these people.In terms of regulation, we need so much action and we need it yesterday. There’s a specific and wonderful term that sounds metal as hell called “algorithmic disgorgement.” It’s an act the FTC has engaged in before — basically, the destruction of any algorithm, dataset, or model that contains ill-gotten or illicit data. These definitely fit that bill without a shadow of a doubt. Specifically, we recently found out that even child abuse material has been found in these datasets. So we need algorithmic disgorgement. We need destruction of these models right off the bat because once a model is trained on data, it can’t forget.After that, we need regulations or rules to stipulate that models should only be trained on the public domain, as in like from government archives, stuff that’s available for everybody to use, with any expansion upon that to be done with the explicit consent, credit, and compensation of whomever owns that data. I’m not talking about like, “in order for you to get a job, you need to say you will give us your data,” because that’s gross. And I’m not talking about, “we'll give you 0.005 cents if you give us your image,” because that’s also equally gross. I’m talking about serious wages here.We also need immediate transparency of all models, because we can’t have an OpenAI situation where they’ve gotten away with not telling the public what their models are trained on. There’s definitely copyrighted data in there. I don’t want to see a situation where just because the company holds copyright in the form of work for hire, where we give away all of our rights to a company in order to work with that company and they can do what they want with it. For example, I worked with Disney for eight years or so. Disney owns so much of my work and there’s nothing stopping them from generating a Karla Ortiz model internally and never having to hire me again. That’s a possibility that can happen and we need worker protections against that.So we need a lot. In terms of the public again, don’t engage with theft. If you see something that has generative AI, raise a ruckus, complaint about it. It does work. A lot of companies have steered away from it because of the backlash they’ve seen. It sounds silly, but it is true: vote with your money on this stuff. Don’t reward a product that used generative AI. Call them out.I think all those points are so important. And I love the focus on algorithmic discouragement instead of just regulating it. Any final thoughts?One more thing: Send opt-out procedures into a deep, dark hole. Fuck that. That’s a push a lot of the AI companies have been doing for quite a while because it’s easy. It shifts the burden of responsibility onto people in a really irresponsible, but also unfeasible way.There are hundreds of visual models. Does that mean I have to opt out of every single one of those models? What about every time they update? The method of opting out is incredibly inefficient. For example, OpenAI not too long ago was like, “Yeah, we’ll opt you out, but you have to show how we’ve used your work.” How do you do that when they’re not even open and transparent about the work that they’ve used? You can’t. That also places undue burden on people who might not know the language, who might not know the technology, who might not even be aware that this is happening because they’re just not online. It’s completely reprehensible.They know that if they can push opt out only, they can still have access to all that ill-gotten data. And that’s the data that powers them. That’s the secret sauce. But if you do algorithmic disgorgement and implement opt in, then they have a problem because hardly anybody wants to give away their data. Why? Because those models are going to compete with them in the future. Why would you do that? Opt in only.

Job seekers with AI skills clearly stand out
There is little doubt that AI is changing the tech industry and the nature of jobs. Consequently, “job seekers would do well to consider the changing industry’s new demands, which include changes stemming from the widespread adoption of generative AI,’’ the first-ever Indeed top 10 highest-paying tech skills report noted. “While Gen AI will touch virtually every industry, tech will be impacted the most.”
Despite the layoffs in tech that have dominated headlines, “this data is demonstrating an inverse trend within the industry — proving the demand for certain tech skills is still high, and in some cases, skyrocketing,” Donal McMahon, vice president of data science at Indeed, told TechRepublic via email. “With this in mind, it is interesting that we see AI-specific skills dominating half the list. This underscores that in a tight market, job seekers with AI skills can stand out, and potentially earn almost 50% more than their counterparts.”
AI skills are sought globally
With the rise of AI globally, Indeed is seeing as much demand for similar skills across the world as in the U.S., McMahon said. Companies around the world “are all searching for employees who know AI and can adapt to new and emerging technologies,” he noted.

Top companies and industries hiring these tech skills
The top companies hiring for these tech skills include Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, TikTok, Deloitte and Ericsson Worldwide, according to Indeed’s report.
In terms of vertical-specific industries, in 2024, every company is working to become a tech company, increasing the demand for these skills, McMahon said. “Some of the top industries we are seeing coveting these skills are the aerospace and defense industry, insurance companies, financial services, manufacturing, and semiconductors.”
Tips for hiring employers: Act fast, focus on skills and upskilling
As more businesses move their operations online and every industry takes on new forms of digital transformation, workers with specialized technical skills are needed everywhere — not just in the tech industry, McMahon stressed.
“Indeed data has shown that 77% of job seekers are frustrated with the job search process and feel like the process is too slow,” he said. “Employers also agree that it takes too long to find quality talent and hire — but they do have some control over this timeline. When job seekers and skills are in demand, we encourage employers to act fast and utilize matching technology during the hiring process.”
Not only will this alleviate pain points for the job seeker, McMahon added, but the company can make a strategic hire faster.
Further, employers can find candidates faster if they focus on a skills-first hiring approach, he said. “Rather than looking at proxies like a college degree, a certain number of years of experience, or previous companies, they can hire based on the skills they need. This will open the talent pipeline to candidates who are often overlooked but are qualified to do the work.”

Employers can also consider implementing an upskilling program to provide opportunities for current employees to learn these skills, McMahon said. He also suggested that new workers continue developing expertise in these skills.
While Indeed’s Workforce Insights Report finds that 43% of job seekers consider lack of certifications as a top barrier to finding the job they want, a majority of the skills on this list can be learned through online courses, the report said.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

Artificial intelligence is changing the way marketing and PR agencies are run.Research shows that 68% of public relations professionals use AI, 68% of SEO experts are exploring it, and 61.4% of marketers are using it. It's easy to see why.AI usage in social media is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.04% through 2028, and large language models increasingly write online search results. We even have AI influencers taking over, with a reported 34% of American consumers putting their trust in them, and the highest-paid virtual influencer, Lu Do Magalu, is earning an estimated $16.2 million per year with sponsorships from brands like Adidas and Mac Cosmetics.



It's clear that AI is here to stay, and it's making a huge difference for companies in various ways, especially when creating online content. This is rapidly changing the tasks that marketers, SEOs, and PR professionals perform while augmenting their skill sets with powerful (albeit somewhat inaccurate) tools.If you want to build a successful agency, the traditional advice is to hyper-focus on one niche and be the best at it to generate revenue and grow your team. Using AI, however, a single person can do the work of an entire team, and many solopreneurs are using it to diversify their offerings as the technology creates dramatic shifts in legacy agency models.

These transcriptions make it easier to assign work to freelancers and ensure they have the client's exact wording and specifications.AI image-generation tools like Midjourney and Adobe Firefly can reduce operational costs while ensuring you have high-quality images for client social media, marketing, ads, and other channels. Runway ML takes visuals a step further by transforming text and images into video, and ElevenLabs provides AI-generated voiceovers.Finally, large language models like Perplexity make online research much faster and more efficient. Of course, there are also risks inherent in using AI in your agency.

This is because generative AI sparked a lot of controversy over the past two years, and there are various ethical considerations, including amplified biases and potential copyright infringement.Last month, a study from Gary Marcus and Reid Southen showed Midjourney v6 reproduces almost exact movie stills, and both Wacom and Magic: The Gathering drew heat online for using generative AI images in their advertising, and the latter fired their agency after the snafu.Related: What Will It Take to Build a Truly Ethical AI?

Making matters worse, AI image detectors like Hive and text detectors like Originality AI produce false positives, blurring the lines between human and machine-generated content. Even if you pledge not to use AI, the freelancers you hire may still introduce it into your workflow, causing unexpected problems.If you do use AI, there are four steps you can take to ensure it's being used safely and correctly.1. Don't publish AI outputs as your ownRaw AI outputs should never be used as the final published product, whether images or text. They aren't legally protectable, per the US Copyright Office's AI guidelines, and claiming AI outputs are your own is plagiarism. Since it's impossible to know what content most models were trained on, it's best to use AI either in the ideation phase or as one small piece of a finished product.2. Be transparent about using AIIf you use AI in any way, be upfront with clients and the public. Having AI usage laid out plainly in your contracts and any content using it is best. Being caught using AI without disclosing it can lead to drastic negative consequences, like this indie book cover contest that was canceled after the artist lied about the use of AI against the rules of the contest. If a publication doesn't want AI pitches or editorials, be sure to honor those requests.


3. Be careful with proprietary dataUnderstand that any information input into an AI may potentially be trained on or viewed by an outside party. Several instances were reported in the past year of ChatGPT leaking sensitive information to other users, and it's important to be mindful of what information is entered into any AI tools. Don't input anything into a prompt that you don't want anyone to see.4. Keep a human in the loopIt's easy to get lazy and submit mistakes you normally wouldn't when using AI. Channel Nine in Australia recently learned this the hard way when an image of politician Georgie Purcell was edited with Adobe Firefly and drew accusations of sexism. This technology isn't a replacement for humans–it's an augmentation. Be sure to thoroughly check any AI work before turning it in and making mistakes that ruin the reputation of your agency or client.Related: 3 Smart Things to Know Before Getting Started with AIGetting started with AI in your agencyAI can be a game-changer, and staying on top of technological advancements is important. It can give you a competitive edge over larger firms with a longer staff list. However, it requires purpose and care to implement correctly, and the consequences for misusing AI can be dire.


More than anything, honesty is the best policy. Companies are continuing to implement internal rules about the use of AI, and a subsection of consumers are always looking to catch a company using it without disclosure. As long as you properly label where AI is used in your workflow, the benefits and the efficiency that come out of it can be worth it.

Like most people, there were things on Heather Holding's to-do list she knew she'd never get to.That led Holding, who oversees risk management at fintech company Best Egg, to wonder whether an artificial intelligence tool could draft policy documents she and her colleagues couldn't find time to pull together.""One day, I was like, 'You know what, let's just try to put these through,'"" Holding told Business Insider. So, she wrote prompts for an AI tool built into a corporate reporting platform made by Workiva. The chatbot drafted documents that needed some tweaking, but Holding and her team got through the backlog of 10 policies within a day.

Holding's experience points to the sometimes subtle ways AI is changing work. Many workers have expressed fears that the technology will show up at the office like a young gun coming for their job. Yet, in some cases, AI might be more like the temp that gets brought in when work piles up — or to do the jobs nobody wanted to do.An AI bot could act as your intern.One reason chatbots like the one Holding used might not take over tons of jobs right away is there are limits to what AI can do — for now. Generative AI tools often still require oversight, much like an inexperienced worker might. Holding has to review and sometimes adjust what a bot kicks out, but even with that, she saves time.

To write a policy doc from scratch, she said, might take from eight to 30 hours, depending on the type and how much research it requires. As long as she does the upfront legwork to draft the proper instructions for the bot, the results are compelling, she said.""You can literally have the sections mirror exactly what you want in an actual policy,"" Holding said.

Tackling those jobs that people otherwise might not even start is an important part of how AI will transform the workplace, according to Ron Williams, CEO and founder of Kindo, which helps companies adopt and use AI tools securely. In part, it's because the technology lets companies do things they couldn't do easily or cost-effectively before.""There are jobs not getting done today that aren't threatened at all — that AI is just going to be able to start doing,"" he told BI.Williams expects some of the biggest gains from AI won't center on what companies and workers are doing now. Instead, he sees major wins coming from what workers aren't doing but that AI could. Accomplishing those things could change the trajectory of a business, Williams said.""As the AIs get better, that's just going to accelerate and expand the reach of what they're going to be able to impact,"" he said.

Williams pointed to work such as content moderation or aggregating reviews in e-commerce. He said AI can sift through thousands of posts and summarize customers' sentiments about a product. Amazon is trying this. Hot takes from AI could boost sales, Williams said, if shoppers have a better understanding of what people think about a product. It's the kind of service that wasn't feasible without technology.""Before, that just wasn't economical to have a human go through and try to aggregate that stuff,"" he said.Filling in when help is scarceOne reason jobs sometimes aren't getting done is because there aren't always enough workers. So, some leaders are looking to AI for help. In a Gigged.AI survey of about 250 UK execs in mid-2023, about half said GenAI could address skills shortages in tech.There are also efforts to train workers in fields like accounting that are facing worker shortages about the benefits of AI. A startup called Docyt recently introduced a professional development platform to help teach accountants how to use AI to complete their jobs more efficiently and accurately.

Jérôme Pesenti, founder and CEO of an AI-powered learning app called Sizzle and former VP of AI at Facebook parent Meta, told BI that sometimes AI takes on parts of jobs that might be unexpected. He pointed to research labs where machines excel at repeating experiments with high precision. But tasks that might seem menial — like cleaning machines and moving samples — are actually often harder to leave to robots.""We are literally decades away from automating this,"" he said. ""Yet some jobs that we thought were, you know, maybe like higher level, which was like doing precise experiments — it actually turns out machines are better at doing.""Humans still come out ahead in areas like behaving in a complex environment and dealing with multiple systems, Pesenti said. But that doesn't mean people won't turn to AI as a hired hand in the workplace, he noted. ""I'm still betting on the human, but I do think the human needs to leverage the machine to be a lot better,"" Pesenti said.At Best Egg, Holding hopes AI might one day take on even more work, like scooping up thousands of rows of data and allowing auditors to ask a chatbot questions about that information or hunt down anomalies. Right now, she might spend up to 40 hours conducting transactional tests. If AI could be deployed to help with this work, the time the task takes might get cut in half, Holding said.

Security and privacy are the essential requirements of developing and deploying AI systems, which is considered the main problem. The risk of data security and privacy violation with the proliferation of AI is growing, thus requiring stronger regulations and frameworks to protect sensitive information. 
A critical question is how AI should be used ethically. Addressing these problems requires cooperation between ethicists, the technical community, the policymakers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the AI systems are fair and equitable.
Also, AI increases the concerns over the loss of jobs and a persistent issue of economic inequality, which calls for steps to reskill the workforce and address social and economic disparities.
AI's rapid progress raises questions about its effects on autonomous weapons and cybersecurity, so there is a call for international collaboration and ethical standards.
Let's understand these AI challenges and discuss solutions to overcome them.
AI Challenges
As of 2024, the AI field will face more problems, such as privacy and personal data protection, ethics of use, which comprises algorithmic bias and transparency, and the socio-economic impact of job displacement. Solving challenges in Artificial Intelligence calls for interdisciplinary cooperation and defining regulatory policies. 
The growth of AI also causes concerns over how AI will affect cybersecurity, which requires international collaboration and ethical controls. Moreover, promoting AI benefits to society and avoiding risks require a general approach, which should consider technological progress and ethical aspects.

Ethics in AI involves discussions about various issues, including privacy violations, perpetuation of bias, and social impact. The accountability, transparency, and fairness in decisions made by AI systems are now the challenge. Some issues that include algorithmic bias, which leads to the discrimination of particular groups, threaten the strengthening of inequalities. 
Additionally, a more focused approach must be used when implementing AI in sensitive areas such as health and criminal justice that warrants increased consideration of ethical principles needed to attain fair outcomes. Finding a balance between technological development and moral issues is essential to using AI for societal benefit while avoiding risks and encouraging ethical innovation.
Bias in AI
Bias in artificial intelligence can be defined as machine learning algorithms' potential to duplicate and magnify pre existing biases in the training dataset. This may lead to unjust and unethical outcomes, significantly affecting marginalized communities. 
For example, biased hiring procedures, loan approvals, and unequal criminal sentencing. AI bias mitigation needs a deliberate approach to data selection, preprocessing techniques, and algorithm design to minimize bias and promote fairness. 
Also, ongoing monitoring and evaluation of AI systems help identify and rectify bias, thus promoting fairness in the outcomes of all individuals through AI-based decision-making processes.
AI Integration
AI integration means that artificial intelligence systems are incorporated into production and services to improve automation and efficiency. This implies identifying relevant application scenarios, fine-tuning AI models to particular scenarios, and ensuring compatibility with existing systems. The integration process demands AI experts and domain specialists to work together to fine-tune their solutions to satisfy organizational requirements. 
Challenges include interoperability of data, the need for personnel training, and the associated change management. Coping with these challenges requires strategic planning, stakeholder participation, and iterative implementations to optimize AI and minimize disruptions. As such, AI integration can play a crucial role in bringing about transformative change and delivering a competitive edge across various industries and sectors.
Computing Power
The degree of computing power is crucial in developing and deploying AI models, particularly those involving computations and massive datasets. The need for high-performance computing devices, such as GPUs, TPUs, and others, increases with growing AI algorithm complexity. Challenges include cost, energy consumption, and scalability. In the early development stages, hardware architectural innovations like neuromorphic computing and quantum computing also offer potential solutions.
Moreover, distributed computation, as well as cloud services, can be used to overcome computational limitations. Managing computational requirements with a balance of efficiency and sustainability is vital for the progress of AI potentials while maintaining resource limitations.
Data Privacy and Security
The main issues surrounding AI are data security and privacy since AI systems require large amounts of data for operation and training. To avoid leaks, breaches, and misuse, one must ensure data security, availability, and integrity. To comply with data protection rules such as the CCPA and GDPR, an organization must have access restrictions, encryption, and auditing capabilities. 
Furthermore, using privacy-preserving approaches such as differential privacy and federated learning is essential to minimize privacy risks and maintain data utility. Trust-building among users through transparent data processes and ethical data handling protocols is crucial for user confidence in AI systems and responsible data management.
Legal issues with AI
The legal concerns around AI cover a large spectrum: liability, intellectual property rights, and regulatory compliance. The accountability question arises when an AI-based decision maker is involved, especially in a faulty system or an accident resulting from an autonomous AI system. Legal issues related to copyright emerge due to the ownership of the content created by AI and its algorithms. 
Furthermore, the regulatory systems, usually the last to adapt to technological changes, must be noticed to avoid legal liabilities and risks. Tackling these issues requires a combination of legal specialists, policymakers, and technology experts working together to create clear rules and policies that balance innovation with accountability and protect stakeholders' rights.
AI Transparency
AI transparency refers to the algorithms and decision-making processes. Transparency is essential for building credibility, trust, accountability, and user confidence in AI systems. Transparency is defined as an element of how AI models work and what AI models do, including inputs, outputs, and the underlying logic. Techniques like explainable AI (XAI) are directed at providing understandable insights into complex AI systems, making them easily comprehensible. 
Further, clear documentation of the data sources, model training methodologies, and performance metrics would also promote transparency. Transparency can be achieved through promoting it, which enables organizations to show ethical AI practices, deal with bias, and allow users to make the right decisions based on AI-derived results.
Limited Knowledge of AI
Limited knowledge among the general population is one of the critical issues impacting informed decision-making, adoption, and regulation. Misconceptions and misinterpretations of AI's abilities and constraints multiply, holding back its responsible use and promotion. Effective measures should be developed and implemented for the education and public awareness programs to ensure public comprehension of AI concepts, use cases, and potential effects. 
Furthermore, enabling accessible resources and training opportunities would allow users to use AI technology more effectively. Bridging the knowledge gap through interdisciplinary collaboration, community involvement, and outreach is how society will get AI that can be productive without at the same time dealing with the ethical, societal, and economic issues of AI.

Trust in AI systems is a significant condition for their wide use and acceptance by people. The foundation for trust is transparency, reliability, and accountability. Organizations need to guarantee transparency by exposing how AI systems operate and their choices. Reliability is another way to say that you are expected to deliver consistent performance, including producing correct results. Accountability constitutes taking responsibility for outcomes resulting from AI, as well as fixing errors or biases. 
Furthermore, building trust involves reaching out to stakeholders, taking feedback, and putting ethics into the front line. By emphasizing transparency, reliability, and accountability, organizations will create trust in AI systems, allowing users to use AI technologies and their potential benefits.
Lack of AI explainability
The lack of AI explainability refers to the difficulty in understanding and determining how AI systems reach their conclusions or recommendations. This lack of transparency makes people distrustful and accountable regarding essential applications such as healthcare and finance. 
The AI methods are developed to address this issue by providing insights about the logic of AI algorithms. Analyzing the importance of features and visualizing models provide users with insight into AI outputs. Though the explainability issue remains a challenging problem, that solution does not affect the model performance is a difficult task. 
Discrimination
An example of discrimination in AI is when the system behaves in a biased and unfair way toward individuals or groups due to their race, gender, or other factors. While AI systems can unknowingly perpetuate or aggravate social biases in their training sets, this ultimately results in discriminatory outcomes. For example, the biased algorithms used in hiring and lending processes amplify existing inequalities. 
Addressing discrimination calls for countering bias in data collection and algorithmic choice. Modern approaches like fairness-aware machine learning are focused on promoting equity by identifying and addressing bias while the model is being developed. In addition, through fair and transparent AI systems, discrimination will be recognized and rectified, leading to fair and unbiased treatment of all people.
High Expectations
High expectations accompanied by AI's powers often lead to unrealistic expectations for AI, followed by disappointment. While AI offers immense potential, its limitations and complexities frequently overshadow exaggerated promises. 
Furthermore, educational and awareness programs give stakeholders a clear picture of how AI is used and its limitations. By setting achievable goals and a balanced knowledge of AI's pros and cons, organizations avoid disappointment and focus on taking advantage of AI.
Implementation strategies
Implementation strategies for AI include systematic approaches to bring AI technologies into the existing systems and workflows to use them effectively. Some key aspects include selecting the proper use cases that align with the business objectives, evaluating whether the data is sufficient and of good quality, and choosing suitable AI algorithms or models. 
Moreover, creating an innovation advisory board would drive the experimentation and learning necessary for AI solutions' iterative development and refinement. Having domain experts and AI specialists on the same team is essential when implementing a project so that the solution covers the needs of users and the organization. 
Data Confidentiality
Confidentiality of data is the focus of AI that ensures that private information remains under restricted access and does not leak to unauthorized parties. Organizations must implement strict security mechanisms (i.e., encryption, access control, and secure protocols for storage) to keep data secure from creation to disposal. 
Complying with data privacy laws, e.g., GDPR and HIPAA, is crucial to guaranteeing confidential data's legal and ethical use. Privacy protection is essential in creating trust among users and stakeholders and is a critical factor in developing AI systems perceived as responsible and reliable.
Software Malfunction
Malfunction in AI software presents excellent risks, including erroneous outputs, system failures, or cyber-attacks. Testing and quality assurance practices should be strict at each stage of the software lifecycle to eliminate such risks. 
Additionally, implementing robust error-handling mechanisms and contingency plans helps keep malfunctions' impacts small when they occur. Regular software updates and maintenance are also significant in preventing and solving potential defects that might cause malfunctioning. 
In addition, creating a culture that promotes transparency and accountability principles helps detect and resolve software problems faster, contributing to the reliability and safety of AI systems.
How do you overcome the challenges in artificial intelligence?
To tackle the challenges in AI, interdisciplinary collaboration is essential. This is achieved by merging technology, ethics, law, and sociology experts to develop all-encompassing solutions. Adopting explainable and transparent AI practices enhances accountability and trust. 
Besides, education and awareness programs also contribute to offering knowledge in the field and ensuring making informed decisions. Investing diversity and inclusiveness in AI team development minimizes biases and yields equality in results. Furthermore, a robust regulatory system is mandatory to adhere to legal and ethical codes. 
AI's challenges can be addressed safely through collaboration, transparency, education, and regulation.

Grammarly and Harris Poll Find Using Generative AI for Communication Could Save Up to $1.6 Trillion Annually in U.S. Productivity




Third annual “State of Business Communication” report illuminates how businesses can tangibly harness AI to enhance communication, efficiency, and performance






February 21, 2024 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Grammarly, the company helping over 30 million people and 70,000 teams work smarter and faster wherever they write, today announced its third annual “State of Business Communication: AI’s Potential to Turn Overload Into Impact” report, uncovering the potential of generative AI to save a staggering $1.6 trillion in U.S. communication productivity each year. In partnership with The Harris Poll, the study exposes how generative AI brings both new solutions and challenges to the problem of poor communication that plagues U.S. businesses.


“Companies not using generative AI for communication are already way behind, and those that are, are far from realizing its full potential”Post this

New AI gaps and risks pose serious threats to businesses, jeopardizing their ability to reap the benefits of the technology. The data shows that leaders and workers have been communicating more (78%) and in more channels (73%) this past year, and it’s causing more stress than ever, particularly among workers (+16% over last year). At the same time, both groups are seeing early benefits from using generative AI, including saving a day a workweek—which adds up to around $16,455 per worker per year. But even though it’s helping, most workers still wish their companies were more open to implementing AI (58%) and don’t know how to use AI well (52%).


“Companies not using generative AI for communication are already way behind, and those that are, are far from realizing its full potential,” said Matt Rosenberg, Grammarly Chief Revenue Officer and Head of Grammarly Business. “The data is clear that generative AI offers monumental benefits, but can also add more distractions at a time when teams need ways to communicate better, not add more to the mix. Our report should be a wake-up call for businesses to stop with the piecemeal approaches, get aligned with their employees, and hone a clear strategy that empowers their entire workforce with AI if they are to realize its impact.”


The study of U.S. business leaders and knowledge workers underscores the changing nature of workplace communication and the ways that generative AI is impacting how we work and interact. Additional findings include:



Workers spend nearly half of their workweek on writing tasks (19.08 hours), and time spent reviewing and editing especially increased (+11% year-over-year)



92% of leaders and 84% of workers who use generative AI do so at least weekly, and it’s already delivering business results for leaders like increased efficiency (52%), higher productivity (50%), saved costs (38%), and higher customer engagement (37%)



Workers using generative AI say that it makes them better at their job (77%) and has transformed how they communicate at work (71%), and that they ultimately believe AI will enhance their work, not replace them (66%)



Leaders, your communication problem is worse than you think: There’s a 24% gap between workers’ (63%) and leaders’ (87%) perceived effectiveness of their organization’s overall communication. Fewer workers this year also say their senior leadership communicates effectively (64%, down 8%)—compared to 90% of leaders who say the same. With leaders reporting that communication directly drives business outcomes like productivity (64%), customer satisfaction (51%), and brand reputation (45%), it’s time for a reality check to tackle the problem.


Focus on better, not more, to address communications overload: Most leaders and workers find constant work notifications challenging (56%), struggle to manage all of the communications they receive (54%), and spend too much time trying to get messages across in the right way (55%). Despite the AI deluge, more workers this year also wish they had better tools to help them be more effective (66%, vs. 58% last year). Facing an overwhelming surge of communication in more places, teams need ways to improve the quality of communication, not simply pile on more.


Chart a clear course to close AI gaps and move past the hype: Despite extensive generative AI use and promising early benefits, poor communication remains a pervasive problem, and leaders and workers are at odds with each other in their use of AI. 89% of leaders report using generative AI for professional purposes, but only 53% of workers say the same—a symptom of the lack of a cohesive AI approach. While 82% of leaders are planning investments in AI, those investments will go to waste if not paired with a company-wide AI strategy that focuses on literacy, education, and training.

The top 10 highest paid skills in tech can help workers earn up to 47% more — and the top skill among them is generative artificial intelligence (genAI), according to a new report from employment website Indeed and other sources.
For example, the top three skills — genAI, system-on-a-chip (SoC) and deep learning — each command an annual salary north of $170,000.
This year, the median salary for IT skilled workers is $101,323, according to IT business consultancy Janco Associates.











 
 
 
Half of the highest-paid skills in tech are AI-specific, which suggests that job seekers with AI talent can stand out in a competitive job market and earn more than their counterparts, according to Indeed.

“One thing everyone can agree on is that the tech industry is changing, and likely irrevocably,” according to Indeed’s report, which is aimed at helping tech workers be more competitive and/or find a new job in 2024.
Job seekers need to keep up with the tech industry’s new demands, which include changes stemming from the widespread adoption of genAI tools over the past year. While genAI will touch virtually every industry, tech will be affected the most.











 
 
 
“In today’s workplace, tech workers (and really, most workers) need to be adaptable as AI continues to impact the world of work,” said Donal McMahon, Indeed’s vice president of data science. “Generative AI in particular is where we are seeing an uptick in shared interest from both job seekers and employers.”
Enterprises spent about $19.4 billion worldwide on genAI technologies in 2023; that amount is expected to double this year, according to research by IDC.
“The way I often describe this is AI is sucking the air out of almost all non-AI investments in the whole tech world,” said Harvard Business School Professor David Yoffie.











 
 
 
Layoffs don’t lie
The past year has seen a trend of “rolling layoffs” that, despite better economic numbers, have continued to plague IT jobs. Business Insider likened the leveling out of IT layoffs to those you might see in any other big industry settling into a more sustainable rhythm.
In January, US-based employers announced 82,307 cuts, compared to 34,817 cuts the month before; it represented a 136% increase in layoffs over December and a 10-month high, according to a report by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. The surge in job cuts was led by the tech industry.
While that January number is down 20% from the 102,943 cuts announced in January 2023, they’re a sign the tech job market is shifting, the outplacement firm said.











 
 
 
 Janco Associates
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in a report issued in January, noted that shift, saying the world is on “the brink of a technological revolution that could jump start productivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the world.” Yet AI and genAI could also “replace jobs and deepen inequality.”
The IMF found the results of an analysis of AI and jobs to be “striking,” and said nearly 40% of global employment will be exposed to the effects of genAI. That figure could be even higher — 60% — in advanced economies such as the US and Europe.
Indeed’s McMahon said data backs that up: “Searches for generative AI jobs on Indeed have surged nearly 4,000% in the last year, indicating a pronounced industry shift. Job postings for generative AI roles have seen a remarkable 306% increase since September 2022, underlining the sustained demand for these specialized skills.”











 
 
 
David Foote, chief analyst at IT research firm Foote Partners, said fast-evolving technologies like AI “are forcing organizations to move more quickly in filling specific gaps in their job architectures.”
Foote Partners publishes a quarterly analysis of supply and demand for 1,333 IT skills and certifications at 4,314 U.S. and Canadian organizations. During the last three months of 2023, many non-certified IT skills were among those earning the highest pay premiums, including AI, big data analytics, and identity access management (including machine learning)
According to Foote Partners, the top jobs within the genAI family are:











 
 
 

Lead Artificial Intelligence Engineer
Principal Artificial Intelligence Engineer
Senior Artificial Intelligence Engineer
Artificial Intelligence Engineer
Lead AI Data Analyst
Senior AI Data Analyst
AI Data Analyst
AI Product Manager
AI Prompt Engineer
Human AI Collaboration Manager

For example, AI engineering is central to product innovation because it leverages AI, machine learning (ML) and software engineering skills to transform ideas into reality and develop a wide range of products and technology for commercial use.
“This group takes the lead in bringing projects to production, but also [has] the opportunity to come up with new ideas,” Foote’s report said.
The rise of skills like prompt engineering
Within the genAI field, both fundamental software development and prompt engineering skills are highly sought after by organizations for creating foundation AI models, tuning them for domain-specific applications, and building consumer-facing products, according to McMahon.











 
 
 
“Prompt engineering is a more accessible job skill for those without a software engineering background. After training up prompt engineering, individuals are able to quickly leverage large language models in a variety of industry tasks such as content creation and text summarization,” he said.
Other top worker capabilities related to AI being sought by employers include data science, machine learning engineering, and software engineering.
Indeed said it’s seeing “a high repetition of the skills identified on its list. Specifically, we see data scientists and machine learning engineers focusing on: generative AI, Deep Learning, Torch, PyTorch and computer vision,” McMahon said. “The capabilities for software engineers are slightly different, with companies preferring skills such as SoC, PyTorch, Computer Vision, Mesos, Rust and Elixir.”











 
 
 
Top 5 highest paid skills, according to Indeed:

Generative AI

Avg. Salary Potential: $174,727
% difference (with skill vs without): 47%

SoC

Avg. Salary Potential: $174,564
% difference (with skill vs without): 47%

Avg. Salary Potential: $169,874
% difference (with skill vs without): 43%

PyTorch

Avg. Salary Potential: $168,636
% difference (with skill vs without): 42%

The top jobs seeking those skills include data scientist, machine learning engineer and software engineer, and the top companies hiring for those skills include Deloitte, Ericsson-Worldwide, and Meta.
While many of the “skills” identified by Indeed simply look like the technologies themselves, such as “SoC” or system-on-chip, the “skill” is being listed across various job descriptions and in top employers hiring.











 
 
 
The specific technical skills related to those technologies include: Analog IP integration, PCIe High-Speed Interfaces, SoC-Level Clocking, Reset, and Power Management, FPGA Design Experience, and RTL Synthesis and DFT/MBIST Insertion.
Where to learn new skills
Indeed’s recent Workforce Insights Report found that 43% of 5,000 job seekers feel a lack of certifications is one the top barriers to finding jobs they want, but a majority of those certifications can be accessed through online learning. The report also found that 71% of workers are open to new opportunities and 60% are prepared to apply.
There are a variety of effective methods for learning new tech skills, including not only enrolling in online courses, but attending boot camps and participating in other training programs tailored to AI development and other top skills.











 
 
 
The top online IT certification providers are: CareerFoundry, Coursera, Udemy, EdX, Codefinity, Codeacademy, Udacity, and FutureLearn. Many universities and colleges offer online certification courses. Beyond that, there a variety of free or cheap online courses, including:

AWS AI and Machine Learning Path
Google’s Cloud Skills Boost
Microsoft Virtual Academy
Professor Messer
LinkedIn’s Career Essentials In Generative AI training course
AI’s “AI for Everyone” short course

“These resources provide practical experience and can accommodate busy schedules. Continuous learning and staying abreast of the latest advancements in AI are essential for success in this rapidly evolving field,” McMahon said. “For many roles today, it’s important to invest in building tech literacy. Everyone in tech can benefit in learning about the basics of AI, as nearly every tech role now has to be an AI role.”

The federal workforce of the future will be tasked with leveraging artificial intelligence — including in hiring — and using accurate, timely data to inform policy decisions, the Office of Personnel Management said in an announcement Friday. 
In releasing its workforce playbook for federal agencies, OPM said agencies should implement strategies that aim to enable a workforce that is “inclusive, agile and engaged, with the right skills to enable mission delivery,” according to a press release. OPM listed 12 priorities, including AI integration and data-driven decisions. 
“OPM is 100% invested in strengthening the federal workforce,” OPM Director Kiran Ahuja said in the release. “This playbook is just another example of OPM’s ongoing efforts to equip federal agencies with the tools and resources to hire the right talent and strategically plan for their future workforce. The federal government works best when we leverage the full talent of our nation and workforce — this playbook is full of useful strategies to do just that.”
In the playbook, OPM calls on federal agencies to use “appropriate” AI capabilities in the HR process, understand how the technology will impact the workforce and safeguard employees accordingly, upskill teams with “appropriate competencies” and train existing talent on recent AI use cases and their applicability to current projects. The office pointed to a report from the Government Accountability Office that shared approximately 1,200 existing and planned use cases along with specific “challenges or opportunities that AI may help solve.”

The Biden administration is also asking agencies to explore the use of generative AI to see how the technology could “improve efficiencies” as needed. 
Additionally, the office is asking agencies to take steps toward implementing data into decision-making by using available data products and platforms, ensuring that data standards are implemented, identifying data literacy gaps and developing strategies to guarantee employees have the necessary data skills. OPM shared that the Department of Defense uses an advanced analytics platform that “supplies leaders with decision support analytics, visualizations, data tools and associated support services.” 
OPM also said in the release that it will provide training and technical assistance to agencies as they implement these strategies through webinars, and it will be posting “periodic updates” to its Workforce of the Future webpage.

Amazon is warning employees not to use third-party generative AI tools for work, according to multiple internal guidances viewed by Business Insider.""While we may find ourselves using GenAl tools, especially when it seems to make life easier, we should be sure not to use it for confidential Amazon work,"" the company warned employees in a recent email. ""Don't share any confidential Amazon, customer, or employee data when you're using 3rd party GenAl tools. Generally, confidential data would be data that is not publicly available.""

Amazon's internal third-party generative AI use and interaction policy, viewed by BI, warns that the companies offering generative AI services may take a license to or ownership over anything employees input into tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT.""This means that any outputs such as email, PRFAQs, internal wiki pages, code, confidential information, documentation, pre-launch and strategy materials may be extracted, reviewed, used, and distributed by the owners of the generative Al,"" the policy states. ""As such, all Amazonians must abide by our standard Amazon policies for confidential information and security for any inputs to generative Al.""

Those companies might also claim the rights to anything their models output, according to the policy.Around this time last year, an Amazon corporate lawyer informally warned employees not to provide OpenAI's ChatGPT with ""any Amazon confidential information (including Amazon code you are working on,"" saying there had been instances of ChatGPT responses looking similar to internal Amazon data. Amazon employees at the time said they were already using the AI tool as a software ""coding assistant,"" according to internal messages.Questions about how generative AI companies handle confidential information, and who owns the information that goes in and comes out of a model, largely remain unresolved as these tools become more ubiquitous. Amazon may be particularly sensitive as its main competitor Microsoft invested heavily in OpenAI and has its own generative AI products.Amazon notoriously kept employees off of Microsoft systems, but it has softened on that lately. The company recently signed a $1 billion, five-year deal for Microsoft 365 licenses, as BI previously reported.

Amazon's internal generative AI policy states employees can use third-party models for work if they obtain director and legal approval and comply with any applicable security reviews. The recent email states some employees have access to Amazon's internal tool Bedrock, ""a more secure alternative.""Amazon's spokesperson Adam Montgomery said the company has been developing generative AI and large machine learning models for a long time and employees use its AI models every day.

Governors Discuss Artificial Intelligence Risks and Regulatory Priorities


Feb. 24, 2024

Press Releases 



















Washington, DC – During the annual Winter Meeting of the National Governors Association (NGA), Governors welcomed tech pioneer Marc Andreessen for a discussion on the potential risks and benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. With no overarching federal regulations on AI, states are taking the lead to set policies to take advantage of the benefits of AI and put safeguards in place against its risks.
North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum moderated a conversation with Andreessen that focused on harnessing the advantages of AI to enhance U.S. competitiveness while protecting consumers from risk. 
Governor Burgum explained how Governors are applying AI to improve efficiency in state government and explored AI’s potential impacts on workforce issues, stating: “In our lifetime, every job, every company, every industry has been transformed by technology. Now we have something more powerful, that’s being adopted at a faster rate than cell phones, the internet or personal computers. Is the AI revolution going to [increase] productivity, or are we going to regulate ourselves in such a way that we have slower growth than we could be achieving? As operating leaders that run state government, Governors always apply technology to be better, faster, more efficient, more responsive to the citizens. Governors are always competing with each other for jobs and talent and capital to come to our states. But part of that competition is going to shift to who is going to have the framework, the education system that is producing the workforce, the human capital that actually understands this.”  
Andreessen explained the technology sector perspective on potential regulatory approaches, stating: “Fundamentally, there are two different regulatory approaches on how to deal with these technologies. One is to regulate the technologies themselves. A lot of the proposals on regulating AI have to do with things like: regulating what can go into chips, regulating who can buy chips, how they get used; regulating software, regulating open-source software, deciding who can actually download open-source software, who can use it, who can write it. The other approach is regulating the uses. That approach [focuses on scenarios such as using AI to] make it easier to plan a bank robbery. Well, it turns out bank robbery is already illegal. Invasion of consumer privacy is already illegal. Medical fraud is already illegal. The good news is, in this country we already have a robust set of laws and regulations for basically all or most of the downside scenarios – either at the law enforcement level for domestic issues or intelligence capabilities for dealing with things at the global level. I think it’s far more effective to regulate the uses since you’re addressing the actual issues. It also preserves the underlying fundamental opportunity in all the positive cases [without] choking off the technology itself.”  
Andreessen concluded: “At the end of the day, we’re going to have to decide as a country: Are we in new technologies to win them? We are so used to America being technologically dominant, which means economically dominant, which also means militarily dominant. We’re so used to that. It’s been the case for 80 years. We have to figure out how to win, how to have American enterprise win, and the American people win in this, while also dealing with the downside cases.”
Montana Governor Greg Gianforte, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, NGA Chair Utah Governor Spencer Cox, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, and Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon also shared insights on what their states are doing to implement effective AI policies.
