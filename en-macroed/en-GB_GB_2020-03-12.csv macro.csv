In light of International Women’s Day celebrations this past weekend, we acknowledged the beauty, essence and power of women to achieve and thrive in the global ecosystem. Yet in our modern digital age, women continue to be neglected on multiple fronts, especially that of the new workforce. It is society’s role to ensure that all females are given equal opportunities to grow in this new age workforce, and we must understand that all of us have a stake in this mission. Women are the key piece to the puzzle of realizing the highest maturity levels of digital enterprises, but unless we realize this, our progress in AI and technology will remain stagnant. In order to close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), and to accelerate advances in artificial intelligence and the sciences, we must encourage and support women on all levels, from government to enterprise, and establish equal employment opportunities for all. 


AI is one of the fields in which women can experience tremendous success, especially with the right push towards female participation in the industry. Women are a necessary force that organizations must integrate in order to accelerate the AI maturity of enterprises. In specific, a heavy emphasis on the female workforce within the artificial intelligence setting can help alleviate some of the biggest problems that enterprises face in the eyes of machine learning technologies, such as selection bias. Therefore, in order for organizations to achieve the highest AI maturity levels, it is necessary to mobilize women on a mass scale and include them as part of all enterprise endeavors in artificial intelligence, from research to product launch. 

The above remarks indicate that there has been a global push to involve more women in science and technology careers. Towards the end of 2019, the World Economic Forum urged more female role models to join accelerator programs focused on promoting women in STEM careers. International campaigns to involve more females in STEM, AI and data science have launched in multiple nations, championed by such entities like IBM, IPsoft and Microsoft as well as the US Chamber of Commerce. From Australia to Saudi Arabia to Canada, strong female leaders in STEM and AI have begun to inspire girls and young women around the world to dream big and chase career opportunities in engineering, artificial intelligence and the sciences. The White House has also made an effort to make women in STEM a top priority: the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, spearheaded by Ivanka Trump, is a new level of female empowerment in STEM. The project seeks to, “Reach 50 million women in the developing world by 2025 through U.S. government activities, private-public partnerships, and a new, innovative fund,” and equip them with all possible tools to succeed in the new digital world. 

PROMOTED
It is evident that steps have been taken to boost female participation in STEM, artificial intelligence and data science. Moreover, this article serves as a first glimpse into the current situation, how to combat it, and ends with several recommendations that seek to accelerate progress for all women in STEM, AI and data science. The mass mobilization of women in STEM careers is the secret that will unleash the fullest potential of our technological abilities, as well as the grand capacities that our digital world has to offer. Without females, this global mission is destined to fail. 

The Current Situation
STEM, data science and AI are fields in which women are vastly underrepresented, and the numbers make it clear. Females compose just 28% of the science and engineering workforce, and that number drops when observing the number of women pursuing university degrees in said fields. About 55% of university graduates are females, but only a little over one-third of those degrees are in STEM. For example, research from the World Economic Forum shows that a measly 3% of females take coursework for information communication technology (ICT), with just 5% choosing to pursue studies math and statistics, and a slightly better 8% when it comes to engineering.

Trump 2024 Election Polls: Biden Narrowly Leads Trump In Virginia, After 10-Point Win There In 2020
The current situation with AI careers also fails to play in favor of women. Just 13.8% of women have authored artificial intelligence related research papers, and less than a quarter of females are considered to be AI professionals. This information should be more than disquieting to enterprises wishing to scale-up their AI maturity levels. According to BCG GAMMA, “Interpreting causal relationships and correlations in large data sets requires subtlety, and both humans and machine learning algorithms can occasionally “see” patterns that lead to spurious, biased, or even downright dangerous conclusions.” This ultimately means that organizations will always fail to harness the fullest capacity of their digital innovations without including women, as machine learning technologies will be fed a constant stream of biased data, producing junk results that are not reflective of the full picture, causing potentially catastrophic harm to organizations.

And when it comes to data science, the news still remains uneventful for women. Females comprise some 15% of the career population, and just 18% of leadership positions at premier technology companies. Despite this fact, according to a poll conducted by LivePerson, 91.7% of 1000 survey respondents said that they could name just one female leader in STEM.

With over 90% of the population oblivious to the female presence in STEM, data science and AI, clearly, the globe clearly faces an uphill battle on the pursuit to resolve this issue. 
Gaps and Challenges in STEM, AI and Data Science 
What is keeping women out of STEM and STEM related occupations? A number of factors must be considered when attempting to answer this question. Let’s break these elements down first, and then briefly go over each one in more depth in order to understand the crux of the matter. 
Few organizations understand the importance of women to AI enterprise maturity levels
Women make up a fraction of the artificial intelligence workforce, whether in the form of research and development or as employees at technology inclined firms. According to the World Economic Forum, “Non-homogeneous teams are more capable than homogenous teams of recognizing their biases and solving issues when interpreting data, testing solutions or making decisions.” In other words, diverse teams, and especially those that emphasize women at their epicenter, are a necessary provision for enterprises to adopt in order to build, realize and accelerate enterprise AI maturity levels. At present moment, unfortunately, few enterprises understand the criticality of women to boost AI maturity levels. 
STEM, data science and AI fields experience a lack of female role models
Without female role models for girls to look up to, it becomes difficult for young women to envision future careers in science, technology and engineering fields. In fact, a 2018 Microsoft survey shows that female STEM role models boost the interest of girls in STEM careers from 32 percent to 52 percent. Therefore, it is imperative that we showcase the achievements of women in the sciences and engineering across the world to capture the attention of females everywhere. 
Women in STEM, data science and AI face a male-dominated culture and are seen as inferior
One of the biggest pressures that females face in STEM careers is cutthroat competition amongst male counterparts, and the toxic workplace culture that it creates. An HBR article found that three-fourths of female scientists support one another in their workplace to ease tensions. Moreover, women are likely to be demoted as inferior by men holding equivalent positions, whether those jobs are in engineering, data science or AI. All of these factors contribute to females swiftly dismissing STEM jobs in order to avoid such disquieting workplace circumstances. 
Women in STEM, data science and AI display different preferences
According to a survey conducted by BCG, when it comes to STEM, “Women place a higher premium on applied, impact-driven work than men do: 67% of women expressed a clear preference for such work, compared with 61% of men.” This finding highlights a significant fact: women are vastly more likely to pursue STEM roles that provide them with meaning, purpose and produce impactful results, but many women don’t perceive this purpose and impact in STEM jobs. Therefore, without a clear high impact-driven pathway in sight, females tend to turn their heads on STEM, data science and AI related careers. 
Communication about STEM, data science and AI roles is key with women, but we have been lagging in this pursuit
Studies have shown that communication is of the utmost importance when it comes to getting more women involved in STEM careers. According to BCG GAMMA, just 55% of women feel like they know enough about employment opportunities in data science. Furthermore, vague explanations of job qualifications, such as “being strong in data science,” and, conversely, incredibly in-depth job descriptions in search of data wizard talent, tend to steer females clear of STEM related jobs. Moreover, an HBR study found that female engagement with STEM employers falls far behind men, and that this should come at no surprise as, “Given the selection bias that accompanies personal work networks, especially in a young and still male-dominated field.”
Retention of women in the STEM, data science and AI jobs is another challenge
It isn’t enough to pique the interest of girls and young women to pursue STEM careers: the goal is to maintain, foster and grow that interest. A study published in the Social Forces journal found that women in STEM are much more likely to abandon their jobs than if they held other careers. More precisely, the study highlights that some 50% of women holding STEM careers left after 12 years on the job, whereas that number dropped to 20% for women in other fields. On average, females tend to distance themselves from STEM after 5 years of industry involvement. But why? According to the same study, “Women with engineering degrees said they left engineering because of lack of advancement or low salary, along with other working conditions.” These facts show that retention of women in the STEM, data science and AI workforce is chief among challenges to address. 
STEM and AI Initiatives Fighting To Solve This Problem
A number of initiatives have been launched in order to combat the gender gap problem in STEM and STEM related fields. At their core, these campaigns emphasize the promotion of women, artificial intelligence, and special educational and reskilling programs to solve the problem. 
Campaigns Focused on Promoting Women in STEM, AI and Data Science 
IPSoft, IBM and the US Chamber of Commerce are examples of organizations that are leading the way to get more women involved with STEM, AI and data science. IPSoft’s Women in AI initiative has been recently launched in order to shine a light on prominent female figures in STEM, showcasing the incredible work that these professionals have accomplished in “adopting and promoting AI technologies in their companies and organizations.” The objective of the Women in AI initiative is to not only inspire girls and young women to pursue careers in artificial intelligence, but to also inform the world of the amazing feats that female pioneers in AI have achieved. In addition to IPsoft, IBM’s #SheCanStem campaign and the US Chamber of Commerce #LightaSpark campaign have both worked to highlight the gender gap in STEM, AI and data science fields by utilizing workshops and educational initiatives across the globe in order to effectively translate the critical, rewarding, and beneficial STEM message to girls and young women. Overall, these campaigns are the right step forward on the path to closing the gender gap and promoting females in STEM and STEM related careers. The more vigorous the effort, the more females will begin to see sizeable results in these fields. 
Mobilizing AI to Help Close the Gender Gap
Utilizing AI to solve the problem of the gender gap is a feasible and necessary solution. According to a report “What’s Keeping Women Out of Data Science?” by BCG GAMMA, “AI has the potential to mitigate the corporate gender and leadership gaps by removing bias in recruiting, evaluation, and promotion decisions; by helping improve retention of women employees; and, potentially, by intervening in the everyday interactions that affect employees’ sense of inclusion.” To elaborate, machine learning technologies can help employers assess candidates based on skills rather than gender, and talent-based qualification assessments have the potential to ameliorate bias in the selection/recruitment process, thus vastly benefiting women. Moreover, according to the program director of employment and earnings at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, Ariane Hegewisch, involving more females in STEM, AI and data science is vital to eliminating biased algorithms, which can also help address the gender gap. Ultimately, less bias in the workplace will lead to more females entering the STEM workforce, and can help boost retention rates. 
Female Trailblazers in AI Working To Inspire Women Everywhere
Placing a media emphasis on female trailblazers in AI and STEM is one of the most powerful, fast and effective ways that we can reach out to the women of the world about the opportunities that lie in the sciences and engineering. Some prominent names that are role models that come to mind include: Global GAMMA CTO and BCG Gamma Partner Andrea Gallego, Strategy Leader at IBM Saudi Arabia Deema Alathel, Co-founder of the Women in Machine Learning Conference Hanna Wallach, Founding CTO at NukkAI Veronique Ventos, Director of the MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) Daniela Rus and ChairWoman and CTO at Diagnostic Robotics Dr. Kira Radinsky.

Recommendations and Concluding Remarks 
In addition to the many initiatives set forth to combat the gender gap in STEM, the following list provides feasible and implementable efforts and campaigns that can be mobilized to further the female cause in science, technology, engineering, data science and AI. Moreover, a greater emphasis is placed on the importance of women and the maturity of enterprise AI initiatives. 
Some of the recommendations below were covered extensively in a previous Entrepreneur Magazine Publication entitled “Why We Need More Women in STEM and How AI Could Help Us Get There.”


An enterprise paradigm shift that recognizes females as central to upholding AI maturity levels: numerous studies have shown that diverse teams are necessary in order to reduce junk data and biased outcomes propagated by machine learning algorithms, as well as to improve overall technological efficiency of enterprise artificial intelligence capacities. Moreover, the easiest way to incorporate this diversity is to tap into the mass pool of women in the globe, and channel them towards artificial intelligence fields via a concerted effort that is enacted by top organizations of the world, such as IBM, Microsoft and the likes. These companies can then serve as industry role models in getting other enterprises to emphasize women in artificial intelligence, and will serve as a necessary and important catalyst for an overall paradigm shift that crowns women as central to harnessing the fullest potential of enterprise AI maturity levels.
Implementing reskilling/upskilling initiatives for women: 11% of jobs held by women at present moment are at risk for digital takeover, according to a BCG GAMMA report “How Reskilling Can Transform the Future of Work for Women.” Moreover, by 2022, it is estimated that over 50% of employees will need to be reskilled. Taking the first step towards implementing reskilling/upskilling initiatives for women will not only make the shift towards digital better and easier for all, but it will significantly benefit and encourage women to pursue STEM, AI and data science related positions. 
Taking advantage of reskilling campaigns: by taking the first steps of launching reskilling/upskilling campaigns specifically engineered for women, the STEM, data science and AI workforce will see a significant increase in labor force participation due to more female engagement, and will actually help accelerate progress in science and technology at a potentially unprecedented scale. 
Launching STEM/AI awareness campaigns specifically meant to educate women about the benefits and impact of a career in sciences and engineering.
Creating special science and technology tracks for girls that are designed to favor the learning patterns of young women and to get girls interested in STEM from a young age, beginning in primary school. 
Realizing a skills-based future: understanding that the future of the economy and the digital world lies in skill and talent, and not in static degrees and hierarchical structure that have tended to favor men in corporate positions for decades. 


These recommendations combined with already implemented efforts to combat the gender gap in STEM, data science and artificial intelligence are ways in which we can encourage females and ensure that women will receive equal employment opportunities in our new digital age. Moreover, digital organizations must integrate a mass emphasis on women if they will ever achieve their highest artificial intelligence maturity levels. Now more than ever is the time for us to tap into this global mass of female potential, and channel it in the form of incredible technological feats and advancements, one STEM career at a time.

Called upon by the United Nations, World Bank, INTERPOL, and leading enterprises, Daniel is a globally sought-after expert on the competitive strategy implications of AI for business and government leaders. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  While tech giants tend to hog the limelight on the cutting-edge of technology, AI in banking and other facets of the financial sector is showing signs of interest and adoption even among the banking incumbents. Discussions in the media around the emergence of AI in the banking industry range from the topic of automation and its potential to cut countless jobs to startup acquisitions. But the conversation in the C-suite is a little different. At Emerj, the AI Research and Advisory Company, we’ve spoken to dozens of banking executives as part of our AI Opportunity Landscape work, and one thing is clear: executives are eager to leverage AI for automating risk management processes, such as fraud detection and regulatory compliance. We discuss our research further in the “Insights Up Front” section of this article. Then we set out to study the AI applications and innovations at the top US banks, helping you to answer the following questions: What types of AI applications are currently in use by customers and employees and what applications are in the works at banking leaders JPMorgan Chase or Wells Fargo?  What common trends do their innovation efforts point to, and what does that mean for the future of banking? How much has been invested in AI and emerging tech innovation across leading US banks? Through quotes from company executives and data from our AI Opportunity Landscape in banking, this article serves to present a concise look at the implementation of AI at seven of America’s top commercial banks by revenue.  Changes in the banking industry directly impact businesses and commerce, and we sought to provide relevant insights for business leaders and professionals interested in the convergence of AI and financial technology. First, we’ll provide some insights about the state of AI in banking we discovered through exploring our data and interviews with banking executives Readers with a broader interest in AI’s applications across the financial sector may be interested in reading our article Artificial Intelligence in Finance, which covers a wider array of applications beyond the top US banks. Insights Up Front – Emerj Data Analysis The seven leading US commercial banks have prioritized technological advancement with investments in AI applications to better service their customers, improve performance and increase revenue. The future of finance will be heavily influenced by emerging fintech and AI applications setting the stage for increasing competition among the industry’s leading giants. Banks Will Have Trouble Acquiring AI Talent From our analysis of the top seven US banks, we’ve found an interesting but not surprising trend: it seems that larger banks (at the time of this writing) seem to have more robust AI applications in development and in use. This may reflect the tremendous difficulty of obtaining and retaining machine learning and AI talent. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook not only have a more alluring reputation for innovation, but they also have much higher profit-per-employee ratios, allowing them to shower top talent with higher salaries and excellent perks. It’s unlikely that even behemoths like JPMorgan Chase or Wells Fargo will be able to compete well against the tech giants in the AI talent war of the next decade. Banking Chatbots Are Hype In researching these seven firms, “chatbots” and “conversational interfaces” emerge as trends that seem to inspire enthusiasm and excitement in the banking world. That said, conversational interfaces (chatbots) make up roughly 13.5% of the AI vendor product offerings in banking, less than we would expect given that they make up nearly 39% of the AI use-cases across top 100 banks. More broadly, customer-facing Functions (Customer Service, Wealth Management, Marketing, and Sales) made up only 25% of the total AI vendor product offerings in banking. In contrast, risk-related Functions (Fraud and Cybersecurity, Compliance, Risk Management, and Financing and Loans) made up 56%. The full breakdown of AI vendor product offerings by function is provided in the graph below: This is visualized data from our full AI Opportunity Landscape in banking. We should note that banks are likely understating their use of AI for other use-cases, and the banking experts we interviewed for our research and our AI in Banking podcast all agree that banks are investing in AI for compliance and risk monitoring more than any other business area.  This plays out in the numbers; AI vendors selling products for Fraud and Cybersecurity, such as Feedzai, raised more money than any other AI vendors as a category (roughly 26% of the funds raised across AI vendors in banking). Compliance trailed at ~17%. At the same time, banks are likely overstating their use of AI for customer service applications, including chatbots because:  Chatbots are unlikely to deliver any kind of easily-measurable ROI The natural language processing technology behind them is still relatively nascent Even the best banking chatbots, such as Bank of America’s Erica, are still only able to handle rudimentary requests from customers It will be a while before the technology has advanced enough for chatbots to generate natural language and hold conversations with customers more often than they’re routing customers to customer support agents. It may very well be that more mundane business intelligence or cybersecurity will eat up most of the AI budget for these large banks, but it’s clear that chatbots have garnered the most excitement from the PR departments and spokespersons of the banking giants we researched. This is likely due to the fact that most banks want to appear on the cutting edge of technology and want to appear convenient for their customers. However, banks tend not to have any real AI strategy in mind when they’re publishing their chatbot efforts. According to Ian Wilson, former Head of AI at HSBC: The key question you’ll be hearing at the c suite in a bank particularly is ‘Whats next? What comes next? Where is the ROI?’ And often there is no answer to that question. There is no what’s next because there was nothing strategic put in place. It was just throw some mud at the wall and see what sticks. Which is fine to learn, but…I think you will see transitioning there is the recognition that we need to put some structure around this; we need to do this strategically. Banks Are Downplaying Disruption (Including Job Loss) Lastly, our research found a number of top banks referring to AI as an “augmenting” force for their employees, not a “replacement.” To us, this seems to be a necessary move of the communications department, but a disingenuous way to describe AI’s potential impact on jobs, which will most likely involve both “augmenting” and replacing human beings outright. Unlike many modern tech giants, old banks often have thousands of employees performing mundane paperwork and “legacy” processes, many of which may require complete elimination once machines can replace humans at the desk. Staff-heavy firms (including Accenture, who mostly echoed the same “augmentation” statement in our interview with their CTO) almost unanimously speak of AI in black-and-white terms. We believe that the future involves a number of disruptive changes that banks (and indeed all modern economies) will have to prepare themselves for. Next, we’ll explore the applications of each bank one-by-one, starting with JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the country by revenue. JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase upped its technology budget to $11.4 billion in 2019. In the video below, Manuela Veloso, Head of the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University and Head of AI Research at JP Morgan Chase and Samik Chandarana, Head of Analytics and Data Science at JP Morgan, discuss some of what JPMorgan Chase is doing with artificial intelligence: T  Internal Document Search – Contract Intelligence (COiN) JPMorgan Chase invested in technology and introduced a Contract Intelligence (COiN) “chatbot” designed to “analyze legal documents and extract important data points and clauses” in 2017. Manual review of 12,000 annual commercial credit agreements normally requires approximately 360,000 hours. Results from an initial implementation of this machine learning technology showed that the same amount of agreements could be reviewed in seconds. COiN has widespread potential and the company is exploring additional ways to implement this powerful tool, although further information on the rollout is sparse. Predictive Analytics – Emerging Opportunities Engine The Emerging Opportunities Engine, introduced in 2015 and discussed in a letter to shareholders, purportedly uses machine learning and natural language processing to help “identify clients best positioned for follow-on equity offerings.” The technology has proven successful in Equity Capital Markets and the company stated their intentions to expand it to other areas, including Debt Capital Markets, but it’s unclear if this has happened yet. Chatbot First successfully piloted in 2016, the bank also made plans to officially roll out a chatbot “to respond to employee technology service desk requests.” Initially, the bank set a goal for the chatbot to handle 120,000 service tickets, but like COiN, further information does not appear publicly available. Wells Fargo Chatbot Wells Fargo hasn’t publicized many artificial intelligence initiatives, but Steve Ellis, head of the bank’s Innovation Group, seemed eager to leverage AI in a 2017 press release for a chatbot pilot: AI technology allows us to take an experience that would have required our customers to navigate through several pages on our website, and turn it into a simple conversation in a chat environment. That’s a huge time-saving convenience for busy customers who are already frequent users of Messenger. The chatbot was piloted on Facebook Messenger and made available to 5,000 customers and employees. AI vendor Kasisto built the chatbot; the company was among the conversational interface vendors that scored highest on its Overall Score in our AI in Opportunity Landscape research, indicating relatively high funding, robust AI talent on its leadership team, and a history of success with its clients.  As a result, Wells Fargo’s chatbot was likely capable in comparison to others, but it’s unclear if the bank decided to roll out the chatbot to all of its customers.  Predictive Analytics – Predictive Banking However, customers do have access to Wells Fargo’s artificial intelligence-based Predictive Banking application via smartphones. Below is a brief video providing an overview of the software:  Predictive Banking includes features such as: Alerting customers of higher-than-average recurring billing payments Reminding a customer to transfer money into their savings account if they have more money than average in their checking account Prompting customers to set up a travel plan for their account after they’ve purchased a plane ticket Wells Fargo claims Predictive Banking can provide mobile app users with over 50 different prompts for various scenarios. Katherine McGee, Head of Digital Product Management at Wells Fargo, elaborated on one of these prompts in an email to Bank Innovation: If a customer receives an incoming deposit which is not in their usual pattern of transactions and is not needed to meet their normal expenses or scheduled payments, we can highlight the deposit and suggest the customer save the funds. McGee also said that Wells Fargo had planned to offer Predictive Banking to credit card and small business mobile customers in late 2018, but it’s unclear if they did so. Bank of America Interface of Erica’s Balance Watch function, courtesy of Bank of America Chatbot – Erica Bank of America piloted its popular chatbot, Erica, with company employees in late 2017.  The bank made the chatbot available to Rhode Islanders several months later, and by June 2018, all of Bank of America’s customers could download the Erica app on the company’s website. Erica can purportedly: Alert customers if their spending habits for the month will likely bring their balance to zero up to seven days in advance. This is likely done using predictive analytics and based on the customer’s average monthly spending, perhaps even what the customer purchases every month. Remind customers of recurring payments and whether or not they’re payment is scheduled after their due dates Flag recurring payments when they are higher than expected. This may be possible with anomaly detection, an AI approach used to detect deviations from the norm within real-time data. Lock and unlock a customer’s debit card on request When it comes to chatbots, Bank of America is leading its competitors. Erica boasts 6 million users as of March 2019. According to David Tyrie, the bank’s Head of Advanced Solutions and Digital Banking: Since launching Erica’s proactive insights [in late 2018], daily client engagement with Erica has doubled. Consistent with our high-tech, high-touch strategy, we’ll continue evolving our best-in-class digital banking capabilities, including Erica, to provide clients relevant, timely guidance and help make managing their finances easier.  CitiBank Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering According to our research, CitiBank has publicized its interest in artificial intelligence more than any other bank. We found 7 AI-related press releases across Citi’s assets. Through its investment and acquisitions wing, Citi Ventures, the bank boasts a global network of tech companies that participate in its six Citi Global Innovation Labs. In its portfolio of startup investments, particular attention has been given to eCommerce and cybersecurity. It’s made numerous investments in AI firms, including Feedzai, a fraud and anti-money laundering vendor, in 2016. Recently, Citi announced a strategic partnership with Feedzai to integrate its software into the bank’s fraud detection processes. Although the demo video below shows how Feedzai’s software works for eCommerce companies (and is admittedly a little corny), the principles it describes can certainly apply to banks:  Feedzai’s software will purportedly monitor customer payment behavior for deviations from that customer’s normal payment activity. These deviations might include an unusually large funds transfer or a payment made in a location that the customer isn’t known to frequent. The software would alert fraud analysts before the transaction clears. Manish Kholi, Global Head of Payments and Receivables at Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions, said this of the partnership: With the help of Feedzai’s solution, we can scale rapidly in an effort to deliver value to our clients, allowing them to make payments securely, efficiently and without friction, across the globe. Although the press release states that Citi is looking to launch the software in 2019, it’s unclear when or if it’s already happened. Citibank also purportedly worked with Ayasdi to pass the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. Feedzai and Ayasdiare both employ genuine AI talent on their leadership teams, indicating a high likelihood that the companies’ software are legitimately using AI. Ayasdi in particular is one of two companies that scored the maximum possible on its Overall Score across our AI Opportunity Landscape research in banking. US Bank Predictive Analytics – Expense Wizard US Bank recently launched Expense Wizard in collaboration with vendor Chrome River. Expense Wizard is an artificial intelligence-based expense management mobile app that allows users to charge businesses for travel expenses without having to pay up-front themselves first. The bank claims Expense Wizard is a chatbot that integrates into Chrome River’s expense reporting software. The software is explained further in the video below and a promotional video can be found on US Bank’s website:   According to US Bank, using Expense Wizard, a hiring manager can provide a virtual card to a candidate via the app, setting a card limit via US Bank. The candidate would then receive access to the card through the Expense Wizard app, allowing them to buy plane tickets and book a hotel. They can also access details about the flight and hotel in the app. The candidate can then use the app to make other travel-related purchases. All of these purchases are recorded and sent to the business for final approval. At the end of the candidate’s trip, they can submit the expense report to the business. Bradley Matthews, Senior Vice President, Head of Product Management and Marketing at US Bank, had this to say about the software: While talking with customers, we found consistent frustration around managing expenses for both non-employees and employees who travel without a corporate card. They needed to eliminate manual processes, make payments easy and control expenses. We worked closely with our innovation team and Chrome River to develop something completely revolutionary that brings mobile wallet technology and AI to the process, creating efficiency in a system that has been largely unchanged for years. PNC Data Infrastructure Overhaul PNC invested $1.2.billion over five years, according to its 2016 annual report, into modernizing its “core infrastructure and build[ing] out key technological and operational capabilities,” with the objective of faster, more secure and more stable operations and services. Still in the early stages of its tech strategy, the company’s initial focus has been on the consolidation of its data centers and a major shift to an “internal cloud environment.” We can presume that the company’s infrastructure upgrades will help them leverage data and implement artificial intelligence and machine learning. PNC seems to have worked with AI vendor Anaconda to start this, working with the vendor to overhaul its data science infrastructure for Python and R. As a result, Anaconda claims PNC is currently able to build machine learning models in-house, and as of summer 2018, the bank was purportedly looking to migrate their infrastructure into Anaconda Enterprise 5.2. It’s unclear if they’ve done so at this time. Bank of NY Mellon Corp Robotic Process Automation The 233-year-old financial institution is banking on “bots,” specifically robotic process automation (RPA), to improve the efficiency of its operations and to reduce costs. Although RPA is not AI, RPA software sometimes integrates artificial intelligence. In addition, contrary to its name, white-collar processes are carried out not by physical robots, but by software applications. These applications, known as web robots or Internet bots, are programmed to process automated tasks. In May 2017, the bank announced that over the past 15 months, the company has rolled out more than 220 bots developed by Blue Prism for handling tasks that are often repetitive in nature and normally handled by staff. Examples include “data requests from external auditors” and “funds transfer bots” which help “correct formatting and data mistakes in requests for dollar funds transfers.” The video below provides an explanation for how Blue Prism’s AI software works:  Former Senior Executive Vice President and Global Head of Client Service Delivery at BNY Mellon Corp, Doug Shulman, said this about the bank’s investment in RPA: If you think about smart automation, robotics is a piece, workflow is a piece, and we’re combining smart forms, optical character recognition, workflow and robotics to get momentum around automating tasks. BNY Mellon reports that the implementation of RPA has led to the following results: 100 percent accuracy in account-closure validations across five systems 88 percent improvement in processing time 66 percent improvement in trade entry turnaround time ¼-second robotic reconciliation of a failed trade vs. 5-10 minutes by a human From a financial perspective, the corporation estimates that the activity of its “funds transfer bots” alone is responsible for $300,000 in annual savings. These bots cut down on the time employees spend processing payments and resolving data errors. In addition to increased efficiency and reduced costs, in their 2016 annual report, industry competition is emphasized as another reason behind the bank’s increased integration of AI technology.

Arik Hill, the charity’s chief information officer, blames the data entry drudgery for an annual staff turnover of 42 percent at the time. “We are not a very glamorous industry,” says Hill. “We are really only just moving on from paper clinical records.”Since then, the New York Foundling has automated much of this grunt work using what are known as software robots—simple programs hand-crafted to perform dull tasks. Often, the programs are built by recording and mimicking a user’s keystrokes, such as copying a field of text from one database and pasting it into another, eliminating hours of repetitive-stress-inducing work.Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AI“It was mind-blowing,” says Hill, who says turnover has fallen to 17 percent.To automate the work, the New York Foundling got help from UiPath, a so-called robotic process automation company.

In call centers, fewer people are needed to fill out forms if software can be programmed to open the right documents, find the right fields, and enter text. At the New York Foundling, Hill’s software allowed him to redirect eight workers to other tasks.But Davenport says software robots that use AI could displace more jobs, especially if we head into a recession. “Companies will use it for substantial headcount and cost reductions,” he says.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDErik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and the author of several books exploring the impact of technology on the workforce, says robotic process automation will mostly affect middle-skilled office workers, meaning admin work that requires some training.But it won’t happen overnight. He says it took many years for simple software robots, which are essentially descended from screen-scrapers and simple coding tools, to affect office work. “The lesson is just how long it takes for even a relatively simple technology to have an impact on business, because of the hard work it takes to implement it reliably in complex environments,” Brynjolfsson notes.Data science and machine learning already play a role in what’s known as process mining. This involves using software to monitor the tasks that office workers perform, to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.Wil van der Aalst, a professor at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, who coined the term process mining and has pioneered research on the subject, notes that the techniques involved are not what people think of today as AI, but older statistical techniques. He says the machine learning algorithms that make headlines today tend to be best suited for specific tasks such as image or voice recognition.Keep ReadingThe latest on artificial intelligence, from machine learning to computer vision and moreLeslie Willcocks, a professor at the London School of Economics who specializes in business process automation, says the process automation industry has yet to fully take off. Obstacles include siloed data that software robots can’t easily access, incompatible infrastructure, and the fact that many offices have never used automation before. But he believes this is how AI will ultimately arrive inside most businesses.“I am not seeing strong AI being deployed in the vast majority of businesses globally, if you exclude the top technology companies,” Willcocks says. “But there will be a turning point when businesses will deploy these technologies better. It may take five years, [but] it’s a slow train coming.”Even if AI does transform robotic process automation, there will be risks involved, says Davenport of Babson College. The trend may feed a natural human tendency to use automation beyond its capabilities, and this could prove especially problematic when using machine learning methods that are difficult to interpret. “You could be using it to make important decisions like issuing credit or preventing fraud,” he says. “And the algorithms making the decisions in the process may not be transparent to the managers having to make the decision to keep the automated system going.”Such reservations seem unlikely to dampen believers’ enthusiasm, though. Guy Kirkwood, the chief evangelist at UiPath, says the vision is for software robots to be a lot more like the AI of science fiction, eventually taking over how they are programmed from start to finish.“The direction of travel—and we’re not there yet—is that we’ll be able to create self-building robots, where the system just watches what the human does, works out where there's repeatable activity, and works out what the optimum route is with all the variances and the exceptions,” he says “That would be pretty cool.”Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

But Davenport says software robots that use AI could displace more jobs, especially if we head into a recession. “Companies will use it for substantial headcount and cost reductions,” he says.
Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and the author of several books exploring the impact of technology on the workforce, says robotic process automation will mostly affect middle-skilled office workers, meaning admin work that requires some training.
But it won’t happen overnight. He says it took many years for simple software robots, which are essentially descended from screen-scrapers and simple coding tools, to affect office work. “The lesson is just how long it takes for even a relatively simple technology to have an impact on business, because of the hard work it takes to implement it reliably in complex environments,” Brynjolfsson notes.
Data science and machine learning already play a role in what’s known as process mining. This involves using software to monitor the tasks that office workers perform, to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
Wil van der Aalst, a professor at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, who coined the term process mining and has pioneered research on the subject, notes that the techniques involved are not what people think of today as AI, but older statistical techniques. He says the machine learning algorithms that make headlines today tend to be best suited for specific tasks such as image or voice recognition.
Leslie Willcocks, a professor at the London School of Economics who specializes in business process automation, says the process automation industry has yet to fully take off. Obstacles include siloed data that software robots can’t easily access, incompatible infrastructure, and the fact that many offices have never used automation before. But he believes this is how AI will ultimately arrive inside most businesses.
“I am not seeing strong AI being deployed in the vast majority of businesses globally, if you exclude the top technology companies,” Willcocks says. “But there will be a turning point when businesses will deploy these technologies better. It may take five years, [but] it’s a slow train coming.”
Even if AI does transform robotic process automation, there will be risks involved, says Davenport of Babson College. The trend may feed a natural human tendency to use automation beyond its capabilities, and this could prove especially problematic when using machine learning methods that are difficult to interpret. “You could be using it to make important decisions like issuing credit or preventing fraud,” he says. “And the algorithms making the decisions in the process may not be transparent to the managers having to make the decision to keep the automated system going.”
Such reservations seem unlikely to dampen believers’ enthusiasm, though. Guy Kirkwood, the chief evangelist at UiPath, says the vision is for software robots to be a lot more like the AI of science fiction, eventually taking over how they are programmed from start to finish.
“The direction of travel—and we’re not there yet—is that we’ll be able to create self-building robots, where the system just watches what the human does, works out where there's repeatable activity, and works out what the optimum route is with all the variances and the exceptions,” he says “That would be pretty cool.”

Artificial intelligence (AI) will change the way we learn and work in the near future. Nearly 400 million workers globally will change their occupations in the next 10 years, and business schools are uniquely situated to respond to the shifts coming to the future of work. However, a recent study, “Implications of Artificial Intelligence on Business Schools and Lifelong Learning,” shows that business schools remain cautious in adapting management education to address the changing needs of students, workers and organizations, writes Anne Trumbore in this opinion piece. Trumbore, one of the study’s coauthors, is senior director of Wharton Online, a strategic digital learning initiative at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
In the past few weeks, COVID-19 has moved hundreds of millions of students around the globe from physical to online classes. Some schools in Asia are going a step further to use AI to deliver personalized learning to students. All schools in the UK have access to the technology so that when students do return to school, they will not only have kept up with their studies, but their teachers will also have a full report on their progress. And yet very few business schools are deploying these same technologies at scale, even though their future MBA students are getting a crash course in AI-enabled learning right now. How will business schools remain relevant in the age of AI?
We anticipate AI will change the way we learn and work in the near future. Nearly 400 million workers globally will change their occupations within the next 10 years. Because business schools not only prepare students for the workforce but also create scholarship about business practices, they are uniquely situated to respond to the shifts coming to the future of work. But our recent study, “Implications of Artificial Intelligence on Business Schools and Lifelong Learning,” shows that business schools are mostly cautious in adapting management education to satisfy the coming needs of students, workers and organizations. This circumspect approach begs the question: Will MBAs educated today using methods from the past be employable for the jobs of the future?
Global Study
To gain a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities AI presents for business schools, and to clarify the current state of AI adoption in global business education, we conducted 43 interviews with academic, corporate, and technological leaders around the world. We spoke with 29 deans and other senior academic leaders from business schools in Africa, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, Europe, North America, Asia, Australia and Latin America to get a comprehensive picture of AI adoption today. We also spoke with six global companies deploying AI as part of their talent development and management efforts as well as eight platform providers of AI-facilitated (primarily through curation or “intelligent recommendation”) business education.
Will MBAs educated today using methods from the past be employable for the jobs of the future?
We found that a handful of schools are building AI-enabled platforms to provide personalized educational pathways for lifelong learning, to encourage course success for on-campus students and to increase peer-to-peer interaction, but most schools are experimenting on a lesser scale. Politecnico Milan, for instance, has launched Flexa, an AI-powered, business education recommendation engine to provide continuous, personalized learning to students, alumni and companies.
Schools across the globe are running multiple pilots with different technologies, such as RPA (Robotic Process Automation), chatbots, IBM Watson, and others. A number of schools have created robust cross-collaborations with both corporations — such as Microsoft and IBM — as well as with other schools on campus, particularly engineering and computer science. Yet, U.S. universities face multiple barriers in creating truly personalized learning pathways, including data privacy issues, lack of staff talent, faculty resistance and lack of institutional funding and/or commitment.
Meanwhile, corporations and platform providers are working much faster to invent and adopt new AI technologies to improve and validate skills acquisition and learning. Degreed, Skillsoft, Coursera and others are using data science and machine learning to help customize education, while some corporations are partnering with Microsoft and Google, as well as smaller companies like Filtered to create AI-powered customized learning.
Updating Traditional Curricula
As AI and related technologies displace jobs and workers, traditional business-school curricula will need to be updated to provide students with the skills they need to manage and lead in a rapidly changing world. AI-augmented roles will require workers with stronger skills in areas like ethics, leadership, emotional intelligence, and change management. Our research showed a clear opportunity for business schools to teach these human skills that in-person MBA and executive education programs excel at providing.
While corporations and platform providers work quickly to develop courses in new technologies and business practices, business schools can capitalize on the more sustained attention of their students and their decades of experience in creating programs that offer students the opportunity to thoughtfully consider the ethical, moral and environmental consequences of AI-augmented business practices. Business schools have the privileged position of being able to double down on collaborative, hands-on learning experiences that tackle complex, real world challenges, where the best solution is not necessarily the most profitable one. Courses in ethics, data protection and security, distributed leadership, managing innovation and AI governance will be highly desirable to MBA candidates and executive education clients.
AI-augmented roles will require workers with stronger skills in areas like ethics, leadership, emotional intelligence, and change management.
Ultimately, the greatest threat to business schools from AI is to the relevance of the MBA. The traditional pace of knowledge creation cannot keep up with rate of change AI is bringing to business. As corporations improve at providing their employees targeted, relevant business topics at scale, the value proposition of the MBA comes into question. To maintain the value of the MBA, business schools should focus on the topics and skills that corporations either can’t teach or teach well. In addition, business schools should develop new ways of teaching that incorporate AI to give students more immersive learning experiences with immediate, personalized feedback. Professors should not be afraid of being replaced by robots. As noted education and AI researcher Ryan Baker writes, “…we need stupid tutoring systems and intelligent humans. Business schools should not lose sight of the opportunities afforded by these disruptive technological advances. AI provides the ability to improve the student experience, streamline operations and develop efficiencies of scale. AI technologies can make administration more efficient and improve student experience. Beginning with better identification of potential students, to the ability to create diverse and well-rounded classes, to better academic and career advising, AI has the potential to improve the student experience while cutting operational costs.
Personalizing Learning
To survive and thrive in an AI-enabled world, business schools must be open to the following:

New methods of knowledge creation that speed up the research cycle. Working with industry data and collaborating with industry experts for teaching and research, collaborating with other schools such as engineering, computer science, education or medical schools, and finding alternative, reputable outlets for publication beyond peer reviewed academic journals all promise to make relevant content more quickly.
More data-driven, personalized and effective learning experiences for students. Future MBA candidates will be exposed to AI-enabled education K-12, at university or in the workplace. It is reasonable to assume that they will have similar expectations of business education — and that it will be customizable, adaptive and immersive — and delivered both inside and outside the classroom.
Taking AI technologies seriously and making related investments. Since most business schools will be unable to devote the necessary resources to develop their own AI capabilities, it will be critical to partner with technology vendors to provide personalized learning experiences that support existing students and offer alumni and others relevant lifelong learning.
Immediately addressing AI’s challenges: ethics, privacy, quality of training data, transparency of algorithms and data security. Rather than letting AI’s risks become a barrier to adoption, business schools can take the lead on developing a coalition for shared governance, empowering faculty, talented staff, students, and experts to work together to develop school and university policies and solutions to address these concerns. Creating a coalition of business schools is another option to explore, as is working with government policymakers to develop sustainable and thoughtful solutions.

Taking the steps outlined above can help move business schools into the future and ensure their survival. Avoiding these challenges could very well result in students avoiding their MBA programs. For schools like Politecnico Milan, disruption from the coronavirus allows them to improve their recommendation algorithms and reach new populations of distance learners. Schools without these capabilities, however, will have to provide value to future MBA students in a world where AI-enabled education is more widely used by students than by business schools.

As China initiated its response to the virus, it leaned on its strong technology sector and specifically artificial intelligence (AI), data science, and technology to track and fight the pandemic while tech leaders, including Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei and more accelerated their company's healthcare initiatives. As a result, tech startups are integrally involved with clinicians, academics, and government entities around the world to activate technology as the virus continues to spread to many other countries. Here are 10 ways artificial intelligence, data science, and technology are being used to manage and fight COVID-19.
Coronavirus: How Artificial Intelligence, Data Science And Technology Is Used To Fight The PandemicAdobe Stock

1. AI to identify, track and forecast outbreaks

The better we can track the virus, the better we can fight it. By analyzing news reports, social media platforms, and government documents, AI can learn to detect an outbreak. Tracking infectious disease risks by using AI is exactly the service Canadian startup BlueDot provides. In fact, the BlueDot’s AI warned of the threat several days before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organization issued their public warnings. 

2. AI to help diagnose the virus

Artificial intelligence company Infervision launched a coronavirus AI solution that helps front-line healthcare workers detect and monitor the disease efficiently. Imaging departments in healthcare facilities are being taxed with the increased workload created by the virus. This solution improves CT diagnosis speed. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba also built an AI-powered diagnosis system they claim is 96% accurate at diagnosing the virus in seconds.

3. Process healthcare claims
It’s not only the clinical operations of healthcare systems that are being taxed but also the business and administrative divisions as they deal with the surge of patients. A blockchain platform offered by Ant Financial helps speed up claims processing and reduces the amount of face-to-face interaction between patients and hospital staff.
4. Drones deliver medical supplies
One of the safest and fastest ways to get medical supplies where they need to go during a disease outbreak is with drone delivery. Terra Drone is using its unmanned aerial vehicles to transport medical samples and quarantine material with minimal risk between Xinchang County’s disease control centre and the People’s Hospital. Drones also are used to patrol public spaces, track non-compliance to quarantine mandates, and for thermal imaging.

5. Robots sterilize, deliver food and supplies and perform other tasks
Robots aren’t susceptible to the virus, so they are being deployed to complete many tasks such as cleaning and sterilizing and delivering food and medicine to reduce the amount of human-to-human contact. UVD robots from Blue Ocean Robotics use ultraviolet light to autonomously kill bacteria and viruses. In China, Pudu Technology deployed its robots that are typically used in the catering industry to more than 40 hospitals around the country.

6. Develop drugs
Google’s DeepMind division used its latest AI algorithms and its computing power to understand the proteins that might make up the virus, and published the findings to help others develop treatments.  BenevolentAI uses AI systems to build drugs that can fight the world’s toughest diseases and is now helping support the efforts to treat coronavirus, the first time the company focused its product on infectious diseases. Within weeks of the outbreak, it used its predictive capabilities to propose existing drugs that might be useful.

7. Advanced fabrics offer protection
Companies such as Israeli startup Sonovia hope to arm healthcare systems and others with face masks made from their anti-pathogen, anti-bacterial fabric that relies on metal-oxide nanoparticles.
8. AI to identify non-compliance or infected individuals
While certainly a controversial use of technology and AI, China’s sophisticated surveillance system used facial recognition technology and temperature detection software from SenseTime to identify people who might have a fever and be more likely to have the virus. Similar technology powers ""smart helmets"" used by officials in Sichuan province to identify people with fevers. The Chinese government has also developed a monitoring system called Health Code that uses big data to identify and assesses the risk of each individual based on their travel history, how much time they have spent in virus hotspots, and potential exposure to people carrying the virus. Citizens are assigned a color code (red, yellow, or green), which they can access via the popular apps WeChat or Alipay to indicate if they should be quarantined or allowed in public. 
9. Chatbots to share information
Tencent operates WeChat, and people can access free online health consultation services through it. Chatbots have also been essential communication tools for service providers in the travel and tourism industry to keep travelers updated on the latest travel procedures and disruptions.
10. Supercomputers working on a coronavirus vaccine
The cloud computing resources and supercomputers of several major tech companies such as Tencent, DiDi, and Huawei are being used by researchers to fast-track the development of a cure or vaccine for the virus. The speed these systems can run calculations and model solutions is much faster than standard computer processing.
In a global pandemic such as COVID-19, technology, artificial intelligence, and data science have become critical to helping societies effectively deal with the outbreak.

The technology is proving itself evidently beneficial in revolutionizing the workplace culture as well. AI tends to guide, organize and automate work while improving staff efficiency and productivity. Specifically, when AI is blended with automation, it maximizes the company profits by utilizing the minimum manpower yet in a right and creative manner. The technical improvements brought in by them contribute to the management of several tasks in the office that are achieved effortlessly and employees' work becomes less tiring..Market Analysis by Gartner:.Artificial intelligence (AI) will be widely adopted in office environments in a variety of ways over the next few years as businesses invest in digital workplace initiatives, said Gartner analysts in their 2019 analysis. The trend is expected to gather steam as voice-activated personal assistants that have proved a hit at home begin to make inroads in the office..By 2025, the technology will &quot;certainly be mainstream,&quot; said Matthew Cain, vice president, and distinguished analyst at Gartner – even though privacy and security concerns have limited deployments so far. Cain was among the analysts who spoke at Gartner's Digital Workplace Summit..Gartner has separately predicted that consumer and business spending on smart speakers will pass $3.5 billion in 2021, with 25 percent of digital workers using an AI assistant on a daily basis within the next two years. A number of companies have already deployed the technology, though WeWork reportedly put its Alexa for Business deployment on hold last year..Case Study 1:.The New York Foundling which is a charity that offers child welfare, adoption, and mental health services, was stuck in cut-and-paste hell in 2018. The clinicians and admin staff were spending hours transferring text between different documents and databases to meet varied legal requirements. Arik Hill, the charity's chief information officer, blames the data entry drudgery for an annual staff turnover of 42 percent at the time. &quot;We are not a very glamorous industry,&quot; says Hill. &quot;We are really only just moving on from paper clinical records.&quot;.Since then, the New York Foundling has automated much of this grunt work using what are known as software robots—simple programs hand-crafted to perform dull tasks. Often, the programs are built by recording and mimicking a user's keystrokes, such as copying a field of text from one database and pasting it into another, eliminating hours of repetitive-stress-inducing work. &quot;It was mind-blowing,&quot; says Hill, who says turnover has fallen to 17 percent..To automate the work, the New York Foundling got help from UiPath, a so-called robotic process automation company. That project didn't require any real machine intelligence..But in January, UiPath began upgrading its army of software bots to use powerful new artificial intelligence algorithms. It thinks this will let them take on more complex and challenging tasks, such as transcription or sorting images, across more offices. Ultimately, the company hopes software robots will gradually learn how to automate repetitive work for themselves..In other words, if artificial intelligence is going to disrupt white-collar work, then this may be how it begins..Case Study 2:.When Matt Radwell, a customer support officer for a small local authority in the UK, first started answering queries from the area's residents, it was a frustrating and time-consuming business. If a resident contacted Aylesbury Vale District Council, 40 miles north of London, about an issue like housing benefit in which he lacked expertise, Mr. Radwell might keep the caller waiting as long as 20 minutes. He had to find someone who could give him the relevant information..Over the past two years, however, his job has been transformed. When a resident types a question into the council's online chat facility, an advanced computer system starts reading it..For around 40 percent of inquiries, the system — which has been trained to recognize residents' questions by using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence — presents Mr. Radwell and other customer support officers with a series of potential, pre-written responses. Each is labeled with an estimated probability of its being the correct choice. If one is appropriate, Mr. Radwell clicks on it, satisfying the resident far more quickly and easily than before..The council's machine learning system — provided by Digital Genius, a San Francisco-based specialist in customer service systems — has put it at the forefront of a transformation underway in millions of white-collar jobs worldwide..Experts' Opinions:.Tom Davenport, a professor who studies information technology and management at Babson College says, &quot;When paired with robotic process automation, AI significantly expands the number and types of tasks that software robots can perform.&quot;.He also added, &quot;software robots that use AI could displace more jobs, especially if we head into a recession. Companies will use it for substantial headcount and cost reductions.&quot;.Even if AI does transform robotic process automation, there will be risks involved, says Davenport of Babson College. The trend may feed a natural human tendency to use automation beyond its capabilities, and this could prove especially problematic when using machine learning methods that are difficult to interpret. &quot;You could be using it to make important decisions like issuing a credit or preventing fraud,&quot; he says. &quot;And the algorithms making the decisions in the process may not be transparent to the managers having to make the decision to keep the automated system going.&quot;.Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and the author of several books exploring the impact of technology on the workforce, says &quot;robotic process automation will mostly affect middle-skilled office workers, meaning admin work that requires some training.&quot; But it won't happen overnight. He says it took many years for simple software robots, which are essentially descended from screen-scrapers and simple coding tools, to affect office work. &quot;The lesson is just how long it takes for even a relatively simple technology to have an impact on business, because of the hard work it takes to implement it reliably in complex environments,&quot; Brynjolfsson notes..Wil van der Aalst, a professor at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, who coined the term process mining and has pioneered research on the subject, notes that &quot;the techniques involved are not what people think of today as AI, but older statistical techniques.&quot; He says the machine learning algorithms that make headlines today tend to be best suited for specific tasks such as image or voice recognition..Leslie Willcocks, a professor at the London School of Economics who specializes in business process automation, says the process automation industry has yet to fully take off. Obstacles include siloed data that software robots can't easily access, incompatible infrastructure, and the fact that many offices have never used automation before. But he believes this is how AI will ultimately arrive inside most businesses..Willcocks further added, &quot;I am not seeing strong AI being deployed in the vast majority of businesses globally if you exclude the top technology companies. But there will be a turning point when businesses will deploy these technologies better. It may take five years, [but] it's a slow train coming.&quot;.Guy Kirkwood, the chief evangelist at UiPath, says the vision is for software robots to be a lot more like the AI of science fiction, eventually taking over how they are programmed from start to finish..&quot;The direction of travel—and we're not there yet—is that we'll be able to create self-building robots, where the system just watches what the human does, works out where there's a repeatable activity, and works out what the optimum route is with all the variances and the exceptions,&quot; he says. &quot;That would be pretty cool.&quot;.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Today, with the wealth of freely available educational content online, it may not be necessary. There are so many courses, tutorials, and guides available online that it is perfectly possible to gain a thorough grounding in these subjects without paying a penny. What’s more, you can study at your own speed in your own time. Some of these materials are produced by the world’s leading universities, while others are put together by experienced professionals keen to share their knowledge.

These courses are aimed at a range of different audiences – maybe you want to actually learn how to design and code AI algorithms, maybe you want to bolt together the increasing range of “DIY” AI tools and services that are available, or maybe you need to manage AI projects in your organization. Whatever your needs, you are likely to find something here that will expand your horizons.

Elements of AI - Helsinki University

This is an elementary-level class aimed at anyone who wants to understand what AI does, how it might affect them, and what it can be used for, without getting involved in the underlying mathematics and statistics. It demonstrates that in-depth knowledge of those fields isn't necessary to start taking advantage of the opportunities offered by AI and machine learning, and includes practical exercises. Originally available only in Finland (and in Finnish) as part of the government's drive to educate its population on AI, last year, the decision was made to make it available to the world.
Learn with Google AI
This collection of tutorials, guides, and resources has grown considerably since I last highlighted it. As well as basic tutorials covering the fundamentals, it also offers instructions on applying AI and ML to social, environmental and humanitarian challenges, as well information on how to ensure that your AI implementations are both ethical and “people-centric"". This all helps to build a broad understanding of the many factors – technological or otherwise – that are important to consider when considering how AI could work for you.

Machine Learning – Stanford University (Coursera)
Often cited by AI experts as the single most important online resource for anyone wanting to learn AI, this course is led by Andrew Ng, who founded Google’s pioneering Google Brain deep learning program. This course gives a thorough grounding in the mathematical, statistical, and computer science fundamentals that go into developing and deploying automated learning machines.
AI for Everyone – Andrew Ng (Coursera)
Another course from Andrew Ng – this one explicitly aimed at those who don’t need an in-depth technical understanding of the subject but who may want to begin leveraging AI in their organizations or working to roll out AI initiatives while working with non-technical teams. It covers the workflow of running AI projects as well as how to develop a strategy around AI deployments in business.
Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials – Microsoft (EdX)
This course is also listed in my guide to the best free data science courses. Of course, there's a great deal of crossover between the two subjects, as data science is the foundation of all of today's AI. If you're confused about the terminology, then think of machine learning as a technique that leverages data science to work towards achieving what we currently understand as AI. This course gives a great overview as it starts by explaining the core data science concepts before moving on to demonstrate how they are applied in machine learning.
Machine Learning Crash Course - Google
Another Google course, and this one is said to be required reading for everyone whose work is involved with AI at the tech giant. This course covers the basics but also moves onto the theory and practical applications of TensorFlow, Google’s open-source deep-learning library that it uses in many of its own AI-enhanced services and projects.
Learning From Data (Introductory Machine Learning) - Caltech (EdX)
Starting with theoretical principles such as ""what is learning?"" and ""can machines learn?"" this course covers advanced practical applications including creating ML algorithms used to power neural networks. It aims to help those who are set on a career as a data scientist or analyst. Like many of the courses covered here, all of the materials are freely available, but you can pay $50 for official certification at the end.
Artificial Intelligence A-Z: Learn How To Build An AI - Udemy
Another course that takes a slightly different approach, here you are taken through the practical steps necessary to build machines that solve a number of real-world AI problems, such as driving a car or playing a game. It also covers Q-learning, a form of machine learning based on reinforcement learning, that is gaining in popularity in cutting-edge applications.
Creative Applications of Deep Learning With Tensorflow – Kadenze (Class Central)
Deep learning is one of the most advanced fields of AI, and one that is pushing the boundaries of creating machines that can think and learn like humans. This is another course focused on the open-source TensorFlow framework originally created by Google for use in Deep Learning, and is one that has received good reviews for giving an easy-to-follow guide to a complex technical subject.

Technology is one sector that is constantly evolving and finds purpose in every thinkable domain. There is an upward graph for number of innovative technologies and the number of industries adopting the technology. This decade’s most happening topic in the tech industry is the emergence of Artificial Intelligence and it has had a successful entry into HR tech startups. 
Following the other sectors’ lead of replacing predictable and repetitive tasks with AI, HR tech startups are also choosing AI for intelligent and disrupting hiring technologies. 
One major area of HR that faces the maximum pain points is Recruitment. It is a very challenging task as it could make or break your organisation. Identifying the right candidate, engaging with the candidate and then, onboarding them is a long process that could be partly handled by AI. 
Here are 5 HR Tech Startups that are using AI for recruitment and more: 
Trabaajo
Backed by their parent company Xenture, this AI-based application helps in finding the right job or candidate for the suggested profile. By automating the process of matching skill requirements with qualified individuals, the hiring process is faster and easier.
Founded by Sunaina Agarwal and Arun Kumar, the company offers real-time video interviews and is aiming to create a job market across all domains and countries. 
iXceed Solutions
A Talent and Workforce Solutions services company, iXceed is a service provider to Fortune 500 companies and primarily focuses on these domains globally: Technology, IT consulting and Engineering Consulting. 
The company uses Artificial Intelligence-based recruitment solutions to create an in-class experience for both clients and candidates. Some of their clients are- Infosys, HCL, Oracle, Mindtree, NIIT, etc. It is co-founded by Yogita Tulsian, who is also its Director. 
EdGE Networks
The edge in EdGE Networks is its AI-powered products that auto-source, auto-screen and auto-engage the best candidates for the role and along with this, the AI also recommends options for career paths and draws up a personalised learning curve for employees.
The company began operations in 2012 and has developed productivity tools by leveraging AI. These tools help businesses identify pain points in their processes such as talent acquisition, workforce optimization, talent transformation, and workforce planning. 
Arjun Pratap is the CEO and Founder of EdGE Networks. 
Darwinbox
Slightly unconventional to the pain points listed above, Darwinbox is a cloud-based HR solutions firm. The company provides solution for more than recruitment process such as core processes, employee engagement, performance management, employee movement,etc.
Established in 2015, the company’s platform uses AI to pick keywords in job profiles that match the description so the recruiters can draw up a ranking metric. Its clientele includes Paytm, Ekart, Spencer’s, Delhivery, etc. Darwinbox is founded by Rohit Chennamaneni, Chaitanya Peddi, and Jayant Paleti. 
Dockabl
This company focuses more on the ‘after’ recruitment part. It is an employee experience platform that provides organizations with the ability to constantly manage performance. 
The tools provided by the company are tech-enabled and help in structuring goals, tracking progress, real-time feedback and peer recognition. This app aims at benefiting and serving all members of an organization fairly. Samarth Massan and Sanjeev Grover are the co-founders of Dockabl. 
Concluding…
Being a division that deals with human beings, there is bound to be unpredictability. By automating regular and redundant tasks, HR professionals can concentrate more other important processes of planning, execution, and implementation of policies. There will be more time to structure the organization and understand what culture is best suited for it.
