Then an artificial intelligence (AI) software system assessed my personality, and either passed or failed me. No human had a look-in.I wondered: is it fair for a computer alone to accept or reject your job application?Welcome to the fast-growing world of AI recruitment. While recruiters have been using AI for around the past decade, the technology has been greatly refined in recent years. And demand for it has risen strongly since the pandemic, thanks to its convenience and fast results at a time when staff may be off due to Covid-19.The AI recruitment software that put me through the above test was provided by a New York-based firm called Pymetrics.The questions, and your answers to them, are designed to evaluate several aspects of a jobseeker's personality and intelligence, such as your risk tolerance and how quickly you respond to situations.Or as Pymetrics puts it, ""to fairly and accurately measure cognitive and emotional attributes in only 25 minutes"".Its AI software is now used in the initial recruitment processes of a number of multinational companies, such as McDonald's, bank JP Morgan, accountancy firm PWC, and food group Kraft Heinz. An interview with a human recruiter then follows if you pass.""It's about helping firms process a much wider pool [of applicants], and getting signals that someone will be successful in a job,"" says Pymetrics founder Frida Polli.Frank EllisFrida Polli says that the results of the AI test are more beneficial than reading a candidate's resume or CV""Everyone wants the right job, and to hire the right person. It doesn't benefit anyone for the match to be off. Trying to use these AI systems in smart ways is to everyone's advantage."" Another provider of AI recruitment software is Utah-based HireVue. Its AI system records videos of job applicants answering interview questions via their laptop's webcam and microphone.The audio of this is then converted into text, and an AI algorithm analyses it for key words, such as the use of ""I"" instead of ""we"" in response to questions about teamwork. The recruiting company can then choose to let HireVue's system reject candidates without having a human double-check, or have the candidate moved on for a video interview with an actual recruiter.HireVue says that by September 2019 it had conducted a total of 12 million interviews, of which 20% were via the AI software. The remaining 80% were with a human interviewer on the other end of a video screen. The overall figure has now risen to 19 million, with the same percentage split.HireVue first started offering the AI interviews in 2016. Its users include travel services firm Sabre.Meanwhile, a report from 2019 said that such is the growth in the use of AI that it will replace 16% of recruitment sector jobs before 2029.Kevin Parker, the chief executive of HireVue, says the AI is more impartial than a human interviewer. ""There's a desire to have a fair process, and AI can help evaluate all those candidates in a very consistent way,"" he says.HireVueThe HireVue system sees the jobseeker upload a video of him or herself answering a series of questionsPymetrics also says that its system ensures more fairness, and that ""every algorithm is rigorously tested for bias"". Ms Polli adds that it is better than firms simply relying upon a candidate's resume or CV.""A resume can only give information about someone's hard skills, but research and common sense tells us that it's also soft skills that contribute to job success,"" she says.So, AI recruitment is nothing to worry about? Online retail giant Amazon doesn't think so.In 2018 it was widely reported to have scrapped its own system, because it showed bias against female applicants. The Reuters news agency said that Amazon's AI system had ""taught itself that male candidates were preferable"" because they more often had greater tech industry experience on their resume. Amazon declined to comment at the time.Getty ImagesAmazon is said to have scrapped its AI recruitment system back in 2018James Meachin of UK business psychology consultancy Pearn Kandola is a specialist on the recruitment sector. He says that AI systems still have a number of challenges.""The first step in selecting candidates is to correctly parse what they have said or written,"" he says. ""On this basic level, leading voice assistants from Google, Amazon and Apple still routinely fail to understand what people are saying. For example, Scottish accents pose a challenge, as do unusual words or phrases.""If an AI system can accurately transcribe what has been said, the second - greater - challenge is to detect the meaning embedded in those words - the semantics, nuance and context. Here, AI systems can fail to understand. In contrast, a human listening to the conversation will intuitively understand what is meant.""New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.Prof Sandra Wachter, a senior research fellow in AI at Oxford University, says: ""I would be very worried if people said that using AI in recruitment only has benefits.""All machine learning works in the same basic way - you go through a bunch of data, and find patterns and similarities.""So in recruitment, looking at the successful candidates of the past is the data you have. Who were the chief executives in the past, who were the Oxford professors in the past? The recruitment algorithms are going to pick out more men.""The risk is that if you don't put in strong tests, women and people of colour are overlooked.""To help firms and other organisations avoid bias in their AI systems, not just for recruitment, but for all their business operations, Prof Wachter  wrote a paper on the issue last year. Subsequently, her proposals have been adopted by Amazon.Getty ImagesPicking the best candidates is a tricky business whichever way you approach itThere are, however, more benign ways in which AI is being used by the recruitment sector. Take Seattle-based Textio. Its software uses AI to help firms write job adverts that appeal to a broad range of people, by making the language both more inclusive, and easy to understand. It is used by everyone from the World Bank to Dropbox, Spotify and Tesco.Then there is Los Angeles-based Korn Ferry, whose AI recruitment software trawls the internet for potential job candidates. So firms don't have to wait for the best possible people to apply for positions, they can instead more easily proactively chase the individuals they want.But what about my AI job interview? I haven't been called for an interview with a human. Who knows if they're still looking to hire for the position though?EmploymentEmployment discrimination",,,,,,,,,,

Psychology and other “helping professions” such as counselling and social work are often regarded as quintessentially human domains. Unlike workers in manual or routine jobs, psychologists generally see no threat to their career from advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Economists largely agree. One of the most wide-ranging and influential surveys of the future of employment, by Oxford economists Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, rated the probability that psychology could be automated in the near future at a mere 0.43%. This work was initially carried out in 2013 and expanded upon in 2019.
We are behavourial scientists studying organisational behaviour, and one of us (Ben Morrison) is also a registered psychologist. Our analysis over the past four years shows the idea psychology cannot be automated is now out of date. 
Psychology already makes use of many automated tools, and even without significant advances in AI we foresee significant impacts in the very near future.
What do psychologists do all day?
Previous projections assumed the work of a psychologist requires extensive empathic and intuitive skills. These are unlikely to be replicated by machines any time soon. 
However, we argue the typical psychologist’s job has four primary components: assessment, formulation, intervention, and evaluation of outcome. Each component can already be automated to some extent.

Assessment of a client’s strengths and difficulties is largely carried out by computer-driven presentations of psychological tests, interpretation of results and the writing of interpretative reports. 
The rules for diagnosis of conditions are far advanced, to the extent that decision trees are extensively used by practitioners. 
Interventions are designed along formulaic lines, providing explicit rules for the presentation of guidance and problem solving, with exercises and reflections at specific points in the therapy. 
Evaluation is largely a replay of the initial assessment. 

Much of the work of the helping professional does not require empathy or intuition. Psychology has essentially laid the groundwork for the replication of human practice by a machine.
A profession in denial?
Nearly four years ago, we published an article in the bulletin of the Australian Psychological Society, asking how AI and other advanced technologies would disrupt the helping professions. We were conservative in our predictions, but even so we suggested significant potential impacts on employment and education. 
We were not arguing that so-called “strong” AI would emerge to replace humanity. We simply showed how the kind of narrow AI that currently exists (and is steadily improving) could invade the job territory of the helping professions. 



AI-driven mental health chatbots are already available.

A range of AI-driven mental health apps are already available, such as Cogniant and Woebot. Several such products adopt cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) procedures, widely considered the “gold standard” of intervention for many psychological conditions.
These programs typically use artificially intelligent conversational agents, or chatbots, to provide a form of talking therapy that helps users manage their own mental health. Research on the technology has already shown great promise.
Our concern about the future was not, however, shared among members of the helping professions. Still, we continue to present our case widely. 
AI deployment is accelerating
Four years later, we believe the impacts of this technology may arrive even sooner than we thought. Three things in particular may drive this acceleration.
The first is the rapid progress in automated systems that can replicate (and sometimes exceed) human decision-making capacities. The development of deep learning algorithms and the emergence of advanced predictive analytic systems threaten the relevance of professionals. With access to big data in the psychological and related literature, AI systems can be used to assess and intervene with clients.
The second factor is an emerging “tsunami” of AI impacts warned of by economists. Developments in information technology have not yet been reflected in widespread productivity gains, but as Canadian researchers Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans and Avi Goldfarb have argued, it’s likely AI predictive ability will soon be a superior alternative to human judgement in many areas. This may trigger a significant restructuring of the employment market.

The third factor is the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for mental health services increased dramatically, with crisis services such as Lifeline and Beyond Blue reporting 15-20% more contacts in 2020 than in 2019. Pandemic-related mental illness is not expected to peak until mid 2021.
At the same time, in-person care was often ruled out – in late April 2020, half of Medicare-funded mental health services were delivered remotely.  Meditation and mindfulness apps like Headspace and Calm also saw downloads soar. 
This provides further evidence that clients will readily engage in technology-mediated forms of therapy. At the very least, the improved efficiencies will increase the number of clients that can be managed by a single human psychologist. 
How many psychologists will we need?
Given all this, how many human psychologists will the society of the very near future require? It’s a difficult question to answer.
As we have seen, it’s almost certain the work of psychologists can be replaced in large part by AI. Does this mean human psychologists should be replaced by AI? 
Many of us may feel uncomfortable with this idea. However, we have a moral obligation to use the treatment that gives the best outcomes for patients. If an AI-based solution is found to be more effective, reliable and cost-effective, it should be adopted.
Governments and healthcare organisations are likely to have to address these issues in the near future. There will be impact upon the employment and training and education of professionals. 
The professions need to be an integral part of the response. We urge psychology and related allied health professions to take a lead and not wilfully ignore the trends.
We recommend three concrete actions to improve the situation:

boost investment in research into how humans and machines can work together in the assessment and treatment of mental health
encourage attention to technology among members of the profession
give technological impacts greater consideration in projecting the future landscape of the profession, particularly when thinking about job growth, education and training.

  Previous studies have reported that the adoption of robotic technologies in industry reduces both employment and wages. This column examines the experience of Japan, which is unique due to early industry penetration and the fact that almost all the robots were domestically produced. Applying a different method from those in previous studies, it shows that the penetration of industrial robots has positive impacts on both employment and wages. This implies the potential for harmonisation of human work with future labour-replacement technology, such as artificial intelligence.

We are witnessing a clash between what have become the real symbols: the machine and the human brain. On the one hand, artificial intelligence has become a symbol of innovation, progress and development. Yet, on the other hand, there is the need to preserve human intelligence, relationships between people, their humanity. This has led to a debate on the collaboration between human resources and artificial intelligence.Artificial intelligence is undeniably modernizing HRM (Human Resource Management). As a true ally, it allows the organisation to stand out from its competitors, attract high-potential talent and retain the employees already present. AI is not only an ideal partner for the employees, but also for the managers by relieving them of the many time-consuming daily tasks. There is a considerable advantage in the autonomy of the employee and of the entire HR function. Investing in artificial intelligence is a way to develop its performance, to face an ultra-competitive environment and to give an even more human face to HRM.How does AI seek to change the e-commerce landscape?A fundamental aspect of artificial intelligence, machine learning has become a huge part of how you trade, purchase, and interact with the e-commerce landscape. Customers expectation, even demands of instant gratification, and keeping up the pace without compromising on quality, proves daunting. Coupled with increasing competition across the market, businesses have started to &ldquo;automate&rdquo; services in order to better serve customers and reduce their workload.Chat bots have become a commonplace to report issues and get relevant solutions. VPAs, or Virtual Private Assistants, make it possible for customers to resolve their issues without the need for a support executive.AI has already administered a lot of improvements in the e-commerce sector. By automating processes, the purchase cycle has become easier and a certain personal touch has been added to the way we shop and trade. Potentially, AI can enhance customer experience while taking a huge load of work off the business&rsquo;s back. Automation will most likely have a positive impact on customers since services will be more instant and relevant due to faster processing.Artificial Intelligence and the Workforce - The ImplicationsAI aims to improve upon a wide variety of processes. However, automating processes might have an adverse effect on the human part of the workforce. It is believed that the implementation of AI within the working sector can cause a huge number of workers to be laid off. Its impact will clearly lead to changes in skill demand and would require adaptability to work with or around automation.When it comes to human resources, the radical shift towards technology to streamline operations will help HR professionals make easy and appropriate decisions. Intelligent automation reduces the need for manual involvement which is helpful for both, big businesses and small ones, alike. Since, AI automates the function and removes the need for manual involvement, the possibility of job loss and AI replacing humans in the workforce, is still debatable.The augmentation of automation within businesses will reduce mundane tasks and help optimize existing roles. AI is unlikely to replace humans in the workforce completely. Instead, implementing automation within processes will help HR practitioners recruit better and make better decisions by supplementing their own abilities with valuable information provided by the machine.Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are also being updated to be more in line with active technologies. Without AI, CRMs can be tedious and require heavy human intervention. With AI, CRMs can be self-updating, self-correcting, and undeniably accurate while helping achieve a more seamless approach within an organisation.Rather than serving as a replacement for human ingenuity, artificial intelligence is being regarded as a supporting tool. The future of AI entails effectively using its processing and analysing capacity to streamline the decision-making process to further the development of a company and its subsequent customers.The shift towards artificial intelligence is likely to cause the economy to add jobs that enable the transition.Artificial Intelligence and the Changing Work CultureDecision making is the primary institution artificial intelligence might take over. Automating decision making ensures actions are taken in real-time and are based on relevant, factual data. This helps a company turn to a data-driven culture with ample transparency and one that enables employee empowerment.On the other hand, AI does not tire, get sick, or take breaks. Handling monotonous tasks can be left to the AI, while the humans focus on more complex and creative tasks. This can bring about a significant boost in productivity and hence, revenue. Additionally, AI can also help assist in the recruitment process and even in training employees by offering a more personalized programme.The next generation in HR solutions is powered by data and advanced people analytics. Automation in HR processes can reduce human bias and increase efficiency in candidate assessment. As HR functions are digitized, HRs themselves will move to more strategic and analytical roles. Redefining performance management can also become easier as the HR can count on accurate, real-time data to measure employee potential and take prompt and personalized actions.It is highly likely that automation will cause the displacement of certain jobs, but at the same time will create entirely new ones.ConclusionThe future of the workforce in the face of changing technologies is highly likely to be altered forever. Automation in businesses can bring more advanced, efficient systems to help in processes, both internal and relative to customers. Working together with AI will prove to be a challenge at first but adaptability will be rewarded almost instantly.It is difficult to say how exactly AI will be used in the future. But, with the current advancements we can be certain AI is to play a huge role in the e-commerce sector. Automation will no doubt be extremely useful in our day-to-day lives and has the potential to drastically alter the workforce, but its exact impact is yet to be seen.The author, Vaibhav Lall, is Founder of Khojdeal.DISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETHRWorld does not necessarily subscribe to it.

CopyAre machines capable of design? Though a persistent question, it is one that increasingly accompanies discussions on architecture and the future of artificial intelligence. But what exactly is AI today? As we discover more about machine learning and generative design, we begin to see that these forms of ""intelligence"" extend beyond repetitive tasks and simulated operations. They've come to encompass cultural production, and in turn, design itself.+ 3

Save this picture!Courtesy of Refik AnadolWhen artificial intelligence was envisioned during the the 1950s-60s, the goal was to teach a computer to perform a range of cognitive tasks and operations, similar to a human mind. Fast forward half a century, and AI is shaping our aesthetic choices, with automated algorithms suggesting what we should see, read, and listen to. It helps us make aesthetic decisions when we create media, from movie trailers and music albums to product and web designs. We have already felt some of the cultural effects of AI adoption, even if we aren't aware of it.As educator and theorist Lev Manovich has explained, computers perform endless intelligent operations. ""Your smartphone’s keyboard gradually adapts to your typing style. Your phone may also monitor your usage of apps and adjust their work in the background to save battery. Your map app automatically calculates the fastest route, taking into account traffic conditions. There are thousands of intelligent, but not very glamorous, operations at work in phones, computers, web servers, and other parts of the IT universe."" More broadly, it's useful to turn the discussion towards aesthetics and how these advancements relate to art, beauty and taste.Save this picture!Courtesy of Refik AnadolUsually defined as a set of ""principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of beauty”, aesthetics depend on who you are talking to. In 2018, Marcus Endicott described how, from the perspective of engineering, the traditional definition of aesthetics in computing could be termed ""structural, such as an elegant proof, or beautiful diagram."" A broader definition may include more abstract qualities of form and symmetry that ""enhance pleasure and creative expression."" In turn, as machine learning is gradually becoming more widely adopted, it is leading to what Marcus Endicott termed a neural aesthetic. This can be seen in recent “artistic hacks”, such as Deepdream, NeuralTalk, and Stylenet. Beyond these adaptive processes, there are other ways AI shapes cultural creation. Artificial intelligence has recently made rapid advances in the computation of art, music, poetry, and lifestyle. Manovich explains that AI has given us the option to automate our aesthetic choices (via recommendation engines), as well as assist in certain areas of aesthetic production such as consumer photography and automate experiences like the ads we see online. ""Its use of helping to design fashion items, logos, music, TV commercials, and works in other areas of culture is already growing."" But, as he concludes, human experts usually make the final decisions based on ideas and media generated by AI. And yes, the human vs. robot debate rages on. Save this picture!© Joris Laarman for MX3DAccording to The Economist, 47% of the work done by humans will have been replaced by robots by 2037, even those traditionally associated with university education. The World Economic Forum estimated that between 2015 and 2020, 7.1 million jobs will be lost around the world, as ""artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology and other socio-economic factors replace the need for human employees."" Artificial intelligence is already changing the way architecture is practiced, whether or not we believe it may replace us. As AI is augmenting design, architects are working to explore the future of aesthetics and how we can improve the design process.In a tech report on artificial intelligence, Building Design + Construction explored how Arup had applied a neural network to a light rail design and reduced the number of utility clashes by over 90%, saving nearly 800 hours of engineering. In the same vein, the areas of site and social research that utilize artificial intelligence have been extensively covered, and examples are generated almost daily. We know that machine-driven procedures can dramatically improve the efficiency of construction and operations, like by increasing energy performance and decreasing fabrication time and costs. The neural network application from Arup extends to this design decision-making. But the central question comes back to aesthetics and style. Save this picture!Courtesy of Refik AnadolDesigner and Fulbright fellow Stanislas Chaillou recently created a project at Harvard utilizing machine learning to explore the future of generative design, bias and architectural style. While studying AI and its potential integration into architectural practice, Chaillou built an entire generation methodology using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs). Chaillou's project investigates the future of AI through architectural style learning, and his work illustrates the profound impact of style on the composition of floor plans.As Chaillou summarizes, architectural styles carry implicit mechanics of space, and there are spatial consequences to choosing a given style over another. In his words, style is not an ancillary, superficial or decorative addendum; it is at the core of the composition.Save this picture!Courtesy of Stanislas ChaillouArtificial intelligence and machine learning are becoming increasingly more important as they shape our future. If machines can begin to understand and affect our perceptions of beauty, we should work to find better ways to implement these tools and processes in the design process.Architect and researcher Valentin Soana once stated that the digital in architectural design enables new systems where architectural processes can emerge through ""close collaboration between humans and machines; where technologies are used to extend capabilities and augment design and construction processes."" As machines learn to design, we should work with AI to enrich our practices through aesthetic and creative ideation. More than productivity gains, we can rethink the way we live, and in turn, how to shape the built environment.Editor's Note: This article was originally published on March 6, 2020, and updated on February 9, 2021.",,,,,,,,,1065.0,

Artificial Intelligence is the next step in image editing, so find out how you'll edit your portraits of tomorrow with this tutorial on editing portrait images using Luminar AI.




AI is set to ramp up image editing software like never before. The autonomous tweaks AI could make saves hours of work by cutting out backgrounds or skies, retouching portraits, and enhancing composition. But you don't have to look into the future for this kind of intelligent image editing, it's here today, and you can use it to improve your photos.
Luminar AI by Skylum is editing software that runs entirely on artificial intelligence. In fact, it's a world first. It works by analyzing your photos and making suggested tweaks through a series of editing functions that can be automatically applied to your photo. It's properly clever stuff because it can detect people in portraits, skies in landscapes, and even render different lighting for image retouching.
The benefit of using Luminar AI over another artificial intelligence image editing software is that there's a great deal of flexibility when it comes to editing photos. If you want to click just one button and get a great edit, you can do that, but if you want to delve a little deeper and tweak things until it looks right, there's room for that, too. Let's take a look at how well it performs on my wedding portrait.
Use Templates for Intelligent Improvements
Luminar AI uses the templates feature to make AI-powered tweaks to your photos. Pick from a wide selection of preset templates, which will make filtered adjustments to your photos with minimal user input.
Perhaps Luminar AI's biggest draw is its Templates mode. After importing a photo, you can choose between a variety of preset (but AI-powered) edits that make adjustments to your image based on mood, emotion, or style. Now, it's not just like the presets of old where it pushes the sliders around a bit and basically applies a filter on top of what's already there. It actually makes changes based on what it sees in the photo. Here, I have two wonderful brides, which the software has picked up on and makes adjustments based on where they are in the frame by keeping skin tones natural and making changes to the backdrop without interfering with their dresses.

I chose the Flawless template, which brightened up the background, boosted the color slightly (without going over the top), and brought a wonderful glow to my two subjects by enhancing the brightness in their skin and dresses. There's also this slight burst of brightness around their faces, which helps to draw the eye into the center of the frame.
Check Your Progress
Easily see your progress by holding down the preview button to toggle between the original image and the current edit, or use the before/after slider to study the differences in the photo.
One thing I really like about the way Luminar AI handles images is the simple user interface. I wanted to see a before and after with the template that I selected, so I used the preview button in the top-right (the eye icon) to switch between the original image and the newly edited photo. Right next to the preview button, I have the option to run a before and after slider across the photo, which I really like. I use it similarly to an animator turning the pages over to see the movement of an illustration so that I can keep an eye on any problem areas arising.

Edit Mode
Make more precise tweaks with Edit mode, where you can make AI and non-AI edits to your photos.
Once you've had plenty of fun choosing a template, you may want to take a deeper dive into the software and make some manual adjustments. To do this, I headed to the Edit mode and used some of the tools on offer. To start with, I tested the waters with the Enhance AI tool, which did a great job of brightening the backdrop, giving the photo some more zing. Unfortunately, that wasn't what I was going for in this shot, so I turned it back down. However, I noticed that the traditional undo keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on a Mac) didn't actually work. Odd.

Composition AI
Luminar AI gives you the option of making automatic composition adjustments with mixed results.
I was pretty happy with the composition of this photo. I felt that part of the beauty of the shot is that it's quite symmetrical. With the backdrop matching up on both sides, the hinges slightly poking into the frame, and the two brides centrally placed, the visual weight of the shot felt perfectly balanced. So, when I tried Composition AI, I was quite shocked to find it wanted to crop in tighter on my subjects and place them out of the center. It's great that the software is using the rule of thirds to shake things up a bit, but I'm not sure it improved the composition in this case. For those who are struggling with the composition of a particular shot, though, I'm sure it's a good way to make a decision if you're on the fence.

Traditional Tools Also Featured
Traditional editing tools still remain for editors that like to do some manual tweaks of their own, such as dodging and burning, as seen here.
There are plenty of artificially intelligent tools in Luminar AI (as you might expect), but there are also some non-AI tools that we're used to playing with in image-editing software. I decided to scroll down to the Professional group and use the Dodge & Burn tool to enhance the brides' dresses. With the Lighten tool selected, I kept my brush size at 100 and strength at 50 but turned the amount up to 100. I painted with the brush cursor that automatically pops up once the tool is selected and covered the white dresses to give them some extra punch. I thought it did a great job; even with the amount slider up to max, it didn't overexpose the dresses and gave a wonderfully ethereal look.

Intelligent Skin Retouching
Skin-AI is part of a group of AI-powered portrait editing tools that do well at making automatic changes to the skin.
An integral part of the portrait image-editing process is probably the ability to retouch the skin. Handily, Luminar AI has a whole group of portrait tools just for this, three out of four of which are powered by artificial intelligence. I decided to give the Skin AI tool a go. Once selected, it automatically makes changes to the skin in the photo without any kind of input from the user. Although the skin on both subjects was absolutely wonderful, I wanted to see how the tool worked, so I turned the amount slider up to 64. It gave a good smooth effect without removing all the texture of the skin, which is something I look for in skin retouching. The shine removal was also good, helping to tone down hot spots across their faces. I also ticked the skin defects removal button, which removed a couple of minute blemishes, very precise for such a quick AI-powered tool.

I've been using Luminar AI since it first came out, and I've not been terribly impressed with the composition AI thus far. I'm still trying to get the hang of it. What I do like is that there are a few templates that generally match my own style from in the past. What is important here is that I had a preferred style, and I know when the software is close and when it isn't. I'm not sure how the templates would do for a beginner to editing, but for me it at least saves some time.

I don't really trust AI and certainly wouldn't call it a photo editing tool of tomorrow. Sure, it can be used to save your time on basic editing and many photo editors like Photoworks or Photodiva use AI technologies, but I wouldn't let AI do all the deep post-processing for me and certainly I wouldn't totally rely on it when I know it doesn't have my tastes and vision. Luminar AI is worth trying, though, I just wouldn't recommend it to the beginners who need to understand how it all works first.

Just no.  I tried it, for a few shoots, I could sometimes get something good on the first image, but as soon as I went to the second photo, the dang program would throw off the white balance into an extreme blue and would NOT adjust it back out.  I demanded a refund and wish I could demand a refund on Luminar 4 I had purchased shortly before AI was announced.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is learning more about how to work with (and on) humans. A recent study has shown how AI can learn to identify vulnerabilities in human habits and behaviours and use them to influence human decision-making.
It may seem cliched to say AI is transforming every aspect of the way we live and work, but it’s true. Various forms of AI are at work in fields as diverse as vaccine development, environmental management and office administration. And while AI does not possess human-like intelligence and emotions, its capabilities are powerful and rapidly developing. 
There’s no need to worry about a machine takeover just yet, but this recent discovery highlights the power of AI and underscores the need for proper governance to prevent misuse.
How AI can learn to influence human behaviour
A team of researchers at CSIRO’s Data61, the data and digital arm of Australia’s national science agency, devised a systematic method of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the ways people make choices, using a kind of AI system called a recurrent neural network and deep reinforcement-learning. To test their model they carried out three experiments in which human participants played games against a computer. 
The first experiment involved participants clicking on red or blue coloured boxes to win a fake currency, with the AI learning the participant’s choice patterns and guiding them towards a specific choice. The AI was successful about 70% of the time.
In the second experiment, participants were required to watch a screen and press a button when they are shown a particular symbol (such as an orange triangle) and not press it when they are shown another (say a blue circle). Here, the AI set out to arrange the sequence of symbols so the participants made more mistakes, and achieved an increase of almost 25%.

      If machines can beat us at games, does it make them more intelligent than us?




The third experiment consisted of several rounds in which a participant would pretend to be an investor giving money to a trustee (the AI). The AI would then return an amount of money to the participant, who would then decide how much to invest in the next round. This game was played in two different modes: in one the AI was out to maximise how much money it ended up with, and in the other the AI aimed for a fair distribution of money between itself and the human investor. The AI was highly successful in each mode.  
In each experiment, the machine learned from participants’ responses and identified and targeted vulnerabilities in people’s decision-making. The end result was the machine learned to steer participants towards particular actions.

What the research means for the future of AI
These findings are still quite abstract and involved limited and unrealistic situations. More research is needed to determine how this approach can be put into action and used to benefit society.
But the research does advance our understanding not only of what AI can do but also of how people make choices. It shows machines can learn to steer human choice-making through their interactions with us.

      Australians have low trust in artificial intelligence and want it to be better regulated




The research has an enormous range of possible applications, from enhancing behavioural sciences and public policy to improve social welfare, to understanding and influencing how people adopt healthy eating habits or renewable energy. AI and machine learning could be used to recognise people’s vulnerabilities in certain situations and help them to steer away from poor choices.
The method can also be used to defend against influence attacks. Machines could be taught to alert us when we are being influenced online, for example, and help us shape a behaviour to disguise our vulnerability (for example, by not clicking on some pages, or clicking on others to lay a false trail).
What’s next?
Like any technology, AI can be used for good or bad, and proper governance is crucial to ensure it is implemented in a responsible way. Last year CSIRO developed an AI Ethics Framework for the Australian government as an early step in this journey. 
AI and machine learning are typically very hungry for data, which means it is crucial to ensure we have effective systems in place for data governance and access. Implementing adequate consent processes and privacy protection when gathering data is essential. 
Organisations using and developing AI need to ensure they know what these technologies can and cannot do, and be aware of potential risks as well as benefits.

For K-3 students, Amira is an avatar — one wearing a green jacket with short, dark hair — that pops up on a screen while they work on literacy skills. For educators, though, Amira is more than an artificial intelligent program listening to students read aloud; it is technology that assesses student mastery while delivering personalized coaching and saving teachers time.
As teachers grapple with ways to stay connected to students, especially those already struggling with literacy, Amira wants to be part of the solution. Begun in 2017 with a project using Carnegie Mellon University technology, Amira has built an in-classroom product that is used in 280 school districts across the country and taking AI literacy software to new places, says CEO Mark Angel.
Amira’s reading assistant begins by observing a student read for six to 10 minutes, “the same way a really good teacher does,” Angel says. The software gauges the child’s ability to name letters, sound out words and combine them into phrases and sentences. “We will put a student through a set of observational mini-tests, and then (the program) spends a couple minutes actually listening to that student read an appropriately leveled story or passage out loud,” Angel says.
From that initial screening, Amira is able to grab information to spot signs of dyslexia risk, gauge mastery of phonetics, estimate a student’s vocabulary size and get a good handle on decoding skills and comprehension levels. Then, the program reports findings to a teacher to support differentiated instruction, pinpointing the exact level of literacy abilities and needs for individual students.
Early on, when learning took a dramatic at-home-only turn for most students, Amira offered its online platform free of charge to districts and schools. As the pandemic continues, the cost for Amira is about $20 per student, per year.
“All the data shows that the ability to read is life’s most important skill, and we are in a race to get every student to fluency by third grade,” Angel says. “If students don’t become masterful, motivated readers by third grade, they are four times more likely to drop out of school, have career earnings 35 to 40 percent less and confront a lifetime of difficulty and struggle. We are coming face to face with those dreadful statistics and getting to a place where a lot more kids have an opportunity to spend time reading out loud and do the practice necessary to rewire the brain for good reading.”
(Amira Learning)
Following the initial assessment, Amira encourages teachers to have students spend time practicing reading with the AI assistant for 10 to 15 minutes per day, three to five days a week. The program listens for mistakes, hesitations or problems and provides individualized tutoring.
“It is in that individualized tutoring process Amira is special and unique, using artificial intelligence to look at the context of a student’s mistake and decide the right kind of help to build skills,” Angel says. “It might say they are struggling with this word because they are having a challenge decoding a particular phoneme, or sometimes Amira will decide a student lacks a decoding skill around a silent letter or plurals. Sometimes it is just a hard word, and Amira will provide a definition and get them to be more familiar. It is during that tutoring process Amira delivers personalized help around the observed mistakes and helps them get through the text and move on.”
Students can plug their own assignments into the program or let the AI suggest stories based on the child’s interests. Angel says a typical classroom will use Amira as part of a rotation, with a teacher working with one group of students, another group working on a different project and a third group working with headsets on a Chromebook, iPad or whatever hardware is in the classroom. The groups can rotate every 20 minutes.
“Amira has the potential to change the landscape of independent reading practice,” says Dr. Katharine Miles, a Brooklyn College professor and reading scientist.
Amira’s leadership team was born out of Renaissance Learning, where many of the staff, including Angel, worked. As the chief technology officer, he says, he started looking for a better way to help K-3 students, and he and a group of Renaissance employees licensed the Carnegie Mellon technology and built Amira around it. With venture capital backing the company, they created the core product and demonstrated its value, then found a partner in with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt that could take the product to scale and reach into the complicated ed tech marketplace.
In 2019, Amira partnered with the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston to help administer the TPRI, an early literacy assessment created by the school and delivered to educational institutions across the country. The partnership allows Amira to give the test online as a digital application, creating the first fully automated AI curriculum-based assessment.
Amira has worked with 280 school districts across the country. Moving forward, Angel says the goal is to continue evolving and improving. “AI software is like any person who is learning a new skill,” he says. “The more experience we get, the more different kinds of situations we see, the better we are at practicing our craft.”
With more diversity of students, Angel expects Amira to soon work better with children who have unique challenges, whether it’s pronounced regional accents, dyslexia or special needs. “These are capabilities,” he says, “we can optimize by using the power of the AI.”

Report: Pentagon Says STEM Education Deficit is Weakening America
The United States risks losing its competitive advantage if it continues with its business-as-usual approach and fails to equip its workforce with the education and skills to develop and field complex, cutting-edge emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, machine learning, and hypersonics.

On January 14 the Pentagon released its annual report on the state of the U.S. defense and manufacturing industrial base. The estimated cost of the report was $159,000 USD and clocked in at 184 pages. The document, entitled US Defense Industrial Base Industrial Capabilities Report January 2021, is a congressionally-mandated, annual requirement in which the Secretary of Defense informs the armed services committees on the actions, investments, and overall health of the U.S. defense industrial base (DIB). The report is divided into nine component areas spanning the Department’s primary DIB lines of effort, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the DIB, an overview of the U.S. defense industry, assessments of the sixteen industrial base sectors and emerging technology sectors, and overviews of the primary DIB authorities and investment mechanisms.

There are innumerable takeaways from the report but a consistent and glaring deficiency throughout reveals an erosion and degradation of the U.S. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education system and a severe shortage of technical talent in the U.S. workplace. The broad conclusion is that the United States risks losing its competitive advantage if it continues with its business-as-usual approach and fails to equip its workforce with the education and skills to develop and field complex, cutting-edge emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, machine learning, and hypersonics.     

1. How acute is the STEM education and talent deficit in the United States?  
The STEM shortage in the DIB is quickly approaching crisis status. As stated by Arthur Herman, “We are fast approaching another Sputnik moment, we can’t afford to ignore.” The United States must create a “state-of-the-art STEM education strategy” to cope with this reality. The report assesses if the United States fails to modernize and adjust it likely will face a “permanent national security deficit.” The United States should not be surprised by this development as prominent U.S. business and government leaders have long been sounding the alarm about the decay of the U.S. education system. 





In July, Admiral (Ret) William McRaven, the former U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) commander and chancellor of the University of Texas, was straightforward when pressed about which national security issue kept him up at night: “K-12 education."" According to Admiral McRaven, “unless we are giving opportunity and a quality education to the young men and women in the United States, then we won't have the right people to be able to make the right decisions about our national security…They won't have an understanding of different cultures. They won't have an understanding of different ideas. They won't be critical thinkers.”

The report stresses that 
Today’s education pipeline is not providing the necessary software engineering resources to fully meet the demand from commercial and defense sectors, and resources required to meet future demands continue to grow...Decades of neglect have left the robust system of technical schools the nation once relied upon for industrial training badly weakened and the existing workforce is rapidly aging out, taking irreplaceable tacit knowledge with them...Programmatic responses to education and training needs still largely focus on four-year STEM-based programs rather than digital industrial skills on the factory floor.

2. What does the report reveal about US STEM education trends in relation to Russia and China and the broader international community?
The DIB report reveals the United States is graduating fewer students with STEM degrees as a percentage of population compared to China, and the trend continues to worsen. The population of China is four times that of the United States but is producing eight times the number of STEM graduates while Russia has almost four times the number of engineers. The United States no longer has the most STEM graduates worldwide and is being rapidly outpaced by China. In 2016, the United States had the third-most STEM graduates worldwide with 67 million graduates compared to China with 78 million. 
As the pool of U.S. domestic technical talent shrinks, the number of foreign students stepping up to fill the talent gap has increased. Analysis of the National Science Board’s 2020 Science & Engineering Indicators Report reveals that more than one-half of all U.S. doctorate engineering, computer science, and mathematics graduates are foreign-born. In addition, the DIB report explains how STEM-focused programs at U.S. universities are struggling to attract, and retain top-tier technical talent and are turning to foreign students to address this shortfall, particularly from China and India. In the 2019-2020 Academic Year, the United States hosted over one million international students, with 53 percent coming from China and India; over the past decade the total number of Indian students in the United States has more than doubled from 81,000 in 2008 to 202,000 in 2019. Over half or 52 percent of all international students in the United States were pursuing careers in STEM fields of study, with engineering the leading field of study followed by mathematics and computer science.      
3. What does the DIB Report forecast about STEM occupational hiring trends and developments? 
The DIB report asserts the production of engineers and scientists with U.S. citizenship, and the skills necessary to successfully develop and sustain the software is not keeping up with demand. As of 2017, American students made up barely 21 percent of the computer science student body and 19 percent of electrical engineering majors among our nation’s universities. This is problematic as seven out of ten STEM occupations were related to computers and information systems. 
Findings from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics reveal that computer-science STEM occupations are forecasted to grow 12 percent by 2029, creating over half a million computer-science related jobs with demand for information security analysts, software developers, and computer research specialists poised to grow by 15 percent.
4. What does the DIB Report say about cyber-related trends, activities, and vulnerabilities? 
To no one’s surprise, the DIB report reaffirms and underscores the need for the United States to bolster and ameliorate its cyber defenses. For example, the report documents the persistent threat posed by pernicious cyber-state actors to the U.S. manufacturing base and intellectual property. The report stresses that manufacturing is the second most heavily attacked sector in the U.S. economy with 35 percent of all cyber-espionage attacks in the United States targeted at manufacturing. The DIB report points out that of the 291,000 manufacturing establishments in the United States, 99 percent were small-to-medium size establishments with fewer than 500 employees and are unprepared to deal with a cyber-attack. The report also extolls U.S. intellectual property theft vulnerabilities to the tune of $450 billion in annual losses. To better address these vulnerabilities, the DIB Report assesses the present and future U.S. DoD cyber workforce must develop a broader and deeper understanding of analytics and key emerging technologies, such as autonomy, human-machine interaction, and artificial intelligence. This will require personnel to adopt new methods in how they approach cyber defense and collective security to an “Always On” 24/7/365 mentality.
5. What does the DIB Report say about the U.S. DoD workforce trends in artificial intelligence and machine learning?        
The U.S. DoD artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning industrial base face several key challenges going forward to include recruiting and retaining personnel with AI expertise compared to the commercial sector. The DIB report underscores how a declining U.S. AI domestic workforce is complicating DoD capacity in leveraging private commercial technology for military applications. This will almost certainly complicate DoD’s plans to cultivate and hire experienced, top-tier AI talent equipped with the knowledge, skills, and core competencies to build and deploy the AI across the force that will be critical to fight and win the wars of the future.
6. What should the Biden administration and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin take away from this report? 
The DIB Report portends that without “serious and targeted investment—billions instead of millions—America’s defense industrial base is simply unsustainable, let alone capable of supporting our deployed forces and legacy equipment while solving the complex warfighting challenges posed by advanced technologies in the 21st century, from AI and cyber to hypersonics and autonomous air and sea systems.”
The new U.S. secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, stated his department will ensure all DIB companies have access to the requisite tools and resources to counter the full range of cyber-security threats, support a whole-of-government approach to enhance domestic industrial capacity, and satisfy U.S. defense requirements—a top Biden priority. 
President Joe Biden has articulated that developing, and sustaining a robust, capable, and responsive STEM workforce is critical in slowing the spread of the Covid-19 virus that has killed 420,000 Americans. The United States should be encouraged by his executive order elevating the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) within his first week in office to a cabinet-level agency that will strengthen and enhance the relationship between academia, industry, and government to advance emerging technologies in protecting national security. The Biden administration would do well to inculcate and enhance STEM investments in U.S. public education, particularly at the K-12 level where just 31 percent of Americans assessed in primary and secondary schools were performing at above average in STEM programs.
