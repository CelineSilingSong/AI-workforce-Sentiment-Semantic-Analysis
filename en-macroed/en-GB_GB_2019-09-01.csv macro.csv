What examples are there of AI helping to solve some of the world’s problems?
A couple of examples that I find motivating are areas where AI is being used to provide healthcare, where human support might be quite restrictive or not enough. AI can also improve accuracy rates to help more people in a safer manner.
Another example is a product we’ve developed at AI for Good called rAInbow, where we’ve built an AI tool to help detect early signs of domestic violence and abuse. It’s an issue that affects one in three women, whether it’s physical, sexual, psychological or financial abuse.
It’s one example where AI can help when a human might not be the most suitable to talk to in the very early stages, especially for an issue like domestic violence which is surrounded by shame, stigma, embarrassment and judgement. We launched it in South Africa in November last year and since then we’ve had over 350,000 consultations from women who want to get an understanding of early signs of abuse in a non-judgmental and unbiased way.
It’s not the answer and it’s not a replacement for human support services. In fact, we designed the product working with people from different areas including those providing face-to-face support to people in need. AI can play a role in helping people take that first step and then signposting them to the right services. That way people can be more preventive and proactive rather than reactive.
Algorithmic bias in decision-making, such as in mortgage, loan and job applications, has been known to discriminate against women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. What can be done to counter algorithmic bias and ensure these decisions are made fairly?
There are three things to think about. One: where is the data coming from? A lot of the time the bias is there because the underlying data is biased. It’s about being proactive in looking at additional datasets and identifying biases early on.
Second is working with people from different communities. If it’s a homogenous group of people building the technology, it’s quite difficult to have that unbiased mindset. Bringing subject matter experts, anthropologists, people who understand society, ethicists and lawyers into that process is important.
A third area is how to interpret the insights from the algorithm. A system might pump out results but then it’s up to us as humans to see how to use that information. It’s not just about building the algorithm; it’s about how to use the insights. Do you use them in a purely automated way?
At AI for Good, we’re doing an interesting project on reproductive and sexual health in India. We put in a lot of human intervention as it’s a very sensitive issue, where bias, including human provider bias, is a big problem. Bringing judgement that machines might not always have is important and you can bring humans in at the right moment and the right time in the design process.

How should education systems evolve to meet the societal changes brought by AI? 
I can tell you from experience. We run a programme called FutureMakers, where we train young people between the ages of 13 and 17 in creating AI technologies. These are young people who will be going into the workforce and doing jobs that haven’t even been created yet. So, we need to prepare them for that.
We saw that there were three things stopping them from getting started in a tech career. The first was feeling they weren’t smart enough to work in the field. It’s very much an issue of who people see as role models.
Second, they didn’t know where to begin. Often in schools they don’t have the right framework or the right curriculum, which is always a challenge. Sometimes the kids are more digitally active and mature than the teachers, which creates a strange dynamic.
The last reason they gave us for not being interested is they thought they would rather do something more creative. Working in this field is actually quite creative – it’s not just about sitting at your desk and writing code all day. There are different kinds of roles available.
So, we collaborated with Sage Foundation to teach young people of diverse backgrounds AI skills, giving them access to AI technology and helping them use their imaginations to build their solutions. Young people are great at creativity, problem-solving, empathy and emotional intelligence. We found that nine times out of ten, they built tools that had positive social purpose.
The fear went away because now they can touch and feel it, they know what AI is and what it can do instead of this abstract notion they read about or see in Hollywood films. Some of the examples of products they built are solutions for climate change and solutions to help combat loneliness for older people who live alone.
One of the girls I worked with built a camera app for her grandmother who was visually impaired – the AI camera spoke to her about what was going on around her so she could navigate the world better. I think that’s powerful because when you give these tools to young people, they can create better uses for this technology than making people click more ads.
My request for policymakers is to think about the experience of young people and their teachers and recognize they deserve the best technologies and to benefit from this revolution. It shouldn’t just be people like myself who have been through the traditional process of getting a computer science degree who are benefitting from it. It should be everybody.
How can governments prepare for the rise in automation without leaving people behind and exacerbating inequality? How do they make sure that all of society benefits from AI advancements?
There are new jobs that are going to be created and a diverse group of people should be brought into the world of AI. The new jobs should be an opportunity for people of different backgrounds to embrace.
One point that has been bothering me is the modern-day sweatshop version of jobs being created by the AI industry. Not every job in the AI world is that of a glamorous data scientist or machine learning engineer. There are a huge number of jobs being outsourced that include data labeling, where a lot of the work is preparing datasets.
You see examples of humans being exposed to harmful content day in and day out, just tagging data. I do not think that’s a good, sustainable supply chain practice. People need to be paid fairly for this work and they deserve to work in safe conditions. For example, humans who are asked to moderate and tag content so that algorithms can get better at detecting hate speech - these humans are being exposed to hate speech constantly and people need to think about that.
Another thing is the impact of automation on the worker’s side. There might be benefits of using technology to reduce their workload but what does it mean to the people whose jobs are being automated?
I’ll give an example of something that happened in one of my projects where we automated parts of human tasks. We thought this was the promise of technology - humans do the more interesting, intelligent and challenging things and the machines do the boring, mundane stuff.
We found that it led to the human workers having to do challenging work all the time. Previously, 80 per cent of their job was mundane tasks, which was now taken over by the machine, and only 20 per cent was difficult tasks. And now, 100 per cent of their job is difficult, intense work that requires thinking.
This means technology must be designed for people and their experiences. If they’re doing work that requires more intellect, should they be compensated more? Should they get more breaks during the day? Should they get different kinds of training? These are all the questions I have when it comes to the benefits towards people and towards employees.

Artificial intelligence (AI) in the enterprise is poised for significant growth, so it’s no wonder savvy IT professionals are looking for ways to align their career trajectories with it. Indeed, there was a 29 percent increase in the number of AI jobs listed on Indeed from May 2018 to May 2019, and a concurrent 15 decrease in candidate searches for AI roles, suggesting a potential shortage of AI experts on which IT pros could capitalize. (For more, see AI careers and salaries: 7 telling statistics).
[ Check out our quick-scan primer on 10 key artificial intelligence terms for IT and business leaders: Cheat sheet: AI glossary. ]
“Machine learning and AI has become ubiquitous in our lives,” says Timothy Havens, the William and Gloria Jackson Associate Professor of Computer Systems at Michigan Technological University’s College of Computing and Director of the Institute of Computing and Cybersystems. “This marketplace is going to grow exponentially in the coming years; it is the perfect time for both young people and also those who wish to make a career change to become involved in a field that is going to change everything.”
AI career path: How to start
Python and R skills can help AI career path beginners.
For many IT professionals, a role in AI can be a logical next step that takes advantage of some of their existing skills. Programmers and developers who code in Python and R can relatively quickly upskill themselves to become data scientists, given the machine-learning libraries that are available out-of-the-box for those languages, says Zachary Jarvinen, head of technology strategy, AI, and analytics at OpenText.
“If you want to deploy your models, it makes sense to have good software engineering skills,” adds Vicki Boykis, who started out as a data analyst and now works in data science at CapTech Ventures. “And understanding the underpinnings of machine-learning libraries also requires knowing software engineering.”
The capabilities of IT architects and DevOps professionals lend themselves particularly well to data engineer roles, where they would be charged with creating and managing the large data pipelines that make machine learning possible, says Jarvinen. Even certain knowledge workers and domain experts – in information security, compliance, contracting, revenue ops, data capture, or operational efficiency – may seize opportunities to work on multi-functional AI project teams.
8 tips to transition to an AI career
How can you start preparing? Consider these steps if you are looking to transition to an AI-related role:
1. Solidify your software skills
“First and foremost, to be successful in a career in applied AI, one must be a strong programmer and all that entails: producing well-engineered code, debugging when problems occur, and strong data management skills,” Havens says. If you don’t know Python, learn it, adds Ram Palaniappan, senior practice director of data analytics & insights at TEKsystems.
2. Master AI 101
“It is important to develop a good understanding of the basics of machine learning and AI – the fundamental algorithms and types of problems these algorithms can solve,” Havens says.
3. Know your business
If you’re not already enmeshed in the domain in which you want to apply AI, get to know it well. “Learning what the business question is that needs to be answered with machine learning is probably the most important skill I’d emphasize,” says Havens. “This involves understanding the business, understanding how companies work in general, and listening skills.”
4. Seek out AI-oriented data science courses
An easy way to build the skills necessary for the machine-learning and AI field is continuing education. In addition to formal strong data science programs, there are also many viable, free options.

Maximizing the workplace benefits of new technologies
How we adopt – and adapt to – artificial intelligence in the workplace will be crucial to the future of our region’s economic growth and the very nature of employment.
The 4th Industrial Revolution is already bringing many changes. And, policymakers, employers, and civil society organizations across the Asia Pacific are looking for innovative and inclusive ways to maximize the opportunities created by AI.
They also want to manage the challenges. Among these is the need to understand what the evidence is telling us. In particular, governments want to see what the likely outcomes are so that they can invest today in policies to re-skill for an AI-driven future.
To get a clearer view of what’s happening across this fast-changing landscape and inform public policies, Microsoft Asia has just released a review of multiple pieces of research on AI’s likely impacts for jobs and skills. It analyzes the challenges that could prevent some of Asia Pacific economies from harnessing the full benefits of AI, and it sets out action points to help capture these gains.

The report surfaced both optimism and reservations about AI’s effects across Asia Pacific labor markets. It found that:

AI has the potential to have positive impacts on worker productivity, incomes, and satisfaction.
The potential for AI technologies to create new jobs has received limited focus in the media; however, some existing research literature suggests the positive impacts on the labor market could be significant.
New jobs will be created to support the adoption of AI technologies across sectors. Such jobs are harder to predict, as they are likely to be jobs that do not exist today. In 2022, jobs that directly support AI development could account for less than a fifth of in-demand positions, while 60% could require interpersonal, creative or decision-making skills.
While AI is likely to create more jobs than it displaces in Asia Pacific, disruption is likely, and there may be net losses of jobs concentrated in specific sectors. In that context, displaced workers could face different outcomes depending on their access to training and new economic opportunities. ​
The use of AI to match workers to jobs could have significant economic impacts: Estimates point to a potential impact across Asia of US$500 billion in GDP by 2025, creating additional employment of 31.5 million workers.
To fully harness the potential benefits and mitigate the risks of AI for jobs and work in Asia Pacific, an appropriate action agenda must address the unique challenges the region faces.
Many Asian governments, businesses, and civil society organizations are pursuing innovative approaches to tackle these challenges, and there is a significant opportunity to learn from each other.

The review examines the validity of a long list of enduring perceptions about AI’s impacts. For example, some might believe that workers’ wages will decline as AI displaces more work tasks. However, existing research suggests that wages could instead rise through various ways as new technologies spread. For instance, a study in Australia showed that retraining 75% of displaced workers could cut future potential increases in income inequality by two between 2016 and 2030. Similarly, it challenges the notion that AI’s largest productivity gains will be enjoyed by high-income countries. The report instead points to predictions that middle-income economies, such as The Philippines, stand to reap the highest productivity gains.


It also takes on suggestions that digital sectors will benefit the most from AI, saying that traditional, non-digital sectors such as healthcare or energy are expected to gain up to three times the productivity benefits.
The report suggests policymakers and industries both stimulate greater AI adoption and establish re-skilling programs. In this environment, workers should be valued for their ongoing skills and not just for their formal educational qualifications. It also emphasizes the need for an overall inclusive approach that extends the benefits of AI to all workers.
The review comes up with nine high-level action points to help make the most of AI’s workplace impact:

Ensure strong and even adoption of AI across companies and workers.
Build awareness of re-skilling benefits, critical skills, and training opportunities.
Incentivize and encourage employers to retrain their workers.
Foster close collaboration between governments, industry, and civil society to create relevant and effective nation-wide retraining frameworks.
Ensure the relevance of educational curriculums to emerging skill needs.
Encourage a focus of skills rather than just formal qualifications in both recruitment and national markets strategies.
Build inclusive models that allow underserved groups to benefit from AI.
Create social protection mechanisms for works taking of flexible forms of labor.

The art of copywriting is as old as advertising itself, made great by industry legends like David Ogilvy and Bill Bernbach. But as marketers begin turning toward tools that automate copy, is the craft in danger?Over the past few years, brands have been toying with different ways AI can double as a wordsmith. While these experiments have proven that AI’s ability to “learn” mass amounts of information give it a unique advantage when it comes to churning out copy, it’s also become increasingly clear that there’s only so much the technology can provide from a creative perspective.Take

This future is already happening in warehouses and manufacturing businesses. Other workers use virtual or augmented reality as part of their employment training, to assist them in performing their job or to interact with clients. And lots of workers are under automated surveillance from their employers.All that automation yields data that can be used to analyze workers’ performance. Those analyses, whether done by humans or software programs, may affect who is hired, fired, promoted and given raises. Some artificial intelligence programs can mine and manipulate the data to predict future actions, such as who is likely to quit their job, or to diagnose medical conditions.If your job doesn’t currently involve these types of technologies, it likely will in the very near future. This worries me—a labor and employment law scholar who researches the role of technology in the workplace—because unless significant changes are made to American workplace laws, these sorts of surveillance and privacy invasions will be perfectly legal.[Image: Stratus3D/iStock, StudioM1/iStock]New technology disrupting old workplace lawsThe United States’ regulation of the workplace has long been an outlier among much of the world. Especially for private, nonunionized workers, the U.S. largely allows companies and workers to figure out the terms and conditions of work on their own.In general, for all but the most in-demand workers or those at the highest corporate levels, the lack of regulation means companies can behave however they want—although they are subject to laws preventing discrimination, setting minimum wages, requiring overtime pay, and ensuring worker safety.But most of those laws are decades old and are rarely updated. They certainly haven’t kept up with technological advances, the increase in temporary or “gig” work, and other changes in the economy. Faced with these new challenges, the old laws leave many workers without adequate protections against workplace abuses, or even totally exclude some workers from any protections at all. For instance, two Trump administration agencies have recently declared that Uber drivers are not employees and therefore not entitled to minimum wage, overtime, or the right to engage in collective action such as joining a union.Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, virtual reality, and advanced monitoring systems have already begun altering workplaces in fundamental ways that may soon become impossible to ignore. That progress highlights the need for meaningful changes to employment laws.[Image: Stratus3D/iStock, StudioM1/iStock]Consider Uber driversLike other companies in what has been called the “gig economy,” Uber has spent considerable amounts of money and time litigating and lobbying to protect regulations classifying its drivers as independent contractors, rather than employees. Uber set its fifth annual federal lobbying record in 2018, spending US$2.3 million on issues including keeping its drivers from being classified as employees.The distinction is a crucial one. Uber does not have to pay employment taxes—or unemployment insurance premiums—on independent contractors. In addition, nonemployees are completely excluded from any workplace protection laws. These workers are not entitled to a minimum wage or overtime; they can be discriminated against based on their race, sex, religion, color, national origin, age, disability, and military status; they lack the right to unionize; and they are not entitled to a safe working environment.Companies have tried to classify workers as independent contractors ever since there have been workplace laws, but technology has greatly expanded companies’ ability to hire labor that blurs the lines between employees and independent contractors.[Image: Stratus3D/iStock, StudioM1/iStock]Employees aren’t protected, eitherEven for workers who are considered employees, technology allows employers to take advantage of the gaps in workplace laws like never before. Many workers already use computers, smartphones and other equipment that allows employers to monitor their activity and location, even when off duty.And emerging technology permits far greater privacy intrusions. For instance, some employers already have badges that track and monitor workers’ movements and conversations. Japanese employers use technology to monitor workers’ eyelid movements and lower the room temperature if the system identifies signs of drowsiness.Another company implanted RFID chips into the arms of employee “volunteers.” The purpose was to make it easier for workers to open doors, log in to their computers, and purchase items from a break room, but a person with an RFID implant can be tracked 24 hours a day. Also, RFID chips are susceptible to unauthorized access or “skimming” by thieves who are merely physically close to the chip.advertisement[Image: Stratus3D/iStock, StudioM1/iStock]No privacy protections for workersThe monitoring that’s possible now will seem simplistic compared to what’s coming: a future in which robotics and other technologies capture huge amounts of personal information to feed artificial intelligence software that learns which metrics are associated with things such as workers’ moods and energy levels, or even diseases like depression.One healthcare analytic firm, whose clients include some of the biggest employers in the country, already uses workers’ internet search histories and medical insurance claims to predict who is at risk of getting diabetes or considering becoming pregnant. The company says it provides only summary information to clients, such as the number of women in a workplace who are trying to have children, but in most instances it can probably legally identify specific workers.Except for some narrow exceptions—like in bathrooms and other specific areas where workers can expect to be in relative privacy—private-sector employees have virtually no way, nor any legal right, to opt out of this sort of monitoring. They may not even be informed that it is occurring. Public-sector employees have more protection, thanks to the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches, but in government workplaces, the scope of that prohibition is quite narrow.[Image: Stratus3D/iStock, StudioM1/iStock]AI discriminationIn contrast to the almost total lack of privacy laws protecting workers, employment discrimination laws—while far from perfect—can provide some important protections for employees. But those laws have already faced criticism for their overly simplistic and limited view of what constitutes discrimination, which makes it very difficult for victims to file and win lawsuits or obtain meaningful settlements. Emerging technology, particularly AI, will exacerbate this problem.AI software programs used in the hiring process are marketed as eliminating or reducing biased human decision-making. In fact, they can create more bias, because these systems depend on large collections of data, which can be biased themselves.For instance, Amazon recently abandoned a multiyear project to develop an AI hiring program because it kept discriminating against women. Apparently, the AI program learned from Amazon’s male-dominated workforce that being a man was associated with being a good worker. To its credit, Amazon never used the program for actual hiring decisions, but what about employers who lack the resources, knowledge, or desire to identify biased AI?The laws about discrimination based on computer algorithms are unclear, just as other technologies stretch employment laws and regulations well beyond their clear applications. Without an update to the rules, more workers will continue to fall outside traditional worker protections–and may even be unaware how vulnerable they really are.Jeffrey Hirsch is the Geneva Yeargan Rand Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel HillThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

ScrapingAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTA Breakthrough for A.I. Technology: Passing an 8th-Grade Science TestShare full articleRead in appBy Cade MetzSept. 4, 2019SAN FRANCISCO — Four years ago, more than 700 computer scientists competed in a contest to build artificial intelligence that could pass an eighth-grade science test. There was $80,000 in prize money on the line.They all flunked. Even the most sophisticated system couldn’t do better than 60 percent on the test. A.I. couldn’t match the language and logic skills that students are expected to have when they enter high school.But on Wednesday, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a prominent lab in Seattle, unveiled a new system that passed the test with room to spare. It correctly answered more than 90 percent of the questions on an eighth-grade science test and more than 80 percent on a 12th-grade exam.Match Wits With Aristo on 5 Quiz QuestionsHere are five questions that were presented to a computer system from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a prominent lab in Seattle.The system, called Aristo, is an indication that in just the past several months researchers have made significant progress in developing A.I. that can understand languages and mimic the logic and decision-making of humans.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe world’s top research labs are rapidly improving a machine’s ability to understand and respond to natural language. Machines are getting better at analyzing documents, finding information, answering questions and even generating language of their own.Aristo was built solely for multiple-choice tests. It took standard exams written for students in New York, though the Allen Institute removed all questions that included pictures and diagrams. Answering questions like that would have required additional skills that combine language understanding and logic with so-called computer vision.Some test questions, like this one from the eighth-grade exam, required little more than information retrieval:A group of tissues that work together to perform a specific function is called:(1) an organ(2) an organism(3) a system(4) a cellBut others, like this question from the same exam, required logic:Which change would most likely cause a decrease in the number of squirrels living in an area?(1) a decrease in the number of predators(2) a decrease in competition between the squirrels(3) an increase in available food(4) an increase in the number of forest firesResearchers at the Allen Institute started work on Aristo — they wanted to build a “digital Aristotle” — in 2013, just after the lab was founded by the Seattle billionaire and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. They saw standardized science tests as a more meaningful alternative to typical A.I. benchmarks, which relied on games like chess and backgammon or tasks created solely for machines.A science test isn’t something that can be mastered just by learning rules. It requires making connections using logic. An increase in forest fires, for example, could kill squirrels or decrease the food supply needed for them to thrive and reproduce.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEnthusiasm for the progress made by Aristo is still tempered among scientists who believe machines are a long way from completely mastering natural language — and even further from duplicating true intelligence.“We can’t compare this technology to real human students and their ability to reason,” said Jingjing Liu, a Microsoft researcher who has been working on many of the same technologies as the Allen Institute.But Aristo’s advances could spread to a range of products and services, from internet search engines to record-keeping systems at hospitals.ImageOren Etzioni, who oversees the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, said an advance unveiled on Wednesday could have a wide impact, from search engines to medical records.Credit...Kyle Johnson for The New York Times“This has significant business consequences,” said Oren Etzioni, the former University of Washington professor who oversees the Allen Institute. “What I can say — with complete confidence — is you are going to see a whole new generation of products, some from start-ups, some from the big companies.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe new research could lead to systems that can carry on a decent conversation. But it could also encourage the spread of false information.“We are at the very early stage of this,” said Jeremy Howard, who oversees Fast.ai, another influential lab, in San Francisco. “We are so far away from the potential that I cannot say where it will end up.”In 2016, when a London lab built a system that could beat the world’s best players at the ancient game of Go, it was widely hailed as a turning point for artificial intelligence.Dr. Etzioni’s excitement, however, was muted. Artificial intelligence was not nearly as advanced as it might seem, he said, pointing to the earlier Allen Institute’s competition that stumped the A.I. systems with an eighth-grade science test.The Allen Institute improved on that earlier effort much quicker than many experts — including Dr. Etzioni — expected.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIts work was largely driven by neural networks, complex mathematical systems that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. By pinpointing patterns in thousands of dog photos, for example, a neural network can learn to recognize a dog.In recent months, the world’s leading A.I. labs have built elaborate neural networks that can learn the vagaries of language by analyzing articles and books written by humans.At Google, researchers built a system called Bert that combed through thousands of Wikipedia articles and a vast digital library of romance novels, science fiction and other self-published books.Through analyzing all that text, Bert learned how to guess the missing word in a sentence. By learning that one skill, Bert soaked up enormous amounts of information about the fundamental ways language is constructed. And researchers could apply that knowledge to other tasks.ImageDr. Etzioni and Peter Clark, manager of the Aristo project, at the Allen Institute in Seattle.Credit...Kyle Johnson for The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe Allen Institute built their Aristo system on top of the Bert technology. They fed Bert a wide range of questions and answers. In time, it learned to answer similar questions on its own.Not long ago, researchers at the lab defined the behavior of their test-taking system one line of software code at a time. Sometimes they still do that painstaking coding. But now that the system can learn from digital data on its own, it can improve at a much faster rate.Systems like Bert — called “language models” — now drive a wide range of research projects, including conversational systems and tools designed to identify false news. With more data and more computing power researchers believe the technology will continue to improve.But Dr. Etzioni stressed that the future of these systems was hard to predict and that language was only one piece of the puzzle.Ms. Liu and her fellow Microsoft researchers have tried to build a system that can pass the Graduate Records Exam, the test required for admission to graduate school.The language section was doable, she said, but building the reasoning skills required for the math section was another matter. “It was far too challenging.”Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @cademetz.

Sudhen Desai, M.D.




Burnout has become a popular buzzword in today’s business world, meant to describe prolonged periods of stress in the workplace leading to feelings of depression and dissatisfaction with one’s occupation. The topic has become so pervasive that the World Health Organization (WHO) addressed it at its 2019 World Health Assembly in Geneva in May, adding burnout to the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) — although classifying it as an “occupational phenomenon” rather than a medical condition.
Healthcare itself is not immune to burnout, and a recent study in Journal of the American College of Radiology demonstrates it is taking a toll on pediatric radiologists in particular. The study surveyed Society of Pediatric Radiology (SPR) members and found nearly two-thirds expressed at least one symptom of burnout. While burnout is a complicated phenomenon and no two people experience it the same way, a commentary on the study suggests artificial intelligence (AI) could help alleviate some of the difficulties that can lead to burnout.
Defining Burnout
Rama S. Ayyala, M.D., is a pediatric radiologist with the Department of Diagnostic Imaging at Rhode Island Hospital-Hasbro Children’s Hospital and Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. She wanted to study burnout because she had been interacting with a lot of people in her field who were experiencing it. “A lot of them were leaving medicine and some were even having mental health issues,” she said.
This sentiment was also born out in the most recent edition of the National Physician Burnout, Depression and Suicide Report, published by Medscape. The report ranks medical subspecialties by the percentage of clinicians reporting feelings of burnout. Radiology ranked seventh in the 2018 Medscape survey — alarming enough by itself, but even more so because it jumped from 18th place in the previous edition.1
Ayyala’s research team surveyed SPR members on their feelings of burnout according to the three components of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), originally published in 1981:
•    Emotional exhaustion (feeling overextended and depleted);
•    Depersonalization (a sense of cynicism, and/or a detached or callous attitude toward your job); and
•    Lack of personal accomplishment (perceived incompetence with capabilities in the job).
 
A total of 460 clinicians returned responses out of the 1,453 who were sent the survey, a 32 percent response rate. The prevalence rate for emotional exhaustion among the respondent group was 66 percent and depersonalization was 61 percent.
“People feel like they’ve lost their sense of control,” said Ayyala.
The survey included additional questions to gather more information about the roles and job characteristics of pediatric radiologists, including:
•    Gender;
•    Full- or part-time employment status;
•    How long they have been practicing;
•    Practice type;
•    Total number of pediatric radiologists in the practice; and
•    On-call status and frequency of being on-call.
 
Out of all the job characteristics surveyed, on-call status seemed to have the single greatest association with increased feelings of burnout. “Many children’s hospitals currently struggle with how to provide 24-hour radiology coverage,” Ayyala stated.   
AI Making Way Into Pediatric Imaging
Technology has dramatically changed the way radiologists practice, as remote viewing systems, the evolution of picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and mobile devices allow them to read images from essentially anywhere. For some radiologists who feel burned out due to their workload, however, technology may be able to help alleviate some of their burden — specifically artificial intelligence (AI).
Michael J. Callahan, M.D., who is the director, computed tomography; division chief, abdominal imaging; medical director, ultrasound; and staff radiologist in the Department of Radiology at Boston Children’s Hospital, wrote a commentary for Pediatric Radiology on Ayyala’s study. The topic of burnout has become a point of focus at recent SPR meetings, and the society is working to find possible solutions to help its members. According to Callahan, AI has been discussed as one approach to help improve efficiency in image interpretation. “Although theoretical solutions exist for a multitude of problems, steps to moderate and manage the effects and consequences of burnout in pediatric radiologists will undoubtedly require in-depth discussions at future SPR meetings,” he wrote.
The use of AI has exploded in radiology as a whole in recent years, with vendors and clinicians exploring its use for everything from image interpretation to worklist sorting and more. Despite the immense interest, AI is taking slightly longer making its way to clinical use in the subspecialty of pediatric radiology. This is largely due to the need for large volumes of data to train algorithms, a feat which is difficult with the generally lower volumes of pediatric imaging, according to Sudhen Desai, M.D., an interventional radiologist at Texas Children’s Hospital.
“A system like Texas Children’s, which has a good amount of inpatient and outpatient volume, has available to itself the ability to create datasets to train models from. That’s one of our luxuries,” he said. “However, there are smaller pediatric institutions that suffer from lack of available data.”
Part of the problem, according to Desai, is that the need for larger volumes of data runs counter to the long-standing protocol of limiting the exposure of children to radiation, advanced through national initiatives such as Image Wisely. While this has placed limitations on the adoption of AI in pediatric radiology, the technology itself may also offer a way forward. Desai said that work is ongoing to train the algorithms with lower numbers of radiographs or cross-sectional imaging. With this information, algorithm architects can employ methods such as feedback learning (teaching the computer to take actions in an environment so as to maximize the concept of a cumulative reward) and transfer learning (using the knowledge gained from one application and applying it to a different but related problem). “So we’re trying to use various tricks and techniques to train our models in a more efficient fashion so that we don’t need tens of thousands of datasets but ... maybe hundreds of datasets, that would allow us to do the work,” Desai said.
Using AI to Combat Burnout
As suggested by Callahan, the role of AI in combating pediatric radiologist burnout may be in streamlining and/or automating some of the processes and tasks that entail a heavy workload burden. Several practitioners are already exploring the use of AI in a clinical pediatric imaging setting, offering many promising applications.
 
Bone age detection. Bone age evaluation is one of the most common practices in pediatric radiology. Radiologists examine series of hand radiographs to evaluate a patient’s growth and diagnose developmental disorders. The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) made this the focus of its first annual Machine Learning Challenge in 2017. Teams of researchers were encouraged to develop their own algorithms for automating bone age detection by using a dataset of hand radiographs compiled from various leading U.S. research institutions. Participants in the challenge were judged on how well the bone age evaluations produced by their algorithms agreed with the expert observers’ notated evaluations. The winning algorithm is now available through the EnvoyAI Exchange platform.
Safwan Halabi, M.D., a clinical associate professor of radiology – pediatric radiology at Stanford Children’s Health, has been using the bone age algorithm in his clinical research. He is currently collaborating with researchers at nine other institutions to validate the algorithm “and it’s looking really good,” he said. “We could eliminate some of our mundane things that we measure [because they] can be automated and sent directly to the electronic health record.”
 
Pneumonia detection. Halabi’s Stanford colleague Matthew Lungren, M.D., an assistant professor of radiology (pediatric radiology) is part of a group developing an AI algorithm to improve pneumonia detection on chest X-rays. Their model is trained on a National Institutes of Health (NIH) dataset consisting of 112,120 frontal view chest X-rays from 30,805 unique patients. In a preliminary paper published in 2017, the algorithm was found to exceed the performance of an average radiologist in detecting pneumonia.2   
Pneumonia detection was the focus of the 2018 RSNA Machine Learning Challenge.
 
Interpreting tubes and catheters in pediatric X-rays. Another challenge in the world of pediatric imaging is the fact that many of the smallest, sickest patients have a large number of tubes and other apparatus attached to them — feeding tubes, catheters, ECG leads and more. When these patients need to be imaged, the radiologist will typically have to go through each image and identify artifacts that are external to the patient.
Desai stated that research is currently being done to train AI to identify and classify these outside objects in an X-ray. Using adult chest radiographs, the research group added markers for lines and tubes, and that information was fed back into the AI model. The model was then applied to pediatric radiographs, and it was able to identify lines, tubes and other objects “on the order of about 80 percent,” Desai said. The ultimate goal is for the computer to recognize catheters or tubes that are out of position and alert the radiologist.3
Human Element Still Required
These and other applications offer hope for artificial intelligence to act as a workflow organizer for pediatric radiologists experiencing burnout from an intense workload. But while the technology continues to mature, it is critical for the people guiding the technology to carefully consider its application.
“Burnout is a very broad term which can stem from many different causes,” said Stacey Funt, M.D. Funt previously worked as a full-time body radiologist in New York before her own experiences with burnout caused her to reorder her priorities. She now works in radiology part-time while speaking across the U.S. as a health and wellness coach for healthcare providers through her own company, Lifestyle Health LLC. Funt’s experience with burnout stemmed from a perceived loss of connection with other doctors and her patients. Ultimately, she believes that the most helpful technological solutions are those that can help improve communication and connection across the healthcare continuum. This could be especially helpful for the subset of radiologists who identified being on-call as a potential source of burnout. “I think one source of stress for radiologists that technology can address, especially when on-call, is when you need to contact referring physicians to relay critical information but you can't reach anyone. Another is if you have a really tough case that you are not sure of but don't have anyone present to run it by. So it all depends on the issues for each person, and that’s variable,” she concluded.

September 3rd, 2019, London, UK: Deep Knowledge Analytics salutes its parent company, Deep Knowledge Ventures, in the landmark Nature Biotechnology publication of its portfolio company, Insilico Medicine, demonstrating the design, synthesis and preclinical validation of a novel drug candidate in just 46 days.
The many advances in deep learning reinforcement learning and generative adversarial learning made since 2014 are rapidly transforming multiple industries including search, translation, video games, retail, transportation, and many others. It is relatively easy to validate the performance of the AI systems in imaging, voice, text and other areas where human sensory systems can be used to rapidly verify the validity of the experimental results. However, in the pharmaceutical industry, the validation cycles take decades and cost billions of dollars. Most of the common questions asked by the pharmaceutical industry executives to all of the leading artificial intelligence groups worldwide deal with the novelty of the algorithms and experimental validation of the results in mice or even in humans. There is a grave disconnect between the leaders in AI focusing on the novelty of the algorithms and drug discovery and development experts focusing only on experimental data. 
On Monday, September 2nd, a group of collaborators from Insilico Medicine and WuXi AppTec published irrefutable proof where cutting-edge work in artificial intelligence utilizing the next-generation generative tensorial and reinforcement learning was followed by experimental validation. The molecules ""imagined"" by the Generative Tensorial Reinforcement Learning (GENTRL) techniques were rapidly synthesized, tested in enzymatic, cell-based fibrosis, metabolic stability, microsomal stability assays, and in mice.
The paper Alex Zhavoronkov, et al, 2019,  ""Deep learning enables rapid identification of potent DDR1 kinase inhibitors"", Nature Biotechnology, presents a substantial advance in artificial intelligence for drug discovery. The AI work presented in the paper was done in 2017 and the code is openly available. The company scientists believe that they can go after the many target classes and challenging targets with the universal generative pipeline that can account for cases where no crystal structure exists and one or even no template molecules are known while achieving respectable hit rates. 
We sent the article to a number of thought leaders in the industry asking for their opinion:
""This is an important demonstration of the power of AI, using a GAN approach, to markedly accelerate the design and experimental validation of a new molecule, no less one targeting fibrosis, a major unmet medical need."" said Dr. Eric Topol, Executive Vice-President of Scripps Research and Founder and Director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute (Eric Topol has no relationship with the company in question nor its authors). 
""Zhavoronkov et al. show that AI techniques can be used to guide our search for good drug molecules in the the vastness of chemical space, one of the key challenges in drug discovery today. The work provides compelling evidence that AI can learn from historical datasets to generate novel molecular compounds with drug-like properties, and helps clarify how AI can be used to improve the speed of drug development."" said Mark DePristo, former Head of Genomics at Google Brain, Co-founder and CEO, BigHat Biosciences.
""When Deep Knowledge Ventures chose to provide Insilico Medicine's initial funding round in 2014, we did so because we saw their potential to increase Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) for the betterment of humanity as a whole. Since then they have been the first to use cutting edge deep learning techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks to design novel drug candidates from scratch with specified molecular properties in 2016, and in 2018 to succeed in designing, synthesizing and validating a new drug end to end in less than 2 months. I am also thrilled by the fact that this article visualizes what Insilico Medicine has been making in their R&D already back in 2017 and submitted for publication in 2018. I would not be surprised to find out that since then they have made even greater progress in applying next-generation AI techniques for drug design, which might be publicly disclosed in 2020"" said Dmitry Kaminskiy, General Partner of Deep Knowledge Ventures.
""Using Advanced GANs in the discovery of drugs is a great example of cutting edge application of AI in the pharmaceutical industry - it speeds up a critical process from years to just weeks."" said Christian Guttmann, Executive Director Nordic AI Institute, Professor AI at the University of New South Wales, and Senior AI Research Fellow AI at Karolinska Institute.
""Exhilarating news in Nature Biotechnology today, as scientists from Insilico Medicine (Hong Kong), report that an AI process called GENTRL, has facilitated the identification of new small molecule kinase inhibitors, DNA damage response (DDR1) inhibitors, in a two month time frame, reducing the current non-AI early 'research/preclinical development' time estimates for new drugs by approximately 94%. The cost savings for bio-marker drugs using AI processes is huge.  Not only is the end-to-end development time reduced, but so too are the costs related to R&D scientific, professional and technical personnel, which account for approximately 29% of the total cost to develop a drug, according to Tufts CSDD.  In addition to the reduced development time and costs, drugs potentially get to market sooner, generating revenues for the companies who developed the drugs. DDR inhibitors are being studied for the treatment of cancer. Since the FDA fast tracks many drugs for serious conditions, there is incredible potential to reduce overall developments costs while increase the speed which novel drugs can be approved for very sick patients waiting for them. This welcome news comes at a time when soaring costs for drug development, arguably are being recouped in high prices of novel innovative therapies hitting the market."" said Barbara Gilmore, Senior Consultant on Transformational Health at Frost & Sullivan.
""It is extremely exciting seeing Deep Learning and other techniques being used to help pinpoint drug discovery in a matter of days. In particular, exploiting large, publicly-available data sets to accelerate this process can give huge benefits for low cost. The data-driven approach will give better and faster results than the traditional methods, leading to faster drug discovery and safer, more reliable results than clinical trials on their own. While it's unlikely that AI will replace the current methods overnight, it's obvious that organisations which add AI to their methods will quickly replace those who do not. It is vital these organisations 'Uber' themselves before they get Kodaked"" said David Whewel, former Director of Architecture and Software Innovation at Merck Group.
""As far as I know, this marks the first ever demonstration that AI can generate entirely novel, synthesizable, active molecules against a specific pharmacological target. In my view, the fact that they were able to generate entirely novel, pharmacologically viable compounds using AI is the most amazing achievement here. Of course it's even more amazing that they established this ground-breaking proof of concept in just 46 days!"" said Olivier Elemento, Director of the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine & Associate Director of the Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.

In brief: At the Shanghai Expo Center in China, hosting the 2019 World Artificial Intelligence Conference, Elon Musk and Jack Ma began proceedings with a 45-minute debate around the risks and potential rewards associated with artificial intelligence while also discussing Mars, work culture and chimpanzees among other topics. 
Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and Tesla CEO, exchanged views on-stage with Jack Ma, Chinese billionaire and co-founder of the multinational conglomerate Alibaba Group, over the risks and benefits of artificial intelligence.
""Does AI mean love? There's like a name, AI, it sort of sounds a bit like love?"" began Musk to which Ma amusingly replied ""Yeah AI...I hate the word AI called artificial intelligence. I call it Alibaba intelligence.""
Both leaders had different opinions on the implications of the technology where optimistic Ma said that he didn't consider AI to be a threat, ""I don't know, man, that's like, famous last words,"" replied Musk. According to the Tesla CEO, most people think of AI as a smart human but he said it's going to be much more than that. ""It'll be much smarter than the smartest human.""
He further highlighted AI's capability to be much smarter than humans by saying that ""the biggest mistake that I see artificial intelligence researchers making is assuming that they're intelligent. Yeah they're not, compared to AI. And so like, a lot of them cannot imagine something smarter than themselves, but AI will be vastly smarter---vastly.""

Jack Ma, meanwhile, credited Elon with having a vision about technology and said that he himself is not a ""tech guy"" as he's ""all about life"" and thinks that AI will open a new chapter enabling people to understand themselves better. ""99.99 percent of the predictions that human beings had in history about the future---all wrong,"" said Ma to which Musk responded ""Including that one?""
Talking about technology that's changing at an ""incredibly fast"" rate, Musk said that ""it is outpacing our ability to understand it,"" and he wasn't sure if that was good or bad. He further commented on ""humanity"" being a ""biological boot loader for digital super intelligence.""

When asked by Ma about his curiosity for Mars, Musk said that he thinks it was ""important for us to take the set of actions that are most likely to continue consciousness into the future....where are the aliens? This is the Fermi paradox. This is one of the most important questions. How come we have not found any aliens? There are people out there who think we've found aliens. Trust me, I would know. We have not.""
Commenting on AI's role as a force for good in reducing work hours, Ma said that AI would help create new kinds of jobs that require less of our time. ""I think people should work three days a week, four hours a day,"" and that in artificial intelligence, people would be able to live on for 120 years.
With the debate lasting over 45 minutes, the executives touched on education systems, disagreed over machines outsmarting humans and concluded that population collapse was the biggest problem the world faced over the next 20 years.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






The Aristo AI software has matched an eighth-grader’s ability to pass a science test. (AI2 Illustration)
Four years after the late Seattle billionaire Paul Allen challenged researchers to come up with an artificial intelligence program smart enough to pass an eighth-grade science test, that feat has been declared accomplished — by the hometown team.
The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, or AI2, announced today that its Aristo software scored better than 90% on a multiple-choice test geared for eighth graders, and better than 80% on a test for high school seniors.
There are caveats, of course: The exam, which was based on New York Regents aptitude tests, excluded questions that depended on interpreting pictures or diagrams. Those questions would have required visual interpretation skills that aren’t yet programmed into Aristo. Questions requiring a direct answer (that is, essay questions) were also left out. And for what it’s worth, Aristo would have been useless outside the areas of science in which it was trained.
Nevertheless, the exercise illustrated how far AI has come just since 2016, when all of the programs competing in the $80,000 Allen AI Science Challenge flunked.
“This is a breakthrough because it’s a remarkable result on standardized test questions which require a degree of natural language understanding, reasoning, and even common sense,” AI2 CEO Oren Etzioni told GeekWire in an email. “This is very different from both standard research benchmarks and board games like Go. Even a year ago, no one would have anticipated such rapid progress on 8th and 12th grade science questions!”
AI2 science quiz: Match wits with Aristo, circa 2016
The work builds on a series of language-interpreting, question-answering AI agents including AI2’s ELMo program and the BERT program developed at Google’s research facility in Seattle. Aristo takes advantage of eight types of problem-solving agents — ranging from an agent that merely looks up answers in a database, to an agent that checks lists of associated concepts (known as tuples), to an agent that performs qualitative reasoning.
Each problem-solver produces a score for the preferred multiple-choice answer, and Aristo weights the different scores to select the most likely choice. The program optimizes its performance through rounds of training and calibration.
For example, one question asks: “How are the particles in a block of iron affected when the block is melted? (A) The particles gain mass. (B) The particles contain less energy. (C) The particles move more rapidly. (D) The particles increase in volume.”
To answer the question, Aristo retrieves the knowledge that particles move faster as the heat of a particle increase, associates the term “melted” with “heat,” associates the term “faster” with “more rapidly,” and scores C as the correct choice.
Combining different problem-solving approaches cleared the way for Aristo to raise its test score from roughly 60% in 2016 to 91.6% on the eighth-grade test. The program scored nearly as well, 83.5%, on the 12th-grade exam.
This chart shows how Aristo scored on the New York Regents eighth-grade science test (including only multiple-choice, non-diagram questions) over time. The increase in performance reflects a progressively more sophisticated approach to analyzing test questions.
In a research paper about the project, Etzioni and other AI2 researchers — including Peter Clark, senior manager for Project Aristo — say the program’s passing grade “is only a step on the long road toward a machine that has a deep understanding of science and achieves Paul Allen’s original dream of a Digital Aristotle.”
The researchers are aiming to extend Aristo’s skills to encompass diagram-based questions and essay questions. Eventually, the technology should advance the state of the art when it comes to providing natural-language answers to questions that would tax the brains of grown-ups as well as eighth-graders.
That’s likely to lead to digital assistants that are smarter than the current iterations of Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana and Apple’s Siri — as well as a whole new wave of AI applications and startups.
In separate emails, Etzioni and Clark both paid tribute to Paul Allen, who passed away last October at the age of 65. And they both said he’d want more.
“Paul would’ve been very pleased, but wouldn’t let us rest on our laurels,” Etzioni told GeekWire. “He would ask: What’s your next major step towards understanding of language?”
Clark agreed: “I would imagine him saying “Congratulations! What’s next?” ”
Update for 1:25 p.m. PT Sept. 4: I sent Clark some follow-up questions via email, and here are a few answers that expand upon the significance of the research. The Q&A has been edited for brevity and clarity (especially for the Q’s):

GeekWire: How is this approach different from IBM’s Watson? If Aristo were to compete against Watson, who would win?
Clark: “The two systems were designed for very different kinds of questions. Watson was focused on encyclopedia-style ‘factoid’ questions where the answer was explicitly written down somewhere in text, typically many times. In contrast, Aristo answers science questions where the answer is not always written down somewhere, and may involve reasoning about a scenario, e.g.:

“Otto pushed a toy car across a floor. The car traveled fast across the wood, but it slowed to a stop on the carpet. Which best explains what happened when the car reached the carpet? (A) Friction increased (B) Friction decreased…”
“City administrators can encourage energy conservation by (1) lowering parking fees (2) building larger parking lots (3) decreasing the cost of gasoline (4) lowering the cost of bus and subway fares.”

“Out of the box, Watson would likely struggle with science questions, and Aristo would struggle with the cryptic way that ‘Jeopardy’ questions were phrased. They’d each fail each other’s test.
“Under the hood they are quite different too. In particular, Watson didn’t use deep learning (it was created before the deep learning technology) while Aristo makes heavy use of deep learning. Watson had many modules that tried different ways of looking for the answer. Aristo has a few (eight) modules that try a variety of methods of answering questions, including lookup, several reasoning methods and language modeling.”
Q: Please pass along the usual caveats. For example, questions with pictures were not used because they’d require computer vision. Any other caveats?
A: “Aristo isn’t able to handle questions with diagrams very well except in a few special cases. For instance, Aristo can answer questions about food chains, but it can’t answer those that require reading a map or studying a bar chart. It also has difficulty dealing with hypothetical situations. For example, Aristo struggles with the following question: “If you pull the leaves off a plant, what would the result be?” A good answer would be that the plant would no longer be able to make its own food. But Aristo struggles with this question because it requires the system to create an imaginary world and imagine what would happen in that world. Finally, our benchmark is a multiple choice test, another limitation.”
Q: Could you say a bit about the potential applications? Do you see a “question-answering” program like Watson, or do you see more novel applications?
A: “Aristo’s long-term goal is not just about passing science tests, it’s about creating a system that has a deeper understanding of science, with many potential applications. There are three areas in particular that seem promising. The first is in the area of education and personalized education, where Aristo could help a child understand science by providing personal tutoring. The second is in helping scientists. I can imagine Aristo offering background information on scientific concepts and prior work to a scientist in a laboratory. Finally, longer term, Aristo might help in scientific discovery itself, connecting the dots where people haven’t been able to in the past, in areas such as medicine or engineering. Aristo currently has a long way to go to reach these goals, of course, but performing so well on the Regents Science exam is a tremendous step forward.”

Authors of the AI2 team’s paper, “From ‘F’ to ‘A’ on the N.Y. Regents Science Exam: An Overview of the Aristo Project,” include Clark and Etzioni as well as Tushar Khot, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Kyle Richardson, Ashish Sabharwal, Carissa Schoenick, Oyvind Tafjord, Niket Tandon, Sumithra Bhakthavatsalam, Dirk Groeneveld and Michal Guerquin.
