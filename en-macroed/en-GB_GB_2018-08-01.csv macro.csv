My answer is twofold: First, it’s important to understand the developments in AI and technology.  Learn about the advancements being made and understand what AI can do. And second, focus on building the skills in areas robots can’t do well.

Jobs AI can do better than humans
While AI is making exponential advances year after year, the popular media often like to exaggerate what it is capable of for the sake of eye-catching headlines and anxiety-inducing news soundbites.
PROMOTED
The truth is, while technology is making great strides in simplifying and automating some work, the truth is that many of these tasks are actually much simpler and fewer than you might think.
Machine learning, for example, is good at taking one type of input, call it Input A, and producing a simple response, Output B. Think of a program that is taught to recognize whether or not there is a cat in a photo. We input a series of photos, A, and the program tells us if the images contain cats, B.

(If you have Photos on your Mac, you can see this in action for yourself. Open the program and search your own photo collection for cat or dog or even something like cake or tea. Most of the results will be accurate, and some, often amusingly, won’t.)





While this has the potential to simplify and automate many different types of work, it also has two main drawbacks. First, the program requires massive amounts of learning data to begin to produce Output B reliably. So, in our example, you would have to provide the program with tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of examples of photographs and tell the program whether or not they have cats in them so that it can learn what a cat looks like in many different contexts.

Stanford professor Andrew Ng, writing for the Harvard Business Review, has a good rule of thumb for determining which types of jobs are ripe for automation: “If a typical person can do a mental task with less than one second of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future,” he writes.
So, while there is great potential here to automate the sorts of tasks that require this Input A to Output B kind of model — including scanning security video for suspicious behavior, alerting drivers to pedestrians in the road, tagging hateful or abusive comments online, and so on — using AI to automate these tasks also requires a great deal of investment and work upfront.
As these technologies develop and become more universal, we probably will see humans losing jobs to computers (though not Star Wars-style sentient robots) in the near future. Jobs currently held by humans that require this same sort of Input A to Output B scenario are likely to be outsourced to computers, including jobs like receptionists, telemarketers, bookkeeping clerks, proofreaders, delivery couriers, and even retail salespeople.
Jobs AI can’t do better than humans
Lucky for us mere humans, there are a significant number of jobs that require more than a simple Input A to Output B calculation.
Many jobs require additional and very human qualities like communication, empathy, creativity, strategic thinking, questioning, and dreaming. Collectively, we often refer to these qualities as “soft skills,” but don’t let the name fool you; these soft skills are going to be hard currency in the job market as AI and technology take over some of the jobs that can be performed without people.
For example:

Empathy and communication: While AI is being used in medical applications to do things like more accurately detect diseases on a scan, I certainly wouldn't want to get a robocall to break the news that I have cancer. Even though we are making strides towards affective computing, we are a long way away from any technology that can genuinely recognize human emotions and respond to them appropriately, so any job that requires empathy like primary care physicians, caregivers, and therapists are unlikely to be outsourced to technology any time soon.
Critical thinking: I love the old science fiction shows where the human asks the computer what they should do in a terrible situation, and the computer predicts a 99 percent probability of failure — but the human goes and does the thing anyway, and usually succeeds. To me, it's a beautiful metaphor for the fact that, no matter how advanced our AI may be, we still need a human to make judgments and critical decisions, even to ""go with our gut,"" in certain situations. A more contemporary example might be that law firms are employing AI to help identify relevant documents in legal cases, but we still need a human judge to adjudicate a decision. (A computer judge and jury would be an entirely different sci-fi horror story in the making.)
Creativity: Computer programs are good at spitting out a number of options, but they're not necessarily good at providing quality of creative choices. While AI can technically produce food, music, or art, the results can be… Well, less than inspiring. We've probably all seen the funny lists of AI-generated recipes or paint colors or even inspirational quotes. Any job that requires true creativity, such as writers, engineers, inventors, entrepreneurs, artists, musicians, etc., are probably safe for a long while based on these results.
Strategy: In business especially, we're beginning to see a lot of automation of marketing practices and the like. For example, I can tell a program to send a Tweet for me at a particular time of day, every day. And while these can be huge time savers, the automation tools are just that: tools. They don't provide the overall strategy needed to give the individual tasks meaning and relevance. Any job that requires strategic thinking is likely to be safe, and improving your skills in that area can help robot-proof your job.
Technological management, installation, and upkeep: Until the robots have robots of their own to install and maintain them, humans are going to be needed to design, plan, install, manage and maintain any robotics, technology, or AI systems. This takes us back to my first point about understanding what technology is capable of; the more familiar you are with the technology, the more valuable you will be in helping implement and maintain it.
Physical skills: While robots are being created that can do increasingly tricky things, like make your morning latte, there are still a significant number of physical skills robots haven’t mastered. Additionally, we humans seem to love to watch each other accomplish incredible physical feats (the World Cup is just one example). So if you have any amazing physical skills, from crafting to sport, you’re also safe for now.
Imagination and vision: Finally, one quality I can't quite imagine a robot or AI ever possessing is just that: imagination. The way AI currently works is by taking existing data and making logical inferences based on parameters we give it. Imagination and dreaming are merely not programmable skills. Activists, entrepreneurs, visionaries, thought leaders, authors, speakers and others have a distinct advantage over technology in this field, and that isn't going to change any time soon.

In short, if you're concerned that your job might be one day outsourced to technology, the best thing you can do right now is work on your soft skills. Work on communication, strategic thinking, problem-solving, empathy, and creativity. It might eventually save your career from being taken over by robots, and even earn you a pay rise in the near future as well.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to a new survey, a quarter of the workforce think their job won’t be needed in future. Many of us expect the technological revolution to be as disruptive as the industrial revolution. This could bring amazing opportunities and emancipation, but also new forms of exploitation, deeper inequalities, injustices and anger.More than 6m workers fear being replaced by machines – reportRead moreTrades unions and communities can’t just stand by and hope for the best. If we want technological change to benefit everyone rather than widening inequality then we need to start preparing now. It took decades for new legislation, the growth of trade unions and the emergence of the welfare state to tackle some of the injustices of the industrial revolution and start harnessing the benefits for everyone. We cannot afford to wait that long this time. The labour movement needs to lead the way.That is why I am working with Community, the trade union, and the Fabian Society to launch a new commission on workers and technology. The commission will take a “worker’s eye view”, starting in those workplaces across the country that are facing the fastest technological and industrial change. It will be looking for the practical and immediate things that government, employers and unions should be doing to make sure people are empowered by advances in technology and not just exploited, abandoned or let down.Automating routine calculations and data assembly could free up workers to use their emotional intelligence insteadThe commission’s initial survey of workers has found that only 44% think their current job will be improved by technology, while 20% think it will get worse. And if the 23% who believe their roles may not be needed at all are right, that means huge disruption – potentially 6 million people needing to move into new kinds of work. Back in 2015, the Bank of England estimated that even more jobs – up to 15 million – were at risk from robots and automation.Importantly, most people are optimistic about their own ability to adapt. Some 73% of workers say they are confident they can update their skills if automation affects their job. However the support is not in place to help them do that. Just one in 10 workers think the government is taking steps to prepare them for new technologies; just one in four think their employer is taking action; and only one in six employees with a trade union in their workplace say it is helping to prepare them.Whether changes to the world of work come from automation or algorithms, everyone should be able to take advantage of the positive opportunities they bring. For example, technology could support people who want to work more flexibly or help people move on from routine, repetitive tasks into more rewarding work.Automating routine calculations and data assembly tasks could free up workers to use their strategic and emotional intelligence instead. In one pilot scheme in Bremen, Germany, the postal service has teamed up with local government, healthcare and welfare associations to allow mail carriers to call in on elderly citizens as part of their daily rounds, opening up new roles while reducing the burden on care providers.But such schemes rely on workers having the support to move from their old jobs to good-quality new ones – something that too often does not happen. Manual or low-skilled workers find themselves downgraded into increasingly insecure and worse-paid jobs instead.Harnessing technological change for the good also requires vigilance and action to prevent new technology being used to control rather than emancipate the workforce. Amazon has patented designs for electronic wristbands to monitor how quickly staff work – and there have been serious concerns raised about the welfare of workers at its warehouses. Far from relieving them of menial tasks, new technology can be used to force humans to work as if they were machines.We are at a crossroads. Technological change opens up the possibility of a positive transformation of the labour market, but there are significant risks that work itself could change for the worse. Politicians, trade unions and business leaders must act now to ensure technological change leads to plentiful, good-quality jobs for all. And, as the TUC has suggested, they must learn from the partnership approach taken in Germany, where workers, business and civil society have had the chance to shape the direction of policy in response to a government white paper on reimagining work.My commission will be looking for practical action in key areas: how government can ensure new jobs are good jobs; how to enable workers to reskill; and how business and unions can work together to help workers navigate change. We’ll be holding evidence sessions, visiting workplaces and hosting public debates.At this moment of huge turbulence in our politics, it is critical that political leaders provide a practical path through the coming economic disruption. Inaction risks greater division and polarisation. That’s why we have to rise to the challenge, and harness the power of technology to deliver a better working life for all.

Football teams secretly using AI to predict injuries before they occur

Football may be unpredictable, but its injuries aren’t. Artificial intelligence can work out when players are likely to get hurt so that coaches can let them rest.
A machine learning algorithm developed by data scientists at the University of Pisa, Italy, and FC Barcelona recently predicted 9 out of 14 injuries sustained by an elite Italian football team during a single season.
The researchers fitted the team’s 26 players with GPS sensors during their training sessions to measure how far and fast they…

Tiptoes Into the WorkplaceShare full articleRead in appHolly Uhl, a manager at State Auto Insurance Companies in Columbus, Ohio, oversees an automation project for back-office tasks that saves an estimated 25,000 hours of human work a year.Credit...Maddie McGarvey for The New York TimesBy Steve LohrAug. 5, 2018There is no shortage of predictions about how artificial intelligence is going to reshape where, how and if people work in the future.But the grand work-changing projects of A.I., like self-driving cars and humanoid robots, are not yet commercial products. A more humble version of the technology, instead, is making its presence felt in a less glamorous place: the back office.New software is automating mundane office tasks in operations like accounting, billing, payments and customer service. The programs can scan documents, enter numbers into spreadsheets, check the accuracy of customer records and make payments with a few automated computer keystrokes.The technology is still in its infancy, but it will get better, learning as it goes. So far, often in pilot projects focused on menial tasks, artificial intelligence is freeing workers from drudgery far more often than it is eliminating jobs.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe bots are mainly observing, following simple rules and making yes-or-no decisions, not making higher-level choices that require judgment and experience. “This is the least intelligent form of A.I.,” said Thomas Davenport, a professor of information technology and management at Babson College.But all the signs point to much more to come. Big tech companies like IBM, Oracle and Microsoft are starting to enter the business, often in partnership with robotic automation start-ups. Two of the leading start-ups, UiPath and Automation Anywhere, are already valued at more than $1 billion. The market for the robotlike software will nearly triple by 2021, by one forecast.“This is the beginning of a wave of A.I. technologies that will proliferate across the economy in the next decade,” said Rich Wong, a general partner at Accel, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and an investor in UiPath.The emerging field has a klutzy name, “robotic process automation.” The programs — often called bots — fit into the broad definition of artificial intelligence because they use ingredients of A.I. technology, like computer vision, to do simple chores.For many businesses, that is plenty. Nearly 60 percent of the companies with more than $1 billion in revenue have at least pilot programs underway using robotic automation, according to research from McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe companies and government agencies that have begun enlisting the automation software run the gamut. They include General Motors, BMW, General Electric, Unilever, Mastercard, Manpower, FedEx, Cisco, Google, the Defense Department and NASA.State Auto Insurance Companies in Columbus, Ohio, started its first automation pilot project two years ago. Today, it has 30 software programs handling back-office tasks, with an estimated savings of 25,000 hours of human work — or the equivalent of about a dozen full-time workers — on an annualized basis, assuming a standard 2,000-hour work year.Holly Uhl, a technology manager who leads the automation program, estimated that within two years the company’s bot population would double to 60 and its hours saved would perhaps triple to 75,000, nearly all in year-after-year savings rather than one-time projects.Cutting jobs, Ms. Uhl said, is not the plan. The goal for the company, whose insurance offerings include auto, commercial and workers’ compensation, is to increase productivity and State Auto’s revenue with limited additions to its head count, she said.Ms. Uhl said her message to workers is: “We’re here to partner with you to find those tasks that drive you crazy.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRebekah Moore, a premium auditor at the company, had one in mind. Premium auditors scrutinize insurance policies and make recommendations for changing rates. They audit less than half of the policies, Ms. Moore said.The policies that will not be audited then have to be set aside and documented. That step, she explained, is a routine data-entry task that involves fiddling with two computer programs, plugging in codes and navigating drop-down menus. It takes a minute or two. But because auditors handle many thousands of policies, the time adds up, to about an hour a day, she estimated.Starting in May, a bot took over that chore. “No one misses that work,” Ms. Moore said.Is she worried about the bots climbing up the task ladder to someday replace her? Not at all, she said. “We’ll find things to do with our time, higher-value work,” said Ms. Moore, 37.On State Auto’s current path, her confidence seems justified. If the company hits its target of 75,000 hours in savings by 2020, that would be the equivalent of fewer than 40 full-time workers, compared with State Auto’s work force of 1,900. The company plans to grow in the next two years. If so, State Auto would most likely be hiring a few dozen people fewer than it would otherwise.Automation companies are eager to promote the bots as helpful assistants instead of job killers. The technology, they say, will get smarter and more useful, liberating workers rather than replacing them.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The long-term vision is to have one bot for every employee,” said Bobby Patrick, chief market officer for UiPath. The company, which is based in New York, recently reported that its revenue more than tripled in the first half of 2018, to a yearly rate of more than $100 million.Mihir Shukla, chief executive of Automation Anywhere, refers to his company’s bots as “digital colleagues.” In July, the company announced it had raised a $250 million round of venture funding, valuing the company at $1.8 billion.The market for A.I.-enhanced software automation is poised for rapid growth, but that expansion, analysts say, will ultimately bring job losses.Forrester Research estimated that revenue would nearly triple to $2.9 billion over the next three years. And by 2021, robotic automation technology will be doing the equivalent work of nearly 4.3 million humans worldwide, Forrester predicted.In a dynamic global labor market, that is not a clear-cut forecast of 4.3 million layoffs. The bots may do work not previously done by humans, and people may move onto new jobs.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“But these initial bots will get better, and the task harvesting will accelerate,” said Craig Le Clair, an analyst for Forrester. “For workers, there will be a mix of automation dividends and pain.”The recent research has examined jobs as bundles of tasks, some of which seem ripe for replacement and others not. So the technology’s immediate impact will resemble the experience to date with robotic software, changing work more than destroying jobs.For Ms. Uhl of State Auto, the most persistent pushback has come not at the company but at home, from her two young sons, Christian, 9, and Elijah, 7, who are eager to glimpse the future.Hearing their mother talk about robots at work, they keep asking her to bring one home. “It’s not the kind of robot you can see,” Ms. Uhl said she has told her disappointed sons.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohr.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) skills are in demand and worth $500k/year


By Neil Aitken -   August 1, 2018 - 1:55 am 17891 0 










9 min readInternet job portal ‘Indeed.com’ links potential employers with people who are looking to take the next step in their careers. The proportion of job posts on their site, relating to ‘Data Science’, a specific job in the AI category, is growing fast (see chart below). More broadly, Artificial Intelligence & machine learning skills, of which ‘Data Scientist’ is just one example, are in demand.
No wonder that it has been termed as the sexiest job role of the 21st century. Interest comes from an explosion of jobs in the field from big companies and Start-Ups, all of which are competing to come up with the best AI business and to earn the money that comes with software that automates tasks.
The skills shortage associated with Artificial Intelligence represents an opportunity for any developer. There has never been a better time to consider whether reskilling or upskilling in AI could be a lucrative path for you.

The AI skills gap the market is experiencing comes from the difficulty associated with finding an individual demonstrating a competent mixture of the very disparate faculties that AI roles require. Artificial Intelligence and it’s near equivalents such as Machine Learning and Neural Networks operate at the intersection of what have mostly been two very different disciplines – statistics and software development. In simple terms, they are half coding, half maths.

Hamish Ogilvy, CEO of AI based Internal Search company Sajari is all too familiar with the problem. He’s on the front line, hiring AI developers. “The hardest part”, says Ogilvy,
“is that AI is pretty complex and the average developer/engineer does not have the background in maths/stats/science to actually understand what is happening. On the flip side the trouble with the stats/maths/science people is that they typically can’t code, so finding people in that sweet spot that have both is pretty tough.”
He’s right. The New York Times suggests that the pool of qualified talent is only 10,000 people, worldwide. Those who do have jobs are typically happily ensconced, paid well, treated appropriately and given no reason whatsoever to want to leave.
Judged by $ investments in the area alone, AI skills are worth developing for those wishing to stay current on technology skills.
In fact, an instinct to develop AI skills will serve any technology employee well. No One can have escaped the many estimates, from reputable consultancies, suggesting that Automation will replace up to 30% of jobs in the next 10 years. No job is safe. Every industry is touched by AI in some form. Any responsible individual with a view to the management of their own skills could learn ML and AI skills to stay relevant in current times. Even if you don’t want to move out of your current job, learning ML will probably help you adapt better in your industry.
What is a typical AI job and what will it pay?
OpenAI, a world class Artificial Intelligence research laboratory, revealed the salaries of some of its key Data Science employees recently. Those working in the AI field with a specialization can earn $300 to $500k in their first year out of university. Experts in Artificial Intelligence now command salaries of up to $1m.

Indraneil Roy, an Expert in AI and Talent Acquisition who works for Edge Networks puts it this way when outlining the difficulties of hiring the right skills and to explain why wages in the field are so high.
“The challenge is the quality of resources. As demand is high for this skill, we are already seeing candidates with fake experience and work pedigree not up to standards.”
The phenomenon is also causing a ‘brain drain’ in Universities. About a third of jobs in the AI field will go to someone with a Ph.D., and all of those are drawn from universities working on the discipline, often lured by the significant pay packages which are available. So, with huge demand and the universities drained, where will future AI employees come from?
3 ways to skill up to become an AI expert (And earn all that money?)
There is still not a lot of agreed terminology or even job roles and responsibility in the sector. However, some things are clear. Those wishing to evolve in to the field of AI must understand the conceptual thinking involved, as a starting point, whether that view is found on the job or as part of an informal / formal educational course.
Specifically, most jobs in the specialty require a working knowledge of neural networks, data / analytics, predictive analytics, with some basic programming and database skills. There are some great resources available online to train you up. Most, as you’d expect, are available on your smartphone so there really is no excuse for not having a look.
1. Free online course: Machine Learning & Statistics and probability 
Hamish Ogilvy summed the online education which is available in the area well.
There are “so many free courses now on AI from Stanford,” he said, “that people are able to educate themselves and make up for the failings of antiquated university courses. AI is just maths really,” he says “complex models and stats. So that’s what people need grounding in to be successful.”
Microsoft offer free AI courses for technical professionals: 
Microsoft’s training materials are second to none. They’re also provided free and provide a shortcut to a credible understanding in an area simply because it comes from a technical behemoth.
Importantly, they also have a list of AI services which you can play with, again for free. For example, a Natural Language engine offers a facility for you to submit text from Instant Messaging conversations and establish the sentiment being felt by the writer. Practical experience of the tools, processes and concepts involved will set you apart. See below.
Check out Microsoft’s free AI training program for developers.
Google are taking a proactive stance on Machine Learning. They see it’s potential to improve efficiency in every industry and also offer free ML training courses on their site.
2. Take courses on AI/ML
Packt’s machine learning courses, books and videos:
Packt is working towards a mission to help the world put software to work in new ways, through the delivery of effective learning and information services to IT professionals. It has published over 6,000 books and videos so far, providing IT professionals with the actionable knowledge they need to get the job done – whether that’s specific learning on an emerging technology or optimizing key skills in more established tools.
You can choose from a variety of Packt’s books, videos and courses for AI/ML. Here’s a list of top ones:

Artificial Intelligence by Example [Book]
Artificial Intelligence for Big data [Book]
Learn Artificial Intelligence with TensorFlow [Video]
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Java [Video]
Advanced Artificial Intelligence Projects with Python [Video]
Python Machine learning – Second Edition [Book]
Machine Learning with R – Second Edition [Book]

Coursera’s machine learning courses

Coursera is a company which make training courses, for a variety of subjects, available online. Taken from actual University course content and delivered with tests, videos and training notes, all accessed online, each course is roughly a University Module. Students pick up an ‘up to under-graduate’ level of understanding of the content involved.
Coursera’s courses are often cited as merit worthy and are recognizable in the industry. Costs vary but are typically between $2k and $5k per course.
3. Learn by doing
Familiarize yourself with relevant frameworks and tools including Tensor Flow, Python and Keras.
TensorFlow from Google is the most used open source AI software library. You can use existing code in your experiments and experiment with neural networks in much the same way as you can in Microsoft’s.
Python is a programming language written for a big data world. Its proponents will tell you that Python saves developers hundreds of lines of code, allowing you to tie together information and systems faster than ever before. Python is used extensively in ML and AI applications and should be at the top of your study list.
Keras, a deep learning library is similarly ubiquitous. It’s a high level Neural Network API designed to allow prototyping of your software as fast as possible.

Finally, a lesser known but still valuable resources is the Accord.net. It is one final example of the many  software elements with which you can engage with to train yourself up. Accord Framework.net will expose you to image libraries, natural learning and real time facial recognition.
Earn extra points with employers
AI has several lighthouse tasks which are proving the potential of the technology in these still early stages. We’ve included a couple of examples, Natural Language processing and image recognition, above. Practical expertise in these areas specifically, image or voice recognition or pattern matching are valued highly by employers.
Alternatively, have you patented something? A registered patent in your name is highly prized. Especially something to do with Machine Learning. Both will help you showcase Extra skills / achievements that will help your application.’ The specifics of how to apply for patents differ by country but you can find out more about the overall principles of how to submit an idea here.
Passion and engagement in the subject are also, clearly appealing characteristics for potential employers to see in applicants. Participating in competitions like Kaggle, and having a portfolio of projects you can showcase on facilities like GitHub are also well prized.
Of all of these suggestions, for those employed, any on the job experience you can get will stand you in the best stead. Indraneil says
“Individual candidates need to spend more time doing relevant projects while in employment. Start ups involved in building products and platforms on AI seem to have better talent.”
The fact that there are not many AI specialists around is a bad sign
There is a demand for employees with AI skills and an investment in relevant training may pay you well.
Unfortunately, the underlying problem this situation reveals could be far worse than the problems experienced so far. Together, once found, all these AI scientists are going to automate millions of jobs, in every industry, in every country around the world.
If Industry, Governments and Universities cannot train enough people to fill the roles being created by an evolving skills market, we may rightly be concerned to worry about how they will deal with retraining all those displaced by AI, for whom there may be no obvious replacement role available.

Facebook's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, says that letting AI experts split their time between academia and industry is helping drive innovation.Writing for Business Insider, the executive and NYU professor argues that the dual-affiliation model Facebook uses boosts individual researchers and the industry at large.A similar model has historically been practiced in other industries, from law to medicine.

To make real progress in Artificial Intelligence we need the best, brightest and most diverse minds to exchange ideas and build on each other's work. Research in isolation, or in secret, falls behind the leading edge. According to Nature Index Science Inc. 2017, publications resulting from collaborations not just among academics, which comes most naturally, but between academia and industry more than doubled from 12,672 in 2012 to 25,962 in 2016. The burgeoning dual-affiliation model — where academics actually work inside industry for a time, while maintaining their academic position — makes possible not only technological advances like better speech recognition, image recognition, text understanding, and language translation systems, but also fundamental scientific advances in our understanding of intelligence.Dual affiliation is a boon. It benefits not just the AI economy but individual academics — both researchers and students — as well as industry. We need to champion it.The Economics of Industry-Academia CollaborationWorldwide spending on AI systems is predicted to reach $19.1 billion in 2018, says International Data Corporation. The number of active AI startups is fifteen times larger than in 2000, per Stanford University. And according to Adobe, the share of jobs requiring AI is 5.5 times higher than in 2013. Things are going pretty well and I'm arguing it's largely thanks to industry-academia collaborations.

For decades, many professors of business, finance, law, and medicine have practiced their profession in the private sector while teaching and doing research at university. A growing number of leading AI researchers, from colleagues here at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) to several of my friends at other technology companies, are embracing a version of dual affiliation. Other academics, such as my old friend Yoshua Bengio at the University of Montréal, have not joined corporate research labs but have played important roles in many companies and startups as advisers or co-founders.

The dual affiliation model allows researchers to maximize their impact. Different research environments lead to different types of ideas. Certain ideas only flourish in academic environments, while others can only be developed in industry where larger engineering teams and larger computing resources are available.

In the past, true collaborations between industry and academia were complicated by overly possessive policies regarding intellectual property — on both sides. But in today's world of fast-paced internet services deployment, owning IP has become considerably less important than turning research results into innovative products as quickly as possible, and deploying them at scale. AI researchers establish priority by publishing their results quickly on open-access repositories such as ArXiv.org. Many papers are accompanied by open-source releases of the corresponding code. This practice has increased the rate of progress of AI-related science and technology and thawed a once icy relationship. Sharing helps everyone now.Academia and AISo investment in basic research in industry, and the practice of open research, open-source software, together with a more relaxed attitude towards IP, have made industry-academia collaborations considerably easier and more fruitful than in the past. But we must keep pushing. What drives new technologies like AI is the speed of adoption by the general population, and what often controls that speed is the number and diversity of talented people who can apply themselves to the problem. There are only so many, highly-coveted spots at universities. Meanwhile there's an ever-growing need for top-talent in the industry — we've made a great start with great leaders in key positions, but we need to support — and drive — exponential growth. We need a deeper bench.

Industry partnerships with academic institutions can help. They increase the net number of students who can be expertly trained in AI — giving them the benefit of access to significant computing power and training data with the expectation only that they contribute to the field in the future. The FAIR lab in Paris currently hosts 15 PhD students in residence, co-advised by a FAIR researcher and a professor. Ground-breaking research has come out of this program, and I believe our resident PhD students get a superior research environment and mentoring than in most purely academic environments. The program is so successful that we plan to expand it to 40 students over the next few years. Some students may choose to join FAIR after graduation, but many will choose to join other labs, found a startup, or become professors. This is one way we contribute to the R&D ecosystem.

The goal for this ecosystem is to improve everyone's opportunity — not only students, but seasoned academics too. Just because renowned researchers welcome new opportunities to participate in research outside of academia, they shouldn't have to jeopardize their own careers — which often happened in the past. Many academics were forced to choose one or the other. I spent the first 15 years of my professional career in industry research at AT&T Bell Labs, AT&T Labs-Research, and the NEC Research Institute, before becoming a professor at NYU in 2003. When I joined Facebook in 2013, I was fortunate enough to be able to keep my professor position and share my time between FAIR and NYU. My dual affiliation allows me, among other things, to keep educating the next generation of scientists. The same holds for a number of academics working at FAIR today — some 20% of the time, some 50%, and some 80% like me. It's also true for the five key research hires we just announced, who will help build our new Pittsburgh lab and FAIR teams in London, Seattle, Paris, and Menlo Park. The dual affiliation model hedges our personal risk while making our research, and knowledge, more powerful.Dual Affiliation, Exponential ProgressFor us academics, industry affiliation offers any number of benefits: resources in the form of compute power and funding, more collaboration with others, and the opportunity for immediate real-world application of research, at a scale that proves out hypotheses much faster than in a lab. People think such benefits must come with an asterisk — that they'll be expected to be sucked into the shipping product machine. In the right industry environments, this simply isn't the case.

In fact, fundamental research really benefits when it is untethered from the resource hunt. The dual affiliation model lets academics control their own agenda and timeline. Freed from time crunch, they identify research trends in both academia and in industry, and can act upon whichever's most promising. They are not pressured by product groups to bring their research to application, to achieve ""real world impact"" the way many companies with AI-powered products pressure their AI engineers. At FAIR, for instance, we want researchers to focus on long-term challenges. And in the process of working towards fundamental scientific advances, we often invent new techniques, develop new tools, or discover new phenomena that turn out to be useful. More often than not, ambitious long-term projects end up having product impact much quicker than we thought. Although FAIR is set up as a basic research lab focused on long-term horizons, our work has had a large impact on products for such applications as language translation, image, video and text understanding, search and indexing, content recommendation, and many other areas.

Some of us in AI are working to solve real-world problems that impact billions of people by applying image, text, speech, audio and video understanding, reasoning, and action planning. At FAIR, we openly share our advances as much as we can, as fast as we can in the form of technical papers, open source code and teaching material. We produce new knowledge and tools to educate people on the latest developments and make science progress faster. Others in industry, academia and government can innovate on top of our work, creating new products, building new startups, and making new scientific discoveries. Our goals are shared, and these advances are for everyone's benefit. The AI software tools we are producing are used by hundreds of groups for research in high-energy physics, astrophysics, biology, medical imaging, environmental protection and many other domains.

I started my professional career at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the late 1980s, and saw a culture of ambitious, open research that produced many of the innovations that power the modern world. These innovations, including the transistor, the solar cell, the laser, digital communication technology, the Unix system, and the C/C++ language, had a big impact on AT&T. But these and many more discoveries and innovations, a dozen of which won Nobel Prizes and Turing Awards, have had an even bigger impact on the world at large. That's what we are after, with AI. Understanding intelligence in machines, animals and humans, is one of the great scientific challenges of our times and building intelligent machines is one of the greatest technological challenges of our times. No single entity in industry, academia or public research has a monopoly on the good ideas that will achieve these goals. It's going to take the combined effort of the entire research community to make progress in the science and technology of intelligence.Yann LeCun is Vice President and Chief AI Scientist at Facebook and Silver Professor at NYU affiliated with the Courant Institute and the Center for Data Science. He was the founding Director of Facebook AI Research and of the NYU Center for Data Science. He received a PhD in Computer Science from Université P&M Curie (Paris). After a postdoc at the University of Toronto, he joined AT&T Bell Labs, and became head of Image Processing Research at AT&T Labs in 1996. He joined NYU in 2003 and Facebook in 2013.See also:A third of Facebook's ad revenue growth now comes from Instagram — and it couldn't come at a better timeFacebook tested plane-mounted lasers that fire super-high-speed internet over California.

UCLA engineers develop artificial intelligence device that identifies objects at the speed of light

Created with a 3D printer, the artificial neural network could have applications in medicine, robotics and security
A team of UCLA electrical and computer engineers has created a physical artificial neural network — a device modeled on how the human brain works — that can analyze large volumes of data and identify objects at the actual speed of light. The device was created using a 3D printer at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering.
Numerous devices in everyday life today use computerized cameras to identify objects — think of automated teller machines that can “read” handwritten dollar amounts when you deposit a check, or internet search engines that can quickly match photos to other similar images in their databases. But those systems rely on a piece of equipment to image the object, first by “seeing” it with a camera or optical sensor, then processing what it sees into data, and finally using computing programs to figure out what it is.
The UCLA-developed device gets a head start. Called a “diffractive deep neural network,” it uses the light bouncing from the object itself to identify that object in as little time as it would take for a computer to simply “see” the object. The UCLA device does not need advanced computing programs to process an image of the object and decide what the object is after its optical sensors pick it up. And no energy is consumed to run the device because it only uses diffraction of light.
The network, composed of a series of polymer layers, works using light that travels through it. Each layer is 8 centimeters square.
 
New technologies based on the device could be used to speed up data-intensive tasks that involve sorting and identifying objects. For example, a driverless car using the technology could react instantaneously — even faster than it does using current technology — to a stop sign. With a device based on the UCLA system, the car would “read” the sign as soon as the light from the sign hits it, as opposed to having to “wait” for the car’s camera to image the object and then use its computers to figure out what the object is.
Technology based on the invention could also be used in microscopic imaging and medicine, for example, to sort through millions of cells for signs of disease.
The study was published online in Science on July 26.
“This work opens up fundamentally new opportunities to use an artificial intelligence-based passive device to instantaneously analyze data, images and classify objects,” said Aydogan Ozcan, the study’s principal investigator and the UCLA Chancellor’s Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “This optical artificial neural network device is intuitively modeled on how the brain processes information. It could be scaled up to enable new camera designs and unique optical components that work passively in medical technologies, robotics, security or any application where image and video data are essential.”

The process of creating the artificial neural network began with a computer-simulated design. Then, the researchers used a 3D printer to create very thin, 8 centimeter-square polymer wafers. Each wafer has uneven surfaces, which help diffract light coming from the object in different directions. The layers look opaque to the eye but submillimeter-wavelength terahertz frequencies of light used in the experiments can travel through them. And each layer is composed of tens of thousands of artificial neurons — in this case, tiny pixels that the light travels through.
Together, a series of pixelated layers functions as an “optical network” that shapes how incoming light from the object travels through them. The network identifies an object because the light coming from the object is mostly diffracted toward a single pixel that is assigned to that type of object.
The researchers then trained the network using a computer to identify the objects in front of it by learning the pattern of diffracted light each object produces as the light from that object passes through the device. The “training” used a branch of artificial intelligence called deep learning, in which machines “learn” through repetition and over time as patterns emerge.
“This is intuitively like a very complex maze of glass and mirrors,” Ozcan said. “The light enters a diffractive network and bounces around the maze until it exits. The system determines what the object is by where most of the light ends up exiting.”
In their experiments, the researchers demonstrated that the device could accurately identify handwritten numbers and items of clothing — both of which are commonly used tests in artificial intelligence studies. To do that, they placed images in front of a terahertz light source and let the device “see” those images through optical diffraction.
They also trained the device to act as a lens that projects the image of an object placed in front of the optical network to the other side of it — much like how a typical camera lens works, but using artificial intelligence instead of physics.
Because its components can be created by a 3D printer, the artificial neural network can be made with larger and additional layers, resulting in a device with hundreds of millions of artificial neurons. Those bigger devices could identify many more objects at the same time or perform more complex data analysis. And the components can be made inexpensively — the device created by the UCLA team could be reproduced for less than $50.
While the study used light in the terahertz frequencies, Ozcan said it would also be possible to create neural networks that use visible, infrared or other frequencies of light. A network could also be made using lithography or other printing techniques, he said.
The study’s others authors, all from UCLA Samueli, are postdoctoral scholars Xing Lin, Yair Rivenson, and Nezih Yardimci; graduate students Muhammed Veli and Yi Luo; and Mona Jarrahi, UCLA professor of electrical and computer engineering.
The research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Ozcan also has UCLA faculty appointments in bioengineering and in surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. He is the associate director of the UCLA California NanoSystems Institute and an HHMI professor.

How artificial intelligence can help us eat better

You are what your friends eat, according to USC researchers whose study aims to prevent obesity and diabetes in kids; AI may be able to find friends who are good influences


August 06, 2018
Connie Choy






Do you have that friend you go out with to indulge on all the scrumptious (and unhealthy) delicacies L.A. has to offer? Or how about that other friend who eats organic and always makes you feel like an unhealthy chicken nugget? Chances are you have both — and you’re also probably one of them.
Peers can wield a lot of influence when it comes to our lifestyle choices: According to the American Psychological Association, people who enrolled in weight loss programs with friends did a better job at keeping their weight off than those who did it alone. Bryan Wilder, a PhD candidate in computer science at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, and Kayla de la Haye, assistant professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, believe there’s an opportunity to optimize our peer influences to live a healthier life using artificial intelligence.
Bridging de la Haye’s knowledge of public health with Wilder’s skills in computer science gave life to USC’s Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society’s RECONNECT model, a comprehensive algorithm that provides health practitioners the tool to form real-life peer support groups based on demographic, social and health-related data volunteered by patients.
Wilder and de la Haye will test their algorithm in California’s Antelope Valley where 15 percent of its 400,000 residents live below the poverty line. According to the L.A. County Department of Public Health, only 10 percent of children living in this region are considered by their parents to be healthy, and obesity rates are among the county’s highest.
The study’s goal is to work with low-income moms and their infants to promote healthy eating and activity to prevent diseases like obesity and diabetes in children.
A pilot research conducted by de la Haye found surprising data to support social intervention. For instance, particularly with the at-risk community in Antelope Valley, moms with young children have very few same-age peers, and those who have no peers and limited social support exhibit poor health-related behavior such as unhealthy diet and lack of exercise.

Healthy eating and key connections
“We know that the algorithm is thinking about the big picture of the entire social network,” said Wilder, who is advised by Milind Tambe, holder of the Helen N. and Emmett H. Jones Professorship in Engineering. “Not just an individual person. It’s considering these chains of influences when it takes someone who needs a healthy buddy and matches him or her up. The algorithm is a lot more effective because it manages the global picture.”
RECONNECT creates networks on a big-picture scale. Rather than recommend the right weight loss program like traditional methods, RECONNECT recommends the right people to surround yourself with for permanent behavior change. Embedded in a social circle that promotes health and well-being, you’re better equipped to make healthier choices.
The National Institute of Health is funding the next phase of its research in Antelope Valley. The NIH funding was granted to de la Haye and her co-principal investigator, Sarah-Jeanne Salvy of the University of Alabama, Birmingham. This phase will involve a group of 300 families that will be enrolled in an 18-month home-visiting program monitored by a certified health professional.
Half of the families will receive the standard home-visiting services, while the other half will get an enhanced home-visiting service with a new healthy lifestyle intervention and a family and peer support component facilitated by the RECONNECT model.
The researchers hope to see if families engaging in healthy lifestyles and RECONNECT are overall better off and have less risk for diseases like obesity and diabetes compared to families who receive only the standard in-home services.

On trial before her were two men accused of forging paintings by artists including Kazimir Malevich and Wassily Kandinsky, whose angular, abstract compositions can now go for eight-figure prices. The case had been in progress for three and a half years and was seen by many as a test. A successful prosecution could help end an epidemic of forgeries – so-called miracle pictures that appear from nowhere – that have been plaguing the market in avant-garde Russian art.But as the trial reached its climax, it disintegrated into farce. One witness, arguably the world’s leading Malevich authority, argued that the paintings were unquestionably fakes. Another witness, whose credentials were equally impeccable, swore that they were authentic. In the end, the forgery indictments had to be dropped; the accused were convicted only on minor charges.Russian avant-garde forgery case ends in convictions and disappointmentsRead moreThe judge was unimpressed. “Ask 10 different art historians the same question and you get 10 different answers,” she told the New York Times. Adding a touch of bleak comedy to proceedings, it emerged that the warring experts were at the wrong end of a bad divorce.It isn’t a comforting time for art historians. Weeks earlier, in January, the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, Belgium, was forced to pull 24 works supposedly by many of the same Russian artists – Kandinsky, Malevich, Rodcheko, Filonov – after the Art Newspaper published an exposé arguing they were all forged. Just days before, there was uproar when 21 paintings shown at a Modigliani exhibition in Genoa, Italy, were confiscated and labeled as fakes. Works that had been valued at millions of dollars were abruptly deemed worthless.The market in old masters is also jittery after an alarming series of scandals – the greatest of which was last year’s revelation that paintings handled by the respected collector Giuliano Ruffini were suspect. A Cranach, a Parmigiano, and a Frans Hals were all found to be forged; institutions including the Louvre had been fooled. The auction house Sotheby’s was forced to refund $10m for the Hals alone. Many experts are now reluctant to offer an opinion, in case they’re sued – which, of course, only intensifies the problem.Adding fuel to the fire is another development: Wary of being caught, more and more forgers are copying works from the early to mid-20th century. It’s much easier to acquire authentic materials, for one thing, and modern paintings have rocketed in value in recent years.For many in the industry, it is starting to look like a crisis. Little wonder that galleries and auction houses, desperate to protect themselves, have gone CSI. X-ray fluorescence can detect paint and pigment type; infrared reflectography and Raman spectroscopy can peer into a work’s inner layers and detect whether its very component molecules are authentic. Testing the chemistry of a flake of paint less than a millimeter wide can disclose deep secrets about where and, crucially, when it was made.“It’s an arms race,” says Jennifer Mass, an authentication expert who runs the Delaware-based firm Scientific Analysis of Fine and Decorative Art. “Them against us.”What if the forger’s handwriting was staring you in the face, if only you could see it?But what if you didn’t need to go to all that trouble? What if the forger’s handwriting was staring you in the face, if only you could see it? That’s the hope of researchers at Rutgers University in New Jersey, who have pioneered a method that promises to turn art authentication on its head.Instead of subjecting works to lengthy and hugely expensive materials analysis, hoping a forger has made a tiny slip – a stray fiber, varnish made using ingredients that wouldn’t have been available in 16th-century Venice – the new technique is so powerful that it doesn’t even need access to the original work: A digital photograph will do. Even more striking, this method is aided by artificial intelligence. A technology whose previous contributions to art history have consisted of some bizarre sub–Salvador Dalís might soon be able to make the tweed-wearing art valuers look like amateurs.At least that’s the theory, says Ahmed Elgammal, PhD, whose team at Rutgers has developed the new process, which was made public late last year. “It is still very much under development; we are working all the time. But we think it will be a hugely valuable addition to the arsenal.”That theory is certainly intriguing. Instead of obsessing over materials, the new technique takes a hard look at the picture itself: Specifically, the thousands of tiny individual strokes that compose it.Every single gesture – shape, curvature, the velocity with which a brush- or pencil-stroke is applied – reveals something about the artist who made it. Together, they form a telltale fingerprint. Analyze enough works and build up a database, and the idea is that you can find every artist’s fingerprint. Add in a work you’re unsure about, and you’ll be able to tell in minutes whether it’s really a Matisse or if it was completed in a garage in Los Angeles last week. You wouldn’t even need the whole work; an image of one brushstroke could give the game away.“Strokes capture unintentional process,” explains Elgammal. “The artist is focused on composition, physical movement, brushes – all those things. But the stroke is the telltale sign.”View image in fullscreenThe original painting by Matisse titled Odalisque in Red Pants, left, next to a fake version that was on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas, Venezuela. The original work was swapped with a forgery in 2002. Photograph: Uncredited/ASSOCIATED PRESSThe paper Elgammal and his colleagues published last November examined 300 authentic drawings by Picasso, Matisse, Egon Schiele, and a number of other artists and broke them down into more than 80,000 strokes. Machine-learning techniques refined the data set for each artist; forgers were then commissioned to produce a batch of fakes. To put the algorithm though its paces, the forgeries were fed into the system. When analyzing individual strokes, it was over 70% accurate; when whole drawings were examined, the success rate increased to over 80% . (The researchers claim 100% accuracy “in most settings.”)The researchers are so confident that they included images of originals and fakes alongside each other in the published paper, daring so-called experts to make up their own minds. (Reader, I scored dismally.) One of Elgammal’s colleagues, Dutch painting conservator Milko den Leeuw, compares it to the way we recognize family members: They look similar, but we’re just not sure why. “Take identical twins,” he says. “Outsiders can’t separate them, but the parents can. How does that work? It’s the same with a work of art. Why do I recognize that this is a Picasso and that isn’t?”The idea of fingerprinting artists via their strokes actually dates back to the 1950s and a technique developed by Dutch art historian Maurits Michel van Dantzig. Van Dantzig called his approach “pictology”, arguing that because every work of art is a product of the human hand, and every hand is different, it should be possible to identify authorship using these telltale strokes.The problem, though, was that there was too much data. Even a simple drawing contains hundreds or even thousands of strokes, all of which needed to be examined by the human eye and catalogued. Multiply that by every work, and you see how impractical it was.“It just wasn’t possible to test it,” says den Leeuw, who first became aware of pictology as a student. “I saw many attempts, but mostly it ended in ideas that would never be.”But can AI now do what humans failed to, and give an art historian’s trained eye some sort of scientific basis? “Exactly,” says den Leeuw. “Very often it’s a gut feeling. We’re trying to unpick the mystery.”Though Mass says she’s unlikely to throw out her fluorescence gun just yet, she admits to being impressed. “A lot of people in the field are excited by AI It’s not a magic bullet, but it’ll be another tool. And it’s really valuable when you’re dealing with a sophisticated forger who’s got everything else right – paint, paper, filler, all the materials.”Can A​I​ now do what humans failed to, and give an art historian’s trained eye some sort of scientific basis?There are issues. So far, the system has been tested mainly on drawings from a handful of artists and a brief time period. Paintings, which generally contain thousands more strokes, are a tougher challenge; older paintings, which might contain numerous layers of restoration or overpainting, are tougher still. “It’s challenging, but it doesn’t mean we can’t do it,” Elgammal says. “I’m confident.”What about style, though, particularly where an artist changes over time? Think of Picasso’s wildly varying periods – blue, African, cubist, classical – or how in the 1920s Malevich abandoned the elemental abstraction of his black squares for figurative portraits that could almost have been painted by Cézanne (pressure from Stalin was partly responsible).Another expert, Charles R Johnson, who teaches computational art history at Cornell, is less persuaded – not so much by the AI as by the assumptions that lie behind it. “A big problem is that strokes are rarely individualized,” he says. “Overlap is difficult to unravel. Plus, one must understand the artist’s style changes over their career in order to make a judgment.”In addition, Johnson argues, many artist’s brushwork is essentially invisible, making it impossible to unpick; it might be better to focus computer analysis on assessing canvases or paper, which can be more rigorously verified. “I remain quite skeptical,” he says.Elgammal and den Leeuw concede there’s a way to go. Currently they’re working on impressionist paintings – infinitely more complex than Schiele and Picasso line drawings – and hope to publish the results next year. Even with the drawings, the machine can’t yet be left to learn on its own; often the algorithms require human tweaking to make sure the right features are being examined. Artists whose output isn’t large enough to create a reliable data set are also a challenge.I ask Elgammal if he’s worried about being sued. He laughs, slightly nervously. “That’s something I think about.”It’s a reasonable question, particularly pressing given the number of fakes that are circulating: What if your database accidentally becomes contaminated? Many people argue that the art market is hopelessly corrupt – so much so that some economists doubt whether calling it a “market” is even fair. Could the algorithm become skewed and go rogue?“It’s like any system,” Mass agrees. “Garbage in, garbage out.”Does she think that’s a possibility? How many fakes are out there? “Put it this way,” Mass says, “when I go into auction houses – maybe not the big ones, but smaller, local ones – I think ‘buyer beware.’ It might be between 50 and 70% .”Rival solutions are coming down the road. Some have proposed using blockchain technology to guarantee provenance – the history of who has owned a work. Others have called for much greater transparency. Everyone agrees that the system is broken; some kind of fix is urgent.Of course, there are big philosophical questions here. When someone goes to the effort of finding exactly the right 17th-century canvas, dons an antique smock, and paints a near-flawless Franz Hals, it should perhaps make us reconsider what we mean by the words “real” or “fake”, let alone the title of “artist”. Yet the irony is inescapable. It is hard to think of something more human than art, the definition of our self-expression as a species. But when it comes down to it, humans aren’t actually that good at separating forged and authentic in a painting that has all the hallmarks of, say, a Caravaggio but is merely a stunt double. Relying on our eyes, we simply can’t tell one twin from the other. We might even ask: Why do we care?Forget cars that pilot themselves or Alexa teaching herself to sound less like the robot she is – AI seems to understand the secrets of artistic genius better than we do ourselves.When I speak to den Leeuw, I wonder if he also senses the irony: that, while machines might not yet might be able to make good art, they are getting eerily good at appreciating it. “Yes, it’s true,” he says thoughtfully. “When it comes to very complex combinations of things, humans are really not so good.” He laughs. “We make too many mistakes.”

But building that takes lots of programmers many hours; Vice City, after all, was not built in a day.What if an AI could do some of the heavy lifting (so to speak) instead? Computer scientists at Italy's Politecnico di Milano found a way to let AI handle all the difficult parts of level design so that designers and gamers alike can get to the fun parts more quickly.The 1993 first-person shooter DOOM was a natural place to start. People run the thing on as much technology as possible — there are people out there who will figure out how to run the game on anything with an operating system, from a thermostat to a calculator.So it made sense that the ubiquitous game should be the starting point for the scientists to train the Generative Adversarial Network that they used to create new maps.That neural net relies on two artificial intelligence algorithms working with and against each other to create believable levels. One, the generator network, received data from thousands of human-created levels, including some from the original games and some created by hobbyists. It then created new stages that looked similar.The AI took into account the overall size of the level, the heights of the walls, the number of rooms in a level, and other measurements to try and mimic man-made levels as best as it could.The second AI, called the discriminator network, is there to check its work. It, too, analyzes the original levels, but is trained to recognize whether or not they’re man-made or AI-generated. After that analysis, it takes what it learned to check the generator network’s output.With these two algorithms pushing against each other, the researchers found that their technology could generate levels that looked believable, or at least as believable as possible given DOOM's famously-old school graphics.There were some glitches. The networks got confused about some of the fine details of how a wall ought to look, for example. But for the most part the stages were as playable as any other.But DOOM is just the beginning. The researchers believe that the general framework that runs their AI could scale up to larger and more involved games. While this could take some of the imaginative design work out of human hands, such a tool could also encourage video game developers who don’t have the budget of a major studio, allowing them to carve out their own niche in the field. With an algorithm designing or at least helping to design and construct some stages of a game, it could cost much less to make a game.Share This ArticleRead This NextPleading the FifthWashington Post Launches AI to Answer Climate Questions, But It Won't Say Whether AI Is Bad for the ClimatePress GenerateLeak Reveals the New York Times Experimented With Using AI to Write HeadlinesWhat in the BioshockIn Fresh Hell, American Vending Machines Are Selling Bullets Using Facial RecognitionFake LoveResearcher Studying Married Men With AI GirlfriendsVirus PanicChatGPT-4o Is Sending Users to a Scammy Website That Floods Your Screen With Fake Virus Warnings",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence-video-games'}",,https://wordpress-assets.futurism.com/2018/05/doom.jpg,,,,,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'https://futurism.com#organization', 'url': 'https://futurism.com', 'description': 'Science and Technology News and Videos', 'foundingDate': '2015-11-25', 'masthead': 'https://futurism.com/masthead', 'name': 'Futurism', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': '60', 'width': '191', 'url': 'https://futurism.com/schema/OrgFuturism.png'}}",,2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,
