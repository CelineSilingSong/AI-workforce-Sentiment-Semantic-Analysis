The middle and working classes have seen a steady decline in their fortunes. Sending jobs to foreign countries, the hollowing out of the manufacturing sector, pivoting toward a service economy and the weakening of unions have been blamed for the challenges faced by a majority of Americans. 


There’s an interesting, compelling and alternative explanation. According to a new academic research study, automation technology has been the primary driver in U.S. income inequality over the past 40 years. The report, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that 50% to 70% of changes in U.S. wages, since 1980, can be attributed to wage declines among blue-collar workers who were replaced or degraded by automation. 

Artificial intelligence, robotics and new sophisticated technologies have caused a wide chasm in wealth and income inequality. It looks like this issue will accelerate. For now, college-educated, white-collar professionals have largely been spared the fate of degreeless workers. People with a postgraduate degree saw their salaries rise, while “low-education workers declined significantly.” According to the study, “The real earnings of men without a high-school degree are now 15% lower than they were in 1980.” 

PROMOTED
Much of the changes in U.S. wage structure, according to the paper, were caused by companies automating tasks that used to be done by people. This includes “numerically-controlled machinery or industrial robots replacing blue-collar workers in manufacturing or specialized software replacing clerical workers.”

Artificial intelligence systems are ubiquitous. AI-powered digital voice assistants share everything you want to know just by asking it a question. Instead of a live person addressing a problem, a corporate chatbot forces you to engage with it. The technology is remarkable. It helps diagnose cancer and health issues. Banks use sophisticated software to check for fraud and bad behaviors. Driverless automobiles, newsfeeds, social media and job applications are all controlled by AI.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) concluded in a recent report, “A new generation of smart machines, fueled by rapid advances in AI and robotics, could potentially replace a large proportion of existing human jobs.” Robotics and AI will cause a serious “double-disruption,” as the pandemic pushed companies to fast-track the deployment of new technologies to slash costs, enhance productivity and be less reliant on real-life people. The WEF asserts automation will slash about 85 million jobs by 2025. In a dire prediction, WEF said, “While some new jobs would be created as in the past, the concern is there may not be enough of these to go round, particularly as the cost of smart machines falls over time and their capabilities increase.”

Management consulting giant PriceWaterhouseCoopers reported, “AI, robotics and other forms of smart automation have the potential to bring great economic benefits, contributing up to $15 trillion to global GDP by 2030.” However, it will come with a high human cost. “This extra wealth will also generate the demand for many jobs, but there are also concerns that it could displace many existing jobs.”

Concerns of new technologies disrupting the workforce and causing job losses have been around for a long time. On one side, the argument is automation will create new and better jobs and erase the need for physical labor. The counterclaim is that people without the appropriate skills will be displaced and not have a home in the new environment. 
Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Zoom and other tech giants greatly benefited financially during the pandemic. The virus outbreak accelerated trends, including choosing technology over people. There’s still a need for humans. For example, although Amazon invested heavily in automation for its warehouses, the online retail giant still needed to hire over 300,000 workers during the pandemic. This brings up another important overlooked  issue: the quality of a job. Proponents of AI say that there’s nothing to worry about, as we’ve always successfully dealt with new technologies. You may have a job, but what is the quality of it?  
To remain relevant, you will have to learn new skills to stay ahead of the curve. Bloomberg reported, “More than 120 million workers globally will need retraining in the next three years due to artificial intelligence’s impact on jobs, according to an IBM survey.” The amount of individuals who will be impacted is immense. 
The world’s most advanced cities aren’t ready for the disruptions of artificial intelligence, claims Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm. It is believed that over 50 million Chinese workers may require retraining, as a result of AI-related deployment. The U.S. will be required to retool 11.5 million people in America with skills needed to survive in the workforce. Millions of workers in Brazil, Japan and Germany will need assistance with the changes wrought by AI, robotics and related technology.
For those who may be left behind, there’s a call for offering a universal basic income (UBI). This idea gained national attention when it became a major part of Democratic candidate Andrew Yang’s 2020 presidential campaign. Yang’s policy was to lift people out of poverty or help them through rough patches with a guaranteed monthly income. Supporters say it gives people needed financial security to find good jobs and avoid debt. Critics have argued free money would be a disincentive to work, creating a society dependent on the state.
According to a Wells Fargo research report, robots will eliminate 200,000 jobs in the banking industry within the next 10 years. This has already adversely impacted highly paid Wall Street professionals, including stock and bond traders. These are the people who used to work on the trading floors at investment banks and trade securities for their banks, clients and themselves. It was a very lucrative profession until algorithms, quant-trading software and programs disrupted the business and rendered their skills unnecessary—compared to the fast-acting technology. 
There is no hiding from the robots. Well-trained and experienced doctors will be pushed aside by sophisticated robots that can perform delicate surgeries more precisely and read x-rays more efficiently and accurately to detect cancerous cells that can’t be readily seen by the human eye. 
Truck and cab drivers, cashiers, retail sales associates and people who work in manufacturing plants and factories have and will continue to be replaced by robotics and technology. Driverless vehicles, kiosks in fast-food restaurants and self-help, quick-phone scans at stores will soon eliminate most minimum-wage and low-skilled jobs.
The rise of artificial intelligence will make even software engineers less sought after. That’s because artificial intelligence will soon write its own software, according to Jack Dorsey, the tech billionaire boss of Twitter and Square. That will put some beginner-level software engineers in a tough spot. When discussing how automation will replace jobs held by humans, Dorsey told Yang on an episode of the Yang Speaks podcast, “We talk a lot about the self-driving trucks and whatnot.” He added, “[AI] is even coming for programming [jobs]. A lot of the goals of machine learning and deep learning is to write the software itself over time, so a lot of entry-level programming jobs will just not be as relevant anymore.”  
 When management consultants and companies that deploy AI and robotics say we don’t need to worry, we need to be concerned. Companies—whether they are McDonald’s, introducing self-serve kiosks and firing hourly workers to cut costs, or top-tier investment banks that rely on software instead of traders to make million-dollar bets on the stock market—will continue to implement technology and downsize people, in an effort to enhance profits. 
This trend has the potential to adversely impact all classes of workers. In light of the study’s spotlight on the dire results of AI, including lost wages and the rapid growth in income inequality, it's time to seriously talk about how AI should be managed before it's too late.

Too often, the biases that professionals from minority groups experience in the real world are replicated in the AI-enabled algorithms used in training & recruiting

Without human intervention, it is easy for algorithms used in the recruiting process to reproduce bias from the real world, according to a 2019 study conducted by Harvard Business Review (HBR) with professionals from Northeastern University and the University of Southern California.
Since then, it is questionable whether the situation has improved despite the emergence of artificial intelligence as a powerful tool in the evolving 21st century business landscape and its ability to learn and identify trend. A new report entitled The Elephant in AI, produced by Prof. Rangita de Silva de Alwis founder of the AI & Implicit Bias Lab at University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, looks at employment platforms through the perceptions of 87 black students and professionals coupled with an analysis of 360 online professional profiles with the goal of understanding how AI-powered platforms “reflect, recreate, and reinforce anti-Black bias.”
Key findings from the research
The new report explored a range of AI-related employment processes from job searches, online networking opportunities, and electronic resume submission platforms. More specifically, key findings include:





In an analysis of job board recommendations of those surveyed, 40% of respondents noted that they had experienced recommendations based upon their identities, rather than their qualifications. Moreover, 30% also noted that the job alerts they had received were below their current skill level.
Almost two-thirds (63%) of respondents noted that academic recommendations made by the platforms were lower than their current academic achievements. This was a finding of particular disappointment as the survey highlights the fact that black women are the most educated group in America.





For the most part, Silicon Valley is still prominently populated by white people, with men comprising the majority of leadership positions. It begs the question of how the technology industry can create fair and balanced AI for the masses if there are still diversity challenges within the very teams designing and implementing the algorithms upon which that AI relies. In fact, Amazon scrapped a recruiting tool in 2018 because of such bias.
Further, a 2019 study from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology that examined 189 facial recognition algorithms from 99 different developers found that a majority falsely identified non-white faces. Although commonly used by both federal and state governments, facial recognition has raised concerns over AI-enabled bias and have led agencies such as the Boston and San Francisco police departments to ban its use.
AI-enabled biases in recruiting & testing 
As with the case of facial recognition, long-known hiring discrimination processes are often increasingly AI-enabled. The UPenn report notes that Black professionals in today’s employment marketplace continue to receive 30% to 50% less job call-backs when their resumes contain information tied to their racial or ethnic identity.
With AI being developed as an employment tool meant to help provide equality of opportunities, the survey asked about employers empowered with AI-based recruiting technologies and whether candidates feared being not considered for employment by those employers. Less than 10% said it would little cause of worry, yet more than 20% said that it’d be of considerable worry to them. The report expands on hiring discrimination by exploring potential biases incorporated within pre-programmed “expected responses”, with researchers pointing out that these responses point to potential data inequity.
Other inequities centered around skill-based tests questions programmed into hiring platforms that have been known to be biased. Such questions, built upon exams such as the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), are creating unfair screening assessments. And given the amount of research around these biases in standardized testing, using legacy assessment models continue to inhibit the success of Black and other minority groups from advancing in employment hiring pools.
In considering the use of AI platforms by employers, the report points both to the technical complexity of the AI behind the platforms as well as the limited knowledge of those in human resources or other hiring roles in understanding such complexities.
Actions for employers & developers
Until there are industry-wide best practices, the responsibility to ensure that the AI algorithms being used to promote equity falls upon the vendors that are building the tools and the employers that use them. According to the 2019 HBR study, employers using AI-enabled recruiting tools should analyze their entire recruiting pipeline — from attraction to on-boarding — in order to “detect places where latent bias lurks or emerges anew.”
Prof. de Silva de Alwis calls for diverse teams to develop less biased models and algorithms and advises employers of software developers to leverage tools that will minimize biases, such as Microsoft’s Fairlearn, an open source toolkit that empowers data scientists and developers to assess and improve the fairness of their AI systems. InterpretML, also a Microsoft creation, is another tool that helps AI-model developers assess their model’s behavior and de-bias their data.
Employers should also use a “second look” at the resumes and CVs of underrepresented minorities to mitigate the biases that run the risk of being reproduced on a vast scale by AI-led recruitment platforms, says Eric Rosenblum, Managing Partner at Tsingyuan Ventures, the largest Silicon Valley venture capital fund for Chinese diaspora innovators.

UK researchers have secured government funding to study the use of artificial intelligence for breast cancer screening in NHS hospitals.
The work builds on previous research which showed that artificial intelligence could be as effective as human radiologists in spotting breast cancer from X-ray images. 
Backed by funding through the Artificial Intelligence in Health and Care Award, the next stages of the project aim to further assess the feasibility of the AI system to see how the technology could be integrated into the national screening programme in the future to support clinicians.  
The partnership, which includes Imperial College London, Google Health, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, St George’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and the Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust builds on previous work, in which the researchers trained the algorithm on depersonalised patient data and mammograms from patients in the UK and US.
The findings, published in Nature in January 2020, showed the AI system was able to correctly identify cancers from the images with a similar degree of accuracy to expert radiologists, and demonstrated potential to assist clinical staff in practice. 
Clinical setting
The funding has been awarded to Imperial College London and the three NHS Trusts for a retrospective study to determine the accuracy and fairness of an AI-model, examine how radiologists and clinicians interact with the AI system, and a prospective observational study in a clinical setting. All research will be subject to National Research Ethics approval before commencing. The AI system would not be used in patient care during the study, and clinicians would remain in full control of patient care pathways at all times. 
One in eight women in the UK will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, with the risk increasing with age. Early detection and treatment provide the best outcome for women, but accurately detecting and diagnosing breast cancer remains a significant challenge. 
The funding of this project is one of a number to be announced today by the Department of Health and Social Care, NHSX and the National Institute for Health Research. The Artificial Intelligence in Health and Care Award is making £140 million available over four years to accelerate the testing and evaluation of artificial intelligence technologies which meet the aims set out in the NHS Long Term Plan. 
The AI Award is one of the programmes that make up the NHS AI Lab, led by NHSX and delivered in partnership with the Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC) and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). The Award is part of the £250 million funding given by the Department for Health and Social Care to NHSX to establish an AI Lab aimed at improving the health and lives of patients. 
Next steps
Professor the Lord Ara Darzi of Denham, Director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London and chief investigator on the project, said: “Our early work in this area has shown that using algorithms to screen for breast cancer is feasible. This next step will be our first real life test of AI as part of a national screening programme.  
“AI is not designed to replace healthcare workers, whose clinical training and experience are invaluable to the NHS. Ultimately, we hope these tools could help to reduce the current burden on radiologists and the NHS, improving outcomes for patients through earlier detection and treatment of cancer.” 
Professor Deborah Cunningham, Consultant radiologist at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, said: “We are very excited to be able to work with colleagues assessing this new AI tool in screening mammogram interpretation in a real-world situation for the first time. There is a national shortage of clinicians qualified to interpret screening mammography and this product has the potential to mitigate this problem, while improving early breast cancer diagnosis, benefiting a large number of asymptomatic well women.” 
Dr Susan Thomas, Clinical Director at Google Health said: “Artificial intelligence has shown great potential to dramatically improve both access and quality of healthcare, and the next step is to assess how this technology could be safely implemented in real-world clinical settings. The NHS is a global leader in providing a high-quality national screening programme for breast cancer. These studies will help provide a comprehensive evaluation of a technology that has potential to improve the consistency and sustainability of breast cancer screening programmes around the world.” 
Lord Darzi added: “It is only through these kinds of partnerships, which bring together expertise from academia, healthcare and the commercial sector, that we can leverage the very best technology for the greatest benefit to global health.” 
The full list of AI in Health and Care Award winners is available on the NHSX website.

Advances in artificial intelligence will change the character of warfare for generations to come, affording decisive and enduring advantages to whoever harnesses it first. Recently, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence’s Final Report released on March 1, 2021 emphasized the importance of AI to our nation’s security when it set an aggressive target for America’s armed forces: become “AI-ready by 2025” or risk ceding our overmatch—a target I believe is crucial to meet. As Congress considers the president’s budget request, it should keep this goal in mind.
In today’s era of great power competition, the United States must win this future against China and Russia. Doing so requires a 3–5 percent real increase in annual defense spending, coupled with the retirement of legacy systems and other reforms that will enable efficient investment into the digital workforce, systems, and infrastructure needed to ensure our AI readiness.
As secretary of defense, I felt so strongly about AI’s importance that we sped up the fielding of AI capabilities at scale to meet warfighter needs through the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. We also published DoD’s first-ever set of AI ethical principles to ensure the United States is the global leader in the responsible development and use of AI.
But to win the AI future, the Pentagon must also successfully advance and integrate four main ingredients: standardized and shared data; relevant AI algorithms and models; strong cybersecurity to protect the data and integrity of the models; and a robust transport mechanism (e.g., 5G) to push AI out to the warfighter.
In 2018 as secretary of the Army, I initiated a comprehensive review of Army capabilities and programs called Night Court. The Army’s leadership looked at over five hundred programs and asked, Does this program support the Army’s modernization priorities? If not, then we canceled or reduced it, allowing us to realign over $30 billion to higher-priority programs. A second round of reviews in 2019 harvested another $13 billion.
When I became secretary of defense, I launched a similar review for the entire department. We made good progress despite a late start, but more can be done. To be “AI-ready by 2025,” the Pentagon must continue reforming while gaining congressional support to trim low-priority, underperforming, and legacy systems ill-suited for tomorrow’s conflicts. Savings can then be reinvested in game-changing technologies, such as digital infrastructure and the innovations needed to win AI-enabled warfare.
To help make these difficult decisions, the department should also continue taking the following steps to drive more rigorous analysis and evaluation of its programs and systems: first, build the capacity to support data-driven decision-making; second, identify the AI-dependent capabilities the US military needs to defeat a near-peer competitor; and third, establish more substantive criteria for AI readiness.
Data-Driven Decision-Making
AI will vastly accelerate the pace and scope of conflict, and will place an even greater premium on smart, timely, and accurate decisions in war. Data-driven decision-making enabled by AI can also help the Pentagon make better investment choices during peacetime. To achieve these outcomes, leaders must have broad, on-demand access to authoritative data.
During my tenure as secretary of defense, we established the first official chief data officer under the CIO and issued the first Department of Defense Data Strategy to guide improvements on the availability and reliability of department information. We also took additional steps to support management operations by developing platforms for senior leaders to interact with live data. To this end, an important first step was the launch of the DoD comptroller’s ADVANA data platform, integrating hundreds of department datasets to support the Pentagon audit and other core business processes.
Much work remains, however. Data is the fuel that AI needs to be relevant. On its own, algorithms are worthless without the right inputs. The hard work that lies ahead is for the Pentagon to rationalize and share its data across the services and its many agencies, with the most important step being to cultivate a culture of data sharing.
DoD had the largest research and development budget in its history in 2020, and recently unveiled an even larger one that we programmed last year. Our investment focus was on the top eleven modernization initiatives—beginning with AI—that would ensure our continued overmatch well into the future. To effectively optimize our portfolio going forward, DoD must assess and weigh its core investments in AI, quantum computing, directed energy, 5G networks, and other technologies based on the weapons and systems they will bring to bear, as well as new capabilities they could create or enable. For example, a review of DoD’s modernization portfolio today should consider foundational investments in AI and emerging technologies necessary to support joint capabilities, such as Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) and long-range precision fires, while simultaneously determining how and where to place bets to advance next-generation capabilities. To accomplish this, the Pentagon must first develop curated datasets of its technology investments, labeled with the operational and technological attributes of each, along with the digital platforms and applications that will allow automated tracking and broad trade-space analysis.
We should also reimagine DoD’s analysis of alternatives (AoA) process, which requires comparing systems under development to alternative solutions before procuring them, using evaluation criteria unique to each program. With better data and AI-enabled analysis, the AoA process could more quickly and effectively generate estimated returns on investment for both current and future systems, allowing apples-to-apples comparisons that inform department-wide investment and divestment decisions. This will also help DoD communicate modernization priorities more effectively with Congress, allowing for better-informed oversight of budget decisions and their necessary trade-offs.
Capabilities to Defeat a Near-Peer Competitor
My top priority as secretary of defense was implementing the National Defense Strategy (NDS), with a clear focus on China. We had a very good understanding of the capabilities needed to ensure the comparative advantage of US forces in a near-peer conflict. These requirements were based on a clear set of facts and assumptions used to guide our thinking. A few stood out.
To begin, China should continue to be the pacing threat as it works toward its stated goal of becoming the world leader in AI by 2030, part of its plan to complete its military modernization by 2035. The Chinese Communist Party is operationalizing this plan by driving massive investments into applied AI research and leveraging its strategy of military-civil fusion to harness private sector innovation for military advantage.
Second, US forces will need to be able to fight and win across all domains, especially the comparatively new ones of outer space and cyberspace. Operating as a joint force across these domains will require an unprecedented level of connectivity and interoperability. The concept of JADC2, for example, will provide the connectivity required to coordinate all-domain operations against near-peer competitors with capabilities to disrupt or deny US battle networks.
Finally, AI will change warfare across the ground, sea, air, space, and cyberspace domains. As such, the department must have existing platforms and systems that are ready to operate within these radically changed environments, but must also position itself to quickly adopt and operationalize emerging and disruptive technologies.
One of my “Top Ten” NDS implementation objectives was the development of a modern Joint Warfighting Concept (JWC) that enabled our transition to all-domain operations. DoD should continue to ruthlessly validate the JWC through rigorous experimentation, wargaming, and exercises while leveraging modern disciplines and tradecraft such as digital engineering and digital twins that enable virtual representations of warfighting systems and platforms. This will require foundational investments in the technical infrastructure to develop and scale modeling and simulation sandboxes where cleared warfighters, researchers, and industry partners can iterate and validate operational concepts against countless adversarial scenarios and capabilities.
DARPA provided a glimpse of what is possible during last year’s AlphaDogfight Trials when a simulated F-16 operated by an AI agent defeated not only other AI agents in a simulated digital air-to-air combat, but also a human F-16 pilot. Experimentation and wargames like these will not only provide great insight into operational concepts, but also enhance training for warfighters by tailoring learning to maximize performance.
Defining and Achieving AI-Readiness
Finally, the department should set clear schedule and performance objectives that drive measurable improvements in the digital infrastructure and workforce necessary to achieve AI-readiness. These objectives will help define investments in a digitally enabled force not by five-year milestones or set quantities of air, ground, or sea platforms, but rather in terms of the ability of our military forces to adopt emerging and disruptive technologies at a pace and scale that creates uncertainty in the minds of our adversaries. Additionally, these objectives will help us clarify and refine the key technical and operational attributes required by AI-enabled technologies.
DoD must define and invest in the underlying digital ecosystem that enables digital innovation. To use an analogy from home renovation shows on TV, the process of modernizing a house can’t start with quartz countertops, wide-plank hardwood floors, and recessed lighting. It begins with the heavy-lift investments to upgrade the plumbing, electrical wiring, and insulation behind the walls. Moreover, an open-concept home that replaces individual rooms requires an expensive overhead beam to support the load. In a similar fashion, an AI-ready force requires a commitment to resource the data, trained AI models, cloud storage and computing, software development, and secure networking and processing—the foundational digital infrastructure to support AI-enabled applications and technology.
While these initiatives are a major undertaking for the department, the Pentagon has a head start with the recent blueprint for a digital ecosystem published by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. The blueprint envisions a technical foundation that: 1) provides access to leading cloud technologies and services for scalable computing; 2) enables the sharing of data, software, and capabilities through well-documented and hardened application programming interfaces based on industry standard protocols along with proper access controls; and 3) gives all DoD developers and scientists access to the tools and resources they need to drive new AI capabilities.
The armed services have made great strides building out this digital environment with programs like Platform One, the Joint Common Foundation, and other development platforms. Each of these efforts is a step in the right direction, but ultimately no one service or entity can own and support the full ecosystem required. Rather, the Pentagon should follow a federated approach, building on and connecting existing resources and pathfinder efforts, and linking individual agency initiatives through interoperability and adherence to a community-driven, open architecture.
Perhaps the most difficult change DoD must make in the coming years is the transformation of its warfighters and workforce to ensure digital relevance. Our military must embrace new and disruptive emerging technologies, including AI. To effect this, personnel at all levels—from our most senior leaders to our junior servicemembers—must understand how these technologies unlock new capabilities. To do so, we must provide them with the knowledge and skills required to employ AI as an opportunity to augment, or even displace, current methods.
Moreover, we must integrate civilian and uniformed technologists into our warfighting teams, and provide them with appropriate and rewarding career paths and opportunities. Talent management was a major focus of mine as secretary of the Army, when we began overhauling the ground service’s personnel management system. There is a great deal to be done here across all of DoD, however, and it will take considerable time and effort. But “people” are our most valuable resource, so top-down leadership is required if we are going to drive the change needed to recruit and retain the best our nation has to offer in the years to come.
Much has been accomplished the last couple years to make the US military “AI-ready” and able to win the future, but much work remains. I am acutely aware of how difficult it is to prioritize, reform, and redistribute money within the Department of Defense. But at the end of the day, we must do what’s right for our warfighters and our nation’s security—and at this time, the right thing to do is dedicate more resources to building our AI capabilities and the other ingredients that will ensure DoD’s success. Making the tough prioritization decisions and defending them before Congress will help set the conditions for the Pentagon to out-innovate and out-deploy our adversaries in this crucial space, thus ensuring US and allied overmatch against China and Russia in the decades ahead.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over just about every aspect of communication. From Siri answering your vocalized questions to Amazon recommending products based on your browsing history, AI has permeated our lives in ways we don't even think about anymore.AI is developing faster than ever — experts have projected the global AI market value to reach $190 billion by 2025. It's not time to panic about Skynet taking over just yet, but it is important to understand how AI is currently impacting and will continue to impact writers and other professions.Human writers will always have a place in content creation. I teach over 500 of them in my academy, and I see a real need that grows every year. The real uncertainly lies with the question of ""In what capacity?""



Will AI become so powerful that editing machine-generated work rather than writing unique articles will become the norm for content creators?My prediction: not likely. At least, not anytime soon.


Artificial intelligence is making waves, but content writers aren't going anywhereIt's no secret that content creation is a time-consuming process. Even with the help of AI tools, it takes a lot of time and effort to create a professional piece of content. That's why so many companies are turning to AI. It can help them get more content created in a shorter amount of time.AI isn't expected to replace writers entirely — not yet, at least. When it comes to writing, there are still some things that AI can't do. For example, it can't create truly original content.Now, what would you say if I told you those three paragraphs you just read were written by AI? Because it was.Overall, it's pretty good for a machine, and AI tools have massively improved over the last few years. Despite some grim predictions about machines inevitably replacing a majority of human jobs in the near future, our trusty AI friend admitted in its third paragraph that it can't compete when it comes to writing original content.


(A machine wouldn't lie, right?)And originality isn't the only skill where machines fall short.Related: The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Accelerated During the Pandemic. It's Here to Stay.Six essential human skills that give us an advantage over AIPerhaps the day will come when we're able to program machines to be smart enough and adaptive enough to compete with us on equal footing, but we're a long way from that point.


In the humans vs. AI stand-off, we still have a few tricks up our sleeves.1. Creativity Artificial intelligence is great at processing data and reforming it into written content. The facts are there, presented in legible, grammatically correct sentences, but it's just missing something.There's simply no way to program true creativity into a machine yet. The human brain is lightyears ahead of any other creature or artificial intelligence in that department.2. Variation AI is getting better about emulating the way we communicate, but it hasn't quite nailed down our natural speech yet.


Strong writing avoids repeating the same words, phrases, sentence lengths and sentence structure. We like to switch things up. AI has a tendency to sound a bit, well, robotic after a while. But it is improving.3. Passion When you read a book, article, poem or any other written piece, you can often feel the soul of the writer bleeding through every word. Most writers truly love what they do for a living, and it shows. There's something to be said about human tenacity and dedication.No matter how sophisticated we program AI processes, there's simply no way to recreate the level of sentiment, passion and commitment that allows us to connect with one another so deeply through indirect means.4. Empathy Robots can do many things, but they can't feel emotions or figuratively put themselves in our shoes to understand the challenges we're facing. For this reason, AI isn't likely to replace humans in customer service or any other field that requires a personal and empathetic connection.


5. Experience No amount of data can compete with the value of true experience, just like pictures of exotic places on Google can't amount to really traveling there. Similarly, without experiences to draw from, AI writing often feels somewhat hollow below the surface.6. Judgment Computers are programmed to make choices based on a series of parameters, but that isn't the same as developing judgment skills. Human copywriters rely on values, knowledge gained from experience, and intuition to write topics that will resonate with people.Many writers ""go with the flow"" and allow the writing to naturally guide them, sometimes in directions they weren't necessarily planning to go. We make choices as we write.AI hasn't yet become intuitive and adaptable on that level yet. Rather than shift gears into a related topic if that's the way the piece is flowing, AI will often circle back and repeat information because it's bound to a specific outline or set of topics to follow.

AI falls short when it comes to creating search engine optimized (SEO) content, among other categories.Still, despite some shortcomings, there's no denying that AI has its benefits and will be playing an important role in our lives for the foreseeable future.


Rather than resist the changes, we at Express Writers have embraced AI as a supplemental resource. Although we've sampled several different AI tools, our favorite is the third iteration of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT-3) AI.A language AI tool called Hyperwrite assists us by:Jumpstarting ideas: Allowing AI to make recommendations helps our writers push through writer's block when they're stuck.Creating first drafts: With a little guidance throughout the process, AI can produce usable material that just needs some TLC and editing to bring out a human touch in the final draft.Cutting production time by nearly 50%: A little help can go a long way by reducing the time we spend researching topics and powering through rough drafts.The future lies in the capable hands of talented human writers. AI is not likely to ever fully replace content writers, but it can be a versatile resource to assist them and speed up the creation process.The passionate writers who embrace their tools rather than fear them have nothing to worry about for the future.

Both aging and population growth are primary drivers of these shortages, with the 65-and-up segment projected to swell by more than 42% over the next decade. The findings are part of the Association of American Medical Colleges’ seventh annual analysis of physician supply and demand, published June 11. The report did not give a specific number for radiology alone, lumping the specialty together with anesthesiology, neurology, emergency medicine and addiction specialists. This segment is projected to see a shortfall of between 10,300 and 35,600 physicians by 2034. “Nonprimary care specialties” have the highest anticipated deficit (upward of 77,100), while “medical specialties” (such as cardiology, oncology and pulmonology) had the lowest (13,400). AAMC noted that the “other specialties” category is 1,400 higher due primarily to demand in physical medicine, psychiatry, and neurology, but “lower demand for radiologists.” “While some factors, such as an aging population and national goals to expand access to care, will increase demand for physicians, others could decrease demand, or increases and decreases in demand could offset each other,” the report noted. “For example, advances in artificial intelligence could improve the productivity of radiologists, pathologists and others in detecting and diagnosing cancers and other medical conditions, possibly leading to a lower demand for these physicians to care for the existing population.”An AAMC spokesman could not provide further details on its radiology estimates, but said the predicted decline is based on “changing demographics and utilization patterns.” Global information company IHS Markit conducted the analysis on behalf of AAMC back in 2019 prior to the pandemic. The firm utilized data including physician work hours and retirement trends. More than 2 of every 5 physicians in the U.S. will reach age 65 or older within the next decade, and their decision to hang up the stethoscope will “dramatically affect the magnitude of national workforce shortages,” the report noted.

This is creating legitimate concerns that AI will eventually displace human employees throughout the economy. But it is hardly the only, or even the most likely, consequence. Never once have digital technologies been so attentive to us, nor have we been so reactive to our devices. As AI will fundamentally transform how and who performs work, the technology's greater effect will be in complementing and boosting human talents rather than replacing them..The AI revolution has already started, and it is changing every area of our life..From academics and researchers to inventive tech entrepreneurs, here are 10 people pushing the frontiers of deep learning and computerized vision to make AI dreams come true..1.

Real-time applications are enabled by smart data processing embedded into the gadget itself..10. Robin Li.Nationality: ChinesePosition: CEO and Founder of Baidu.Li wants to be in charge of AI's destiny in China and abroad. Baidu is constantly engaged in cutting-edge research in fields such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning. Baidu Brain is a set of AI-powered solutions, as well as DuerOS, a smart speaker platform..Why are These People so Involved in AI?.Automation.One of the most often mentioned advantages of AI technology is automation, which has had substantial effects on the communication, transport, consumer goods, and service sectors. Automation not only provides for higher production levels and efficiency in various industries, but it also allows for more efficient input materials usage, better product quality, shorter lead times, and improved safety. Automation can also assist to free up resources that can be put to better use..Smart Decision Making.Artificial Intelligence has long been used to help businesses make better decisions. To make good judgments for the organisation, AI technology can coordinate data supply, evaluate trends, establish data consistency, give predictions, and quantify uncertainties. AI will stay neutral on the subject at hand as long as it is not trained to replicate human emotions, and it will assist in making the best choice to promote corporate efficiency..Enhanced Customer Experience.AI-powered solutions can assist organisations in swiftly responding to consumer questions and concerns and resolving issues. Chatbots that combine conversational AI and Natural Language Processing technology may provide highly customised messages to consumers, assisting in the discovery of the optimal solution for their requirements. AI technologies can also assist customer care representatives feel less stressed, resulting in increased productivity..Medical Advances.Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are growing progressively popular in the healthcare industry. For example, remote patient monitoring technology enables healthcare practitioners to swiftly make clinical diagnosis and prescribe treatments without having the patient attend the hospital in person. AI can also help track the course of infectious diseases and even forecast their impacts and consequences in the future..Research and Data Analysis.Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) may be used to evaluate data considerably more quickly. It can aid in the development of prediction models and algorithms for data processing and understanding the possible outcomes of various trends and events. Furthermore, AI's powerful computational skills may expedite the processing and interpretation of data for research and innovation that would otherwise take much longer for humans to examine and comprehend..Conclusion.While many businesses have utilised AI to automate operations, those who use it primarily to replace workers will only experience short-term productivity improvements. In our 1,500-company study, we discovered that when people and robots collaborate, organisations make the most substantial performance gains. Humans and AI actively improve each other's complimentary qualities through cooperative intellectual ability..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

What does AI in warfare really look like? What are the possible applications, and how will they be used? Who will use them and who will they be used against? This webinar will discuss the future of AI in warfare from a practical standpoint and seeks to make explicit how these weapons will be developed, deployed and used—and by whom. Rather than discussing the development of autonomous weapons in technical or logistical terms, this discussion aims to tease out how autonomous weapons operate within and augment the current geopolitical landscape and what the moral consequences of their deployment might be. We will also discuss what this means for those who work in the field of AI, and what responsibility we all have to ensure that the work we do leads to a more just and equitable future.

There are numerous instances of AI applications in healthcare. The AI that occurs in hearing aids has actually been going on for years and the following is about how it happened. Hearing aids used to be relatively simple, he notes, but when hearing aids introduced a technology known as wide dynamic range compression (WDRC), the devices actually began to make a few decisions based on what is heard. For hearing aids to work effectively, they need to adapt to a person's individual hearing needs as well as all sorts of background noise environments. AI, machine learning, and neural networks are very good techniques to deal with such a complicated, nonlinear, multi-variable problem..The result of the research.Researchers have been able to accomplish a lot with AI to date when it comes to improving hearing. For instance, researchers at the Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory (PNL) at the Ohio State University trained a DNN to distinguish speech from other noise (such as humming and other background conversations). DeLiang Wang, professor of computer science and engineering at Ohio State University, in IEEE Spectrum has further explained &quot;People with hearing impairment could decipher only 29% of words muddled by babble without the program, but they understood 84% after the processing,&quot;.Using neural networks in hearing aids.In recent years, major hearing aid manufacturers have been adding AI technology to their premium hearing aid models. For example, Widex's Moment hearing aid utilizes AI and machine learning to create hearing programs based on a wearer's typical environments. Recently, Oticon introduced its newest hearing aid device, Oticon More™, the first hearing aid with an onboard deep neural network. Oticon More has decided 12 million-plus real-life sounds so that people wearing it can better understand speech and the sounds around them. In a crowded place, Oticon More's neural net receives a complicated layer of sounds, known as input. The DNN gets to work, first scanning and extracting simple sound elements and patterns from the input. It builds these element-powered her to recognize and make sense of what's happening. Lastly, the hearing aids then make a decision on how to balance the sound scene, making sure the output is clean and ideally balanced to the person's unique type of hearing loss. Speech and other sounds in the environment are complicated acoustic waveforms, but with unique patterns and structures that are exactly the sort of data deep learning is designed to analyze..The necessity of AI-powered hearing aid.Hearing aids range widely in price, and some at the lower end have fewer AI-driven bells and whistles. Some patients may not need all the features, like the people who live alone or rarely leave the house find themselves in crowded scenarios often, for instance, might not benefit from the functionality found in higher-end models..But for anyone who is out and about a lot, especially in situations where there are big soundscapes, AI-powered features allow for an improved hearing experience. The improvement of memory can be measured in a lot of more natural cater is memory recall. It's not that the hearing aids like Oticon More literally improve a person's memory, but artificial intelligence helps people spend less time trying to make sense of the noise around them, a process known as listening effort. When the listening effort is more natural, a person can focus more on the conversation and all the nuances conveyed within. So, the use of AI in hearing aids would help the brain work in a more natural way..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
