With so many processes to coordinate and manage, artificial intelligence is quickly becoming essential for organizations of its scale. This applies to both research and development as well as the huge support infrastructure needed for a business with 170,000 employees.
Recently it announced that it had developed machine learning algorithms capable of sniffing your armpit and telling you whether you are suffering from body odors. While this may seem like ""using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut,"" the technology which has been developed could well go on to be used to monitor food for freshness, helping to solve the problem of food overproduction and waste endemic in society.
PROMOTED
As well as these smart, public-facing initiatives, though, artificial intelligence is being put to use behind the scenes to help screen and assess the more than one million people per year who apply for jobs with Unilever. If they make the grade and become one of the thousands who are offered a job, they have AI-powered tools to help them adjust to their new role and hit the ground running.

AI-enhanced recruiting
Unilever recruits more than 30,000 people a year and processes around 1.8 million job applications.
This takes a tremendous amount of time and resources. As a multinational brand operating in 190 countries, applicants are based all around the world. Finding the right people is an essential ingredient for success, and Unilever can't afford to overlook talent just because it is buried at the bottom of a pile of CVs.

To tackle this problem, Unilever partnered with Pymetrics, a specialist in AI recruitment, to create an online platform, which means candidates can be initially assessed from their own homes, in front of a computer or mobile phone screen.
First, they are asked to play a selection of games that test their aptitude, logic, and reasoning, and appetite for risk. Machine learning algorithms are then used to assess their suitability for whatever role they have applied for, by matching their profiles against those of previously successful employees.





The second stage of the process involves submitting a video interview. Again, the assessor is not a human being but a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm examines the videos of candidates who answering questions for around 30 minutes, and through a mixture of natural language processing and body language analysis, determines who is likely to be a good fit.
Unilever's chief of HR, Leena Nair, told me that around 70,000 person-hours of interviewing and assessing candidates had been cut, thanks to the automated screening system.
She said, ""We look for people with a sense of purpose – systemic thinking, resilience, business acumen. Based on that profile, the games and the video interview are all programmed to look for cues in their behavior that will help us understand who will fit in at Unilever.""
Referring to the video interview analytics for their future leaders program, she tells me: “Every screenshot gives us many data points about the person, so we work with a number of partners and use a lot of proprietary technology with those partners, and then we select 3,500 or so people to go through to our discovery center.” After spending a day with real leaders and recruiters, Unilever selects about 800 people who will be offered a job.
The system is also designed to give feedback to all applicants, even those who aren’t successful.
“What I like about the process is that each and every person who applies to us gets some feedback,” Nair says.
“Normally when people send an application to a large company it can go into a ‘black hole’ – thank you very much for your CV, we’ll get back to you – and you never hear from them again.
“All of our applicants get a couple of pages of feedback, how they did in the game, how they did in the video interviews, what characteristics they have that fit, and if they don’t fit, the reason why they didn’t, and what we think they should do to be successful in a future application.
“It’s an example of artificial intelligence allowing us to be more human.”
So while Unilever isn’t quite ready to hand the entire recruitment process over to machines just yet, it has shown that it can assist with the initial “sift” when it comes to preliminary screening of applicants.
Robots to help you settle into the job
After making the grade, another machine-learning-driven initiative is helping new employees get started in their new roles – adapting to the day-to-day routines as well as the corporate culture at the business.
Unabot is a natural language processing (NLP) bot built on Microsoft’s Bot framework, designed to understand what employees need to know and fetch information for them when it is asked.
“We joke about the fact we don’t know whether it’s a man or a woman – it’s Unabot,” Nair tells me.
“Unabot doesn’t only answer HR questions, questions about anything that affects employees should be answered by Unabot, and it is now the front face for any employee question – they might ask it about IT systems, or about their allowances – so we are learning about what matters to employees in real time.”
Through interacting with employees, Unabot has learned to answer questions such as where parking is available, the timing of shuttle buses, and when annual salary reviews are due to take place.
Unlike, for example, Alexa or consumer-facing, customer-service corporate chatbots, Unabot must also be able to filter and apply information based on who it is speaking to. It is capable of differentiating the information it passes on based on both the user's geographical location and their level of seniority within the company.
Unabot was first rolled out for employees based in the Philippines and is now operating in 36 countries. It has been selected as the next AI initiative that will be rolled out globally in all of Unilever’s 190 markets.
“It’s a new way of working,” Nair tells me, “We never go in and say it's perfect so let’s roll it out in all countries,’ we learn what we can in one country and roll it out in the next one.”
Currently, all of its data comes from internal sources, such as company guidelines, schedules, policy documents and questions asked by the employees themselves. In the future, this could be expanded to include external data such as learning materials.
And although it’s early days, the initial analysis seems to show that the initiative is popular with staff – with 36% of those in areas where it is deployed having used it at least once, and around 80% going on to use it again.
One lesson learned early on was that the importance of providing a frictionless experience.
“So we’ve learned that you have to make anything that interacts with employees or consumers effortless,” Nair says.
“People interact in different ways – a policy document is written in a particular way, its three or four pages of what an employee shouldn’t do. But an employee tends to ask questions in very simplistic ways – how does this impact my life, where will I find this, what can I do?”
Machine learning – particularly NLP – can overcome this due to its ability to detect which questions are repeatedly asked, even if they are asked in different ways, and present the right information.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dec 12, 2018, 11:00 AM ESTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeThe rate of progress in the field of artificial intelligence is one of the most hotly contested aspects of the ongoing boom in teaching computers and robots how to see the world, make sense of it, and eventually perform complex tasks both in the physical realm and the virtual one. And just how fast the industry is moving, and to what end, is typically measured not just by actual product advancements and research milestones, but also by the prognostications and voiced concerns of AI leaders, futurists, academics, economists, and policymakers. AI is going to change the world — but how and when are still open questions. Today, findings from a group of experts were published in an ongoing effort to help answer those questions. The experts include members of Harvard, MIT, Stanford, the nonprofit OpenAI, and the Partnership on AI industry consortium, among others, and they were put together as part of the second annual AI Index. The goal is to measure the field’s progress using hard data and to try and make sense of that progress as it relates to thorny subjects like workplace automation and the overarching quest for artificial general intelligence, or the type of intelligence that could let a machine perform any task a human could. AI will change the world, but researchers are still trying to figure out how and whenThe first report, published last December, found that investment and work in AI was accelerated at an unprecedented rate and that, while progress in certain fields like limited game-playing and vision has been extraordinary, AI remains far behind in general intelligence tasks that would result in, say, total automation of more than a limited variety of jobs. Still, the report was lacking in what the authors call a “global perspective,” and this second edition set out to answer many of the same questions with new, more granular data and a more international scope. “There is no AI story without global perspective. The 2017 report was heavily skewed towards North American activities. This reflected a limited number of global partnerships, not an intrinsic bias,” reads the 2018 report’s introduction. “This year, we begin to close the global gap. We recognize that there is a long journey ahead — one that involves collaboration and outside participation — to make this report truly comprehensive.” In that spirit of global analysis, the second AI Index report finds that commercial and research work in AI, as well as funding, is exploding pretty much everywhere on the planet. There’s an especially high concentration in Europe and Asia, with China, Japan, and South Korea leading Eastern countries in AI research paper publication, university enrollment, and patent applications. In fact, Europe is the largest publisher of AI papers, with 28 percent of all AI-related publications last year. China is close behind with 25 percent, while North America is responsible for 17 percent.  Image: AI Index Report 2018When it comes to the type of AI activity, the report finds that machine learning and so-called probabilistic reasoning — or the type of cognition-related performance that lets a game-playing AI outsmart a human opponent — is far and away the leading research category by a number of published papers. Not far behind, however, is work on computer vision, which is the foundational sub-discipline of AI that’s helping to develop self-driving cars and power augmented reality and object recognition, and neural networks, which, like machine learning, are instrumental in training those algorithms to improve over time. Less important, at least in the current moment, are areas like natural language processing, which is what lets your smart speaker understand what you’re saying and respond in kind, and general planning and decision making, which is what will be required of robots when automated machines are inevitably more integral facets of daily life.  Image: AI Index Report 2018A fascinating element of the report is how research in those categories breaks down by global region. China is heavily focused on agricultural science, engineering, and technology, while Europe and North America are focused more on the humanities and medical and health sciences, though Europe is generally more well-rounded in its approach to research. Some other interesting tidbits from the report include US AI research papers, which, despite being lower in volume, outpace China and Europe in citations. Government-related organizations and research outfits also account for far more papers in China and Europe than corporations or the medical field, while the US’s AI research efforts are largely dominated by corporate efforts, which makes sense given the immense investment in the field from Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.  Image: AI Index Report 2018As far as performance goes, AI continues to skyrocket, especially in fields like computer vision. By measuring benchmark performance for the widely used image training database ImageNet, the report finds that the time it takes to spin up a model that can classify pictures at state-of-the-art accuracy fell “from around on hour to around 4 minutes” in just 18 months. That equates to a roughly 16x jump in training speed. Other areas like object segmentation, which is what lets software differentiate between an image’s background and its subject, has increased in precision by 72 percent in just three years.  Image: AI Index Report 2018For areas like machine translation and parsing, which is what lets software understand syntactic structures and more easily answer questions, accuracy and proficiency is getting more and more refined, but with diminishing returns as algorithms get ever closer human-level understanding of language. In a separate “human-level milestones” section, the report breaks down some big 2018 milestones in fields like game-playing and medical diagnostics where progress is accelerating at surprising rates. Those include progress from Google-owned DeepMind in playing the classic first-person shooter Quake in objective-oriented game modes like capture the flag, as well as landmark performances against amateur and then former professional players of the online battle arena game Dota 2.  Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeAll of this hard data is fantastic in understanding where the AI field stands right now and how it’s been growing over the years and is projected to grow in the future. Yet, we’re still stuck in murky territory when it comes to harder questions around automation and the ways that AI could be implemented in areas like criminal justice, border patrol screenings, warfare, and other areas where performance is less important than the underlying governmental policy at play. AI will only continue to get more sophisticated, but there are a number of hurdles, both technological and with regard to bias and safety, before such software could be reliably used without error in hospitals, education systems, airports, and police departments. Unfortunately, that hasn't stopped corporations and governments from continuing to plow forward in deploying AI in the real world. This year, we discovered that Amazon was selling its Recognition facial recognition software to law enforcement, while Google found itself embroiled in controversy after it was discovered it was contributing computer vision expertise to a Department of Defense drone program known as Project Maven. AI is increasingly being put to work by governments in situations that are ripe for abuseGoogle said it would pull out of the project once its contract expired, and it also published a wide-ranging set of AI ethics principles that included a pledge never to develop AI weaponry surveillance systems or to contribute to any project that violated “widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.” But it’s clear that the leaders of Silicon Valley see AI as a prime business opportunity and such projects and contracts as the financial reward for participating in the AI research arms race. Elsewhere in the world, AI is helping governments pioneer systems of surveillance and law enforcement that constantly track citizens as they move about society. According to The New York Times, China is using millions of cameras and AI-assisted technologies like facial recognition to create the world’s most comprehensive surveillance system for its nearly 1.4 billion-person populace. Such a system is expected to link with the country’s new social credit system for scoring citizens and stratifying society into layers of access and privilege based on education, financial background, and other metrics, all of which will be informed by a day-to-day data collection and analysis of people’s real-world and online behaviors.  Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeWith automation, we’ve come to an understanding that mass unemployment isn’t coming anytime soon, and the bigger concern is whether we as a society are prepared for the nature of work to transition toward less stable, lower-paid jobs without safety nets like health insurance. Not everyone is going to lose their job right away. Rather, certain jobs will be eliminated over time, while others will become semi-automated. And some jobs will always require a human being. The fate of workers will depend on certain employer constraints, labor laws and regulations, and whether there’s a good enough system in place to transition people into new roles or industries. For instance, a McKinsey Global Institute report from November of last year found that 800 million jobs could be lost to worldwide automation by 2030, but only about 6 percent of all jobs are at risk of complete automation. How that process of moving from a human-only job to an AI- or robot-assisted one is developed could mean the difference between a full-blown crisis and a historical paradigm shift. Automation won’t eliminate every job, but it will complicate the nature of workA paper from US think tank, the Center for Global Development, that was published back in July centered on the potential effects of AI and robotic automation on global labor markets. Researchers found that there is not nearly enough work being done to prepare for the overall automation fallout, and we’re spending too much time debating the general ethics and viability of complete automation in a narrow set of markets. “Questions like profitability, labor regulations, unionization, and corporate-social expectations will be at least as important as technical constraints in determining which jobs get automated,” the paper concluded. Not everything is all doom and gloom. Part of the philosophy behind the AI Index report is about asking the right questions and making sure that the people making policy, the public, and the leaders of the AI industry have data to make informed decisions. It may be too early to reliably measure the impact of AI on society — the industry is only just getting started — but preparing ourselves for what it all means and how it will affect daily life, work, and public institutions like health care, education, and law enforcement is perhaps just as important as the research and product development itself. Only by investing in both can we avoid the risk of creating technologies that change the world for the worse.

And just how fast the industry is moving, and to what end, is typically measured not just by actual product advancements and research milestones, but also by the prognostications and voiced concerns of AI leaders, futurists, academics, economists, and policymakers. AI is going to change the world — but how and when are still open questions. 

Today, findings from a group of experts were published in an ongoing effort to help answer those questions. The experts include members of Harvard, MIT, Stanford, the nonprofit OpenAI, and the Partnership on AI industry consortium, among others, and they were put together as part of the second annual AI Index. The goal is to measure the field’s progress using hard data and to try and make sense of that progress as it relates to thorny subjects like workplace automation and the overarching quest for artificial general intelligence, or the type of intelligence that could let a machine perform any task a human could. 

""AI will change the world, but researchers are still trying to figure out how and when""

The first report, published last December, found that investment and work in AI was accelerated at an unprecedented rate and that, while progress in certain fields like limited game-playing and vision has been extraordinary, AI remains far behind in general intelligence tasks that would result in, say, total automation of more than a limited variety of jobs. Still, the report was lacking in what the authors call a “global perspective,” and this second edition set out to answer many of the same questions with new, more granular data and a more international scope. 

“There is no AI story without global perspective. The 2017 report was heavily skewed towards North American activities. This reflected a limited number of global partnerships, not an intrinsic bias,” reads the 2018 report’s introduction. “This year, we begin to close the global gap. We recognize that there is a long journey ahead — one that involves collaboration and outside participation — to make this report truly comprehensive.” 

In that spirit of global analysis, the second AI Index report finds that commercial and research work in AI, as well as funding, is exploding pretty much everywhere on the planet. There’s an especially high concentration in Europe and Asia, with China, Japan, and South Korea leading Eastern countries in AI research paper publication, university enrollment, and patent applications. In fact, Europe is the largest publisher of AI papers, with 28 percent of all AI-related publications last year. China is close behind with 25 percent, while North America is responsible for 17 percent.

When it comes to the type of AI activity, the report finds that machine learning and so-called probabilistic reasoning — or the type of cognition-related performance that lets a game-playing AI outsmart a human opponent — is far and away the leading research category by a number of published papers. 

Not far behind, however, is work on computer vision, which is the foundational sub-discipline of AI that’s helping to develop self-driving cars and power augmented reality and object recognition, and neural networks, which, like machine learning, are instrumental in training those algorithms to improve over time. Less important, at least in the current moment, are areas like natural language processing, which is what lets your smart speaker understand what you’re saying and respond in kind, and general planning and decision making, which is what will be required of robots when automated machines are inevitably more integral facets of daily life.

A fascinating element of the report is how research in those categories breaks down by global region. China is heavily focused on agricultural science, engineering, and technology, while Europe and North America are focused more on the humanities and medical and health sciences, though Europe is generally more well-rounded in its approach to research. 

Some other interesting tidbits from the report include US AI research papers, which, despite being lower in volume, outpace China and Europe in citations. Government-related organizations and research outfits also account for far more papers in China and Europe than corporations or the medical field, while the US’s AI research efforts are largely dominated by corporate efforts, which makes sense given the immense investment in the field from Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.

As far as performance goes, AI continues to skyrocket, especially in fields like computer vision. By measuring benchmark performance for the widely used image training database ImageNet, the report finds that the time it takes to spin up a model that can classify pictures at state-of-the-art accuracy fell “from around on hour to around 4 minutes” in just 18 months. That equates to a roughly 16x jump in training speed. Other areas like object segmentation, which is what lets software differentiate between an image’s background and its subject, has increased in precision by 72 percent in just three years.

For areas like machine translation and parsing, which is what lets software understand syntactic structures and more easily answer questions, accuracy and proficiency is getting more and more refined, but with diminishing returns as algorithms get ever closer human-level understanding of language. 

In a separate “human-level milestones” section, the report breaks down some big 2018 milestones in fields like game-playing and medical diagnostics where progress is accelerating at surprising rates. Those include progress from Google-owned DeepMind in playing the classic first-person shooter Quake in objective-oriented game modes like capture the flag, as well as landmark performances against amateur and then former professional players of the online battle arena game Dota 2.

All of this hard data is fantastic in understanding where the AI field stands right now and how it’s been growing over the years and is projected to grow in the future. Yet, we’re still stuck in murky territory when it comes to harder questions around automation and the ways that AI could be implemented in areas like criminal justice, border patrol screenings, warfare, and other areas where performance is less important than the underlying governmental policy at play. AI will only continue to get more sophisticated, but there are a number of hurdles, both technological and with regard to bias and safety, before such software could be reliably used without error in hospitals, education systems, airports, and police departments. 

Unfortunately, that hasn't stopped corporations and governments from continuing to plow forward in deploying AI in the real world. This year, we discovered that Amazon was selling its Recognition facial recognition software to law enforcement, while Google found itself embroiled in controversy after it was discovered it was contributing computer vision expertise to a Department of Defense drone program known as Project Maven. 

""AI is increasingly being put to work by governments in situations that are ripe for abuse""

Google said it would pull out of the project once its contract expired, and it also published a wide-ranging set of AI ethics principles that included a pledge never to develop AI weaponry surveillance systems or to contribute to any project that violated “widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.” But it’s clear that the leaders of Silicon Valley see AI as a prime business opportunity and such projects and contracts as the financial reward for participating in the AI research arms race. 

Elsewhere in the world, AI is helping governments pioneer systems of surveillance and law enforcement that constantly track citizens as they move about society. According to The New York Times, China is using millions of cameras and AI-assisted technologies like facial recognition to create the world’s most comprehensive surveillance system for its nearly 1.4 billion-person populace. Such a system is expected to link with the country’s new social credit system for scoring citizens and stratifying society into layers of access and privilege based on education, financial background, and other metrics, all of which will be informed by a day-to-day data collection and analysis of people’s real-world and online behaviors.

With automation, we’ve come to an understanding that mass unemployment isn’t coming anytime soon, and the bigger concern is whether we as a society are prepared for the nature of work to transition toward less stable, lower-paid jobs without safety nets like health insurance. 

Not everyone is going to lose their job right away. Rather, certain jobs will be eliminated over time, while others will become semi-automated. And some jobs will always require a human being. The fate of workers will depend on certain employer constraints, labor laws and regulations, and whether there’s a good enough system in place to transition people into new roles or industries. For instance, a McKinsey Global Institute report from November of last year found that 800 million jobs could be lost to worldwide automation by 2030, but only about 6 percent of all jobs are at risk of complete automation. How that process of moving from a human-only job to an AI- or robot-assisted one is developed could mean the difference between a full-blown crisis and a historical paradigm shift. 

""Automation won’t eliminate every job, but it will complicate the nature of work""

A paper from US think tank, the Center for Global Development, that was published back in July centered on the potential effects of AI and robotic automation on global labor markets. Researchers found that there is not nearly enough work being done to prepare for the overall automation fallout, and we’re spending too much time debating the general ethics and viability of complete automation in a narrow set of markets. “Questions like profitability, labor regulations, unionization, and corporate-social expectations will be at least as important as technical constraints in determining which jobs get automated,” the paper concluded. 

Not everything is all doom and gloom. Part of the philosophy behind the AI Index report is about asking the right questions and making sure that the people making policy, the public, and the leaders of the AI industry have data to make informed decisions. It may be too early to reliably measure the impact of AI on society — the industry is only just getting started — but preparing ourselves for what it all means and how it will affect daily life, work, and public institutions like health care, education, and law enforcement is perhaps just as important as the research and product development itself. Only by investing in both can we avoid the risk of creating technologies that change the world for the worse.

Stuck at traffic lights that never seem to change to green. Sitting in queues of cars that stretch on for miles or delayed by a glut of slow traffic that suddenly disappears. Traffic jams are a blight on our modern, fast moving lives. And we have been dealing with them in a very unmodern way.We don’t move about and travel in the same way that we used to, yet our traffic management systems have struggled to keep pace with the relentless onslaught of vehicles they have to deal with now. Jam-busting measures are often slow to react to changes in road or weather conditions and many traffic lights still work on timers that are often out of synchronisation, preventing vehicles from flowing freely.You might also like: • The chef making 120 burgers every hour • The aircraft designer who’s never flown • What single word defines who you are?In 2015 there were an estimated 1.3 billion motor vehicles on the world’s roads and with growing affluence in developing economies that number is expected to soar to over 2 billion by 2040. Even with new roads and bypasses, this ever increasing level of traffic could quickly outstrip the ability of our road networks to cope in many busy areas, such as cities.But by combining new communications technology with the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to crunch vast amounts of data in real time it may be possible to ease our clogged roads so they can cope with the growing number of cars.While many see self-driving vehicles as the panacea for traffic jams, it will be at least two decades before they start to make a meaningful impact on our roadsWhile many see self-driving vehicles as the panacea for traffic jams – provided these robotic vehicles can be taught to drive less erratically and react faster than human motorists – it will be at least two decades before they start to make a meaningful impact on our roads. In the meantime, highways agencies and city planners will have to cope with an ever-more complicated mix of human, semi-autonomous and autonomous drivers on the roads. Keeping them all moving will require traffic management systems to be instantly reactive and adaptable.Getty ImagesThere are hopes that new technology can ease traffic jams in already congested cities like Bengaluru, India, where vehicles often move at a walking pace (Credit: Getty Images)In Bengaluru, India, which regularly faces long traffic jams and the average speed on some roads at peak hours is just 4km/h (2.5mph),  Siemens Mobility has built a prototype monitoring system that that uses AI through traffic cameras. Traffic cameras automatically detect vehicles and this information is sent back to a central control centre where algorithms estimate the density of traffic on the road. The system then alters the traffic lights based on real-time road congestions.To respond in this way, however, requires data. A lot of data. Fortunately, this is not something in short supply. There’s lots of information from traffic monitoring systems, road infrastructure, cars and drivers themselves via their mobile phones. Millions of cameras line our roads while the passing vehicles induces tiny electrical currents in loops of metal hidden beneath the tarmac, providing further information about the traffic conditions. Motorists can send instant updates about hold ups thanks to the navigation software they use on their mobile phones and in their cars.Some of this monitoring technology – like the induction loops – have been around since the 1960s while others like cameras capable of tracking traffic and reading number plates are more recent. The challenge is doing something useful with all this information.“Since Isaac Newton we have been trying to influence the world by building mathematical models,” says Gabor Orosz, an associate professor in engineering  at the University of Michigan. “If we have data we can figure things out. The same applies to traffic.”There are now attempts to harness AI’s ability to make sense of large amounts of information and change the way that we move around our cities.Researchers at The Alan Turing Institute in London and the Toyota Mobility Foundation recently launched a new project together that is exploring how traffic management systems can become more dynamic and responsive through the use of AI. They are currently using simulations that scale up in complexity and evolve, helping their algorithms to learn how to predict changes in the traffic. Although they are still testing the system, they hope to soon apply their systems in the real world.Getty ImagesModern traffic management systems often use a combination of cameras and sensors in the road itself to assess the density of vehicles (Credit: Getty Images)“With deep machine learning we can improve predictability,” says William Chernicoff, head of research and innovation at the Toyota Mobility Foundation. “Metropolitan mobility managers can then make faster and more informed decisions on signal timing, suggested routing to system users, and capacity allocation.”Journey times in the city have fallen by 25% while vehicle emissions have dropped by up to 20%In Pittsburgh researchers are already working with city managers on a similar approach that has been operating in the city since 2012. An adaptive traffic control system developed by researchers at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, has been rolled out around the city by a company called Rapid Flow Tech. Their Surtrac technology is being used at 50 intersections in Pittsburgh and since launching, it has reduced wait times at intersections by up to 40%, according to the company. It also claims that journey times in the city have fallen by 25% while vehicle emissions have dropped by up to 20%.The system uses video feeds to automatically detect the number of road users, including pedestrians, and types of vehicles that are at an intersection. The AI software then processes this information second by second to come up with the best way to move traffic through the intersection, changing traffic lights depending on the most optimal way of keeping traffic moving. Decisions can be made autonomously, and shared with neighbouring intersections to help them understand what is coming their way.As vehicles become more connected with the help of mobile phone and other wireless technology, they too will help to feed even more information into systems like this. In the future, according to Griffin Schultz of Rapid Flow, connected vehicles will be able to communicate information about their speed, driver behaviour and even potential faults to the surrounding infrastructure.“At the moment we are just learning, but in the future this will be all pervasive,” he says. “It’s not just about cars, but will help all types of road users in a multimodal transportation society.”Getty ImagesBeing stuck in frustrating queues on busy roads can eat up many hours of motorists' day, reducing the time they have to do something more productive (Credit: Getty Images)Elsewhere, intelligent infrastructure is helping transport networks to become more connected. Siemens Mobility are working with cities and municipalities around the world to identify patterns of movement in an attempt to identify ways of improving experience for everyone on the road.“There are real world projects around the globe and the applications are continuously expanding,” says Markus Schlitt, head of intelligent traffic systems at the company.“In future cities, traffic will be so complex that without artificial Intelligence (AI) it will be virtual gridlock,” says Schlitt. “By utilising the data, we’re able identify patterns that would not have been seen without AI. Through continuous learning, we’re able to constantly update the traffic patterns and thus traffic flow. This results in less waiting time and fewer emissions.”In Hagen, Germany, they are using artificial intelligence to optimise traffic light control and reduce the waiting time at an intersection. Simulations suggest it can decrease waiting times at lights by up to 47% compared to a traditional pre-timed signal plan.But it’s not just motorists that are benefiting from the use of AI. Siemens Mobility are operating a fleet of 1,400 electric bikes in Lisbon, Portugal,, using machine learning to analyse various data sources like the weather to predict the future demand at each of the 140 bike-sharing stations. This allows them to ensure the availability of bikes and spaces in charging docks for those returning bikes. The predictions are used along with recent traffic information to help bike collection teams restock docking stations and provide optimal routing for service technicians who maintain the bikes.“This not only reduces operational running costs, it also increases the end-customers’ user experience,” says Schlitt. “So when you need to get around in Lisbon, you can be sure that there is always an e-bike available for you at the stations.”Siemens MobilityKeeping track of electric bikes as people move them around a city is a mind boggling task for a human but relatively easy for a computer (Credit: Siemens Mobility)As brilliant as the technology is, we can’t rely on it solely. Mischa Dohler, from the department of informatics at King’s College London and co-founder of traffic monitoring technology company Worldsensing, has been trialling AI and machine learning in Bogota, Colombia. He says the technology has already produced great results, by using road signals and signs to reroute traffic when there is an accident, reduce traffic jams, and lessen the time motorists spend seeking parking spaces.But he says that while AI is helping to make this sort adaptive transport network possible, the human element is important too. He calls this “explainable AI planning”. It is “so important because it takes intelligent decisions autonomously but is also understandable”, allowing humans to take decisions alongside the AI or adapt if something goes wrong. As well as being intellectually and technically capable, motorists themselves will have to be open to the idea of their traffic systems being controlled by computers.“When cities rely on algorithms to enact policy, that policy becomes obfuscated by computation,” says Jed Carter, editor of online technology magazine Moving World. “It becomes even harder for citizens to understand why they’ve been re-routed, photographed or detained when the reasons for those actions are buried in computer code.”But deploying smart technologies onto the roads will do more than simply prevent traffic jams. Mark Nicholson, from Vivacity Labs, who ran a UK Government backed project deploying intelligent traffic light signals in Milton Keynes, England, says that newer technologies have a lot of other benefits. Cost is one – as technology takes over more of the heavy lifting of traffic management, it will require less human intervention on mundane tasks like watching traffic cameras.Automated systems are also getting better at differentiating between large numbers of road users, so can prioritise cyclists, buses or emergency vehicles for example, which can improve safetyAutomated systems are also getting better at differentiating between large numbers of road users, so can prioritise cyclists, buses or emergency vehicles for example, which can improve safety. Keeping traffic flowing can also reduce energy consumption caused by idling vehicles when stationary and improves air quality. It can help to cut engine emissions and so help to reduce impacts on the environment. It can make parking easier and frees up time for motorists to be more productive.   Vivacity LabsSmart cameras at junctions can automatically identify different road users, allowing the traffic management system to adapt according to their needs (Credit: Vivacity Labs)“We want to automate and let the humans focus on what is important or more long term,” says Nicholson. “(Things) like choosing whether air quality is poor enough to prioritise HGVs to make sure they don’t need to stop next to a school, planning where to put a new bypass, as well as immediate issues such as choosing how to reroute traffic around a crash.”Nicholson says that the real benefit of technology is the way that it frees up humans to do important higher level work. By automating the tedious, time consuming day-to-day running of the transport networks means humans working alongside the machines can focus on what they are best at – adapting to situations that require adaptive thinking and creative solutions.The results from the Milton Keynes project are promising. City-wide intelligent cameras capable of identifying and classifying all vehicles and road users allowed for accurate, highly localised data around the city, giving planners and authorities insight into where and when roads get busy, the expected routes that motorists might take, and where parking spaces are likely to be available. Vivacity installed 411 of its smart traffic cameras at the major junctions in Milton Keynes, totalling 104 junctions and 812 carriageways. As well as counting and classifying road users, the sensors can measure time it takes for vehicles to travel between junctions and provide live photos to help with the development of future planning.Vivacity feed the data into a machine learning model that learns typical daily patterns and combines this with how the traffic responds to transient changes in the road network. It evolves and adapts over time, improving its predictive power and minimising the amount of human intervention required. It provides historical and live data, and predicts traffic flows for the day.The system is already predicting traffic conditions 15 minutes in advance with 89% accuracy compared to what happens in realityThe system is already predicting traffic conditions 15 minutes in advance with 89% accuracy compared to what happens in reality.""It is not only helping citizens see parking space availability in real time today, but also lays the foundations for future connected & autonomous transport technologies in Milton Keynes,” says Nicholson.What seems to be clear is that giving AI the green light on our roads could keep us all moving forward. “This is just the beginning – we haven’t even fully harnessed the capabilities and benefits of AI,” adds Markus Schlitt, from Seimens Mobility.Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

And, with artificial intelligence changing the way we program software, we can solve for this last mile of enterprise automation we hadn’t been able to figure out over the past 30 years. As AI projects roll out over the next few years, we will need to rethink the definition of the work that people will do. And in the post-AI era the future of work will become one of the largest agenda items for policy makers, corporate executives and social economists.  Despite the strong and inherently negative narrative around the impact on jobs, the bulk of the impact from the automation of work through AI will result in a “displacement” of work not a “replacement” of work – it’s easy to see how the abacus-to-calculator-to-Excel phenomenon created completely new work around financial planning and reporting, and enterprise performance management. Similarly, AI will end up accelerating the future of work and resulting displacement of jobs will be a transition already in place, not an entirely new discussion. As some work gets automated other jobs will get created, in particular ones that require creativity, compassion and generalized thinking.      A NAO humanoid robot, developed by Softbank Corp. Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/BloombergKrisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg   Shifting away from the larger impact of AI on jobs, and zooming in a little closer to getting AI operationalized, it’s clear people will be needed in many different ways to make AI work. From my observations across dozens of AI rollouts, here are seven areas where human knowledge and expertise will be a critical requirement in AI projects.1. Being an ethical compassFirst and foremost, selecting the right AI applications is one the most important decisions that people can make. Are we using AI for the right reasons – to help people with special needs by enhancing eyesight, to provide translation in hearing aids for better communications across cultures, to increase diversity in the hiring process? Or, are we using it for the wrong applications – from influencing elections to guiding the criminal justice system? People provide the ethical compass needed to determine AI’s use cases.2. Bringing contextWe need people in the loop to orient AI towards the right goals. This happens already with supervised learning, where people label the datasets in advance before running AI algorithms. But even in unsupervised or reinforced learning, people need to ensure the algorithm is leading to results that matter for the business, for instance, in pharmacovigilance, when prioritizing between life-threatening and benign secondary effects of taking medicine. In addition, we need people to contextualize AI’s results. For example, an AI algorithm predicting failure from sensors on aircraft engine parts will not know to interpret the data differently if the aircraft is flying over the Sahara versus the North Pole. People must feed this context into the algorithm; otherwise predictions can be off. It is more powerful to combine a moderately strong AI algorithm with human domain expertise than to use the most powerful deep learning model without any such context.3. Providing governance In a digital workforce, planning should take into account the inputs, outputs, and various exchanges involved with every process. We cannot just toss a robot into the mix and let it do its own thing. For instance, a minor change to a webform can throw off robot process automation working elsewhere. Mapping out how machines and other systems will work together can prevent potential hiccups and obstacles. When managers only have to oversee people, they can easily see when an employee clocks in, clocks out, or physically does not show up for work at all. Since AI is virtual, it becomes harder to tell whether or not a robot is working. For instance, if there is a random password change that blocks a bot from logging in, then not only does the work stop, but we may not notice it until hours or even weeks later. In a hybrid workforce, we should be able to easily see if and how AI is working, just as much as human employees. People drive governance.4. Handling complexityThe new man-meets-machine dynamic will make current jobs easier to do, but the focus of people will shift to higher value and more complex jobs. With AI taking over some tasks, employees are then free to look at bigger issues and concerns. Take banking for example. Chatbots in the world of finance can now handle more routine issues such as payment status, allowing human agents to dedicate their time to more complicated, customer cases, such as identifying the root cause of payment delays. This evolution towards more complex work is not new; when spreadsheets were invented, the financial analyst’s role went from reporting to planning. 5. Preventing bias As mentioned in another column, the two big reasons for AI bias are the lack of diversity in data samples and rushed or incomplete training algorithms. In both cases, people with domain knowledge are key. Industry or process experts can help think through potential biases, train the models accordingly, and govern over the machines to see that they don’t fall out of line. Diversity in the teams working with AI can also address training bias. When we only have a select few working on a system, it becomes skewed to the thinking of a small group of individuals. By bringing in a team with different skills and approaches, we can have a more holistic, ethical design and come up with new angles.6. Managing change Managing this next-gen, hybrid workforce is very different from just managing people. We have to think about how we deal with the change, make sure robots are holding up their end, and see that employees have the right skills to work with their new AI coworkers. Putting seasoned employees alongside machines is a dramatic change – which is putting it lightly. AI design is moving from “humans in the loop” to “computers in the group.” Sometimes we forget to consider change management because we are eager to get AI going and start seeing some results. This actually does more harm than good, creating problems later down the line, due to rushed projects and negative thinking from employees. Any project has to start with a clear change management plan to prevent problems from both people and technology.7. Connecting creativity and compassionWhen Apple introduced the iPhone, we had no idea what new jobs it would create. Following the introduction of the iPhone, we came up with an entirely new creative industry of applications, ecommerce, ride sharing, wearables, online communities, video gaming, all invented by people who saw the potential of this new technology and applied their creativity to it. Just like creativity boomed after the iPhone’s launch, new creative applications will emerge from AI. We don’t know what they are yet, though people will drive that future. Much has been written about AI’s ability to create: art, poetry, and music are some recent and prominent examples.AI can help enhance creativity, though humans bring the compassion that goes hand in hand here. Kai Fu Lee, in his latest Ted Talk, explains how humans can thrive in the age of AI by harnessing compassion and creativity.Get ready for the hybrid workforcePeople who can translate their knowledge to these seven areas will be more important than ever. There is a great opportunity now to reskill employees on how to apply their experience in meaningful ways, and create greater talent. At the same time, recruiting programs should look for “bilingual” people, meaning those who already have both domain and digital knowledge, and can walk in, make those connections, and do the job.In the future workforce, people and machines will be equally important, combining industry knowledge with AI and automation. We have to start thinking more about how to manage this combination and make sure there are well-thought plans, structures, and education in place. Then, we can really consider ourselves ready to work alongside AI.       Sanjay Srivastava   Chief digital officer, Genpact     This article originally appeared in Digital Insurance.

He said he is optimistic about the technology's long-term benefits, but his assessment of the potential risks of AI parallels some tech critics, who contend the technology could be used to empower invasive surveillance, deadly weaponry and the spread of misinformation. Other tech executives, like SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, have offered more dire predictions that AI could prove to be “far more dangerous than nukes.” AdvertisementGoogle’s AI technology underpins everything from the company’s controversial China project to the surfacing of hateful, conspiratorial videos on its YouTube subsidiary — a problem Pichai promised to address in the coming year. How Google decides to deploy its AI has also sparked recent employee unrest.💻Follow TechnologyFollowPichai’s call for self-regulation followed his testimony in Congress, where lawmakers threatened to impose limits on technology in response to its misuse, including as a conduit for spreading misinformation and hate speech. His acknowledgment about the potential threats posed by AI was a critical assertion because the Indian-born engineer often has touted the world-shaping implications of automated systems that could learn and make decisions without human control.Two years after #Pizzagate showed the dangers of hateful conspiracies, they’re still rampant on YouTubePichai said in the interview that lawmakers around the world are still trying to grasp AI’s effects and the potential need for government regulation. “Sometimes I worry people underestimate the scale of change that’s possible in the mid- to long term, and I think the questions are actually pretty complex,” he said. Other tech giants, including Microsoft, recently have embraced regulation of AI — both by the companies that create the technology and the governments that oversee its use.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut AI, if handled properly, could have “tremendous benefits,” Pichai explained, including helping doctors detect eye disease and other ailments through automated scans of health data. “Regulating a technology in its early days is hard, but I do think companies should self-regulate,” he said. “This is why we've tried hard to articulate a set of AI principles. We may not have gotten everything right, but we thought it was important to start a conversation.” Pichai, who joined Google in 2004 and became chief executive 11 years later, in January called AI “one of the most important things that humanity is working on” and said it could prove to be “more profound” for human society than “electricity or fire.” But the race to perfect machines that can operate on their own has rekindled familiar fears that Silicon Valley’s corporate ethos — “move fast and break things,” as Facebook once put it — could result in powerful, imperfect technology eliminating jobs and harming people.Within Google, its AI efforts also have created controversy: The company faced heavy criticism earlier this year because of its work on a Defense Department contract involving AI that could automatically tag cars, buildings and other objects for use in military drones. Some employees resigned because of what they called Google’s profiting off the “business of war."" AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAsked about the employee backlash, Pichai told The Post that its workers were “an important part of our culture.” “They definitely have an input, and it’s an important input, it’s something I cherish,” he said.In June, after announcing Google wouldn’t renew the contract next year, Pichai unveiled a set of AI-ethics principles that included general bans on developing systems that could be used to cause harm, damage human rights or aid in “surveillance violating internationally accepted norms."" The company faced criticism for releasing AI tools that could be misused in the wrong hands. Google’s release in 2015 of its internal machine-learning software, TensorFlow, has helped accelerate the wide-scale development of AI, but it has also been used to automate the creation of lifelike fake videos that have been used for harassment and disinformation.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementGoogle and Pichai have defended the release by saying that keeping the technology restricted could lead to less public oversight and prevent developers and researchers from improving its capabilities in beneficial ways.“Over time, as you make progress, I think it’s important to have conversations around ethics [and] bias and make simultaneous progress,” Pichai said during his interview with The Post.“In some sense, you do want to develop ethical frameworks, engage non-computer scientists in the field early on,” he said. “You have to involve humanity in a more representative way because the technology is going to affect humanity.” Pichai likened the early work to set parameters around AI to the academic community’s efforts in the early days of genetics research. “Many biologists started drawing lines on where the technology should go,” he said. “There's been a lot of self-regulation by the academic community, which I think has been extraordinarily important.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai emerges ‘unscathed’ from the circus in WashingtonThe Google executive said it would be most essential in the development of autonomous weapons, an issue that’s rankled tech executives and employees. In July, thousands of tech workers representing companies including Google signed a pledge against developing AI tools that could be programmed to kill.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementPichai also said he found some hateful, conspiratorial YouTube videos described in a Post story Tuesday “abhorrent” and indicated that the company would work to improve its systems for detecting problematic content. The videos, which together had been watched millions of times on YouTube since appearing in April, discussed baseless allegations that Democrat Hillary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin had attacked, killed and drank the blood of a girl.Pichai said he had not seen the videos, which he was questioned about during the congressional hearing, and declined to say whether YouTube’s shortcomings in this area were a result of limits in the detection systems or in policies for evaluating whether a particular video should be removed. But he added, “You’ll see us in 2019 continue to do more here.” Pichai also portrayed Google’s efforts to develop a new product for the government-controlled Chinese Internet market as preliminary, declining to say what the product might be or when it would come to market — if ever.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementDubbed Project Dragonfly, the effort has caused backlash among employees and human rights activists who warn about the possibility of Google assisting government surveillance in a country that tolerates little political dissent. When asked whether it’s possible that Google might make a product that allows Chinese officials to know who searches for sensitive terms, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre, Pichai said it was too soon to make any such judgments.“It’s a hypothetical,” Pichai said. “We are so far away from being in that position.” Share24 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Machines that learn are reshaping lives and livelihoods. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the most important change force in modern society, but it remains common for high school graduates to know nothing about how it works, the opportunities it creates and what we need guard against. 

In May, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) launched the AI for K-12 Working Group (AI4K12) to define for artificial intelligence what students should know and be able to do.  The AI4K12 steering committee includes David Touretzky, Carnegie Mellon; Christina Gardner-McCune, University of Florida; Fred Martin, University of Massachusetts; and Deborah Seehorn, CSTA Curriculum Committee. 
With lots of input, the steering committee drafted five big ideas that every student should know. A summary of the report (available here) they will present at the AAAI conference in January follows. 
PROMOTED
Big Idea #1: Computers perceive the world using sensors. The ability of computers to “see” and “hear” well enough to be practically useful is one of the most significant achievements of AI. Students should understand that machine perception of spoken language or visual imagery requires extensive domain knowledge. Graduates should be able to identify and demonstrate the limitations of machine perception systems and use open machine learning tools to train perceptual classifiers.

Big Idea #2: Agents maintain models/representations of the world and use them for reasoning. Representation is one of the fundamental problems of intelligence, both natural and artificial. Students should understand the concept of a representation--the way a map represents a territory, or a diagram represents a board game. Students should further understand that computers construct representations using data, and these representations can be manipulated by applying reasoning algorithms that derive new information from what is already known. High school students should be able to make use of elementary data structures to program simple inference algorithms.
Big Idea #3: Computers can learn from data. Machine learning algorithms allow computers to create their own representations using training data that is either supplied by people or acquired by the machine itself. High school students should be able to train a network and code simple applications using open tools.

Big Idea #4: Making agents interact naturally with humans is a substantial challenge for AI developers. Understanding people is one of the hardest problems faced by intelligent agents. Inferring a person’s future intentions by observing their actions is challenging even for humans. Robots will need to acquire some of this skill if they are to be welcome in our lives. High school students should be able to construct context-free grammars to parse simple languages and use open tools to construct a chatbot. They should also be able to use sentiment analysis tools to extract emotional tone from text.
Big Idea #5: AI applications can impact society in both positive and negative ways. Students should be able to identify ways that AI is contributing to their lives. The societal impacts of AI involve two kinds of questions: what applications should AI be used for and what ethical criteria should AI systems be required to meet?
Students should understand that the ethical construction of AI systems that make decisions affecting people’s lives requires attention to the issues of transparency and fairness.  High school students should be able to evaluate new AI technologies and describe the ethical or societal impact questions raised by them. AI4K12 will be developing guidelines but not curriculum. They plan to curate online resources for educators.Tom Vander ArkFollowingFollowI am an advocate for better learning for everyone.

Introduction
A revolution is coming.
And none of us can stop or resist it. Like a nuclear Armageddon, it will sweep the length and breadth of entire industries; it will change the way we live and work, alter the current course of our existence, and usher in a new era—the fourth industrial revolution.
After steam, electricity, and computing, the age of deep digital transformation—fuelled by incredible advances in technology—is now upon us; we stand on the threshold of vast changes. These changes will be, in scope and scale, unlike anything humankind has experienced before.[2] And of the technologies that will materially impact our lives, artificial intelligence (AI) is a prime candidate.[3]
Currently, about 6.4bn sensors are connected to the internet; and there are about 4.6bn mobile users, 3.4bn internet users, and 2.3bn social medial users.[4] It is this exploding volume of data and the ability to harness them that is primarily driving AI research and development.
By themselves, the four major cloud-service provider (CSP): Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Google have more than $1 billion in investments and has over 200,000 servers in over a million square feet of space. And it is estimated that global spending on AI will grow 50 percent compounded annually and will reach $57.6 billion by 2021.
What really is “artificial intelligence”?
First, let me tell you what artificial intelligence (AI) is not.
It is not all about robots. Machine control (robotics and autonomous machines) is just one aspect of AI research. Other areas include machine learning (deep, supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement and large scale machine learning) and machine perception (computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, Internet of Things)[5]
Also, it is not our final invention—Terminator is a good, futuristic movie but smart robots won’t kill us all. Well, not probably.
Put simply, artificial intelligence is intelligence displayed by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.[6] In the words of John McCarthy—the man who coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’—AI is the “science and engineering of making intelligent machines”. The term is also used to denote machines that could use cognitive computing capabilities to mine data, decipher trends and pattern, and machines with the “ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experiences”[7]
In what was a giant step for computerkind and a depressing day for mankind, Deep Blue—a chess-playing AI that could scan 200 million positions per second and analyse 74 moves ahead—shocked the world when it made history by outmaneuvering Gary Kasparov, a chess world champion who, at 22, was eating other grandmasters for breakfast and who had never lost to a human opponent.
Fast forward two decades later and Alpha Zero—a machine that rediscovered thousands of years of human knowledge and highly strategic moves and then invented better moves of its own—was unveiled. By playing itself a million times over, the machine achieved a superhuman level in just hours. And what’s really shocking was the fact that the machine did all of this without human expertise, data, or knowledge!
In another ‘Man vs Machine battle’, the Case Cruncher Alpha beat its human counterparts in a competition where the legal AI was pitted against 100 commercial lawyers given factual scenarios of hundreds of cases and asked to predict the success of the claim. Case Cruncher achieved 86 percent accuracy and won by over 20 percent.
Right. There’s such thing as legal AI.
The world’s first AI lawyer, ROSS, reads through thousands of cases and delivers a ranked list of the most relevant ones, helps lawyers to analyze legal issues and make connections that would otherwise be invisible. It even writes legal memo like actual humans!
Clever software tools like Ravel Law and Lex Machina predict the attitude and workings of a judge, the usual moves of opposing counsel, and the possible outcomes of cases by using large volume of litigation information, court decisions, filing data, and legal processes.
Also, AI-powered platforms such as Kira Systems, helps analyze documents and uncover trends and patterns. A legal analytics firm, Premonition AI, provides information on the effectiveness of litigators before particular judges by mining what it claims is the biggest litigation database in the world. Seal Software can crawl through a network to discover, and then classify, all of a company’s existing contracts and KM Standards can “identify common clauses, agreement structure, standard clause language, and common clause alternatives” in a set of contracts. Indeed, there are now AI-powered programs that help judges review criminal records, help evaluate the gravity and frequency of offences, and assist in sentencing.
AI would anchor many areas of legal practice (souce: law)
For many reasons, interests in artificial intelligence have spiked, conversations are growing, and the impact of AI is being widely recognized, even in a heel-dragging, precedent-based profession like law.
Artificial Intelligence and Law: David and Goliath
Law is the only self-regulated profession on earth. It has not changed much since the industrial revolution.
It enjoys substantial immunity from outside challengers, particularly in comparison to other professions.[8] This immunity is safeguarded by the enactment of protectionist professional rules and guidelines which govern civility, ethics, and protect lawyers from overthrow.[9] But it appears very likely that law—though shielded by regulations and imbued in tradition—might not be able to withstand the sweeping influence of the digital revolution for long. “Carefully erected protections sheltering the legal profession from disruption is now being eroded”,[10] and the foundation of the monopoly over legal work and the ‘practice of law’ is beginning to crumble.
Traditionally and historically, only lawyers can legally engage in the practice of law. But things are beginning to change. In the landmark case of Lola v Skadden[11], the Court held that “tasks that could otherwise be performed entirely by a machine cannot be said to engage in the practice of law,” meaning that once some task can be entirely performed by a machine, that task can no longer be considered to be ‘the practice of law’. According to the Yale Journal of Law and Technology, “[t]he broader implications of this decision are threefold:

As machines evolve, they will encroach on and limit the tasks considered to be the “practice of law”;
Mechanistic tasks removed from the ‘practice of law’ may no longer be regulated by professional rules governing the legal field; and
To survive the rise of technology in the legal field, lawyers will need to adapt to a new ‘practice of law’ in which they will act as innovators, purveyors of judgment and wisdom, and guardians of fairness, impartiality, and accountability within the law.”[12]

Just as Salomon v Salomon[13] revolutionized corporate law, the decision in Lola v Skadden may soon spark a global trend. Predictions already abound. According to Deloitte, over 100,000 thousand jobs will be automated in the legal sector in the UK alone by 2025, and companies that fail to adopt AI are fated to be left behind. Law is no longer safe from AI. And a single rock from the agile and fluid AI’s sling may knock down the highly regulated, heavily armored, and greatly encumbered legal profession.
Analogically speaking, David may take out Goliath again.
The good news is: Some firms are already keeping up with the machines.
And why not? Machines work smarter, more efficiently, and more accurately than any human; they do ordinarily grueling and time-consuming tasks such as contract creation, management, and review in seconds; and they never get tired, never need caffeine to stay awake, and never ask for vacations!
Smart firms like Dentons are not simply trying to keep up, they are actually doing something. Apart from investing in legal technology startups, Dentons has also established an innovation and venture arm known as NextLaw Labs. According to the firm’s Chief Innovation Officer, “[our] industry is being disrupted, and we should do some of that [disruption] ourselves, not just be a victim of it.”[14] Also, law firms like Ashurst in Australia, Baker McKenzie in the United Kingdom are already incorporating AI into their services.[15]
The Future of Law Practice in Africa
While ‘AI’ remains a relatively unknown, and possibly even scary, term to many lawyers and professionals in Africa, it is comforting to know that some African firms like Bowmans, Webber Wentzel, and KTA Advocates have adopted AI to improve their legal services delivery.
Bowmans lead the way by some miles. In one of our correspondence, Celia Pienaar, the Legal Services Improvement Manager at Bowmans and Cathy Truter, Of Counsel and Project Head of AI implementation revealed to me that “Bowmans was one of the first firms to have adopted and rolled out an AI product in Africa, across six offices and four jurisdictions (Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda).” Sidestepping the hype around future use cases of AI, Bowmans focuses on real cases that would create immediate and tangible benefits. Commenting further, Celia said, “By streamlining the mundane, time-consuming tasks through the use of AI systems, [Bowmans] is able to free up [their] lawyers’ time to focus on high level tasks.” This is some serious pacesetting.
We now have, also, companies dedicated to advancing legal technologies. In 2016, Nigeria’s foremost legal technologies company, LawPavilion, launched LawPavilionPrime. The first of its kind in Africa, the AI “gives in-depth analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of legal positions and authorities by generating a never-before-seen statistical analysis, historical data, precedential value ratings, conflicting judgments, locus classicus, statutory or literary authorities and opinions.”[16] And now, the company has unveiled TIMI, Nigeria’s first artificial intelligence legal assistant. Apart from assisting lawyers with legal research, litigation, and opinion drafting, TIMI also provides notes with legal authorities and gives a step-by-step guide on drafting and filing court processes.
“In the past, the legal field has had time to carefully consider its adoption of technological innovations. This is no longer the case.”[17] “The time is rapidly approaching when many lawyers, professors, judges, managing partners, and other legal professionals will regret that they did not act before technology caught up, and surpassed, the legal profession”[18]
Are there limits to what these machines can do?             
The world is getting more curious by the second. White- and blue-collar jobs are under threat. And perhaps the most prevailing question now is: are there any limits to what machines can do?
Well, the truth is no one knows for sure. Not even the experts can say.
As Niel Bohrs once said: “Prediction is difficult, especially about the future”, and making efforts to see into the future is a fool’s errand. However, it suffices to say that, for now, there are certain limits. The AI technology that currently exists are ‘narrow’ or ‘weak’, in that they are designed to perform narrow or specific tasks, such as legal outcome prediction, contract review, and language translation. We still haven’t developed a general-purpose machine—or General AI—which is a notional future AI system, expected to outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.[19]
“But it is impossible to deny that progress is being made, and rapidly too. First, it was said that the subtleties of chess would make it impossible for the then (human) champion to be beaten. Wrong. Then it was argued that the Chinese game of Go, far more complex than chess, would resist the rise of robots. Wrong again. And now artificial intelligence is creating debaters to take on modern-day Ciceros and give them a run for their money.”[20]
Should I be scared? Will AI Take Lawyers’ Jobs?
On a recent episode of The Daily Show, a young lawyer played by comedian (and law school graduate) Ronny Chieng, half-jokingly threatens in a satirical skit to sue the robots that stole his job. In the skit, Chieng’s case against legal robots goes to trial, but the jurors are robots and the judge is Amazon’s Alexa. Chieng’s opening statement reflects the struggles that attorneys may soon meet:
Your honor, members of the jury, this is about the essence of humanity itself, because unlike that thing [pointing to the legal robot] I went to law school—taught by humans. I spent countless, sleepless, nights, reading, writing, pondering [things]…, all things artificial intelligence can’t do, and quite frankly I’m sensing a lot of bias in this court room.[21]
Right. With the rise of AI comes the fear of job loss.
Indeed, concerns about computers taking over lawyers’ jobs go back to the 1950s when AI technology began to rise. But predictions of structural change in the legal industry date back at least to the invention of the typewriter. Yet the introduction of new technologies: word processing, e-mail, photocopying electronic filing system, automated document processing—once seen as threats to the legal profession—have actually helped lawyers prosper.
Emerging technologies like AI would have transformational impacts on Legal Practice (source: law)
But of course, AI is a different beast.
AI development is expected to continue its inspired, relentless match, leaving radical changes in its wake. The $600 billion global legal services market is not immune, and lawyers and law firms are not spared from this revolution. But it is not all gloom and doom, for, “many of these technologies are only able to complete a discrete task or a discrete portion of a legal project.  Attorneys still will be required to deliver the final product.”[22] More so, while routine tasks like documents review and management are prime candidates for automation, complex situations involving uncertain laws, conflicting rights, and unique fact patterns will remain difficult to be automated for an extended period of time.[23]
So even though intelligent software tools cut down the amount of time and money spent on certain tasks, and generally improves efficiency and accuracy, it is hard to imagine that machines will one day take over lawyers’ jobs. Au contraire, because legal services will become faster, cheaper and more consistent, demand for legal services might actually increase since more people will be able to afford legal representation.
Lawyers need not be afraid. “Despite advances in technology toward providing technical answers in some of these areas, clients still need lawyers to predict human reactions in ways that no computer can handle.”[24] And clients still need to engage with humans. As Celia succinctly puts it: the point is not to “create robot lawyers, but to take the robots out of the lawyer.” Even as data explodes and becomes easier to harness, and even as the rise of AI continues, lawyers need not tremble. After all, “data isn’t everything when it comes to decision-making [and lawyering]. Experience, intuition, hunches, imagination, and judgment all matter too.”[25] As Margaret Heffernan once observed, “artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the answer to genuine stupidity”.
What Can Lawyers Do To Survive The Rise of The Machines?
First off, lawyers need to stop seeing the rise of AI as a threat: instead, they should start to adapt. Adaptation in this case does not mean competing with AI—which would be a futile effort—but rather embracing its possibilities.[26] As I said at the beginning of this piece, although we cannot stop the revolution that is coming, we can adjust timely and reposition ourselves. Right. Lawyers and law firms should not wait for machines to take their jobs or their competitive edge. They should instead learn about how they can leverage AI, and see how they can turn a potential foe into a friend.
Again, lawyers must jettison their innate tendencies to resist change: they must innovate. In the face of imminent disruptions, lawyers and law firms should be willing to incorporate technological skills. It’s good to know that many African firms are already deploying cutting-edge technology in providing legal services. Apart from the likes of Bowmans and Webber Wentzel in South Africa, Nigerian firms like Aelex, Olaniwun Ajayi, and Infusion Lawyers—the country’s first fully virtual IP&IT law firm—have embraced the endless possibilities that technology has to offer.
“If other industries can successfully adopt AI, why not lawyers?”[27]
Lawyers must adjust their perspectives. As AI allows tasks to become automated, lawyers must appreciate the encroachment and impact of AI on the legal profession and must strategically reposition themselves. Those who fail to do this may suffer. Brick-and-mortar lawyers who earn their fees from protracting cases and from low-level document review and drafting of common legal documents like Deeds and Wills—tasks that AI can complete in seconds—will watch their practice slowly die.
The American Bar Association has already extended the lawyers’ ‘duty of competence’ beyond the knowledge of substantive law to a duty of technological competence. If America has done it, Africa will catch up soon.
Conclusion
The pace of technological advancement is unpredictable. Advances in artificial intelligence are overturning many assumptions—things once considered the stuff of science fiction are fast becoming a part of our reality.
Yet while jobs like legal research, case prediction, compliance, contract reviewing and drafting, precedent management and other routine and repetitive tasks, billing, secretarial and paralegal duties, etc., are under threat, “AI and legal tech cannot yet replicate the experience and creativity of a battle-hardened legal practitioner [and] legal jobs that require [the] ability to connect and work with other people are currently insulated from the onslaught of AI.”[28]
But one is almost immediately prompted to ask: for how long can this last?
In the long term, “some see computers continuing to double in power every two years, reaching levels of computing power by the 2020s that rival the human brain and that by the 2050s rival, in a single desktop machine, the power of all human brains combined. Given such vast increases in computational power, they see computers as besting humans at what lawyers do, which is to provide reliable, expert answers to difficult questions.”[29]
Steady increase in computing power, availability of large volume of data, the evolution of more effective algorithms, and access to capital, which has exploded in the last couple of years, with 200 AI startups raising $1.5 billion in equity funding[30] is driving the resurgence. And as the legal industry becomes more and more aware, “[c]ompetition in legal AI will be fierce over the next few years. Traditional law firms will compete for startups, non-traditional legal service providers like Thomson Reuters, and legal outsiders such as Bloomberg and PwC [will compete] for tech- and law-qualified staff and market share.”[31]
Businesses—including law firms and lawyers—must develop clear long-term strategy that envision new ways to use AI; they must find ways to deal with changing client demands. Or they risk being left behind. The future is uncertain and in many ways, unpredictable. Coming to terms with that and developing strategies to take advantage is key to success.”[32]
In many ways, AI “represents both the biggest opportunity and potentially the greatest threat to the legal profession since its formation.”[33]

Artificial Intelligence: Good Versus Evil (infographic)

Artificial intelligence is the stuff of scary movies for some people. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the AI system known as Hal frightened us all by calmly saying, “I’m sorry, Dave, I can’t let you do that,” which made us question whether giving a computer that much power over our lives was a worthwhile endeavour.  Despite the reasonable caution we feel toward AI, in many ways it is already changing our lives for the better. Artificial intelligence is what you make of it, and if we as a society can agree to use it as a force for good there’s no limit to the positive impact it can make on humanity.

AI Breaks Bad
As the old saying goes, garbage in, garbage out. We’ve seen several attempts at training AI go awry in recent years that can all be traced back to our own imperfections as the human programmers of this technology. AI-driven Twitter bots have been turned into racists within days of being released onto the internet, while AI-driven predictive algorithms used to predict crime have been shown to adopt racial profiling. Rather than being the neutral and dispassionate fair-minded equalizers we want them to be, they instead take on our own flaws when we program them.

There’s also a great deal of fear about what will happen to humans when artificial intelligence takes over our careers. Currently it is predicted that AI will take over 38% of jobs by the mid-2030s, and 86% of executives say that workers will need to shift their skills sets in the future. These fears are similar to when automation took over things like farming and assembly lines at the turn of the century and people were unprepared to deal with the changing demands of the economic landscape.

AI Can Be A Great Force For Good
Those fears about losing your job to artificial intelligence may be unfounded, however. There are certain jobs that AI just cannot do, and keeping that in mind as you choose or retool your career path can help you stay ahead of the game. What’s more, as AI takes over certain jobs - the repetitive ones are going to be the first to go - it will free us up to gain even higher ground in terms of innovation. When the menial tasks are taken care of by machines, more human power can be freed up to achieve greater technological advances. 

Already AI has changed the face of healthcare through customized pharmaceutical treatments and highly accurate infectious disease model analysis. It has helped to improve road safety through predictive braking, lane monitoring, and more. There are even advancements being made in learning with the help of functional MRI studies that are being applied to how humans actually learn.

In the near future, artificial intelligence can be leveraged to solve some of our most pressing problems. Scientists are already looking to AI to help with predictive farming models that will enable us to use fewer resources to grow food in a more efficient manner. They are looking to AI to help make trucking more efficient in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It can also help people with certain types of disabilities live more full and robust lives. AI can help blind people interact with their environments more deeply and it can help deaf people do the same.

Whether AI is used for good or for evil is truly up to us. What can this technology do in the right hands? And what if it falls into the wrong ones? Learn more about the good versus evil sides of AI from this infographic.

The perceptron was an algorithm designed to classify objects it was shown and an ancestor of modern Artificial Intelligence. When Rosenblatt became a little boastful at a press conference in 1958, the New York Times picked up on it and went a little overboard with excitement. “NEW NAVY DEVICE LEARNS BY DOING; Psychologist Shows Embryo of Computer Designed to Read and Grow Wiser”, read the title of an article. And the author went on:The Navy said the perceptron would be the first non-living mechanism “capable of receiving, recognizing and identifying its surroundings without any human training or control”Does this tone sound familiar?Not a week goes by without news of new breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence and of algorithms being able to complete tasks which were previously reserved to humans. There is plenty of talk these days about the automation of jobs and our new algorithmic overlords which get complicated tasks done with seemingly very little human involvement. This, however, is a fallacy — that we cannot see the humans behind AI does not mean that there are none. And this does not only apply to the engineers developing these algorithms. In fact, there is a new class of blue-collar jobs curating the data which is so critical to the functioning of the algorithms which are said to power our digitalized economy.It would not be the first time that we overlook the masses of people working hard to make technology work. Not much time has passed since “computers” were actually people, a substantial share of whom (underpaid) women, working on computations which have since been automated. Women were also among the first computer programmers, operating complex machines such as the one built to run Rosenblatt’s perceptron algorithm, yet overshadowed by the engineers of these first computers. Little attention was paid to these backroom workers of big technology firms, government agencies, and research labs at the time. Only recently, there has been an uptick in recognition of these workers, in academia but also, for example, in Hollywood. We should learn from history and not repeat these mistakes. To do so, we need to take a look at who the new hidden figures of technology are, what their job is, and why they are needed.A computing group at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, circa 1955 (source: JPL/Caltech)Like a car without wheelsWhen people talk about AI these days, what they really mean is usually Machine Learning (ML). Most ML algorithms, in turn, are essentially statistical models which “learn” how to perform a particular task by analyzing large samples of data — “training data” — they were previously fed. Developers rely on these models because of what is referred to as “Polanyi’s paradox”: We know more than we can tell, that is. Much of our knowledge is tacit, which is why we can’t simply program it into software in the form of hard rules; no matter how trivial the task, to teach computer programs we need to show, or “train”, them. Thus, a very sophisticated, but untrained ML algorithm is like a sports car without wheels: it may still look nice, but it won’t get you anywhere — it’s essentially useless. Similarly, if you feed your ML model garbage training data, it will spit out garbage results.But what exactly is “training data”? Let’s say you run a blueberry muffin factory, but every once in a while a runaway dog from a nearby animal shelter accidentally jumps onto the conveyer built and your AI-powered packaging robot needs to differentiate between the muffins and the dogs so that no dog ends up on a grocery store shelf. For the robot to pull this off, it needs to be fed with a lot of pictures of muffins and dogs, and they need to be labeled accordingly so it can deduce their identifying characteristics. The same principle applies, for example, to self-driving cars (which need to be able to identify a stop sign, amongst other things) and most other AI applications.Chihuahua or muffin? Not that easy to tell for a machine without human supervision (source: Mariya Yao)This poses a problem for companies: How do they obtain labeled or annotated data? Even if they get their hands on large troves of data — such as photos (for image recognition algorithms), voice recordings (for speech recognition), or written text (for sentiment analysis) — labeling all this data is a tedious task, and one which needs to be completed by humans. It is work.50 ways to label dataThere are different ways to get your data labeled. Some firms label their data themselves — although this can be costly, as hiring people simply for these tasks costs firms both money and flexibility. Other companies even find ways to get people to label their data for free. Ever wonder why Google’s reCAPTCHA keeps asking you to identify traffic signs on blurry photos? (A small hint: Google’s holding company Alphabet also owns Waymo, which is at the forefront of autonomous driving) In most cases, however, it is paid workers who label and curate data and an entire outsourcing industry has sprung up around it. Be it in factory-like workplaces around the world or through remote work at home or on a smartphone: These are the invisible workers who power Artificial Intelligence.reCAPTCHA — everybody’s favorite pastime on the internetMuch like Western firms started offshoring manufacturing jobs to developing countries starting in the 1960s and 1970s, tech companies are outsourcing data labeling to foreign companies running what can be described as data labeling factories. And much like in the past, these jobs are moved to places — from China to Central Africa — where wages are low and working conditions more favorable for them. There, masses of workers in former warehouses and large open space offices sit in front of computers and spend their workdays labeling data. As Li Yuan quotes the co-founder of a Chinese data labeling company in a recent piece for the New York Times:We’re the construction workers in the digital world. Our job is to lay one brick after another […] But we play an important role in A.I. Without us, they can’t build the skyscrapers.Another way to outsource data labeling is through online crowdworking platforms, relying on their users completing tasks broken down into small components all around the world. This includes large platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk with its hundreds of thousands of registered crowdworkers, but also specialized platforms. Some large technology companies even have their own crowdworking platforms to curate data, others can rely on smaller platform services that focus exclusively on data labeling. Workers’ motivations for these jobs vary: some people want to make an extra buck in their spare time and value the flexibility such platforms offer. As one user of Spare5, a specialized data labeling app, explains in a promotional video:It’s just, you know, something I can easily do, just pull my phone out, do a few tasks, make a few dockets on the way home and to work. […] For me it’s a little bit rewarding knowing that I spent this time really digging deep, trying to find the information […] I feel like I am solving a mystery, solving this puzzle.Others, however, rely on these platform jobs for their livelihood and are oftentimes faced with substantial risks: low pay, no (or few) employment protections and employee rights, and along with that enormous uncertainty.The blue-collar job of the age of AITaking a step back, it becomes evident that a new type of low-skill, blue-collar job has emerged to satisfy technology’s appetite for labeled data. As opposed to doing physical assembly line work in the industrial economy, this new AI working class has become part of a digitalized “data supply chain”. Of course, not all of these jobs are low-skill — an algorithm detecting cancer on images from CT scans needs to be trained by experienced radiologists. But, in accordance with Polanyi’s paradox, most tasks researchers are trying to get ML applications to complete are still fairly simple for humans and training these algorithms requires little more than common sense.It is thus important to make sure that this new class of jobs becomes a driver of economic security for workers, not a source of exploitation. As for supply chains in more “traditional” global industries, such as mining or the clothing industry, it is on all of us — governments, consumers, and firms — to ensure that those who label data work under decent conditions.It will be difficult for governments to regulate work in this global, borderless market for data labeling services. Yet, they must strive to adapt existing institutions aimed at improving working conditions and to push companies to create fair data supply chains. Both crowdwork and work in data labeling factories pose different challenges in this respect, but none of these obstacles are insurmountable. Overcoming them does, however, require regulatory efforts as well as international and cross-sectoral cooperation. Firms, in turn, must offer some transparency regarding their data supply chains. And although first-world consumers still remain largely oblivious of the conditions under which their clothes and gadgets are manufactured in far-away places, we, too, should seek to hold tech companies accountable for the way they power their artificially intelligent applications. After all, consumers do have leverage and responsible consumption can have an impact on firms’ behavior.No matter how excited we get about the pace of technological progress, it is as important now as it was in the past to keep reminding ourselves that there are people behind most of the advances in AI we hear about day in and day out in the media — many of them, actually. And as ML researchers are looking for an ever-growing number of new tasks to be automated, these jobs are not going to go away soon. Let’s make sure they are decent jobs then.This article was written in the context of the course “History of the Technology Revolution” at Sciences Po Paris, taught by Laurène Tran, Besiana Balla, and Nicolas Colin.Further ReadingIf the above piqued your interest, here are some more articles exploring the same topic:Sarah Dai, AI promises jobs revolution but first it needs old-fashioned manual labour — from China, South China Morning Post, October 2018Mark Graham, The rise of the planetary labour market — and what it means for the future of work, The New Statesman, January 2018Hope Reese, Is ‘data labeling’ the new blue-collar job of the AI era?, TechRepublic, March 2016Hope Reese and Nick Heath, Inside Amazon’s clickworker platform: How half a million people are being paid pennies to train AI, TechRepublic, Dember 2016Tom Simonite, To Make AI Smarter, Humans Perform Oddball Low-Paid Tasks, Wired, September 2018Li Yuan, How Cheap Labor Drives China’s A.I.
