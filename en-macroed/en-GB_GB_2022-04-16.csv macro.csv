Performing arts union Equity is launching a campaign around performers’ rights over artificial intelligence (AI).
They hope to persuade the U.K. government to introduce laws that will prevent companies using AI performance synthetisation – based on real performers’ voices and likeness – without their permission.
As the U.K. law currently stands, performers’ rights extend to being able to give consent to the making of a recording of a performance and the right to control use of the recordings and any copies.
However, AI technology falls outside the scope of these protections because it “reproduces performances without generating a ‘recording’ or a ‘copy,'” according to the union. In addition, in a survey of 430 Equity members, 79% of those who have undertaken AI work said they didn’t feel they had a “full understanding” of their rights before signing their contracts.

Meanwhile 93% of audio artists responding to the survey said they were worried AI posed a threat to employment opportunities. According to Equity, AI is increasingly being used in the audio and audio-visual sector, from audiobooks to digital avatars.

Equity’s new campaign, which is titled Stop AI Stealing the Show, is backed by actor Talulah Riley (“St Trinian’s”), politician Lord Clement-Jones, who is co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Artificial Intelligence, and Canadian voiceover artist Bev Standing.
Standing won a settlement after she sued TikTok, saying the company had used her voice for their text-to-speech feature without her permission based on recordings she had provided for another company years earlier.
“In 2018, I was hired to do a text-to-speech job for a translation app,” said Standing. “But in 2020 these recordings were used for the first ever English text-to-speech voice on TikTok, who was not my client. The fear of coming up against a multibillion-dollar company was a little overwhelming but it came down to the fact that it was just wrong and I had to stand up for myself – my voice files were copyrighted and I owned them, so TikTok didn’t have permission to use them.” 
“After talking to a lawyer, a complaint was filed,” she continued. “We came to a very amicable agreement with TikTok last year and they settled. As a voice actor, I feel it’s a smart business decision to understand AI and get involved in it, and I now only work with companies where I have control over where my voice gets licensed. AI is here to stay – it’s not going away.”
 








Equity also warned that artists providing their voice and likeness for AI work were “not being compensated fairly” or sometimes at all and that performers are often asked to sign NDAs which obscures the nature of the job. 
“The explosion of artificial intelligence across the entertainment industry is a significant and growing concern for audio artists and other performers,” said Paul W Fleming, Equity’s general secretary. “We are working hard to protect our members as bosses try to increase profits by replacing skilled professionals with AI systems; but without Government action to modernise U.K. law we could see dystopian consequences for performers and permanent damage to our world leading industry. Workers everywhere need action on AI – from checkout tills to feature films, from call centres to videogames – to ensure this new technology enhances their working lives, and not just the bosses’ bottom line.”
Talulah Riley, a member of Equity, added: “Advances in AI technology are coming at us fast and it is important that those of us in the entertainment industry are aware of the possible changes to our livelihood. As a performer, it is vital that my voice and my image are my own, no matter how easily and cheaply those things can be digitally replicated. I believe that performers must be rewarded fairly for the content we create.”

Artificial Intelligence Approach Helps Identify Type 2 Diabetes Risk


A new artificial intelligence method used various factors, including pancreas health and fat levels, to determine patients at risk for developing type 2 diabetes.

Researchers from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) model that analyzed various factors relating to pancreas health and fat levels using non-contrast abdominal CT images to detect type 2 diabetes risk.







The study, which was published in Radiology, evaluated 8,992 patients, of which 572 had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 1,880 had dysglycemia. All patient screenings occurred between 2004 and 2016.
To build the model researchers used 471 images obtained from various datasets. They divided the photos into three categories: 424 for training, 8 for validation, and 39 for test sets.
The researchers used a variety of measurements when analyzing images. These measurements included CT attenuation, pancreatic volume, intrapancreatic fat percentage, and three-dimensional fractal dimension.
Other analyzed features included visceral fat levels and density and volumes of neighboring muscles and organs.
Results showed that low pancreas density and high visceral fat correlated with diabetes prevalence.
The consistent and accurate results displayed by the AI model indicated that fully automated analyses of abdominal CT biomarkers are a reliable approach to predicting and diagnosing diabetes.
Further, researchers hope to continue implementing multivariable analyses in diagnosing type 2 diabetes.
“This study is a step towards the wider use of automated methods to address clinical challenges,” said study authors Ronald M. Summers, MD, PhD, and Hima Tallam, an MD and PhD student, in a press release. “It may also inform future work investigating the reason for pancreatic changes that occur in patients with diabetes.” Summers and Tallam work and study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, respectively. 
The authors did note various limitations of the research, including difficulty segmenting images, and the exclusion of clinical factors such as race, family history, or blood lipid level from the final model.
Increasingly, predictive analytics methods are being used in clinical diagnoses.
For example, a predictive analytics method developed in August 2020 used a calculator to help clinicians foresee a stroke. Specifically, the tool used information regarding the metabolic system, including blood pressure and cholesterol.
Another study published in Nature Communications described how an early-warning system monitored infectious diseases. The study involved 3,000 providers who reported data on influenza-like illnesses to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention weekly. With this data, the researchers created a forecasting model that intended to provide early warnings regarding patients at risk for stroke.
But as predictive analytics use in healthcare evolves, researchers are taking steps to enhance these methods.
Research published in the Journal of Social Computing in June 2021 described how predictive analytics could best succeed when assisted by both AI and humans, as AI works well when handling big data, and humans are better at handling thick data.

Jasper alone claims more than 55,000 paying subscribers, and OpenAI says one competitor has more than 1 million users. WIRED counted 14 companies openly offering marketing tools that can generate content like blog posts, headlines, and press releases using OpenAI’s technology.

He uses a copywriting service called ContentEdge to help write pages on topics like how to commission portraits of pets. The service uses technology from OpenAI and IBM combined with in-house software and describes its product as “fast, affordable, and nearly human.”ContentEdge, like many of its rivals, functions like a conventional online text editor but with added features you won’t find in Google Docs. In a sidebar, the software can suggest keywords needed to rank highly on Google for a chosen title. Clicking a button marked with a lightning bolt generates complete paragraphs or suggested outlines for an article from a title and a short summary. The text includes terms drawn from pages ranked highly by Google.Chen likes the way the resulting paragraphs sometimes sprinkle in information drawn from the billions of words of online text used to train OpenAI’s algorithms. That it does so in ways that can be garbled or contradictory doesn’t faze him. “You shouldn’t use the output outright, but it’s a starting point to edit and does the boring work of researching things,” he says.ContentEdge and its competitors generally advise users to edit and fact-check content before posting. Although OpenAI’s technology most often produces original text, it can regurgitate text that appeared in its training data scraped from the web.

This article is part of our Artificial Intelligence Insights Series, written by McCarthy Tétrault’s multidisciplinary Cyber/Data team. This series brings you practical and integrative perspectives on the ways in which AI is transforming industries, and how you can stay ahead of the curve.

The tech world trend of artificial intelligence (“AI”) is becoming increasingly prevalent in employment matters. For example, employers are using AI to attract candidates, evaluate job performance and automate certain positions; however, there are controversies over the use of AI, including it resulting in the continuation of patterns of bias and discrimination in employment-related decision making and the potential of compromising privacy rights.
The area that has received much of the attention in recent years is the use of AI during the recruitment and hiring process. In a typical recruit cycle, one may encounter AI at multiple stages:

Creating Job Descriptions: Augmented writing platforms can analyze databanks of job postings and internal demographics to suggest alternative language, with the goal of appealing to a greater proportion of the target audience of the hiring employer.
Searching for Candidates: AI drives targeted advertising and can be effective in attracting suitable candidates to job postings they may otherwise have overlooked. For active job seekers, previous online activity will lead algorithms to push similar content. AI on platforms like LinkedIn can even target passive job seekers – individuals who are not consciously looking for a new position but would be open to opportunities – by analyzing their profile, recommending suitable job postings and encouraging certain connections. There are also new platforms using AI to make the job search more inclusive; for example, the Ontario Disability Employment Network’s new division, Jobs Ability Canada, assists individuals with disabilities to create profiles that are then intelligently matched to job postings harvested directly from the websites of companies subscribed to the platform.
Screening: AI may dramatically reduce the time needed to sort through resumes and applications. Many companies use keyword-matching programs to pare down the candidate pool, while others use more complex software to compare applicants based on a variety of factors, including factors that the program itself has determined make successful applicants.
Communicating with Applicants: Chatbots can be utilized throughout the process for tasks such as asking and answering basic applicant questions, scheduling interviews and sending reminders and feedback. This automation enables the recruiters to spend more time connecting with qualified candidates, while still providing a sufficiently engaging experience for all applicants.
Assessing and Evaluating: There are various tools at the interviewing stage that purport to assess candidate competency or “fit”. As virtual interviews are becoming more common, vendors of video interview software have included vocal and facial analysis components to provide additional data to the final decision makers. Some companies have also turned to game-based assessments whereby AI takes the raw results of a “game” to make conclusions about a candidate’s cognitive skills and personality traits.

Risks of AI in Employment Decisions
While AI has undoubtedly led to increased efficiency, there are attendant risks when the technology is used to make employment decisions. The greatest concern in this context is discrimination. Despite hopes that AI could eliminate human failings, evidence has shown that bias still creeps into AI systems resulting in harmful, discriminatory impacts. For example, a recruitment tool may end up ranking one gender or ethnicity consistently higher than the other due to the sample of resumes that were provided to the system for training at the outset being overwhelmingly from one gender or ethnicity. While the sample resumes would be intended to identify successful candidates based on prior successful candidates, the tool would ultimately lead to systemic bias for being reflective of one specific gender or ethnicity.
AI programs can also be based on fundamentally flawed premises, an issue distinct from biased source data. For example, the idea that a person’s facial expressions are a reliable indicator of their abilities or likelihood of success in a role is questionable. Expression and tone of voice are both products of culture, health and context. Tools that analyze these features are really measuring how “culturally normal” a person is, not necessarily how suitable they may be for a job, resulting in discrimination against candidates who may deviate from the “typical” successful candidate.
Lack of understanding and transparency may result due to the use of AI. Where a recruiter does not adequately explain to candidates how a decision was made, unsuccessful candidates may not understand the basis of the decision. Candidates may, for instance, believe their human rights were offended due to a misapprehended understanding of why they were not successful.
There is also a general hesitancy around AI due to questions about how it collects, processes and distributes personal information. The level of risk or liability exposure will depend on how and where the AI is being used. Employers must therefore be mindful of the privacy legislation in their jurisdiction and anywhere else the AI may be operating (i.e. if it were used for a potential candidate in a different country, or if the specific tool stores personal information across borders).
Regulation
The rise of AI in employment decisions and the corresponding risk of discrimination have been acknowledged across several jurisdictions. In the United States, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission examined how AI and other technology is transforming the hiring process and offers guidance on how to ensure these tools are compliant with federal civil rights laws. Individual states and cities have also taken action.[1]
The European Commission has proposed a comprehensive, risk-based framework to regulate the development, marketing and use of AI in the EU. Under the proposal, AI in the employment context is considered “high-risk”; that is, the draft regulation specifically notes that AI systems have the power to significantly impact individuals’ career prospects and livelihoods, and there is the risk that historical discrimination may be perpetuated by those systems. With the “high-risk” designation, employers using AI in recruitment would be subject to the requirements set out in Title III of the regulation, including data governance, technical documentation, record-keeping, transparency, human oversight and accuracy. We have taken a closer look at the proposed regulation in an earlier McCarthy Tétrault blog post.
Canada’s own response to AI has been primarily in the form of privacy law reform. Quebec’s Bill 64 will require companies that make decisions using personal information that are based exclusively on AI to inform the affected individuals. The federal Bill C-11 would apply more broadly, imposing transparency and explainability obligations on private organizations that use technology to replace or merely assist human decision-makers. Bill 64 received royal assent on September 22, 2021, while Bill C-11 died on the order paper. See McCarthy Tétrault’s Bill 64 Blog Series for further insight on the impact Bill 64 may have on your business and previous blog posts for additional details on Bill C-11.
Conclusion
Though innovation and artificial intelligence will likely continue to transform the way employment decisions are made, there are certain lessons to be learned from its use and attempted regulation thus far. First, transparency and explainability are key to using AI. To gain both internal and external confidence, employers must be able to communicate their use of AI to those who will be impacted by its decisions. Second, AI is not infallible. Even with a general understanding of the process behind AI-powered decisions, employers should undertake regular audits and impact assessments of their systems to ensure they continue to work as expected. Third and lastly, there is still a crucial role to be played by humans in the hiring process and overall decision making throughout the employment relationship up to and including termination. Beyond acting as a check of the AI and a final decision maker, a recruiter, manager or other supervisory employee can create personal connections that, as of now, are still out of reach for machines.
If you have any questions regarding use of AI in your workplace, please do not hesitate to contact a member of our Labour & Employment Law Group or a member of our Cyber/Data Group.
[1] Illinois’ Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act has been in force since January 1, 2020, pre-dating the COVID-19 pandemic, and applies to AI that analyzes recorded interviews. Employers that utilize this technology must notify candidates, explain how the AI works and which characteristics it considers, and receive the candidate’s consent for the use of the technology;
New York City Council recently passed a bill, effective January 2, 2023, that will require employers to disclose to candidates their use of any “automated employment decision tools” in the hiring process. All automated employment decision tools will also be subject to a bias audit within a year of their use, the results of which must be made publically available. Violations under this bill will carry fines of up to $1,500 per instance;
The California Fair Employment & Housing Council recently proposed amendments to the state’s anti-discrimination employment laws that would impose obligations and liabilities on both employers that use, and vendors that sell or distribute, employment-screening tools or services that automate decision-making. The use of these automated-decision systems will be unlawful if it is intentionally discriminatory, but also if it is facially neutral in the event that it nevertheless has an adverse impact. Among other record-keeping requirements, the proposal would obligate employers and participating third-party entities to retain all data used to develop or apply algorithms in automated-decision systems.

The federal program that helps veterans with service-related disabilities explore employment and education options is using more digital tools to improve how it communicates with veterans and delivers customer service.
The head of the program, called the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) division under the Veterans Benefits Administration at the Department of Veterans Affairs, outlined several new modernization initiatives it implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic such as digitization and virtual video capabilities.
Before the pandemic, the division was “still a paper-intensive line of business,” Executive Director Nick Pamperin told GovCIO Media & Research. “A counselor would have a trifold folder where they would hand write notes and enter them into a computer system. Obviously, with not being able to go into the office, that just wasn’t going to work. Within 72 hours of COVID protocols being implemented, VR&E routed all incoming paper mail to our centralized vendor. Then it was scanned and uploaded into the Veterans Benefits Management System so [we] could still … maintain continuity of case management.”
Plus, VR&E already offered some virtual services before the pandemic. Pamperin said VA shifted its processes and procedures to continue to deliver interactive services to veterans like counseling and career services and also boost its existing virtual capacities.
One of the main services the division leveraged was its VA Video Connect. The platform allows veterans and their caregivers to meet with VA health care providers through live video on any computer, tablet or mobile device with an internet connection. The telecounseling platform has enabled the greater agency to interact and engage with veterans, and it allowed these career counselors to continue that engagement.
“We expanded telecounseling to our entire veteran population. We were set up for success for this,” Pamperin said. “During COVID-19, we scheduled over 200,000, almost 210,000, virtual telecounseling appointments with veterans, so it’s still allowed that face-to-face interaction that our counselors need.”
To streamline its customer service support, in 2020 the division implemented an electronic virtual assistant called e-VA to automate routine administrative tasks and create additional communications layers between veteran counselors.
“This is a big communications shift. It allows email communications back and forth that allows veterans to do several services that they previously couldn’t do unless they reached out to their counselor via the telephone,” Pamperin said.
The AI-powered virtual assistant allows veterans to schedule and reschedule appointments, text and email their counselor, and submit documentation privately and securely from their own devices. The new platform was designed to enhance customer service and provide timely responses.
“There’s some artificial intelligence that it leverages in there when it looks at tone of emails and content to help drive the veteran to the service they need,” Pamperin said. “Some of the ways it’s really benefited streamline functions is it allows for bidirectional email communication. … We can track responsiveness and timeliness in a much more robust fashion.”
The tool also sets up automatic alerts for veterans and counselors, sends follow up messages and appointment reminders, and automates documentation of routine communications. The platform will update VA’s internal case management system as veterans enter new information, which then improves continuity of care and communication capabilities.
Since implementation of e-VA and with a 96% adoption rate, the agency has already been able to automatically schedule 360,000 appointments, Pamperin said. This has both enabled veterans to take control of their communication with the agency and reduced workforce burden on VA.
“It’s really a win for veterans and for our counselors out in the field,” Pamperin said.
The division is looking to expand veteran adoption of the tool to better reach underserved populations, like veterans in rural areas, in a “much more user-friendly capability.”
“One of the ways that we’re continuing or striving to serve rural areas or just underserved veterans in general is through e-VA. Here at the service level, we have the ability to send mass targeted communications directly to veterans,” Pamperin said. “We were able to send to 10,000 veterans that were at job-ready status a specific, targeted message that said, ‘We have these three employers that are all looking for jobs in the following 10 skills.’”
As part of the division’s strategic roadmap, VR&E also is aligning with President Biden’s recent directives regarding cybersecurity, supply chain and customer experience.
“We need to continue to capitalize on the successes that modernization has brought to VR&E. We need to continue to look at modernizing not just our technology, but also our processes and procedures,” Pamperin said.
