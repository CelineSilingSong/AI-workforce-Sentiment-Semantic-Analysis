Generative AI is a kind of artificial intelligence that creates new content, including text, images, audio, and video, based on patterns it has learned from existing content. Today’s generative AI models have been trained on enormous volumes of data using deep learning, or deep neural networks, and they can carry on conversations, answer questions, write stories, produce source code, and create images and videos of any description, all based on brief text inputs or “prompts.”
Generative AI is called generative because the AI creates something that didn’t previously exist. That’s what makes it different from discriminative AI, which draws distinctions between different kinds of input. To say it differently, discriminative AI tries to answer a question like “Is this image a drawing of a rabbit or a lion?” whereas generative AI responds to prompts like “Draw me a picture of a lion and a rabbit sitting next to each other.”

This article introduces you to generative AI and its uses with popular models like ChatGPT and DALL-E. We’ll also consider the limitations of the technology, including why “too many fingers” has become a dead giveaway for artificially generated art.











 
 
 
The emergence of generative AI
Generative AI has been around for years, arguably since ELIZA, a chatbot that simulates talking to a therapist, was developed at MIT in 1966. But years of work on AI and machine learning have recently come to fruition with the release of new generative AI systems. You’ve almost certainly heard about ChatGPT, a text-based AI chatbot that produces remarkably human-like prose. DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have also drawn attention for their ability to create vibrant and realistic images based on text prompts.

Output from these systems is so uncanny that it has many people asking philosophical questions about the nature of consciousness—and worrying about the economic impact of generative AI on human jobs. But while all of these artificial intelligence creations are undeniably big news, there is arguably less going on beneath the surface than some may assume. We’ll get to some of those big-picture questions in a moment. First, let’s look at what’s going on under the hood.
How does generative AI work?
Generative AI uses machine learning to process a huge amount of visual or textual data, much of which is scraped from the internet, and then determines what things are most likely to appear near other things. Much of the programming work of generative AI goes into creating algorithms that can distinguish the “things” of interest to the AI’s creators—words and sentences in the case of chatbots like ChatGPT, or visual elements for DALL-E. But fundamentally, generative AI creates its output by assessing an enormous corpus of data, then responding to prompts with something that falls within the realm of probability as determined by that corpus.











 
 
 
Autocomplete—when your cell phone or Gmail suggests what the remainder of the word or sentence you’re typing might be—is a low-level form of generative AI. ChatGPT and DALL-E just take the idea to significantly more advanced heights.
What is an AI model?
ChatGPT and DALL-E are interfaces to underlying AI functionality that is known in AI terms as a model. An AI model is a mathematical representation—implemented as an algorithm, or practice—that generates new data that will (hopefully) resemble a set of data you already have on hand. You’ll sometimes see ChatGPT and DALL-E themselves referred to as models; strictly speaking this is incorrect, as ChatGPT is a chatbot that gives users access to several different versions of the underlying GPT model. But in practice, these interfaces are how most people will interact with the models, so don’t be surprised to see the terms used interchangeably.
AI developers assemble a corpus of data of the type that they want their models to generate. This corpus is known as the model’s training set, and the process of developing the model is called training. The GPT models, for instance, were trained on a huge corpus of text scraped from the internet, and the result is that you can feed it natural language queries and it will respond in idiomatic English (or any number of other languages, depending on the input).











 
 
 
AI models treat different characteristics of the data in their training sets as vectors—mathematical structures made up of multiple numbers. Much of the secret sauce underlying these models is their ability to translate real-world information into vectors in a meaningful way, and to determine which vectors are similar to one another in a way that will allow the model to generate output that is similar to, but not identical to, its training set.
There are a number of different types of AI models out there, but keep in mind that the various categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Some models can fit into more than one category.
Probably the AI model type receiving the most public attention today is the large language models, or LLMs. LLMs are based on the concept of a transformer, first introduced in “Attention Is All You Need,” a 2017 paper from Google researchers. A transformer derives meaning from long sequences of text to understand how different words or semantic components might be related to one another, then determines how likely they are to occur in proximity to one another. The GPT models are LLMs, and the T stands for transformer. These transformers are run unsupervised on a vast corpus of natural language text in a process called pretraining (that’s the P in GPT), before being fine-tuned by human beings interacting with the model.











 
 
 
Diffusion is commonly used in generative AI models that produce images or video. In the diffusion process, the model adds noise—randomness, basically—to an image, then slowly removes it iteratively, all the while checking against its training set to attempt to match semantically similar images. Diffusion is at the core of AI models that perform text-to-image magic like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E.
A generative adversarial network, or GAN, is based on a type of reinforcement learning, in which two algorithms compete against one another. One generates text or images based on probabilities derived from a big data set. The other—a discriminative AI—assesses whether that output is real or AI-generated. The generative AI repeatedly tries to “trick” the discriminative AI, automatically adapting to favor outcomes that are successful. Once the generative AI consistently “wins” this competition, the discriminative AI gets fine-tuned by humans and the process begins anew.
One of the most important things to keep in mind here is that, while there is human intervention in the training process, most of the learning and adapting happens automatically. Many, many iterations are required to get the models to the point where they produce interesting results, so automation is essential. The process is quite computationally intensive, and much of the recent explosion in AI capabilities has been driven by advances in GPU computing power and techniques for implementing parallel processing on these chips.











 
 
 
Is generative AI sentient?
The mathematics and coding that go into creating and training generative AI models are quite complex, and well beyond the scope of this article. But if you interact with the models that are the end result of this process, the experience can be decidedly uncanny. You can get DALL-E to produce things that look like real works of art. You can have conversations with ChatGPT that feel like a conversation with another human. Have researchers truly created a thinking machine?
Chris Phipps, a former IBM natural language processing lead who worked on Watson AI products, says no. He describes ChatGPT as a “very good prediction machine.”
It’s very good at predicting what humans will find coherent. It’s not always coherent (it mostly is) but that’s not because ChatGPT “understands.” It’s the opposite: humans who consume the output are really good at making any implicit assumption we need in order to make the output make sense.
Phipps, who’s also a comedy performer, draws a comparison to a common improv game called Mind Meld.











 
 
 
Two people each think of a word, then say it aloud simultaneously—you might say “boot” and I say “tree.” We came up with those words completely independently and at first, they had nothing to do with each other. The next two participants take those two words and try to come up with something they have in common and say that aloud at the same time. The game continues until two participants say the same word.
Maybe two people both say “lumberjack.” It seems like magic, but really it’s that we use our human brains to reason about the input (“boot” and “tree”) and find a connection. We do the work of understanding, not the machine. There’s a lot more of that going on with ChatGPT and DALL-E than people are admitting. ChatGPT can write a story, but we humans do a lot of work to make it make sense.
Testing the limits of computer intelligence
Certain prompts that we can give to these AI models will make Phipps’ point fairly evident. For instance, consider the riddle “What weighs more, a pound of lead or a pound of feathers?” The answer, of course, is that they weigh the same (one pound), even though our instinct or common sense might tell us that the feathers are lighter.
ChatGPT will answer this riddle correctly, and you might assume it does so because it is a coldly logical computer that doesn’t have any “common sense” to trip it up. But that’s not what’s going on under the hood. ChatGPT isn’t logically reasoning out the answer; it’s just generating output based on its predictions of what should follow a question about a pound of feathers and a pound of lead. Since its training set includes a bunch of text explaining the riddle, it assembles a version of that correct answer.
However, if you ask ChatGPT whether two pounds of feathers are heavier than a pound of lead, it will confidently tell you they weigh the same amount, because that’s still the most likely output to a prompt about feathers and lead, based on its training set. It can be fun to tell the AI that it’s wrong and watch it flounder in response; I got it to apologize to me for its mistake and then suggest that two pounds of feathers weigh four times as much as a pound of lead.











 
 
 
Why does AI art have too many fingers?
A notable quirk of AI art is that it often represents people with profoundly weird hands. The “weird hands quirk” is becoming a common indicator that the art was artificially generated. This oddity offers more insight into how generative AI does (and doesn’t) work. Start with the corpus that DALL-E and similar visual generative AI tools are pulling from: pictures of people usually provide a good look at their face but their hands are often partially obscured or shown at odd angles, so you can’t see all the fingers at once. Add to that the fact that hands are structurally complex—they’re notoriously difficult for people, even trained artists, to draw. And one thing that DALL-E isn’t doing is assembling an elaborate 3D model of hands based on the various 2D depictions in its training set. That’s not how it works. DALL-E doesn’t even necessarily know that “hands” is a coherent category of thing to be reasoned about. All it can do is try to predict, based on the images it has, what a similar image might look like. Despite huge amounts of training data, those predictions often fall short.
Phipps speculates that one factor is a lack of negative input.
It mostly trains on positive examples, as far as I know. They didn’t give it a picture of a seven fingered hand and tell it “NO! Bad example of a hand. Don’t do this.” So it predicts the space of the possible, not the space of the impossible. Basically, it was never told to not create a seven fingered hand.
There’s also the factor that these models don’t think of the drawings they’re making as a coherent whole; rather, they assemble a series of components that are likely to be in proximity to one another, as shown by the training data. DALL-E may not know that a hand is supposed to have five fingers, but it does know that a finger is likely to be immediately adjacent to another finger. So, sometimes, it just keeps adding fingers. (You can get the same results with teeth.) In fact, even this description of DALL-E’s process is probably anthropomorphizing it too much; as Phipps says, “I doubt it has even the understanding of a finger. More likely, it is predicting pixel color, and finger-colored pixels tend to be next to other finger-colored pixels.”











 
 
 
Potential negative impacts of generative AI
These examples show you one of the major limitations of generative AI: what those in the industry call hallucinations, which is a perhaps misleading term for output that is, by the standards of humans who use it, false or incorrect. All computer systems occasionally produce mistakes, of course, but these errors are particularly problematic because end users are unlikely to spot them easily: If you are asking a production AI chatbot a question, you generally won’t know the answer yourself. You are also more likely to accept an answer delivered in the confident, fully idiomatic prose that ChatGPT and other models like it produce, even if the information is incorrect.
Even if a generative AI could produce output that’s hallucination-free, there are various potential negative impacts:

Cheap and easy content creation: Hopefully it’s clear by now that ChatGPT and other generative AIs are not real minds capable of creative output or insight. But the truth is that not everything that’s written or drawn needs to be particularly creative. Many research papers at the high school or college undergraduate level only aim to synthesize publicly available data, which makes them a perfect target for generative AI. And the fact that synthetic prose or art can now be produced automatically, at a superhuman scale, may have weird or unforeseen results. Spam artists are already using ChatGPT to write phishing emails, for instance.
Intellectual property: Who owns an AI-generated image or text? If a copyrighted work forms part of an AI’s training set, is the AI “plagiarizing” that work when it generates synthetic data, even if it doesn’t copy it word for word? These are thorny, untested legal questions.
Bias: The content produced by generative AI is entirely determined by the underlying data on which it’s trained. Because that data is produced by humans with all their flaws and biases, the generated results can also be flawed and biased, especially if they operate without human guardrails. OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, put safeguards in the model before opening it to public use that prevent it from doing things like using racial slurs; however, others have claimed that these sorts of safety measures represent their own kind of bias.
Power consumption: In addition to heady philosophical questions, generative AI raises some very practical issues: for one thing, training a generative AI model is hugely compute intensive. This can result in big cloud computing bills for companies trying to get into this space, and ultimately raises the question of whether the increased power consumption—and, ultimately, greenhouse gas emissions—is worth the final result. (We also see this question come up regarding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.)


The downsides of generative AI

Use cases for generative AI
Despite these potential problems, the promise of generative AI is hard to miss. ChatGPT’s ability to extract useful information from huge data sets in response to natural language queries has search giants salivating. Microsoft is testing its own AI chatbot, dubbed “Sydney,” though it’s still in beta and the results have been decidedly mixed.











 
 
 
But Phipps thinks that more specialized types of search are a perfect fit for this technology. “One of my last customers at IBM was a large international shipping company that also had a billion-dollar supply chain consulting side business,” he says.

Their problem was that they couldn’t hire and train entry level supply chain consultants fast enough—they were losing out on business because they couldn’t get simple customer questions answered quickly. We built a chatbot to help entry level consultants search the company’s extensive library of supply chain manuals and presentations that they could turn around to the customer.
If I were to build a solution for that same customer today, just a year after I built the first one, I would 100% use ChatGPT and it would likely be far superior to the one I built. What’s nice about that use case is that there is still an expert human-in-the-loop double-checking the answer. That mitigates a lot of the ethical issues. There is a huge market for those kinds of intelligent search tools meant for experts.

Other potential use cases include:

Code generation: The idea that generative AI might write computer code for us has been bubbling around for years now. It turns out that large language models like ChatGPT can understand programming languages as well as natural spoken languages, and while generative AI probably isn’t going to replace programmers in the immediate future, it can help increase their productivity.
Cheap and easy content creation: As much as this one is a concern (listed above), it’s also an opportunity. The same AI that writes spam emails can write legitimate marketing emails, and there’s been an explosion of AI copywriting startups. Generative AI thrives when it comes to highly structured forms of prose that don’t require much creativity, like resumes and cover letters.
Engineering design: Visual art and natural language have gotten a lot of attention in the generative AI space because they’re easy for ordinary people to grasp. But similar techniques are being used to design everything from microchips to new drugs—and will almost certainly enter the IT architecture design space soon enough.

Conclusion
Generative AI will surely disrupt some industries and will alter—or eliminate—many jobs. Articles like this one will continue to be written by human beings, however, at least for now. CNET recently tried putting generative AI to work writing articles but the effort foundered on a wave of hallucinations. If you’re worried, you may want to get in on the hot new job of tomorrow: AI prompt engineering.

Is Generative AI Stealing From Artists?Adobe Stock

This is a problem that we’ve only had to deal with in the last year – since Generative AI took the world by storm. Tools like ChatGPT can write stories, songs or plays, while Stable Diffusion or DALL-E 2 can produce images of anything we can describe to them.

But should the credit (and royalties) go to the person who used the tool to create the art or to the company that built the AI tool? Or to the humans whose original works were used to train the AI in the first place?

PROMOTED
Because generative AI is so new, we simply don’t have an answer to this question yet. But a growing number of artists whose work has been ""scraped"" from the internet to train AI engines are launching legal action against AI companies, which they claim are profiting from their work without giving them credit or payment.

At stake are both compensation and control – with artists understandably believing they should have the right to decide how their work is used and to be financially compensated for its use. So let's take a look at some of the issues involved and some of the arguments that could have an impact on the future roles of both AI and art in society.

The question of who owns the rights to works of art created by AI will go before the courts, as individual artists as well as corporations, challenge the right of AI service providers to use their works without permission.

Artist Eva Toorent is one of the founder members of the European Guild for Artificial Intelligence Regulation (EGAIR). She believes that AI companies should have to obtain artists' opt-in consent before using their work to train algorithms that can create other works.
She recently told the BBC, “If I’m the owner, I should decide what happens to my art.”
Accusations of breach of copyright have also been made by Getty Images, which alleges that 12 million of its proprietary photographs were used by Stability AI, without its permission, to train its Stable Diffusion image generation tool.
It’s hard to deny the crux of their argument, which is that current IP and creative rights legal frameworks designed to protect artists from having their work used without permission or compensation are simply not adequate for the AI era.
As things stand, an artist’s work can simply be used again and again as a generative AI tool pumps out any number of cloned or derivative artworks. ChatGPT, for example, is capable of writing “in the style of” many human authors if instructed to do so – including myself.
Toorent, for example, says she realized the scale of the problem when she visited a gallery displaying AI artwork and was able to identify works that were based on her own style.
From a financial point of view, it seems clear from an ethical perspective that when AI companies stand to make enormous profits from this technology, artists whose talent contributed to their success deserve their cut. OpenAI, for example, attracted investment of $10 billion from Microsoft based on its potential to generate revenue in the future.

Inspiration vs. Plagiarism
There are a number of arguments that AI companies could put forward in order to get around their responsibility to artists.
One might be that training an AI system on human-created art is no different to a human artist taking inspiration from other human artists and going on to make their own art that reflects that influence.
But I would say that this doesn't quite hold up – a human artist taking inspiration from another human will – unless they are an outright plagiarist - add their own human qualities to come up with something that exhibits their own human creativity. A computer algorithm can't do that – it might mash it together with influences from other human artists, but it will never create anything that is truly new or original.
Or it could be argued that generative AI – and the huge potential for driving efficiency and growth that it promises - simply would not be possible without a huge amount of training data. And that obtaining permission for everything they use simply isn’t practical. There are some examples, however, of AI companies attempting to do just that. Adobe has exclusively trained its Firefly generative AI on images that it holds the rights to. It even offers to indemnify customers who use its tools against future claims against them.
Another argument might be that using an artist’s work to train an Ai algorithm doesn’t necessarily cause any harm or loss to that artist or devalue the original work. This argument will become harder to stand up if it transpires that artists are indeed losing out on work to AIs, though!
AI companies might try to go down the road of claiming that compensating everyone whose work is used might be too difficult due to the number of artists involved and the scale of the training datasets. It's possible that technology could provide a solution here, though, with AI and distributed ledger systems like blockchain potentially being used to create automated payment systems in the future.

The Future of Art and AI
I believe that generative AI has the potential to be truly transformative in many positive ways. It can make our day-to-day lives simpler, it can reduce the amount of time we spend on soul-destroying and repetitive tasks, and it can enable us to express creativity without being held back by technological barriers.
The positive impact this could have on society, however, would be offset if it also means creative people have to become accustomed to others taking their work and profiting from it - particularly if it can be used in ways that they may have moral or ethical objections to. Musicians, for example, frequently deny permission for their music to be used at political rallies. As things stand, there would be nothing to stop a politician from using AI to create music ""in the style of"" any particular band and using it as they see fit.
Upcoming legislation and court battles may go some way toward establishing a framework that will allow us to govern and regulate these matters in a more satisfactory way. Certainly, any legislated change is more likely to favor the artists, who are inherently disadvantaged by the current status quo.
But of course, money talks – and we can expect the AI providers – such as global tech giants Google, Microsoft and Meta – to strongly oppose any changes that will inhibit their ability to innovate (and make money).
All that’s certain right now is that as we explore this new intersection of art and technology, we are in uncharted territory. Finding a solution that keeps everyone happy without compromising artistic creativity or technological innovation will involve finding answers to some of the core ethical questions around AI and its place in society. In the long term, this is likely to be a good thing for all of us.

Josh TaylorTue 8 Aug 2023 19.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Aug 2023 19.23 EDTSharePublishers should be able to opt out of having their works mined by generative artificial intelligence systems, according to Google, but the company has not said how such a system would work.In its submission to the Australian government’s review of the regulatory framework around AI, Google said that copyright law should be altered to allow for generative AI systems to scrape the internet.The company has called for Australian policymakers to promote “copyright systems that enable appropriate and fair use of copyrighted content to enable the training of AI models in Australia on a broad and diverse range of data, while supporting workable opt-outs for entities that prefer their data not to be trained in using AI systems”.The call for a fair use exception for AI systems is a view the company has expressed to the Australian government in the past, but the notion of an opt-out option for publishers is a new argument from Google.

When asked how such a system would work, a spokesperson pointed to a recent blog post by Google where the company said it wanted a discussion around creating a community-developed web standard similar to the robots.txt system that allows publishers to opt out of parts of their sites being crawled by search engines.Google’s comments come as news companies such as News Corp have already reportedly been initiating conversations with AI companies about payment for scraping news articles.Dr Kayleen Manwaring, a senior lecturer at UNSW Law and Justice, told Guardian Australia that copyright would be one of the big problems facing generative AI systems in the coming years.“The general rule is that you need millions of data points to be able to produce useful outcomes … which means that there’s going to be copying, which is prima facie a breach of a whole lot of people’s copyright.”Google calls for relaxing of Australia’s copyright laws so AI can mine websites for informationRead moreManwaring said the laws differed in different countries regarding what AI systems are allowed to ingest, but said the notion of an opt-out system would turn copyright on its head.“If you want to reproduce something that’s held by a copyright owner, you have to get their consent, not an opt out type of arrangement … what they’re suggesting is a wholesale revamp of the way that exceptions work.”Toby Murray, associate professor at the University of Melbourne’s computing and information systems school, said Google’s proposal would put the onus on content creators to specify whether AI systems could absorb their content or not, but he indicated existing licensing schemes such as Creative Commons already allowed creators to mark how their works can be used.“They may well be hoping try to create norms early on that say other companies do not to have to pay for this content,” he said.Manwaring said copyright could break down if the problem wasn’t resolved, which would probably be to the detriment of smaller content creators.“I think it’s going to be a big issue that continues, particularly as powerful entities have their copyright ripped off. But at the moment non-powerful entities are very likely getting their copyright infringed left, right and centre, if a lot of people’s suspicions are correct and AI training sets are using a lot of material from the internet.”At Senate estimates in May, the Liberal senator Sarah Henderson asked the communications department whether the government was considering a scheme similar to the news media bargaining code to force AI companies to pay for scraping sites.In response in July, the department pointed to the government’s AI regulation consultation, said the government was examining future policy settings for news media as part of its news media assistance program, and was considering a Treasury review of the news media bargaining code.Submissions to the AI consultation closed last week. It is understood hundreds of submissions have been received, but so far none have been published online.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleInternetComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 days‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceNursing home owner who left 800 people in warehouse during Hurricane Ida avoids jail time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's how to harness it at work.,,,N/A,N/A,"By Simmone ShahAugust 9, 2023 11:42 AM EDTBefore last year, Jana Soldicic’s understanding of artificial intelligence was mostly limited to what she’d read on the pages of science fiction novels. But in the fall, after getting the chance to use the technology in real life as she played around with the generative AI tools ChatGPT and DALL-E, she got more curious. “I really wanted to know what was behind it. I knew it couldn’t be magic,” Soldicic said. She searched online and found Elements of AI, a self-paced, online course created by MinnaLearn and The University of Helsinki that provides an introduction to artificial intelligence designed for people without a background in technology, and was surprised by how much she enjoyed the course.“I got a little bit addicted to it,” she says. “It gave me a basic understanding of what AI is now and what it could be.” The experience gave her a deeper understanding of how artificial intelligence actually operated—far beyond what she might have learned from messing around with the publicly available programs. Now, she’s bringing that knowledge to her work as an event planner. “I now have more of an understanding what it could do for me, my work, [and] my colleagues, other than just creating texts or pictures.”Soldicic, who is based in Hamburg, Germany, uses AI text-to-image generators like DALL-E to bring adverts and flyers to life with designs that it might have previously been impossible for her to create on her own. “We wanted little squirrels on a tandem bike for one event [flyer], and you could never find such a picture in real life. I put in ‘two squirrels on the tandem bike’ [on DALL-E] and there were so many different and cool results. I didn't have to find somebody to realize my idea, I could just do it at home.” Read More: Millions of Americans Have Lost Jobs in the Pandemic—And Robots and AI Are Replacing Them Faster Than EverArtificial intelligence is expected to drastically change the way most of us work, but it’s a shift many are unprepared for. Amid all the chatter around AI, there is increasing concern about the threat it may pose to workers, ranging from screenwriters and background actors to lawyers. A recent Goldman Sachs report found that as many as 300 million jobs around the world could be affected by AI and automation, but a Boston Consulting Group survey found that adoption has so far been largely limited to the C-suite. According to the June survey, 80% of executives said they used generative AI regularly, while only 20% of frontline employees reported the same. Meanwhile, a study earlier this year by human resources analytics firm Revelio Labs found that the jobs most threatened by AI are largely held by women. Read More: The Writers Strike Is Taking a Stand on AIIn the face of this change, people like Soldicic are trying to skill up in AI and bring what they learn to the workplace—and many courses are emerging to help them do it. “It's clear that this is one of those moments where people are really trying to get a handle on what's happening,” says Dan Brodnitz Global Head of Strategy at LinkedIn Learning. “This is about the opportunity for AI to improve our jobs and to augment our professional lives. To navigate that, people are going to and already [are] super motivated to invest in themselves.” AI and the future of workExperts say AI will likely transform the workplace, though it is developing so rapidly that we may not know all the ways it could change how we will be working in the future. A recent survey by McKinsey estimated that generative AI tools could theoretically automate work that takes as much as 70% of an employee's time and that AI could replace half of workers' daily work activities by 2045– around a decade earlier than their previous estimates. The shift stands to impact knowledge-based workers, in jobs that have traditionally had higher wages and educational requirements, according to McKinsey. However, experts say the shift will likely mean people will be required to use tools such as generative AI in the same way we use search engines and word processors. “AI is not just about automating jobs and replacing people,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI. By far the biggest benefits are having AI work with humans and help them be more productive.” Read More: The AI Job That Pays Up to $335K—and You Don't Need a Computer Engineering BackgroundBrynjolfsson, along with researchers Danielle Li, and Lindsey Raymond, authored a study in which generative AI was used by over 5,000 customer support agents at a call center, and found that AI tools boosted workers productivity, reduced attrition, and were especially helpful for early-career workers. Through machine learning, the generative AI systems were able to use pattern recognition to identify successes and failures in customer service approaches. “It listened in on a whole bunch of transcripts and calls, and could see the patterns that turned out well the ones that didn't turn out well,” says Brynjolfsson. “It captured that tacit knowledge and passed it on to the less experienced workers.”Brynjolfsson said the AI system was able to recommend specific features to solve a customer’s problems, or a tone of voice or phrasing that might work better. “Maybe no human had ever written down those rules before but the AI system, by looking at literally millions of transcripts, was able to pick up on these patterns.”AI tools are likely going to impact tasks that are “routine, predictable, or standardized,” according to Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor of business psychology and author of I, Human: AI, Automation, and the Quest to Reclaim What Makes Us Unique. Though it might be tempting to brush off the sudden rise of AI tools as just a fad, Chamorro-Premuzic says it’s important to become as familiar as possible with the tools, as they are likely to become ubiquitous. “These are tools that everybody will use, and if you're the only person not even trying it out or not using it, you might actually suffer,” he says, comparing such resistance to deciding not to use Google’s search engine.Read More: The AI Arms Race Is Changing EverythingAnd even if employers don’t expect workers to be experts in AI now, being comfortable with AI tools and how they operate could potentially provide a leg up as tools begin to become more commonplace in the workplace. “When employers know that an employee or an applicant has experience with AI, that could potentially be more appealing to them, even if they're not a tech company,” says Amber Clayton, senior director of knowledge center operations at the Society for Human Resource Management. “I think many employers are looking at this right now as an opportunity to be more efficient.”Training up on AIVille Valtonen, MinnaLearn’s CEO and co-founder, believes truly understanding AI is only possible by going  back to the basics. MinnaLearn’s Elements of AI course teaches students the patterns and probabilities that make artificial intelligence what it is, so they have the confidence to adapt alongside the technology. “The AI field moves so fast. There are hundreds of tools coming daily. So we think it's really useful that people learn the high level things first, and then they can apply that in the world. That’s something you can use for much longer than a specific tool.” The course is free and requires no advanced math or programing experience. “We wanted to create a course for that 99% of people who can’t code and still wanted to understand how AI was being used in the world around them,” says Valtonen. More than one million people from 170 countries have signed up to take MinnaLearn’s online Elements of AI course. The company also offers a paid version of the program tailored towards businesses and it plans to launch a new chapter on generative AI this summer. Read More: Column: AI Is Not an Arms RaceThere are also more tailored courses for workers and jobseekers looking to learn specific skills. Learners looking to understand the tools that might prove useful in particular roles or sectors could turn to LinkedIn Learning—LinkedIn’s educational arm— for example. It offers more than 100 courses covering artificial intelligence, on both the theoretical and practical fronts. These range from “Introduction to Prompt Engineering for Generative AI” to “Artificial Intelligence for Business Leaders.” Pricing for an individual LinkedIn Learning subscription begins at $19.99 per month, with the option to pay for individual courses. The courses are broken down into bite-sized chapters, many of which come in at under five minutes. “We've designed it so you can use the time you have available to learn what you need to learn,” Brodnitz says. “It's all designed to give people a lot of control.” Alphabet also offers a range of courses through the Google Cloud Skills Boost platform.Art Munin decided to take some courses on AI after his employer, a tech company that helps colleges and universities with enrollment management, began deploying an AI tool of its own. “After learning about our AI tool, I was not satisfied just trusting that it worked. I wanted to know how it worked,” he told TIME in an email. Munin has taken several LinkedIn Learning courses, including “Deep Learning: Getting Started” and “Applied Machine Learning: Foundations.” As conversations around artificial intelligence and its use cases begin to enter public conversation, he says the course has allowed him to better discern fact from fiction when it comes to the impacts and concerns around AI. “There is a gigantic difference between AI being used in military missile defense, for example, and AI supporting the recruitment of college students. These courses have helped me with a language and knowledge base to navigate these complex conversations and advocate for the reasonable use of AI in my field of work.” How to make AI work for you While there has been some legitimate concern about AI coming for many of our jobs, there are ways workers can use AI to help them improve at their jobs. Consider the ways AI systems might impact your specific field, and how it can help make your workflow more efficient, suggests Amanda Johnstone, CEO of the technology research and development lab, Transhuman. For example, when trying to brainstorm creative lab experiments that meet specific educational standards, a teacher can ask ChatGPT to help, rather than generating ideas on their own, she says.It can even be as simple as asking the tool to  draft an email or social media post. “Try not to make it too technical,” Johnstone says. “You can have AI create 50 social media posts for you. And then spend half a day timing them to post [rather than] the next three months or you can have artificial intelligence draft the next ten newsletters for you.”Johnstone advises against approaching the prompt like a Google search. Instead, be specific in how you prompt the tool. “When you're prompting AI or working with AI, you need to think ‘what do I really want the end result to be?’; Do I want it to create a newsletter for our target audience bringing in real time data?’ Think about the end outcome and reverse engineer,” she says.For those interested in experimenting with generative AI tools, experts say that a great first step is to simply take the time to play around with them—especially while there are versions of platforms like ChatGPT that are free to access. “Have fun with it, test it in your own way, thinking about the problems that you might have,” Chamorro-Premuzic says. “It's definitely trial and error.”Read More: The Workers Behind AI Rarely See Its Rewards. This Indian Startup Wants to Fix ThatFor some learners,  the benefits of using AI at work has been a pleasant surprise. Damian Wolfgram, a California-based product manager who took Minnalearn’s Elements of AI course, says that outsourcing more mundane tasks like agenda-setting or double-checking a draft’s grammar has drastically increased his productivity. “I'm able to get 80% of whatever that task is done in just 20% of the time,” he says. “I'm the benefactor of that, because it frees up my bandwidth to do other things.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Dean Gillian Lester on AI and the Future of Work






How much is artificial intelligence—and the algorithms it generates—changing the experience and nature of work? What does that mean for employees’ privacy and the future of the legal profession?












Gillian Lester, Dean and Lucy G. Moses Professor of Law, is an employment law scholar whose interests include income inequality, public finance policy, workplace law, and the design of social insurance laws and regulations. Here, she shares her insights and ideas about the ways artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the world of work.
Will the exponential growth of AI transform workplaces and the lives of employees in ways similar to past technological advances?
Absolutely. It’s a technological paradigm shift, like the Industrial Revolution. The deep interplay between technology and the nature of work is a reality that goes back to the printing press and, before that, the invention of tools—the march of human progress. Work is always in a dynamic relationship with social and technological change, including automation. There are some jobs that used to take multiple people to do and that now, a single machine can do without human assistance.
Will there be a wholesale loss of jobs?
That question is more complicated. Some jobs will disappear in the short run, for sure—some estimates are that one-quarter of existing jobs in the U.S. and Europe could be replaced entirely by AI, with others being affected to varying degrees. In the longer run, AI will certainly create jobs as well, as innovation begets new forms of production, challenges, and opportunities. The balance between these forces remains to be seen.
What about privacy and AI? Employers are using AI to monitor workers. Amazon surveils warehouse employees with cameras and the scanners they use to track inventory. Many corporations have access to their employees’ emails. Aren’t those examples of an invasion of privacy? 
Surveillance in the workplace is not a new phenomenon. There have always been bosses watching workers to make sure they’re moving the widgets along the assembly line. And there’s nothing per se unlawful about a manager monitoring a worker to measure their productivity and see that the task at hand is getting done. That said, there are more and less humane ways to monitor workers, and it will be important, as AI makes surveillance easier, to attend closely to basic protections of dignity and civil liberties of workers.
What are the legal protections for public and private sector workers in terms of privacy? 
For workers in the public sector, the Constitution doesn’t have a section devoted purely to privacy—although to the extent workplace privacy enjoys any constitutional protection at all, much of it grows out of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence on search and seizure.
For those who don’t work in government, some combination of tort law and state statutes offer a patchwork of privacy protections. So, for example, there might be legislation preventing an employer from monitoring worker productivity by using a hidden camera that also records any conversations the employees might have. As detailed and extensive as legislative and common law privacy protections might appear to be, the devil is in the details. It is often held that so long as a worker has consented to monitoring, surveillance, or a search, the employer is within its right to engage in the practice without legal liability. But that consent can be sweeping. A worker might sign something when they fill out their employment application that states that they hereby consent to whatever monitoring happens in the future—and they might not even remember signing the form. But are they really going to sue for unconscionability of the contract? And if you work at Amazon, and that’s the big local employer, and you need your job, you may not have that much choice about consent to that monitoring. 
What types of workers are most vulnerable to surveillance? 
Workers with less nuanced or complex tasks are more likely to be monitored, and that will tend to track a class hierarchy in the workplace. Workers in the lowest-wage jobs are most likely to be subject to automated monitoring techniques that may be done through invisible electronic means. Workers who are the least advantaged may face the greatest burden of this type of monitoring. Gig workers—the Uber drivers, the TaskRabbit workers—may be using their own phones, but the platform they work with is monitoring them; it’s just wired into the system, and that’s part of the deal. But those gig workers are also independent contractors and not defined as employees for purposes of laws that might exist to protect employees and require, for example, their consent. So, gig workers beware: You may be subject to a great deal of surveillance enabled by the technology platform you need to do your job.
Switching to the legal profession, many law students and young lawyers are worried that AI and ChatGPT will take away their jobs. Is that a reasonable fear?
AI makes certain tasks that primarily junior lawyers have done in the past much easier. ChatGPT can write a reasonably competent memorandum that will cite cases and synthesize precedents in a particular area, and produce a first-draft level narrative account in an area of law. It can also be useful in taking complicated language and breaking it down into simpler language. But there are absolute hazards associated with overdependence on ChatGPT. It can invent cases that don’t actually exist, and it can make assertions that are overly confident. You really need to check all citations and make sure everything is correct as well as balanced. When you’re a lawyer, if you get things wrong, the consequences are very serious. 
What are some unique lawyering skills that AI can’t replace?
When you’re training to be a lawyer, a big piece of what you’re learning is to exercise nuanced judgment in hard situations where the answers aren’t obvious. And bots are not so good at looking at all circumstances; what they know is what they see in the database. But what they don’t know is the preferences of the client, the risks of different strategies in light of the idiosyncrasies of the parties, and so on. A bot can’t “read the room” in a negotiation or a courtroom. These are real limitations that bring into sharp relief the distinctiveness of human judgment, as well as the interpersonal, relational side of lawyering.
There’s so much fear about AI. What do you see as the upside?
This new technology will be a game changer in the advancement of human knowledge, creating untold new possibilities, new innovations, and new frontiers of human activity.

  Machine learning helped Waseem Alshikh plow through textbooks in college. Now he’s putting generative AI to work, creating content for hundreds of companies.
Born and raised in Syria, Alshikh spoke no English, but he was fluent in software, a talent that served him well when he arrived at college in Lebanon.
“The first day they gave me a stack of textbooks, each one a thousand pages thick, and all of it in English,” he recalled.
So, he wrote a program — a crude but effective statistical classifier that summarized the books — then he studied the summaries.
From Concept to Company
In 2014, he shared his story with May Habib, an entrepreneur he met while working in Dubai. They agreed to create a startup that could help marketing departments — which are always pressured to do more with less — use machine learning to quickly create copy for their web pages, blogs, ads and more.
“Initially, the tech was not there, until transformer models were announced — that was something we could build on,” said Alshikh, the startup’s CTO.
Writer co-founders Habib, CEO, and Alshikh, CTO.
“We found a few engineers and spent almost six months building our first model, a neural network that barely worked and had about 128 million parameters,” an often-used measure of an AI model’s capability.
Along the way, the young company won some business, changed its name to Writer and connected with NVIDIA.
A Startup Accelerated
“Once we got introduced to NVIDIA NeMo, we were able to build industrial-strength models with three, then 20 and now 40 billion parameters, and we’re still scaling,” he said.
NeMo is an application framework that helps companies curate their training datasets, build and customize large language models (LLMs), and run them in production at scale. Organizations everywhere from Korea to Sweden are using it to customize LLMs for their local languages and industries.
“Before NeMo, it took us four and a half months to build a new billion-parameter model. Now we can do it in 16 days — this is mind blowing,” Alshikh said.
Models Make Opportunities
In the first six months of this year, the startup’s team of fewer than 20 AI engineers used NeMo to develop 10 models, each with 30 billion parameters or more.
That translates into big opportunities. Hundreds of businesses now use Writer’s models that NeMo customized for finance, healthcare, retail and other vertical markets.
Writer’s Recap tool creates written summaries from audio recordings of an interview or event.
The startup’s customer list includes household names like Deloitte, L’Oreal, Intuit, Uber and many Fortune 500 companies.
Writer’s success with NeMo is just the start of the story. Dozens of other companies have already downloaded NeMo.
The software will be available soon for anyone to use. It’s part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, full-stack software optimized to accelerate generative AI workloads and backed by enterprise-grade support, security and application programming interface stability.
Writer offers a full-stack platform for enterprise users.
A Trillion API Calls a Month
Some customers run Writer’s models on their own systems or cloud services. Others ask Writer to host the models, or they use Writer’s API.
“Our cloud infrastructure, managed basically by two people, hosts a trillion API calls a month — we’re generating 90,000 words a second,” Alshikh said. “We’re delivering high-quality models that compete with products from companies with larger teams and bigger budgets.”
NVIDIA NeMo supports an end-to-end flow for generative AI from data curation to inference.
Writer uses the Triton Inference Server that’s packaged with NeMo to run models in production for its customers. Alshikh reports that Triton, used by many companies running LLMs, enables lower latency and greater throughput than alternative programs.
“This means you can run a service for $20,000, instead of $100,000, so we can invest more in building meaningful features,” he said.
A Wide Horizon
Writer is also a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that nurtures cutting-edge startups. “Thanks to Inception, we got early access to NeMo and some amazing people who guided us through the process of finding and using the tools we need,” he said.
Now that Writer’s text products are getting traction, Alshikh, who splits his time between homes in Florida and California, is searching the horizon for what’s next. In today’s broad frontier of generative AI, he sees opportunities in images, audio, video, 3D — maybe all of the above.
“We see multimodality as the future,” he said.

AI cybersecurity pioneer, BlackBerry, calls for caution with consumer-grade Generative AI tools in the workplace 
WATERLOO, ON, Aug. 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today released new research revealing that 75% of organizations worldwide are currently implementing or considering bans on ChatGPT and other Generative AI applications within the workplace. 61% of those deploying or considering bans said the measures are intended as long term or permanent, with risks to data security, privacy, and corporate reputation driving decisions to take action. 83% also voiced concerns that unsecured apps pose a cybersecurity threat to their corporate IT environment.
Despite their inclination towards outright bans, the majority also recognize the opportunity for Generative AI applications in the workplace to increase efficiency (55%) and innovation (52%), and enhance creativity (51%). When it comes to using Generative AI tools for cybersecurity defense, the majority of respondents (81%) remained in favour, suggesting that IT decision makers don't want to be caught flat-footed and give cyber criminals the upper hand.
Shishir Singh, Chief Technology Officer, Cybersecurity, at BlackBerry calls for organizations to take a cautious yet dynamic approach to Generative AI applications in the workplace, saying: ""Banning Generative AI applications in the workplace can mean a wealth of potential business benefits are quashed. At BlackBerry, the pioneer of AI cybersecurity, we are innovating with enterprise-grade Generative AI, keeping a steady focus on value over hype, and are exercising caution with unsecured consumer Generative AI tools. As platforms mature and regulations take effect, flexibility could be introduced into organizational policies. The key will be in having the right tools in place for visibility, monitoring and management of applications used in the workplace.""
The research also revealed that although 80% of IT decision makers agree that organizations are within their rights to control the applications that employees use for business purposes, 74% think that such bans signal ""excessive control"" over corporate and BYO devices.
For CIO's and CISO's, unified endpoint management (UEM) provides the required controls over which applications can connect to the corporate environment, ensuring enterprise security together with user privacy by containerizing corporate data. At a time when consumer-grade Generative AI and other unregulated applications are unsecure, an enterprise-grade UEM solution, such as BlackBerry UEM, is critical to organizations.
Join Shishir Singh, CTO, Cybersecurity at BlackBerry, for a BlackBerry LIVE broadcast exploring highlights of the report on August 10, 2023, at 12 p.m. ET. Follow BlackBerry on LinkedIn for updates on how to join the event.

The coming AI era will require new human skillsgetty

When ChatGPT made its debut in November 2022, it changed the world forever. Not only did it become the fastest-growing consumer software application of all time, but it might also be the first wave of artificial intelligence-powered tools that promise to change how humans work, now and into the future. Some have even gone so far as to say that ChatGPT is leading the way for a fourth industrial revolution.

That’s why the majority of HR managers (58%) who participated in a recent survey by TalentLMS agree that the adoption of AI at work is increasing job insecurity among employees—especially those from older generations.

PROMOTED
As a result, 43% of HR executives think their company will face a skills gap because of the rise of AI. That explains why HR managers predict that AI literacy will be a must-have skill for employees, regardless of whether they work in technical or non-technical roles. At the same time, just 14% of employees report receiving any AI training so far.

“To remain relevant all employees should be able to understand, interact with, and leverage AI technologies effectively,” says Thanos Papangelis, CEO and co-founder of Epignosis, the company that builds the TalentLMS learning management system.

An opportunity—and a threat


1/1

The generative power of what ChatGPT can do—producing reams of text in just seconds—truly boggles the mind. It’s no surprise then that just about every organization out there has begun experimenting with ways to leverage that power in one way or another, including automating restaurant drive-throughs.
A separate 2023 survey conducted by TalentLMS on the topic of AI tools like ChatGPT found that 76% of employees estimate that most daily tasks will be done with the help of AI over time.
Not surprisingly, nearly half of the respondents to that same survey (44%) said they fear that AI will replace them in the future.
“AI is a threat and an opportunity at the same time,” says Papangelis.
To adapt to this coming AI era, Papangelis says that employees should embrace the new technology, understanding that being able to use AI systems will help them remain competitive in the fast-evolving job market, adapt to changing work dynamics, and seize emerging roles that require AI integration.

Unlocking AI with professional skills
One of the most interesting and counterintuitive findings from the TalentLMS research is that the skills employees will need to thrive in the AI era go beyond coding or tech skills.
“Our survey showed that even in an era when artificial intelligence will dominate the world of work, soft skills will remain important,” says Papangelis. “In most cases, strong soft skills will help employees stand out and excel in the AI-driven workplace, while AI systems and tools will mainly take over processes and tasks that are repetitive.”
I have long preferred the term “professional” skills over “soft” skills, but I get Papangelis’s point—especially when you look at the three skills areas that HR managers say they will prioritize when looking to hire employees in the AI era:


Interpersonal skills: Active listening, managing people, creating synergies;
Cognitive skills: Problem-solving, creativity, originality, imagination, ability to learn;
Self-management skills: Adaptability, decision-making and ownership, and planning.


When I asked Papangelis about why professional skills like these will matter when applied to AI, he told me that AI is not a substitute for skills like empathy, emotional intelligence, creativity and critical thinking.
“Professional and interpersonal skills play a crucial role in collaboration, problem-solving, and innovation, which are areas where AI often falls short,” he says. “Additionally, as AI becomes more integrated into the workplace, employees will need to work alongside AI systems, making effective communication and teamwork essential for achieving optimal results.”
In other words, it’s your humanity that will make you all the more valuable in the age of AI.

Why it’s humans who will make AI work
Despite AI's impressive ability to process vast amounts of data and provide insights, it still lacks human-like cognitive abilities in certain areas.
“Human imagination, creativity, and problem-solving are essential skills for innovation, thinking outside the box, and tackling complex, non-routine challenges,:” says Papangelis. “AI will work with humans side by side and augment human decision-making. But it is still dependent on our input and prompts to function optimally, particularly in areas requiring creative problem-solving and imagination—especially for complex tasks.”
That’s why the most essential interpersonal skill according to HR managers is the ability to listen—a universal skill that is broadly applicable regardless of job role.
“Even in an AI-dominated world attentive listening builds bonds of understanding between people and leads to an environment of respect, enriched with diverse opinions,” says Papangelis. “Furthermore, AI implementation often involves collaborative efforts. Effectively communicating ideas, understanding the needs of various stakeholders, and managing teams are all essential for successful AI projects.”
Papangelis also notes that AI applications in areas such as customer service rely on understanding and addressing human preferences, emotions and concerns.
“Organizations can benefit from this skill on multiple fronts, from having exceptional teamwork and smooth workflows to building meaningful workplaces,” he says.

Room for skepticism
While it’s easy to be amazed by what AI tools like ChatGPT can do, it’s just as important to recognize that it remains far from perfect. For instance, AI algorithms are designed based on data inputs, which may include biases or inaccuracies. That’s why it remains crucial for people to remain skeptical in a healthy way and to fact-check the results that AI tools produce.
“Fact-checking the results, as well as mastering the art of AI prompts is definitely something that employees should get proper training on in order to be able to harness the full power of AI and avoid its risks,” says Papangelis.
I fully agree that the path forward with AI is not to avoid it, but to find ways to lean into it. That’s how we can truly turn AI from a threat into an opportunity—for everyone.

		Prompt engineering is still telling a computer what to do. Studying large language models and the limits of generative AI will keep your job security.	




 









Artificial intelligence is changing everything. Just ask the CEOs of public companies who can’t seem to stop bringing up the topic on earnings calls. Or ask one CEO, Amazon’s Andy Jassy, who just elevated an AI-oriented exec to his “S-team,” overseeing AI across Amazon. Clearly, AI is a big deal. But what about you, a developer working for one of those businesses? What’s the impact on you?
If you’re worried AI will take your job, relax. It won’t. If you’re worried that AI will write all your code for you while you sip mai tais on a beach, well, it won’t do that, either. As O’Reilly Media Vice President Mike Loukides argues, ChatGPT will absolutely change the way software development is done, but not as dramatically as we sometimes think, and generative AI won’t necessarily make coding easier. Rather, like all technological advances, generative AI enables developers to focus their time more effectively.

[ Coding with AI: Tips and best practices from developers ]

Let’s talk numbers
As Loukides highlights, maybe 20% of a developer’s time is spent writing code. That number might be generous. Given the mix of meetings and other things that crowd a developer’s ability to focus, some peg actual coding at 10%. With this in mind, a coding assistant that promises to magically remove a developer’s coding would not help all that much. Much better would be an AI assistant that promises to show up for all your meetings. (Please? I’d pay lots of money for that.)











 
 
 
However much time a developer spends writing code, AI coding assistants such as Amazon CodeWhisperer or GitHub Copilot can help you use that time much more effectively, as I’ve written. As developer Simon Willison suggests, “ChatGPT (and GitHub Copilot) save me an enormous amount of ‘figuring things out’ time. For everything from writing a for loop in Bash to remembering how to make a cross-domain CORS request in JavaScript—I don’t need to even look things up anymore, I can just prompt it and get the right answer 80% of the time.”

Of course, to know when the answer is right and when it’s wrong, you have to be a fairly experienced developer, as I’ve called out. Less experienced developers won’t know when the syntax or suggestions are simply wrong. But generative AI can make a good developer into a great developer—or at least a much more productive developer. Or not. As Loukides argues, “If 20% of your time is spent coding, and AI-based code generation makes you 50% more efficient, then you’re really only getting about 10% of your time back.” That surplus time could be spent on understanding the user needs so that your coding time is spent on the highest impact code.
But developers do other stuff, too. So far we’ve saved a small percentage of time but haven’t fixed any of the other issues that developers handle. Security. Testing and debugging. Design. Even at the most optimistic projections about AI’s impact on coding, developers are looking at full employment for many years to come.











 
 
 
But maybe the nature of their programming will change.
If it looks like programming and smells like programming
If you’ve spent any time with generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, whether for writing code or editing pictures or something else, you know how important the prompt is. The more detailed the prompt, the better the output. People have started to adorn their LinkedIn profiles with “prompt engineer” job titles. Though a bit meaningless today, they soon won’t be. As Loukides captures, “Writing a detailed prompt really is just a different form of programming. You’re still telling a computer what you want it to do, step by step.”
For developers, it means that in order to save some coding time, you’re going to need to invest time in understanding the underlying large language models that you’re prompting. As Microsoft Research developer Victor Dibia notes, “In my experience, optimizing your prompts (being specific, placement of important instructions, wording, etc.) to work for smaller models does lead to more reliable output behavior for larger models.”











 
 
 
With this step into prompt engineering, we may have entered the next phase of programming. As Loukides points out, “It’s a step towards a new kind of programming that doesn’t require a formally defined syntax or semantics. Programming without virtual punch cards. Programming that doesn’t require you to spend half your time looking up the names and parameters of library functions that you’ve forgotten about.” This is programming, every bit as much as the Java code you wrote last year. But different.
As a developer, you’ve got a long and fulfilling career ahead of you. Generative AI doesn’t eliminate your job, though it’s very likely going to change it. We can call some of this change “prompt engineering,” but it’s still programming, and it still requires smart developers. No one gets a pass from the robot overlords of this AI-fueled future.

All of this is in order to improve its ability to leverage AI in three ways: To do better work for clients, to improve its own operations, and to transform the way it works for clients.

Recently, I caught up once again with Accenture’s Paul Daugherty. Five years after the publication of his book Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI, I took the chance to ask him about the developments we’ve seen since its publication. We also talked about how the arrival of generative tools like ChatGPT will affect the ongoing AI-driven transformation of enterprises.

Generative AI – the game changer

“Over the course of my career,” says Daugherty, “I’ve been really amazed by technology four times.”
PROMOTED
The first was the Lisa – the early Apple computer that popularized the idea of a personal computer with a graphical user interface. The second was browsing the internet for the first time. The third was the arrival of the smartphone.
“The fourth was about 18 months ago when I started to see the progress in …specifically large language models (LLMs).
“The pace of advancement was becoming breathtaking, and some of the capabilities … to understand language and the generative capabilities to create content. Not just diagnose and evaluate or predict …really is game-changing in terms of the impact on business.""

Amazing though it undoubtedly can be, Paul still sees businesses struggling to work out how and where to apply it. Often it isn’t that they have problems identifying use cases – there are plenty of them. Rather, stumbling blocks are around understanding which ones are likely to help them achieve business goals and where investment should be prioritized.

This is backed up by recent stats collated by Accenture that shows that 98 percent of executives believe generative AI will be essential to their strategy going forward.
“So that shows you the level of interest and the impact that executives see this having on their business,"" says Daugherty.

How Accenture is Using AI 
Potential applications fit into one of the three categories mentioned at the start of the article. Further to that, they are broken down into five types of applications: creating, automating, advising, protecting and coding.
Accenture’s digital media business, Song, is a flagship for its use of creative, generative AI. Song is involved with innovating in content creation by understanding the plethora of new tools that are available. Client use cases it is involved with range from marketing and outreach to drafting regulatory documents for life sciences companies.
It has also assisted banking customers with automating back-office processes using GPT-3.5 and implemented its advisory capabilities in customer services operations.
The “protect” implementations are showcased by a worker safety solution created for energy companies. This involves pulling together real-time information on what is happening in a facility in order to improve safety outcomes.
And coding refers to using the super-human ability of LLMs to generate computer code, which enables software developers to become more efficient and productive.
Altogether, Daugherty tells me, Accenture is involved with helping over 100 of its clients implement generative AI projects.
Investing in Capabilities 
Not all of the $3 billion in investment that Accenture has just announced it will make in its AI and data capabilities will go on generative AI.
“Generative AI is clearly game-changing for all the reasons I've talked about – but data and AI broadly have tremendous opportunities for companies,"" says Daugherty.
“It’s not even just about AI – it’s about data and how you pull together the data foundations, the modern data platforms and the cloud-based platform to drive the opportunity.”
As well as doubling the size of the data and AI team, Accenture has developed a tool called AI Navigator, designed to help its clients find their way through the baffling and ever-expanding range of enterprise AI opportunities open to them.
What models does a business need to work with, and how can they be used? Is it best to just use an existing API? Does data need fine-tuning or customizing? How can prompt engineering be used? ""That's what the AI navigator for Enterprise will help our clients with,"" says Daugherty.
Responsible AI
We understand that algorithmic bias can create societal inequalities and decision-making done by opaque black box machinery, incomprehensible to most humans, has the potential to cause harm.
Then there’s the potential for a breach of privacy related to computer vision applications such as facial recognition.
These issues (and many more) have made us aware of the importance of pursuing ""responsible AI.""
Daugherty tells me that – as far as he is aware, at least - Accenture was the first organization to establish a formal compliance program around responsible AI.
“It’s even more critical with generative AI … we’re working with a lot of stakeholders, regulators and governments, as well as our clients, to establish … responsible AI capabilities.”
This “responsible AI framework” ensures that questions can be asked and answered around matters of bias, fairness, privacy and security relating to any AI projects.
On top of that is a “diagnostic tool” used to evaluate the risk level of any AI-related work.
Daugherty says, ""There are certain types of AI categorized as high risk, versus … different levels of risk … and do you know, in your organization, where are you using what might be considered high-risk AI?
“I would submit most organizations really wouldn’t have an idea right now.”
Part of the answer lies in having a solid and reliable inventory of every application within an organization that involves AI. This means that each one can be individually risk assessed and monitored for outcomes as stakeholders build their own understanding of what has to be done to ensure AI is used responsibly.
The Future?
Where do Daugherty and Accenture see this all leading? And what other technologies will they be putting to work alongside AI to accelerate this wave of digital transformation?
Accenture’s 2023 technology vision document – titled When Atoms Meet Bits – highlights digital identity, trust and transparency, next-generation AI and what it refers to as “science technology” as the biggest trends to watch.
And while some believe the concept has gone off the boil, Daugherty is happy to report that he believes “The metaverse is alive and well.”
“The idea of making the two-dimensional digital world three-dimensional is real. There's a lot of activity happening around the metaverse; witness Apple’s new headset launch.”
As well as generative AI, next-generation AI covers a range of frameworks and concepts, including ""common sense AI"" and explainable AI.
Then there are next-generation computing architectures, including quantum computing and biocomputing. The first of which is already being implemented in Accenture client deliveries.
And after that? Only the final frontier: “There are lots of interesting advances happening in space technology, both what happens in space … satellite communications … experiments in space. And also how you can use information from space [like] low-Earth orbit satellites for transformative applications back on Earth.”

The rapid adoption of generative AI models after the launch of ChatGPT promises to radically change how enterprises do business and interact with customers and suppliers.








Generative AI can support a wide range of business needs, such as writing marketing content, improving customer service, generating source code for software applications and producing business reporting. The numerous benefits of generative AI tools -- especially reduced costs and enhanced work speed and quality -- have encouraged enterprises and individuals alike to test such tools' capabilities in their work.
However, as with any emerging technology, rapid implementation could be risky, opening the door to threat actors to exploit organizations' vulnerabilities. In today's complex IT threat landscape, using generative AI tools without careful consideration could result in catastrophic consequences for enterprises.

Security risks associated with using generative AI in enterprise environments
Understanding the potential risks of using generative AI in an enterprise context is crucial to benefiting from this technology while maintaining regulatory compliance and avoiding security breaches. Keep the following risks in mind when planning a generative AI deployment.
1. Employees exposing sensitive work information
In enterprise environments, users should be cautious about any piece of data they share with others -- including ChatGPT and other AI-powered chatbots.
A noticeable recent incident is the data leakage caused by Samsung employees who shared sensitive data with ChatGPT. Engineers at Samsung uploaded confidential source code to the ChatGPT model, in addition to using the service to create meeting notes and summarize business reports containing sensitive work-related information.



The Samsung case is just one highly publicized example of leaking sensitive information to AI-powered chatbots. Many other companies and employees using generative AI tools could make similar mistakes by revealing sensitive work information, such as internal code, copyrighted materials, trade secrets, personally identifiable information (PII) and confidential business information.
OpenAI's standard policy for ChatGPT is to keep users' records for 30 days to monitor for possible abuse, even if a user chooses to turn off chat history. For companies that integrate ChatGPT into their business processes, this means employees' ChatGPT accounts might contain sensitive information. Thus, a threat actor who successfully compromises employees' ChatGPT accounts could potentially access any sensitive data included in those users' queries and the AI's responses.
2. Security vulnerabilities in AI tools
Like any other software, generative AI tools themselves can contain vulnerabilities that expose companies to cyberthreats.
In March, for example, OpenAI took ChatGPT offline to fix a bug in the chatbot's open source library that had enabled some users to see chat titles from another active user's chat history. It was also possible to see the first message of a newly created conversation in someone else's chat history if both users were active around the same time.
In addition, the same bug revealed the payment-related information of 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus subscribers who were active during a specific time period, including the customers' first and last name, email address, and last four credit card number digits. In another recent incident, the cyberintelligence firm Group-IB found more than 100,000 compromised ChatGPT accounts advertised for sale on dark net marketplaces.
3. Data poisoning and theft
Generative AI tools must be fed with massive amounts of data to work properly. This training data comes from various sources, many of which are publicly available on the internet -- and, in some cases, could include an enterprise's previous interactions with clients.
In a data poisoning attack, threat actors could manipulate the pre-training phase of the AI model's development. By injecting malicious information into the training data set, adversaries could influence the model's prediction behavior down the line, leading to false or otherwise harmful responses.
Another data-related risk involves threat actors stealing the data set used to train a generative AI model. Without sufficient encryption and controls around data access, any sensitive information contained in a model's training data could become visible to attackers who obtain the data set.
4. Breaching compliance obligations
When using AI-powered chatbots in enterprise environments, IT leaders should evaluate the following risks related to violating relevant regulations:

Incorrect responses. AI-powered tools sometimes give false or superficial answers. Exposing customers to misleading information could give rise to legal liability in addition to negatively affecting the enterprise's reputation.
Data leakage. Employees could share sensitive work information, including customers' PII or protected health information (PHI), during conversations with an AI chatbot. This, in turn, could violate regulatory standards such as GDPR, PCI DSS and HIPAA, risking fines and legal action.
Bias. AI models' responses sometimes demonstrate bias on the basis of race, gender or other protected characteristics, which could violate anti-discrimination laws.
Breaching intellectual property and copyright laws. AI-powered tools are trained on massive amounts of data and are typically unable to accurately provide specific sources for their responses. Some of that training data might include copyrighted materials, such as books, magazines and academic journals. Using AI output based on copyrighted works without citation could subject enterprises to legal fines.
Laws concerning chatbot use. Many enterprises have begun integrating ChatGPT and other generative AI tools into their applications, with some using AI-powered chatbots to answer their customers' inquiries immediately. But doing so without informing customers in advance risks penalties under statutes such as California's bot disclosure law.
Data privacy. Some enterprises might want to develop their own generative AI models, a process likely to involve collecting large amounts of training data. If threat actors successfully breach enterprise IT infrastructure and gain unauthorized access to training data, the resulting exposure of sensitive information contained in compromised data sets could violate data privacy laws.




Besides security, generative AI also poses challenges such as algorithmic bias, hallucinations and technical complexity.







Best practices for security when using generative AI tools in the enterprise
To address the numerous security risks associated with generative AI, enterprises should keep the following strategies in mind when implementing generative AI tools.
1. Classify, anonymize and encrypt data before building or integrating generative AI
Enterprises should classify their data before feeding it to chatbots or using it to train generative AI models. Determine which data is acceptable for those use cases, and do not share any other information with AI systems.
Likewise, anonymize sensitive data in training data sets to avoid revealing sensitive information. Encrypt data sets for AI models and all connections to them, and protect the organization's most sensitive data with robust security policies and controls.
2. Train employees on generative AI security risks and create internal usage policies
Employee training is the most critical protective measure to mitigate the risk of generative AI-related cyber attacks. To implement generative AI responsibly, organizations must educate employees about the risks associated with using this technology.
Organizations can set guidelines for generative AI use at work by developing a security and acceptable use policy. Although specifics will vary from organization to organization, a general best practice is to require human oversight. Don't automatically trust content generated by AI; humans should review and edit everything AI tools create.
AI use and security policies should also specifically mention what data can be included in queries to chatbots and what is not permitted. For example, developers should never feed intellectual property, copyrighted materials, PII or PHI into AI tools.
3. Vet generative AI tools for security
Conduct security audits and regular penetration testing exercises against generative AI tools to identify security vulnerabilities before deploying them into production.
Security teams can also train AI tools to recognize and withstand attack attempts by feeding them with examples of cyber attacks. This reduces the likelihood that a hacker will successfully exploit the organization's AI systems.
4. Govern employees' access to sensitive work data
Apply the principle of least privilege within enterprise environments, enabling only authorized personnel to access AI training data sets and the underlying IT infrastructure.
Using an identity and access management tool can help centralize and control employees' access credentials and rights. Likewise, implementing multifactor authentication can help safeguard AI systems and data access.
5. Ensure underlying networks and infrastructure are secure
Deploy AI systems on a dedicated network segment. Using a separate network segment with restricted access to host AI tools enhances both security and availability.
For organizations hosting AI tools in the cloud, select a reputable cloud provider that implements strict security controls and has valid compliance certifications. Ensure all connections to and from cloud infrastructure are encrypted.
6. Keep an eye on compliance requirements, including regularly auditing vendors
Compliance regulations are constantly evolving, and with the uptick in enterprise AI adoption, organizations will likely see more compliance requirements related to generative AI technology.
Enterprises should closely monitor compliance regulations affecting their industry for any changes related to the use of AI systems. As part of this process, when using AI tools from a third-party vendor, regularly review the vendor's security controls and vulnerability assessments. This helps ensure any security weaknesses in the vendor's systems do not traverse into the enterprise's IT environment.

Three-quarters of global businesses are currently implementing or considering bans on ChatGPT and other generative AI applications within the workplace, with risks to data security, privacy, and corporate reputation driving decisions to act. That’s according to new research from Blackberry which found that 61% of companies deploying/considering generative AI bans view the steps long term or permanent. Blackberry’s findings draw from a survey of 2,000 IT decision makers across North America (USA and Canada), Europe (UK, France, Germany, and the Netherlands), Japan, and Australia.
The data come a week after the publication of the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs which details the key security and safety challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), which many generative AI chatbots are built on. It also comes as organizations are facing up to the reality of needing to implement specific generative AI security policies amid the skyrocketing growth and adoption of the technology within businesses. One key question on many people’s minds is the extent to which generative AI is ushering in a new era of shadow IT.
Security concerns driving generative AI bans
Despite the majority of the IT decision makers surveyed recognizing the opportunity for generative AI applications in the workplace to increase efficiency (55%) and innovation (52%), and enhance creativity (51%), 83% voiced concerns that unsecured generative AI apps pose a cybersecurity threat to their corporate IT environment, driving inclination towards complete bans, according to Blackberry. What’s more, while 81% of respondents are in favor of using generative AI tools for cybersecurity defense to avoid being caught flat-footed by cyber criminals, 80% believe organizations are within their rights to control the applications that employees use for business purposes.
 
 
 













 
 

Organizations should take a cautious, yet dynamic approach to generative AI applications in the workplace, said Shishir Singh, CTO cybersecurity at BlackBerry. “Banning generative AI applications in the workplace can mean a wealth of potential business benefits are quashed. As platforms mature and regulations take effect, flexibility could be introduced into organizational policies. The key will be in having the right tools in place for visibility, monitoring and management of applications used in the workplace.”

CISOs must develop generative AI policies that tackle risk without stifling innovation
Appropriate, business-aligned security policies controlling the use of generative AI should be high on the CISO’s agenda right now. The challenge for CISOs is to develop cybersecurity policies that not only embrace and support business adoption of this technology but effectively address risk without stifling innovation. Any who think they can put this off for a year or two to see how generative AI develops, hoping to retrofit a security policy appropriate for generative AI’s pervasiveness later down the line, should carefully consider what happened with shadow IT. Businesses were slow off the mark from a security policy perspective to deal with personal technology when it began being used for corporate activities.

Imagine, if you will, a time when writing code was an arduous task, limited only to those with years of education and experience. A time when, much like a painter creating a masterpiece, each line of code had to be meticulously crafted and curated. Then, like a magic spell, generative AI appeared on the scene and turned the world of programming on its head, as I describe in my book on this topic. If you're finding it hard to imagine, then hold tight, because that's precisely the journey you will undertake based on my interview with Sam McKay, the Founder and CEO of Enterprise DNA.


The Generative AI Revolution
Generative AI has been a game-changer in the realm of programming, especially with the advent of low-code/no-code platforms. Imagine if you could tell a genie to build you an app, and voila! It's done. That's what generative AI feels like. It translates high-level instructions into functional code, turning anyone into a developer, even without extensive coding knowledge. It's like having a universal translator, but instead of languages, it translates abstract ideas into tangible applications.

However, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. As liberating as this sounds, it's crucial to remember that foundational coding skills are still an essential piece of the puzzle. While generative AI can bake the cake, it often needs a human hand to add the icing and sprinkles.

PROMOTED
The Evolution and Breakthroughs in Generative AI
Generative AI has not always been this advanced. Think of it as a superhero origin story, starting from a humble beginning and growing stronger with each challenge. The turning point was the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a brainchild of Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues. GANs are like an artist and a critic locked in an eternal battle, producing incredibly high-quality synthetic data.

Another significant leap was the introduction of transformer-based models, such as the GPT series. Think of these models as diligent students, absorbing sequential data and producing impressive language generation capabilities. From GPT-1 to GPT-4, these models have grown in strength and power, enabling them to generate more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

Generative AI has not just stayed within the confines of academia and research but has made a significant impact across industries and society. It's like a modern-day renaissance, influencing art, creativity, healthcare, virtual reality, gaming, language translation, and assistive technologies. It's akin to having an invisible workforce, creating new content, generating synthetic medical images, translating languages, and even making virtual assistants sound more natural.
Training a generative AI model is akin to training a marathon runner. It requires vast resources, time, and a careful balance to avoid overfitting (where the model memorizes the training data and fails to generalize to new data). Overcoming these challenges is a bit like training a pet; it requires patience, consistency, and a lot of treats (or in this case, computational power and time).
Despite its superpowers, generative AI has its kryptonite. It can sometimes suffer from mode collapse (repetitive and limited output), lack of control over the output, and inference errors. However, with continuous research and development, these issues can be addressed, much like a software update fixing the bugs in a system.
The Ethical Maze of Generative AI
With great power comes great responsibility, and generative AI is no exception. Misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, and content moderation are just a few ethical considerations that we need to navigate carefully.
And that’s short-term concerns. In the long term, experts highlight that AI poses a serious risk of human extinction. It's much like walking a tightrope, balancing the benefits of generative AI while ensuring its responsible use.
The Future Implications
Generative AI will have a profound impact on society. Art and creativity will be revolutionized, with artists collaborating with AI to create new art forms. The entertainment industry will offer personalized and immersive experiences, tailoring content to individual preferences. Brands will use AI for personalized marketing, creating a more targeted interaction with consumers. The job market will see the emergence of new roles, focusing on high-level skills, such as system design, architecture, debugging, and problem-solving.
Generative AI's coding ability will automate repetitive tasks, increase productivity, and enhance collaboration between humans and AI, creating a symbiotic relationship that will redefine the programming landscape. However, programmers will need to navigate ethical considerations and focus on high-level skills to leverage the full potential of this technology. And we need to address extinction risks.
So buckle up, dear readers. We are on the cusp of a generative AI revolution, and it's going to be a thrilling ride.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been in the news, most recently concerning the Hollywood actors’ strike about the potential impact of AI in filmmaking.
Another story involved AI being used to replicate the voice of the Canadian rapper Drake in a track that went viral.
These stories raise questions about performers’ rights, and also lead people to wonder: will AI replace artists?
These questions are also germane given recent advances in generative artificial intelligence 
trained on a vast amount of existing images that have been used to create new images based only on user-provided prompts.

I am a composer who has used creative AI in my music and sound practice for almost two decades. My creative practice and research has focused upon the potential for a collaborative relationship between artists and AI. From my perspective, while we are in a time of disruption where many artists will need to renegotiate terms of their labour in a new technological context, there are also opportunities for different forms of collaboration.
AI-generated images
AI-generated high-quality images range from concept art for video games to photorealistic works. 
Examples of generative AI visual art include fantastical images: 



Image created by the author using dreamstudio.ai using the prompt: ‘Astronaut playing a violin while riding a blue horse in a field of sunflowers fantasy art.’ Notice the floating violin bow and incorrect right hand position.


Works can also mimic the style of existing artists. 



Image created by the author in dreamstudio.ai using the prompt: ‘Young person holding a bullhorn and a red flower in the style of Banksy.’


The freely available online systems used to create the above images are examples of the progress made in artificial intelligence being used to generate novel material. Perhaps the biggest advance is these systems’ ease of use: they are readily usable and accessible to the general public.
Will AI replace artists?
On one hand, the answer to whether AI will replace artists is no. 
Generative AI is a powerful tool that can expand the possibilities of art making and will still require the guiding hand of a human artist. As with any new technology, some creative processes will become both easier and less time-consuming with AI. 
For example, an artist interested in generating visual imagery can suggest a prompt and the AI produces it immediately. Instead of taking hours or days to experiment with an idea, it may take minutes or even seconds.  
The current image-producing systems still require human interaction through both a text prompt and the curation of its output, itself an artistic act. 
On the other hand, these limitations will soon be overcome: human-provided prompts can easily be replaced by generated prompts (which some systems already allow for). 
Research into creative AI has already produced systems that can evaluate their own output through aesthetic judgements (rather than only mimicing its data set).   
As such, there is the very real potential that an endless supply of fully AI-produced artwork will constitute much of the imagery we see online and flood the market. 
Reasons to hope
For many practising artists there are reasons to hope. 
Creative AI can allow some artists greater time and energy to explore artistic avenues, thereby producing not just more art, but potentially more paradigm-shifting art. 
Artist and scholar Philip Galanter, who explores art theory bridging the gap between the cultures of science and the humanities, has defined “generative art” as “any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.”
Generative art-making practices have been around for decades (arguably much longer). Human interaction with these systems can produce truly stunning work.

Current systems can only produce mashups of existing data. While the output may be novel in that a given output may never have existed previously, its esthetic value may be limited. 
AI, labour and creativity
The music industry has been driven by style-replicating processes for decades, in which an artist may produce a genuinely novel work and then others fill the available space around it with variations of that work’s style. It takes true creativity to produce something outside the existing paradigm and AI is nowhere near that stage. 
However, it won’t be long before those producers merely creating the same formulaic songs will be in direct competition with AIs that can do so much more efficiently. 
The generative AI used to recreate Drake’s voice was trained on many copyrighted songs featuring his voice. In such cases, music industry figures argue 
this broke copyright law. In this case, an artist used AI as a tool to create something new; it is doubtful anyone would argue it was the AI itself that was being creative. 
Apart from the legal and ethical question of using his voice, Drake can be considered as being replaced labour. 
In the case of Hollywood actors in danger of having their likenesses reproduced in a similar fashion by an AI, it will be directors and producers that are the creative artists, and the actors the displaced labour.  
In my own work, I have never viewed AI as replacing anyone. Instead, I consider it an alternate creative voice trained on my own esthetics. I have gone out of my way to continue to work with human artists who interact with my systems. 


One movement from “A Walk to Meryton,” the latest work involving generative AI by the author.

My latest album places the musebots, my creative AI, before my own name, but still clearly credits the individual musicians with which I   — and my AI system — collaborated.
In this work, the AI generated the entire composition, including selecting all the individual sounds. My role (after the musebots were coded) was to listen to the final work and decide whether I should ask my human musical collaborators to play with it.
AI is nothing without humans
We are on the precipice of systems being able to generate entire songs. Many of the roadblocks to such generation have been, or are close to being, solved. 
This includes successfully separating the different elements of a song — the melody, the bass, the beat — to allow them to be analyzed individually. Given this information, AI can then begin to understand how music is put together structurally, a major step beyond the current generative models that use simplistic building block methods for creating data.
But like the image-generating systems, AI music will be a mashup of what is already out there. It will require the collaboration of human artists to point it in novel directions and determine whether the output is even worthwhile. 
AI will not replace artists in the future; instead, they will be needed more than ever.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the U.S. labor market, and a couple of new studies have found certain trends in the workplace that could shape the future of work in America. NBC New York’s Linda Gaudino reports.



What to KnowThe U.S. labor market saw 8.6 occupational shifts with most people departing food services, in-person sales and office support positions, according to McKinsey Global Institute.The findings state health, STEM, transportation, warehousing, business and legal professionals are projected to be growing under AI, while office support, customer service, sales, production work and food services are the worst impacted by AI acceleration.About a fifth of U.S. workers are considered to have ""high exposure"" to AI, based on Pew Research Center data.
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the U.S. labor market with advanced language capabilities and automation to enhance work options, but a couple of recent studies have found certain trends in the workplace that could shape the future of work in America.
During the COVID pandemic, from 2019 to 2022, the labor market saw 8.6 occupational shifts with most people leaving food services, in-person sales and office support for other occupations, according to a new report by McKinsey Global Institute.

The study suggests that positions that declined and flourished during the pandemic will keep that trend moving forward. The data expects an additional 12 million occupational shifts may be possible in the next seven years. 
Health, STEM, transportation, warehousing, business and legal professionals are projected to be growing under AI, while office support, customer service, sales, production work and food services are the worst impacted by AI acceleration, based on the research.
Jobs remaining strong with a slower growth trajectory are creatives, art management, property maintenance, education, builders, community service, agriculture and mechanics.

""It's definitely a very powerful tool. Not sure how it's going to affect the future, but definitely something to keep in mind,"" Martha Yin, an investment banker in New York City, said to NBC New York.

The survey found that workers are willing to pivot career paths, while tighter labor markets encourage companies to hire broadly. Position shifts in food and customer services accounted for 2.5 million changes in occupation. 
Fast food counter workers, cooks, waitstaff, retail sales, cashiers and hairstylists are just a few of the most common jobs that people decided to leave to pursue something else.
""No, I don't think AI is going to be that intense. Before it [AI] takes over police officers, I think that's going to take a lot more time because I think that's a little too crazy,"" said Jonathon Cruz, a New Jersey state trooper.
AI tools can identify data patterns, write code, design and strategize with or without human help. With this technology, about 30% of hours currently worked could be automated by 2030, based on the data.
The research stated workers earning less than $40,000 per year are up to 14 times more likely to change occupations by the end of the decade than higher-paid earners.
While the McKinsey Global Institute projects certain occupational shifts due to AI, another recent analysis shows U.S. workers are hopeful concerning the AI impacts.
About a fifth of U.S. workers are considered to have ""high exposure"" to AI, particularly workers who identify as women, Asian, college-educated and high-paid workers, according to the Pew Research Center.
The top industries with the most exposure to AI are science, technology, finance, insurance, real estate and public administration. The industries with the least exposure are managerial, administrative and food services, based on Pew Research.
The Pew survey showed that workers more likely to see AI exposure do not necessarily feel their jobs are at risk. About one-in-four workers in professional, scientific and technical services believe AI will help more than hurt them, with about 20% of workers in government, public administration and military polling the same.
Yin and fellow investment banker, Niko Molina, both shared with NBC New York that they do not feel threatened by AI in their employment, especially as banking relies on building client relationships.
In contrast, four-in-ten workers in hospitality, services and arts are not sure about the influence of AI on their jobs.
""I think it [AI] can change the future, but it could also have a negative impact on the public,"" William Lee, a sneaker business owner, told News 4.

Live00:0000:0000:00 Aug 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney (DIS.N), opens new tab has created a task force to study artificial intelligence and how it can be applied across the entertainment conglomerate, even as Hollywood writers and actors battle to limit the industry's exploitation of the technology.Launched earlier this year, before the Hollywood writers' strike, the group is looking to develop AI applications in-house as well as form partnerships with startups, three sources told Reuters.Advertisement · Scroll to continueAs evidence of its interest, Disney has 11 current job openings seeking candidates with expertise in artificial intelligence or machine learning.The positions touch virtually every corner of the company - from Walt Disney Studios to the company's theme parks and engineering group, Walt Disney Imagineering, to Disney-branded television and the advertising team, which is looking to build a ""next-generation"" AI-powered ad system, according to the job ad descriptions.Advertisement · Scroll to continueA Disney spokesperson declined to comment.One of the sources, an internal advocate who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, said legacy media companies like Disney must either figure out AI or risk obsolescence.This supporter sees AI as one tool to help control the soaring costs of movie and television production, which can swell to $300 million for a major film release like ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" or ""The Little Mermaid."" Such budgets require equally massive box office returns simply to break even. Cost savings would be realized over time, the person said.For its parks business, AI could enhance customer support or create novel interactions, said the second source as well as a former Disney Imagineer, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.The former Imagineer pointed to Project Kiwi, which used machine-learning techniques to create Baby Groot, a small, free-roaming robot that mimics the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" character's movements and personality.Machine learning, the branch of AI that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed, informs its vision systems, so it is able to recognize and navigate objects in its environment. Someday, Baby Groot will interact with guests, the former Imagineer said.AI has become a powder keg in Hollywood, where writers and actors view it as an existential threat to jobs. It is a central issue in contract negotiations with the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild of America, both of which are on strike.Disney has been careful about how it discusses AI in public. The visual effects supervisors who worked on the latest ""Indiana Jones"" movie emphasized the painstaking labors of more than 100 artists who spent three years seeking to ""de-age"" Harrison Ford so that the octogenarian actor could appear as his younger self in the early minutes of the film.SAG-AFTRA actors and Writers Guild of America (WGA) writers walk the picket line during their ongoing strike outside Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, U.S., July 31, 2023. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab'STEAMBOAT WILLIE'Disney has invested in technological innovation since its earliest days. In 1928 it debuted ""Steamboat Willie"", the first cartoon to feature a synchronized soundtrack. It now holds more than 4,000 patents with applications in theme parks, films and merchandise, according to a search of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office records.Bob Iger, now in his second stint as Disney's chief executive, made the embrace of technology one of his three priorities when he was first named CEO in 2005.Three years later, the company announced a major research and development initiative with top technology universities around the world, funding labs at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It closed the Pittsburgh lab in 2018.Disney's U.S. research group has developed a mixed-reality technology called ""Magic Bench"" that allows people to share a space with a virtual character on screen, without need for special glasses.In Switzerland, Disney Research has been exploring AI, machine learning and visual computing, according to its website. It has spent the last decade creating ""digital humans"" that it describes as ""indistinguishable"" from their corporeal counterparts, or fantasy characters ""puppeteered"" by actors.This technology is used to augment digital effects, not replace human actors, according to a source familiar with the matter.Its Medusa performance capture system has been used to reconstruct actors' faces without using traditional motion-capture techniques, and this technology has been used in more than 40 films, including Marvel Entertainment's ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.""""AI research at Disney goes back a very long time and revolves around all the things you see being discussed today: Can we have something that helps us make movies, games, or conversational robots inside theme parks that people can talk to?"" said one executive who has worked with Disney.Hao Li, CEO and co-founder of Pinscreen, a Los Angeles-based company that creates AI-driven virtual avatars, said he worked on multiple research papers with Disney's lab while studying in Zurich from 2006 to 2010.""They basically do research on anything based on performance capture of humans, creating digital faces,"" said Li, a former research lead at Disney-owned Industrial Light & Magic. ""Some of these techniques will be adopted by Disney entities.""Disney Imagineering last year unveiled the company's first initiatives in an AI-driven character experience, the D3-09 cabin droid in the Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser hotel, which answered questions on a video screen and learned and changed based on conversations with guests.""Not only is she a great character to interact with and always available in your cabin, which I think is very cool, behind the scenes, it's a very cool piece of technology,"" Imagineering executive Scott Trowbridge said at the time.The Technology Roundup newsletter brings the latest news and trends straight to your inbox.

As AI technologies continue to evolve at a rapid pace, HR leaders may want to begin using or increase their department's use of AI to take advantage of some of its potential benefits, like reducing user error and saving time. However, HR leaders should be aware of some of AI's disadvantages before incorporating it into their department's processes.







While AI use isn't a new concept in HR, machine learning and generative AI have brought it to the front of the cultural conversation. Generative AI can, for example, help HR employees answer employee questions. But HR leaders should consider problems like bias in AI, as these problems can lead to major consequences.
Here are some key points to consider.

The pros of using AI in HR
Some of the benefits of using AI in HR involve HR professionals using it to help them with their work and AI removing the possibility of human error.
1. AI can save time
AI can potentially offer significant time savings for HR departments by eliminating routine tasks.

Julia Lamm

For example, generative AI can assist with tasks such as fielding routine employee inquiries, said Julia Lamm, workforce transformation partner at PwC, an international professional services firm headquartered in London. A generative AI engine can answer questions about vacation allocation or the process involved when an individual is applying for a leave of absence. HR employees could also potentially use generative AI to create the internal announcements they regularly distribute throughout their organization's communications channels.
AI can also potentially help with more knowledge-intensive projects, such as training content development.
One of Lamm's clients used a generative AI tool to develop a production script for a training video about ethics and compliance.
""It was a really solid first draft that they said they might have spent a couple of weeks working on [otherwise],"" she said.
2. AI can reduce errors
HR employees may make mistakes when entering data. Using AI can help solve that problem.

Alexander Kriebitz

Factors that compromise how humans perform their jobs, such as fatigue, don't affect AI, said Alexander Kriebitz, researcher at the Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.
""For those tasks that can be replicated [and] that are very standardized, AI appears to be better than human beings,"" Kriebitz said.


The cons of using AI in HR
HR leaders should be aware of some of the drawbacks of using AI in HR as well. Using AI without knowing about potential consequences can lead to employee distrust and organizational legal risk.
1. AI can be biased
AI bias during the hiring process is one of the biggest drawbacks of using AI in HR. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced this past May that employers using AI hiring tools are liable for potential discriminatory hiring practices.

Paul Starkman

HR leaders must ensure they're adopting products that don't expose their organizations to risk, said Paul Starkman, employment attorney with Clark Hill PLC, a law firm located in Detroit.
""They're going to be responsible for their vendors' decisions and choices, [as well as for] the products that they choose to use in their organization,"" he said.
HR leaders should ask certain questions during the software purchasing process to ensure they're aware of any potential bias.
Company leaders should develop ethical procurement standards for vetting vendors, including those selling AI-driven technology, Kriebitz said. These standards would require vendors to explain how their AI models work in detail. HR leaders should also test AI technology first when deploying it.
""After the test, try to understand -- with your own data, not data provided by the external party -- how the system functions and whether there have been cases of discrimination,"" Kriebitz said.
2. Employees don't trust AI accuracy
While AI may be capable of responding to routine employee inquiries, employees may not be confident that they're receiving accurate information.
Lamm's clients say their HR employees' work has not been reduced by chatbots because employees still follow up with HR to confirm the information.
""I don't think the trust is really there yet,"" Lamm said.
3. Employees and job candidates distrust AI use
Companies must clearly communicate about how they're using AI so their employees -- and, potentially, job candidates -- feel comfortable with organizational operations.
Companies must share the fact that they're using AI, its company uses and the oversight from humans, Starkman said.
""If people think that it's all Big Brother and that we're being managed by machines versus people, that's going to make the employment situation much more adversarial,"" Starkman said.
Transparency is the key.
""[If the AI use isn't transparent, then] it's going to cause more problems than it might be worth,"" Starkman said.

The Big Picture


 The Walt Disney Company has formed a dedicated team to explore the potential of AI in its entertainment empire, despite ongoing strikes by Hollywood writers and actors concerned about AI's influence. 
 Disney has created 11 job positions focused on AI and machine learning, indicating a desire to expand its use of AI across divisions such as studios, theme parks, and advertising. 
 The strikes have caused disruptions in Disney projects, including the production of
 Deadpool 3
, 
Thunderbolts
, and 
Blade
, as unions and studios remain at an impasse over fair treatment, equitable pay, and respect for workers' contributions. 






 The Walt Disney Company has initiated a dedicated team to delve into the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential applications throughout its expansive entertainment empire. This comes amidst ongoing strikes involving the Hollywood writers and actors who aim to limit what they see as the technology's dangerous and growing influence within the industry.

Actors Who Had Major Glow Ups





 Commencing earlier this year, prior to the Hollywood writers' strike, this task force is actively exploring internal AI development avenues and forging partnerships with emerging startups. The company's desire to expand into the world of AI, and by design – costcutting, presents 11 open job positions that specifically seek individuals proficient in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  

 These job opportunities span a wide spectrum within Disney, encompassing divisions ranging from Walt Disney Studios and the inventive unit Walt Disney Imagineering to Disney's theme parks, television ventures, and the advertising sector. It's worth noting that the ad team appears to be pursuing the ability to craft an AI-powered ad system termed ""next-generation,"" as detailed in the descriptions of these job postings.

 Disney's growing interest in expanding their use of A.I. comes hot on the heels of the news that the company was hiring for an R&D Imagineering position that requires expertise in generative AI, indicating their unfortunate interests in seeing how far they can take the potential of AI tools. The company came under fire for debuting their limited series Secret Invasion and trumpeting the opening titles, which had been created using generative AI, in the midst of a strike designed to highlight the fact that AI was taking jobs from skilled workers. 







 How Will The Strike End? 
 As the entertainment industry explores the integration of artificial intelligence into production processes, a parallel struggle is unfolding as actors and writers advocate for their rights. The long-standing issue of inadequate residuals for movies and TV shows persists, offering unacceptable compensation to the very individuals who contributed to the triumph of these projects. The impact of the strike has been significant, causing disruptions in various projects at Disney, such as the production of Deadpool 3, Thunderbolts and Blade. 

 As the impasse continues, both studios and unions find themselves entrenched in the same positions established before the breakdown of pre-strike negotiations. This unfortunately prevailing status quo is continuing to cast a vast shadow of uncertainty across the entertainment industry as the workers strike to earn what is rightfully theirs—fair treatment, equitable pay, and respect.

Prior to joining The Verge, she covered the intersection between technology, finance, and the economy. Aug 9, 2023, 4:55 PM EDTShare this story3 Comments / 3 NewQuizlet, a tool that helps personalize studying for students, recently released a set of new AI-powered features. Quizlet is one of the many educational platforms embracing generative AI to facilitate learning, despite consternation from teachers when ChatGPT first burst into the scene. I no longer have assignments to read, but to do my job, I have to read tons of news articles, reports, and research papers fairly quickly. I wondered: can I use Quizlet to make my job easier and test how much of my beat I actually understand?Oh man, it didn’t turn out well for me. Quizlet released several AI-powered tools on August 8th. Memory Score schedules reviews and tracks scores to help users remember the material. Quick Summary takes key concepts from readings. Brain Beats turn flashcards into songs — a far cry from the mnemonics I used as a kid to remember the order of operations. And Q Chat lets students talk to a ChatGPT-powered tutor. Before adding generative AI, users had to manually add questions to custom flashcards and quick quizzes. Quizlet Plus users, who pay $7.99 a month or $35.99 a year, have unlimited access to the new features. Quizlet gave me early access to one of the features called Magic Notes. (Sadly, I didn’t get to try the song generator.) Magic Notes lets users upload or copy-paste text, and Quizlet summarizes it, then offers an outline, sample essay questions, creates flashcards, and even puts together a practice test. I decided to plug a story by The Verge’s Makena Kelly into Magic Notes. This story is frequently open in my browser as I tend to link back to it often, which means I’ve read it more times than I can count. After pasting the story, Magic Notes generated a bullet-point summary of the article’s main ideas. It offered me a sample essay prompt to discuss the importance of AI companies investing in AI safety, and then there was the practice test. I got a solid D on the practice test, answering nine of the 15 questions correctly. In my defense, some of these questions were nonsensical. Quizlet offered me a list of terms with options for “definitions” and asked me to say whether they matched. (Terms and definitions were sometimes but not always phrased in the form of a question, like on Jeopardy.) For this one, it asked if the definition “Open-sourcing it for researchers and most commercial use” matched the term “What is watermarking in the context of AI-generated content.” Okay, odd phrasing because that’s not how I would define watermarking. The correct answer was: “What did Meta announce about their language model Llama 2?” I’m sorry, but what?!Quizlet’s Magic Notes in action.It did get some questions to mostly make sense. Quizlet prompted me to define AI voice assistants. The answer choices were “What is the importance of responsibility in AI,” “What are measures related to cybersecurity,” “What is the concern regarding enforcement of AI commitments,” and “Which type of AI-generated content would not be covered by watermarking.” The correct answer is the last one. This one was a gimme.Next, I put in one of my stories, thinking I should do better because I wrote the thing, and I feel like I understand what I wrote. Somehow, Quizlet believed the phrase “fostering trust” was an actual term I was looking to define in the story. It isn’t. I simply needed a synonym for “building trust.” Quizlet does say the technology isn’t foolproof and will occasionally return incorrect or problematic answers, so make sure to continue guiding your child while using the features. Quizlet built its new AI features with various generative models, including GPT-3.5. Students were some of the first to embrace generative AI and ChatGPT. This prompted panic from educators who worried kids used the tools to cheat. School districts banned access to ChatGPT. In May, New York rescinded its ban. Since then, generative AI has become more ubiquitous. Like every other sector out there, education-focused platforms want to take advantage. Quizlet is not the only kid-focused startup exploring generative AI for students. Smartphone for Kids maker Pinwheel announced PinwheelGPT, basically ChatGPT for kids with less complex vocabulary. Inside Higher Education said AI in education will grow to a $25 billion industry by 2030 from $2 billion in 2022. Magic Notes did do a pretty good job summarizing the article, and maybe a news story isn’t the best way to test out a study guide. Some news articles summarize an event or talk about company plans; not everything is defined. News assumes a reader already knows the context stories talk about.So I put in Shakespeare Sonnet 116, mainly because I studied it in college a decade ago. Magic Notes did better, and more importantly, I did better in the practice quiz. The questions made sense. For example, who is the author of the sonnet? William Shakespeare, of course. What are tempests in the sonnet? Obstacles or turbulent times. But the quiz still didn’t do well with ambiguity. It asked me to choose the best definition to match with the phrase “Love as an unchanging and unwavering force.” The two choices were “What is the meaning of ‘marriage of true minds’?” and “What is the central theme of Sonnet 116?” I said it was the marriage of two minds; the correct answer is the latter. That is a valid answer, even though I can argue why my choice was right. But I am a literature major and believe literature should be open to interpretation.Quizlet is a tool for students to get an overview of the topics they discuss in class so they have a quicker grasp of the material before a lecture. It is not a place to discuss the choice of nature and time as imagery and relate it to Shakespeare’s life. These questions were fine for that — but, in general, pretty basic.I played with Quizlet’s Magic Notes for a few days and kept pasting in different texts, from research paper abstracts to opinion pieces, to varying degrees of success. It isn’t perfect, though I could see how students can find these AI-powered study tools helpful. It breaks down concepts and saves time when reading denser material. Then again, does no one use CliffsNotes anymore?Comments3 Comments / 3 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeNew chips, new screens, new gadgets | The Vergecast

I played with Quizlet’s Magic Notes for a few days and kept pasting in different texts, from research paper abstracts to opinion pieces, to varying degrees of success. It isn’t perfect, though I could see how students can find these AI-powered study tools helpful. It breaks down concepts and saves time when reading denser material. 

Then again, does no one use CliffsNotes anymore?

For those who don&#039;t know, Kyle McCarley is best known for voicing 9S from Nier Automata, Alm from Fire Emblem: Shadows of Valentia, and Shigeo Kageyama from Mob Psycho. The recent job he&#039;s referring to was called &amp;quot;Researcher, Speech and Audio (University Graduates).&amp;quot;Although that job doesn&#039;t seem to be on LinkedIn anymore, other job postings of a similar nature can still be found on sites like Simplify. The following tweet was the claim from Kyle McCarley, which includes him saying:&amp;quot;They are using your work to train generative AI models.&amp;quot;Kyle McCarley &#9994;@KyleMcCarleyTo all my colleagues working on Hoyoverse games: this is a job posting on their LinkedIn.

He simply wants voice actors to be cautious and try to protect their rights when signing contracts, which is why he previously recommended they send HoYoverse the NAVA AI Rider.It is worth noting that miHoYo has used AI before to voice Lumi_N0va. For example, the following video&#039;s description references that.In the description of the above livestream is a line that says:&amp;quot;Voice&#65306;Anti-Entropy AI&amp;quot;On a related note, Tears of Themis also used AI to replace Jiang Guangtao&#039;s voice when the voice actor was cooperating with police on an investigation at the time. Thus, there is precedence for the company to use artificial intelligence to voice characters.HoYoverse is a subsidiary of miHoYo, so Kyle McCarley&#039;s claims aren&#039;t entirely unfounded. It is worth noting that it&#039;s not just McCarley bringing up worries about AI replacing voice actors in the near future.Other VAs discuss the potential dangers of AI to their workXander Mobus@XanderMobusVOI&#039;ve seen a few folks saying &amp;quot;Oh, they&#039;ll probably just use AI to tweak VA lines, so that&#039;s fine&amp;quot;.

Read to know some of the applications of AI that are impacting industries worldwide.,AI is on top of the business world and making some severe impact. Read to know some of the applications of AI that are impacting industries worldwide.,https://schema.org,,N/A,N/A," A common goal among companies in today’s data-driven world is to become smarter—to know where the market opportunities lie, where supply chain logjams are and where process improvements can be found. Data science has been the fuel behind this trend, and now data science is itself becoming smarter. Thanks to astonishing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and its sub-segments machine learning and deep learning, companies are achieving new levels of efficiency in data analysis that impact their entire business. The rising tide of AI adoption across industries will drive significant growth in the next decade, with AI software revenue set to reach almost $90 billion by 2025. AI’s presence is tantalizing to data scientists and business managers alike who seek to let machines do the number crunching to make the business smarter on a holistic level.
AI on the Fast Track
A leading indicator of a market segment’s growth path can usually be found by following the money trail. Investors and venture capital (VC) firms are always looking for big growth opportunities, and they are finding one now in the AI business. Forbes recently reported that there has been a 14x increase in the number of active AI startups since 2000, and investment into these startups by VC firms has increased 6x in that period. Meanwhile, companies that both build and utilize AI applications are on a similar growth path, with jobs requiring AI skills increasing 4.5x since 2013. If you are looking to start your AI journey, then check out our AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp.
IT Is a Big AI Beneficiary
It should come as no surprise that the department that deals full-time with data—namely the IT organization—is perhaps the biggest beneficiary of AI’s capabilities. A Harvard Business Review study reports that between 34 and 44 percent of global companies they surveyed are using AI to help resolve employee technical support issues (imagine a smart response system to streamline common questions and troubleshoot others), automate internal system enhancements (machine codes can be used to calculate where bottlenecks can be fixed), and ensure that employees only use technology from approved vendors (picture a smart authorization engine that keeps up with daily updates and knows vendor subsidiaries and partners).
But AI Is Cross-enterprise Too
Where else is AI finding a home? Among the most common examples of AI in the enterprise are image recognition and tagging, patient data processing, localization and mapping, predictive maintenance, predicting and thwarting security threats, and intelligent recruitment and HR management techniques. But perhaps the most active adoption is being seen in the marketing and sales operation, where intelligent use of data and the ability to learn from human interactions can produce big financial benefits. In a Statista worldwide survey, 87 percent of current AI adopters said they were using or considering using AI for sales forecasting and for improving e-mail marketing. While sales forecasting is often automated by technology to a point, it can be vastly improved with an AI agent that monitors and reacts to customer interactions and shifting market patterns. Email marketers similarly can create a sense of one-to-one marketing through more intelligent targeting and content creation for various audiences.
The bottom line is also important. McKinsey found that companies who benefit from AI initiatives and have invested in infrastructure to support its scale achieve a three to fifteen percentage point higher profit margin. Healthcare, financial services, and professional services are seeing the greatest increase in their profit margins as a result of AI adoption.
Examples of Companies Taking the Lead in AI Adoption
Here are a few examples of how specific companies in various industries are leveraging AI in their businesses:
According to the McKinsey study, tech giants including Baidu and Google spent between $20B to $30B on AI in 2016, with 90 percent of this spent on R&D and deployment, and 10 percent on AI acquisitions. The current rate of AI investment is 3x external investment growth since 2013. 
Netflix has also achieved impressive results from the AI algorithm it uses to personalize recommendations to its 100 million subscribers worldwide, improving search results and avoiding canceled subscriptions from frustrated customers who couldn’t find what they wanted (with a potential impact of $1B annually). 
Financial data specialist Bloomberg uses techniques like computer vision and natural language processing to improve the breadth of information available through their ubiquitous terminals that financial staff use to access market information. Users can use natural language in queries instead of specialized technical commands, which is analyzed and executed by AI. 
Uber has a core team providing pre-packaged machine learning algorithms 'as-a-service' to its team of mobile app developers, map experts, and autonomous driving teams. These capabilities are used to better predict traveling habits and improve maps using computer vision, and to create algorithms for its autonomous vehicles. 
And Royal Bank of Scotland recently launched a natural language processing AI bot that will answer its banking customer questions and perform simple banking tasks such as money transfers, with the goal to make digital customer support as powerful as face-to-face interaction. 
AI and Machine Learning are revolutionizing the way companies access and process data to become smarter and more efficient organizations. And IT and data science teams are gearing up for the immense benefits of AI in their enterprises.

The impact of artificial intelligence on modern culture are hotly contested. Others believe that AI positively impacts people's daily lives because it can perform mundane and even complex activities more efficiently and effectively than humans can. Yet some worry that AI will lead to increased levels of unemployment, invasion of privacy, and racial profiling.
Can AI Replace Human Intelligence?
The eventual takeover of humanity by AIs and our eventual extinction are not an impossibility.
To assume that the current limitations of AIs in reasoning and decision-making are not indicative of their future capabilities.
It's not out of the question that AI computers trained to respond appropriately to new situations would one day cease to need human supervision.
Artificial intelligence has displaced human labour in today's factories and workshops. In the packing sector, for instance, machines have mostly taken over tasks that were once performed by hand.
Artificial intelligence has mostly supplanted human workers in telemarketing and customer support. The constant availability and low barriers to entry of chatbots have made them popular in these sectors.
Impact of AI
Voice-Based Search
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has had a profound impact on nearly every area of human existence. One AI technology that benefits from AI's ability to streamline processes for its users is speech recognition. The latest innovation can transcribe your voicemails into text for you. It can also teach your speech to issue commands with your voice. As a result, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc., have given this AI-powered speech recognition technology a lot of attention. Devices and software with built-in voice recognition are already commonplace; examples include Amazon's Echo, Apple's Siri, and Google's Home.
AI In Healthcare
The use of AI in healthcare has only recently begun. Machine learning (ML) offers promise in identifying trends within a population, similar to how computer vision (CV) can diagnose diseases using X-rays and NLP (natural language processing) can in medication safety. All of these advancements for patients will come together once we achieve real information interoperability, which supports the safe interchange of health data.
The Impact of AI on Jobs
Artificial intelligence (AI) will have future repercussions for your company. There is the possibility of a significant effect on how your business functions, yet there is no apparent downside. It calls for an optimistic outlook and an eagerness to try something new.
Many sectors of the economy are experiencing profound shifts due to the advent of AI. When applied to commercial processes, AI's ability to recognise patterns and spot anomalies in massive volumes of digital information ushers new avenues of opportunity. It can perform a wide variety of everyday activities competently if trained.
Employees are freed from mundane, repetitive work so they may focus on higher-level technical difficulties or enhance the quality of customer care made possible by the advent of AI.
Business Intelligence
Data produced by customers, tools, and procedures is overwhelming for businesses. People find that the standard business intelligence tools they've been using still need to cut it. Artificial intelligence-driven solutions will soon replace traditional methods like spreadsheets and dashboards. These instruments can automatically probe the data, learn insights, and make recommendations. These resources will transform how businesses leverage information and make decisions.
Education
An area where AI is expected to have a significant impact on education. AI will significantly assist the education sector and system, which needs a considerable overhaul. All that must be done is pinpoint what needs to change and lay out a plan for implementing that change. One factor that could prove to be a game-changer in this regard is the use of AI easy writer in creating a unique, practical, and practically applicable learning path for any subject or topic.
Retail
Artificial intelligence will have profound effects on the retail sector. Retailers will invest heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) to provide superior customer service in the following years. Marketers in the retail industry are anticipated to start using AR/VR capabilities. The popularity of interactive, aesthetically pleasing product catalogues, where the final consumer can try out an item before buying it, is predicted to skyrocket.
Final Thoughts
The market for AI is growing steadily with no signs of slowing down. Artificial intelligence (AI) will be used in nearly every industry to streamline operations. Faster data retrieval and decision-making are two ways AI may help businesses expand.
With multiple industry applications and future potential, AI and ML are currently the hottest markets for careers. If you want to jumpstart your career in this field, then we’ve got the perfect course to help you get started.Start your new AI and ML career today!
