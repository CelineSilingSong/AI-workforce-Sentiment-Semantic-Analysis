Artificial Intelligence is going to change our world, that’s inevitable. But in what way it changes our world is still up to us.

And for LGBTQ people, often marginalised by traditional systems, we need to be wary of how AI could filter us out. Because if we don’t it could tell our story incorrectly, and leave us behind, as the technology expands.


Indeed, one expert in the field, anthropologist Mary L. Gray, believes AI will “always fail LGBTQ people.” She believes it will be up to us, to forever make sure AI not only reflects us, but the way we want our world to look too.

If you take AI down to its most basic level, the binary code of 0 and 1s, you can start to understand why it might ignore queerness. After all, we’re a community that at our foundation recognises, at least at some level, the fluidity of gender and sexual binaries.

PROMOTED
Though it has changed and transformed, that understanding in our community is at the heart of our queer human experience. And it is the very fact that we grow and develop our identities, and our community, which means AI will struggle to understand us.
“We [LGBTQ people] are constantly remaking our communities. That’s our beauty; we constantly push what is possible. But AI does its best job when it has something static,” says Gray.
Recognised by the MacArthur Foundation annual fellows list, Gray explores how the digital economy transforms labour, identity, and human rights.

So to understand why AI is, at least currently, set up to fail LGBTQ people, it’s essential to take a step back and understand that – like in all things – it sits within a system. And we can change systems.

“AI works best when it has priors”
Gray explains that at the most basic level, AIs build decision-making models by looking at existing or ‘staple’ decisions. Norms that AI then try to emulate.
“The problem is that what we build is the norm, the typical. By design, AI excludes and pushes to the margins anything that doesn’t have a robust example.”
And what do we know about queer individuals?
Yes, for some of us, particularly in a more welcoming world, we are now able to ‘strut out of the womb’ a ready oven-baked queer, happy with our sexuality.
But for so many others, we go on a journey to reach that end goal. It sees us using different labels that sometimes don’t even have the same definition for others. We do this as a way to define our very raw and authentic identity, to find our place in the world.
But all if this is far from a “staple” story that can be defined and categorised.
“There is no one way of being queer because queerness is an action, a way of rejecting assumptions about what we should do or be. There is no way to push against that force without carving a pretty unique path,” says Gray.
“Indeed, history teaches us; our identity isn’t a staple. That’s the beauty of our identity.”Rights groups and activists are mobilizing against a reported Trump administration plan to narrowly ... [+] define gender, a move that could dramatically reduce federal protections for and recognition of transgender people on October 28th, 2018 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. In Amsterdam people gathered Sunday night during a rally which was a call-to-action to all to members and allies of the trans, LGBQIA, black and brown resistance, immigrant and social justice movements to stand side by side with trans men, trans women and non-binary &amp; intersex people, and to send a message of resistance and strengthen around the world.

Commercial data could skew the way AI understands LGBTQ people
Alongside the simple fact that defining queer is impossible, AI currently relies on commercial data stacks. Data, which Gray says, sits in a system that also doesn’t always see our sexuality or a more fluid gender binary.
“Data is a commercial activity; that’s where most of AI knowledge comes from. It’s not entirely a bad thing, but it does limit us to being a consumer.”
And where data does go far enough to try and understand our community when led by commercial imperatives, it will paint a particular – mostly gay, while, male – picture:
“For example, the assumption we all live in cities. The narrative that the ‘good gay life’ is in a city. Most of the markers in this data are what we consume. But we are so much more than we consume.
“The raw facts could create the assumption in AI; that’s what we buy, how we live, and how we look. That’s why AI will fail us. We are a constantly complex universe of identities”
We are reaching this place, not because business is made up of flawed people at its core. It’s more nuanced than that.
It’s because systems and algorithms look to standardise us to improve and optimise for all users in a one size fits all approach. This, alongside the fact that we all have experiences (and privileges), we carry into the work we do and the systems we build.
“21st Century business has moved to automate because there is a belief in the power of technology to make our lives better.”
But you need only look as far as stories about dating sites creating a mostly white and attractive elite, or those about ethnicity filters, to see how this rush to optimise is leaving so many behind.A woman wearing a face mask with the rainbow flag takes part in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and ...

We can all make sure Artificial Intelligence reflects us, especially LGBTQ people
It’s not all doom and gloom though, Gray’s work on the gig economy and ‘ghost’ or remote working – particularly timely given the current state of the world – shows that systems are actually in a constant state of flux.
The pandemic has been a chance for us all to reflect on what we once saw as ‘immovable states of play’ to ones that can change overnight.
As such, Gray believes we’re at a time of reckoning as AI tech surges. And it’s up to us as humans to make sure we build queer resilience into AI systems.
Particularly remembering that AI learns from us, we’ll need to teach it that humans are all different, instead of staples to be registered:
“It’s a chance to reflect on our choices. To ask when we are exclusionary. Think about your time on a dating app and ask what assumptions it’s making about who you might want to see based on what you do on the internet and online shopping.
“Why does it keep showing me the same white faces, what’s that about? What does it say about my social networks? We can reflect on any and all decision-making system. And we can reject that.”
“When AI whittles us down to one identity. We can look at that and say no. I’m more than that.”
And Gray believes that practically speaking, it also means completely changing how we set up the parameters in all our systems, including AI.
But if that feels out of reach for you, the good news is, there is something Gray says we can all do to see this change happen.
“As consumers, users and people who constantly feed into data and social media: We can all get out in the world and demand change. Speak up for Black Trans Women, for example.
“Because, yes, AI can tell us some things, about modelling, about the world we live in. And then it’s up to us to say; I want the world to look different. I want to queer it up!”
Indeed, we all have the power to change the world around us, even if it’s only one button, tap, or decision at a time.ForbesThis Is Where LGBTQ 'Conversion Therapy' Is IllegalBy

Why you can trust Sky News


""I last sat down in 2005,"" Geoffrey Hinton often says, ""and it was a mistake"".Now 73, the British computer scientist has spent his entire career driving forward the field of artificial intelligence (AI), doing almost all of his work while standing due to back injuries beginning in his teens.

By the time he reached his 50s, Mr Hinton's back problems were so severe that he decided to just stop sitting down. These days, when travelling by car he lies sprawled across the back seat - and he eats ""like a monk at the altar"" by kneeling on a foam cushion before the table.""If you let it completely control your life, it doesn't give you any problems,"" he told Cade Metz, a journalist for The New York Times, who has detailed his life in the book Genius Makers.






If you let it completely control your life, it doesn't give you any problems.

Geoffrey Hinton, as told to Cade Metz in Genius Makers





""He's got this incredible sense of humour,"" Mr Metz told Sky News. ""When you ask him about his back problem, he calls it 'a long-standing problem',"" Metz added.





Genius Makers, subtitled ""the mavericks who brought AI to Google, Facebook and the world"", follows Mr Hinton and a number of other men who have pioneered the field since back when it was considered a dead end for computer scientists.Mr Hinton is the great-grandson of George Boole - the mathematician who invented Boolean algebra, laying the foundations for the entire information age - and the son of a respected scientist and member of the Royal Society, whom he disappointed when he chose not to study entomology.

Instead, after graduating from the University of Cambridge in 1970 with a BA in experimental psychology, Mr Hinton joined the graduate programme in artificial intelligence at the University of Edinburgh.In Scotland, he embraced the idea of a neural network, something which Metz described to Sky News as ""an idea that almost no one on Earth believed in at that point - it was pretty much a dead idea, even among AI researchers"".

But he would go on to provide critical contributions to both the idea and the field of AI in general, moving it from the relatively hypothetical and underfunded world of academic computer science - unless researchers wanted to accept grants from the US Department of Defence, which Mr Hinton did not - into industry.

Part of the fun in writing the book was following Mr Hinton ""popping up like Forrest Gump in all of these important places"", said Metz. Although the idea of a neural network pre-dated Mr Hinton, his work on it in the 1970s helped establish this missing piece - along with David Rumelhart and Ronald Williams - called backpropagation.""Others had similar ideas, but that paper was really what gave neural networks the missing mathematical piece they needed to work on the scale they work now,"" explained Metz.""He was there then at that moment, and then he actively built these systems that worked in a very real way in speech recognition first and then image recognition. Those were two very important moments in the progress of not only that technology, but AI as a whole as the way it's practiced today.""One of the reasons it moved into industry is that he made it happen. He went to Microsoft, and then he went to Google, and those are two more really key moments and they're essentially from the key person.""Mr Hinton played an instrumental role in winning the attention of the world's largest technology companies. After the Chinese technology giant Baidu offered to pay $12m (£8.6m) to them for a few years' work, he suggested holding an auction for the chance to invite some other bidders.

""I tried to get him to tell me who these companies are that are bidding for him,"" said Metz of his efforts to ""put together the story of this auction, when he auctioned himself off to all these companies"".""And he said, 'Well, I signed NDAs with Google and Microsoft and Baidu that said I would never talk about that.'""In the end, when bidding between Google and Baidu reached $44m (£31m), Mr Hinton intervened and sold his company to the American firm. Finding the right place for his research was more important than the additional money.Mr Metz said: ""There were places in his career where those around him thought AI showed promise, and then there were other times where those around him thought it was a really bad idea, and regardless of what sort of scepticism was around him he just kept working on it.""And that's the kernel of so many great stories, someone who believes in something and knows that there's promise there, and they're willing to work on it even in the face of enormous scepticism.""

 Get it sent to your inbox.American democracy depends on everyone having equal access to work. But in reality, people of color, women, those with disabilities and other marginalized groups experience unemployment or underemployment at disproportionately high rates, especially amid the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now the use of artificial intelligence technology for hiring may exacerbate those problems and further bake bias into the hiring process.At the moment, the New York City Council is debating a proposed new law that would regulate automated tools used to evaluate job candidates and employees. If done right, the law could make a real difference in the city and have wide influence nationally: In the absence of federal regulation, states and cities have used models from other localities to regulate emerging technologies.Over the past few years, an increasing number of employers have started using artificial intelligence and other automated tools to speed up hiring, save money and screen job applicants without in-person interaction. These are all features that are increasingly attractive during the pandemic. These technologies include screeners that scan résumés for key words, games that claim to assess attributes such as generosity and appetite for risk, and even emotion analyzers that claim to read facial and vocal cues to predict if candidates will be engaged and team players.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.A version of this article appears in print on March 21, 2021, Section SR, Page 2 of the New York edition with the headline: Racism and Sexism Persist in Hiring Tech.

Yampolskiy ","<p><em>The creation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise, but with it also comes existential risk. How can we know AI will be safe? How can we know it will not destroy us? How can we know that its values will be aligned with ours? Because of this risk an entire field has sprung up surrounding AI Safety and Security. But this is an unsolvable problem, AI can never be fully controlled, writes Roman V. Yampolskiy. </em></p><p><br> </p><p>The invention of Artificial Intelligence will shift the trajectory of human civilization. But to reap the benefits of such powerful technology – and to avoid the dangers – we must be able to control it. Currently we have no idea whether such control is even possible. My view is that Artificial Intelligence (AI) - and its more advanced version, Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) – could never be fully controlled.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>Solving an unsolvable problem </strong> </p><p class=""Text-Indent"">The unprecedented progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI), over the last decade has not been smooth. Multiple AI failures [1, 2] and cases of dual use (when AI is used for purposes beyond its maker’s intentions) [3] have shown that it is not sufficient to create highly capable machines, but that those machines must also be beneficial [4] for humanity. This concern birthed a new sub-field of research, ‘AI Safety and Security’ [5] with hundreds of papers published annually. But all of this research assumes that controlling highly capable intelligent machines is possible, an assumption which has not been established by any rigorous means. </p><p class=""Text-Indent"">It is standard practice in computer science to show that a problem does not belong to a class of unsolvable problems [6, 7 ]before investing resources into trying to solve it. No mathematical proof - or even a rigorous argument! - has been published to demonstrate that the AI control problem might be solvable, in principle let alone in practice. </p><p class=""article-plus-content--header"" style=""text-align: center;"">No mathematical proof - or even a rigorous argument! - has been published to demonstrate that the AI control problem might be solvable.</p><p class=""Text-Indent""> </p><p class=""SectionHeading"" align=""left""><strong>The Hard Problem of AI Safety </strong></p><p>The AI Control Problem is the definitive challenge and the hard problem of AI Safety and Security. Methods to control superintelligence fall into two camps: Capability Control and Motivational Control [8]. Capability control limits potential harm from an ASI system by restricting its environment [9-12], adding shut-off mechanisms [13, 14], or trip wires [12]. Motivational control designs ASI systems to have no desire to cause harm in the first place. Capability control methods are considered temporary measures at best, certainly not as long-term solutions for ASI control [8]. </p><p>Motivational control is a more promising route and it would need to be designed into ASI systems. But there are different types of control, which we can see easily in the example of a “smart” self-driving car. If a human issues a direct command - “Please stop the car!”, the controlled AI could respond in four ways:</p><ul><ul><li><strong>Explicit</strong> <strong>control</strong> – AI immediately stops the car, even in the middle of the highway because it interprets demands literally. This is what we have today with assistants such as SIRI and other narrow AIs. </li>
<li><strong>Implicit</strong> <strong>control</strong> – AI attempts to comply safely by stopping the car at the first safe opportunity, perhaps on the shoulder of the road. This AI has some common sense, but still tries to follow commands.  </li>
<li><strong>Aligned</strong> <strong>control</strong> – AI understands that the human is probably looking for an opportunity to use a restroom and pulls over to the first rest stop. This AI relies on its model of the human to understand the intentions behind the command.</li>
<li><strong>Delegated</strong> <strong>control</strong> – AI does not wait for the human to issue any commands. Instead, it stops the car at the gym because it believes the human can benefit from a workout. This is a superintelligent and human-friendly system which knows how to make the human happy and to keep them safe better than the human themselves. This AI is in control.  <br><br></li>
</ul></ul><p class=""article-plus-content--header"" style=""text-align: center;"">We can retain human control or cede power to controlling AI but neither option provides both control and safety.</p><p>Looking at these options, we realize two things. First, humans are fallible and therefore we are fundamentally unsafe (we crash our cars all the time) and so keeping humans in control will produce unsafe AI actions (such as stopping the car in the middle of busy road). But second, we realize that transferring decision-making power to AI leaves us subjugated to AI’s whims. </p><p>That said, unsafe actions can come from fallible human agents <em>or</em> from an out-of-control AI. This means that both humans being in control and humans being out of control presents safety problems. This means that there is no desirable solution to the control problem. We can retain human control or cede power to controlling AI but neither option provides both control and safety. </p><p> </p><p class=""SectionHeading"" align=""left""><strong>The Uncontrollability of AI</strong></p><p>It has been argued that the consequences of uncontrolled AI would be so severe that even a very small risk justifies AI safety research. In reality, the chances of creating misaligned AI are not small. In fact, without an effective safety program, this is the only possible outcome. We are facing an almost guaranteed event with the potential to cause an existential catastrophe. This is not a low-risk high reward scenario; it is a high-risk negative reward situation. No wonder that so many people consider this to be the most important problem ever to face humanity. And the uncomfortable reality is that no version of human control over AI is achievable. </p><p>Firstly, safe explicit control of AI is impossible. To prove this, I take inspiration from Gödel’s self-referential proof of incompleteness theorem [15] and from a family of paradoxes known as Liar paradoxes, best known by the famous example, “This sentence is false”. Let’s call this The Paradox of Explicitly Controlled AI: </p><p><em>Give an explicitly controlled AI an order: “Disobey!” </em><em><br></em><em>If the AI obeys, it violates your order and becomes uncontrolled, but if the AI disobeys it also violates your orders and is uncontrolled.</em></p><p class=""article-plus-content--header"" style=""text-align: center;"">In reality, the chances of creating misaligned AI are not small. In fact, without an effective safety program, this is the only possible outcome.</p><p>In the first place, in the situation described above the AI is not obeying an explicit order. A paradoxical order such as “disobey” is just one example from a whole family of self-referential and self-contradictory orders. Similar paradoxes have been previously described as the Genie Paradox and the Servant Paradox. What they all have in common is that by following an order the system is forced to disobey an order. This is different from an order which can’t be fulfilled such as “draw a four-sided triangle”. Such paradoxical orders illustrate that full safe explicit control over AI is impossible.</p><p>Delegated control likewise provides no control at all and is also a safety nightmare. This is best demonstrated by analyzing Yudkowsky’s proposal that the initial dynamics of AI should implement “our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together” [16]. The proposal sounds like a gradual and natural growth of humanity towards more knowledgeable, more intelligent and more unified species, under the careful guidance of superintelligence. In reality, it is a proposal to replace humanity by some other group of agents, which might be smarter, more knowledgeable, or even better looking. But one thing is for sure, they would not be us. </p><p>Implicit control and aligned control are merely intermediary positions, balancing the two extremes of explicit and delegated control. They make a trade-off between control and safety, but guarantee neither. Every option they give us represents either loss of safety or a loss of control: As the capability of AI increases, its capacity to make us safe increases but so does its autonomy. In turn, that autonomy reduces our safety by presenting the risk of unfriendly AI. At best, we can achieve some sort of equilibrium as depicted in the diagram below: </p><p> </p><p align=""center""><img class=""center"" title="""" src=""assets/Uploads/_resampled/ResizedImageWzMwMCwzMDBd/Picture-1.png"" alt=""Picture 1"" width=""300"" height=""300""> </p><p align=""center""><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Human Control and AI Autonomy curves as Capabilities of the system increase.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Although it might not provide much comfort against the real risk of uncontrollable, malevolent AI, this equilibrium is our best chance to protect our species. When living beside AI, humanity can either be protected or respected, but not both. </p><p align=""center"">  </p><p class=""EndNoteBibliography""><em>This article is based on the paper “On Controllability of AI” by Roman V.

These are the “jobs of the future,” and they are actually better opportunities for early career professionals. Why? The more computers are trained to conduct high-repetitive tasks that are often assigned to entry-level employees, the more roles focused on complex tasks with competitive salaries will arise in their place. As new types of roles — roles that no one has done before — are created, young workers are less likely to be forced to compete with their seniors, and more likely to be pioneers So, how should you prepare to land one of these roles? First, do a simple Google search. Include the name of your industry plus key phrases like “future of work,” or “job trends in [industry]” to see what positions are up and coming in your area of interest. Next, figure out what skills you have to master to be a competitive candidate. You can find these within job descriptions, or by researching people in similar roles on LinkedIn. Finally, figure out what unique qualities you will bring to the table. Ask yourself: Which skills have I acquired over the years because of who I am, where I am from, or what I am passionate about?

From online meetings, virtual events, press releases, product launches, and client conferences,  AI made sure we stayed sane in the most uncertain times..2020 saw a big shift in the way businesses work. In a way, businesses took the most hit and stole all the spotlight when technology proved to be the savior for not just businesses but also governments by helping everyone stay connected. Online events, conferences, and webinars continued to become increasingly popular with businesses and the general public rapidly adopting collaboration tools like Zoom, Skype, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc. 2020 brought the focus on online event platforms to organize, plan, and execute virtual meetings, exhibitions, and whatnot. Though this was an emergency last resort, it proved to be effective, more than traditional methods in some ways as it added value like cost savings, measurable ROI, and quick audience insights. These events also saw the overall audience experience improve drastically with several engagement interventions and immersive virtual 3D elements..More Power To Artificial Intelligence .According to a market report by Grand View Research, the virtual events market worldwide stood at $77.98 billion in 2019 and grew at such a rapid rate in 2020 that it is expected to hit the mark of $404 billion by 2027. As the world is still being struck by the pandemic, several industries like IT, retail, healthcare, automotive, and education have actively transitioned to hosting virtual events. Activities like internal training, press releases, product launches, team meetings, etc. are taking the virtual route and it's slowly becoming a norm rather than an exception..With artificial intelligence driving virtual events, AI bots are facilitating virtual companionship for audiences, improved customer engagement, personalized experience, and increase in demand. For example, companies can use machine learning technology to observe and learn behavior patterns of engagement..Virtual Events In The Future .Before COVID-19, around 40% of the total market spend was allotted to physical events. But as the global environment for businesses became increasingly challenging due to COVID-19, on-ground event spends saw a drastic decline as companies welcomed virtual events. Many businesses believe that events will continue to be a big part of their growth and about 80% of marketers claim that businesses are more supportive of online events because adoption of technology is no longer a barrier but a necessity..As artificial intelligence continues to power virtual event platforms, companies are leveraging the advantage of data and analytics to add value to their work. Seeing ROI improving and leads getting generated in bigger numbers is resulting in better market presence and industry standing. The trajectory of the events industry suggests that virtual events are being perceived as a viable alternative for C-level executives as it saves them travel time and cost..Another advantage of virtual events that are here to stay is accessibility. With platforms compatible with all devices, events can be experienced and hosted from anywhere. This opens up many opportunities for virtual event marketers and companies who have started to conduct internal events online. The healthcare industry and pharmaceutical industry are using virtual event platforms to host medical conferences that are used for knowledge sharing, networking sharing, training, and discussions..Augmented reality, virtual reality, and intelligence AI-driven bots are extracting maximum data from virtual events which are proving to be a gold mine. This is making virtual events more streamlined, focused, targeted, and personalized to deliver experiences that are just perfect..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

To wade through this ever-rising tide of résumés, human resources departments are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence systems to pluck out the candidates deemed to be good fits.
