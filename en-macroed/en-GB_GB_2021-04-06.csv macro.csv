Professor Sir Keith Burnett FRS writes following the Royal Society's recent workshop with the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Artificial Intelligence.


I would like to begin by saying how very pleased I was to be asked by the Royal Society to write this blog following our recent workshop with the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Artificial Intelligence (PDF).Beyond the impact of the pandemic - and partly accelerated by it - few subjects are as fundamental and challenging for Science and wider society than the impact of technology on our lives and work. Artificial intelligence in particular feels like a new frontier with uncertain consequences. Questions about the impact of AI on our lives abound. Many of them are sparked by the fear and insecurity which often accompany transformational change. Will I still be able to get a job or will technology make it redundant? Will AI ease our problems or create new and disturbing changes to our experience as citizens? What sort of privacy can we expect and who will decide how these technologies are used for good?Sometimes change comes into our lives without warning. Since the beginning of 2020, Covid-19 has been transforming the world we knew, and its implications are not yet fully clear. A major shift to greater reliance on technology feels inevitable in everything from retail to healthcare and education to the economy. There are other external changes to consider too. Sadly, we cannot help but be aware of heightened political tensions between China and the collection of very different nations we call ‘the West’.So it was an intense and timely pleasure to sit down, courtesy of Zoom, with leading scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Fellows of the Royal Society, to talk about the real issues and questions we see, rather than the lurid tales of science fiction and sensationalist headlines. We came together with a common understanding that technology and AI present some huge and significant challenges for the most important Science we can undertake. But we also recognised there were many unknowns. What can it actually achieve? What are its most important capabilities?As scientists who share a commitment to questions and seeking evidence, we were wary of assuming that our starting place is all it should be, no matter its promise. Are the AI tools we have at the moment really able to address the key problems of Science in this age? I sensed between us both possibility and trepidation. For hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, progress in Science has owed much to breakthroughs in technologies which allow us to explore the universe and ourselves - telescopes and microscopes, lasers and the great Hadron Collider. Just think of those who have opened new vistas of understanding, since the Royal Society was founded in 1660 as an ‘invisible college’ of natural philosophers and physicians committed to verify all statements by an appeal to facts determined by experiment. Let’s take one relatively recent example from the period of my own career as a scientist. A tool designed in the late 1980s to facilitate the sharing of information between physicists at CERN by my colleague Tim Berners-Lee, revolutionised the sharing of information across the world. The World Wide Web gave us an extraordinary ability to make connections and share our insights in new ways.These new technologies continue that trajectory of digital transformation. In recent years we have seen the triumphant success of data analysis and the importance of neural nets. Computer packages tailored for use by scientists have been underpinned by the phenomenal growth of cloud based super computers, amplifying our ability to analyse at speed. Yet as scientists, we are right to be wary of too much hype. We need to be sure we aren’t neglecting the areas where our current capacity is inadequate. Scientists in the UK and China are right to be especially mindful that we do not limit how we frame problems or constrain our understanding of how to address the challenges we face. We should admit that we still know very little about how AI really works within the wider context of Science and why it is so extraordinarily effective at resolving some problems and not others. At such a moment, we require humility and openness. This is another reason to come together with our colleagues from across the world. We are all at the foothills of this field of endeavour, and our own perspectives may be inadequate or vulnerable to cultural blind spots. This is a time to learn together. True the potential of AI is inspiring. In my own experience of mentoring early career scientists from around the world, I’ve had a ring-side seat at the extraordinary impact of machine learning techniques on Science and Medicine. For a young scientist, getting to grips with machine learning is now a capability in many fields. The importance of this fact has led Schmidt Futures to work with Neil Lawrence at Cambridge University on a new Centre to train scientists in these vital techniques. In China, similarly exciting work is underway. The Institute of Automation in Beijing has opened a new centre for brain-inspired intelligence and China has begun planning for new generation AI. This means closing the technology gap with leading countries, funding research, advancing technological development and applications at leading level by 2025, and aiming to be a global leader in research and ethical principles for AI development by 2030. This will demand a combination of basic research, technology development, infrastructure and education but - if our discussions at the Royal Society are anything to go by - there is serious commitment from China to achieving these aims. Yet how sad it would be for Science and the world if we undertook this work on parallel tracks rather than in dialogue with one another. The coming together of our two great scientific bodies is a precious signal that we want to avoid this error. We are thinking as colleagues about what we really need for the future from technology but also from ourselves. These are not necessarily technological questions, but human ones. What’s missing in our understanding? How can we ensure we do not overlook the significance of the ‘roads not taken’? Coming together from our different perspectives and cultures reminds us not to be complacent about how we frame such questions. I think of my long conversations over the years with my Chinese colleagues about the significance of Science to improving the lives of our fellow human beings, and it gives me hope that we can put this powerful technology to good use. Humility is an important starting point for each of us. Just think of the scale of work on AI in China, a country with 30 times the UK population. What would it mean for the world if China were, with us as partners, to truly understand the role of machine learning in smart cities, the efficient use of energy or assessing infection and disease in a vast and changing demographic? What matters is not the AI race but its human purpose. As Chinese and UK scientists came together, we reminded one another there are enormous benefits in having trusted collaborations. This means focusing on AI’s benefits and avoiding its risks – including those which we might not anticipate but are of concerns to others.But I would remind those of us in the UK, that it would be absurd to try contain thinking about AI in the UK or any political domain when almost every one of us has a handheld computer called a smartphone largely made in China. Instead, we need and want to understand how other nations will think about these issues. How will we have those crucial scientific, practical and ethical discussions? In my role as chair of the Nuffield Foundation, I have seen international efforts to create a place where issues can be addressed head on. It’s why we founded the Ada Lovelace Institute as an independent agency along the lines of the Nuffield Council for Bioethics, to consider issues on behalf of all our citizens. Public opinion on AI is also changing.  Western concerns for the primacy of individual privacy and autonomy, for example, are being revisited in the light of the potential to reopen society from the Covid lockdown. Newspapers report on debates about the potential value of vaccine passports, for example. Could we learn from one another now? I certainly listened carefully to the experiences our Chinese Academy of Sciences colleagues as they explained the benefits of health tracking to the citizens of Beijing. Health is, of course, the most immediate and obvious example of the benefits of AI. We have seen wonderful breakthroughs in the identification of diseases such as cancer. Machine learning is rapid and uniquely adept at finding the ‘needle in the haystack’ and in recognising tumours in the human body. By comparing individual images against vast data sets, diagnosis can happen with an accuracy and speed that allows for more effective early intervention. Now we are thinking about how it can help the fight against Covid as we race to contain infection and get ahead of new variants. The history of science teaches that it is very difficult to know where a new technology will lead, owing as much to those who deploy it as the technique itself. Development that are important to medicine, energy, the production of food or insights into the universe, have been used to improve lives and to destroy them. There is no simple way to ensure we make the right choices about how we use AI, but by working together, we will have a better crack at it.The history of the Royal Society is a proud one recognised and honoured by our Chinese friends. Its Fellows have included Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Hawking, Dorothy Hodgkin, Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Tim Berners-Lee. But our understanding is incomplete if we only look for answers within our own number. The mathematics we employ owes much to the Islamic world and the Middle-East. The great physicist Bose was of Indian ancestry, as was our former President Sir Venki Ramakrishnan. The transformative anti-malarial drug artemisinin has its origins in Chinese traditional medicine. It led to Youyou Tu being awarded the Nobel Prize in 2015 for discovering the properties of qinghaosu from the qinghao plant. Now more than ever our scientific endeavour needs to be shaped by a willingness to learn from one another. Of its proud history the Royal Society explains, “We backed James Cook’s journey to track the Transit of Venus. We published the first report in English of inoculation against disease, approved Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine and published Chadwick’s detection of the neutron that would lead to the unleashing of the atom.” As we stand now at another scientific frontier, I am deeply grateful that the Royal Society continues to look outwards, and that our endeavour is one which is open to the questions and insights of scientists of every nation. Our fellow scientists of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have much to teach us. It is this approach of learning from and with one another which will allow us to make the very best of the remarkable powers AI will give us.

The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a somewhat catch-all term that refers to the different possibilities offered by recent technological developments. From machine learning to natural language processing, news organisations can use AI to automate a huge number of tasks that make up the chain of journalistic production, including detecting, extracting and verifying data, producing stories and graphics, publishing (with sorting, selection and prioritisation filters) and automatically tagging articles.
These systems offer numerous advantages: speed in executing complex procedures based on large volumes of data; support for journalistic routines through alerts on events and the provision of draft texts to be supplemented with contextual information; an expansion of media coverage to areas that were previously either not covered or not well covered (the results of matches between ‘small’ sports clubs, for example); optimisation of real-time news coverage; strengthening a media outlet’s ties with its audiences by providing them with personalised context according to their location or preferences; and more.
But there is a flipside to the coin: the efficiency of these systems depends on the availability and the quality of data fed into them. The principle of garbage in, garbage out (GIGO), tried and tested in the IT world, essentially states that without reliable, accurate and precise input, it is impossible to obtain reliable, accurate and precise output.
News automation is the most visible aspect of this phenomenon and has undoubtedly given rise to the most heated debates within the journalistic profession. The idea of ‘robot journalism’ as it is often called has contributed to visions both dystopian and utopian.

At its worst, automation could threaten jobs and journalistic identity by taking over work usually done by humans. At its best, it could lead to a renewal of journalism by taking over repetitive and time-consuming tasks, freeing up journalists to focus on producing content with high added value.

But the automation of journalistic production methods is not limited to the generation of texts. The BBC recently introduced a synthetic voice to read aloud the articles published on its website; last year, Reuters launched an automated video system to cover sports matches.
No AI without human and financial resources
In his 2019 survey of 71 news organisations in 32 countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia, Charlie Beckett, director of the Journalism AI project, reported that nearly four out of ten organisations have already deployed artificial intelligence strategies. The main obstacles to the development of these technologies lie in cultural resistance linked to fears regarding job loss and changing work routines, and sometimes even general hostility to technology. But they are also linked to the high cost of development, which explains why larger companies have greater access to them.
In what could be seen as a charm offensive aimed at easing tensions with newspaper publishers who criticise Google for using their content without compensation, the Google Digital News Innovation Fund has made significant contributions to funding projects in Europe that explore the possibilities of new technologies. At the time of the fund’s launch in 2015, Carlo D’Asaro Biondo, president of strategic partnerships at Google Europe, said the following: “I firmly believe that Google has always wanted to be a friend and partner to the news industry, but I also accept we’ve made some mistakes along the way.” Google DNI has gone on to support no less than 662 projects to the tune of €150 million.
One such project is RADAR (Reporters and Data and Robots) in the UK, which received funding of €706,000. According to the project’s website: “We have built the world’s only automated local news agency. We provide data-driven articles to hundreds of news websites, papers and radio stations across the United Kingdom.” The service is not entirely automated: A team of journalists work closely with the algorithms to ensure editorial control.
In Italy, the SESAAB group received €400,000 to develop algorithms that organise content according to the behaviour of internet users. Its tailor-made recommendation system is intended to increase the volume of subscriptions and with it income so that the journalists at its regional newspapers are able to devote themselves to creating ‘high quality’ content.

There are ways to take advantage of AI tools that don’t require such substantial resources. In addition to technologies developed to meet the specific requirements of a given media outlet, natural language generation software packages are also available which are not particularly out of reach for a news organisation.

According to a report by consultancy firm Gartner, the cost of accessing these platforms ranges from US$250 to US$4,800 a year. Their main advantage lies in the control they offer their end users, who are able to determine the software’s parameters – from choosing data to the form that generated texts will take – without requiring specialised skills. Swiss media group Tamedia opted for this solution in order to automate reporting on popular vote results in Switzerland. The system is capable of generating around 40,000 articles within a few minutes. It took five political journalists two to three days of work to configure ‘Tobi’ as the textbot was called.
The challenges of employment and training
With experiments in automation on the rise, news agencies are amongst the most interested parties despite the rather limited areas that AI covers (sport, the economy, the environment and election results). In a 2017 study, Austrian journalist Alexander Fanta found that a majority of European news agencies had embraced automation. According to Fanta, “machine-written stories lack in depth and critical examination of the presented facts, but can provide a quick summary of news figures or a first version of a story.”
There is currently no evidence to suggest that the automation of news production is linked loss of employment. The only company that has resorted to mass redundancy in a move to ‘fully automate’ is tech giant Microsoft at its MSN News portal. But while rare, there is evidence to suggest that freelancers occasionally lose out on a job to automation, proof that there is no such thing as zero risk against a backdrop of economic fragility for the news media.
But while anxieties regarding employment are legitimate, it is important to remember that journalism is more than just the sum of its parts and the profession’s human character cannot be automated. Journalists provide more than just information. As former journalist and professor at the University of Porto Fernando Zamith argues: “Accuracy requires proper verification. Robots cannot get it right every time.”
Can a computer programme write better articles than a journalist? The Guardian reignited the debate in September 2020 when it published a text written entirely by GPT-3, a language generator developed by American company OpenAI. Despite the software’s prowess, capable of analysing 45 terabytes of data with its 175 billion parameters, it is not without limits. For example, the system does not understand what it is writing and is therefore susceptible to inconsistency. But GPT-3 has broken new ground by offering more in-depth narratives than more traditional language generators.

The danger here is that machines will take over work without human supervision, which is why it is important to develop new editorial skills to shape such systems.

According to researcher Nick Diakopoulos, the United States, which has been a pioneer in automated news, has already seen the emergence of new professional profiles, including work that is both upstream of automated systems (preparation of text templates to be automated, software parameterisation, data quality control) as well as downstream (monitoring of data and content quality).
Integrating these types of skills into journalism education presents a challenge given the large number of subjects that already make up a two-year master’s degree. It would require working on understanding what these algorithms are, studying elements of programming, statistics and probabilities, and addressing aspects related to linguistic engineering and data quality. It would also imply cultivating a necessary critical approach.
At the same time, many voices within academic circles are calling on journalists to develop computational thinking in order to facilitate dialogue with computer scientists. This type of thinking, which consists of breaking down logical problems into sequences, is comparable to journalistic routines, which are also characterised by a succession of choices (sources, angle, story) designed to solve a problem (telling a news story).
Embracing the phenomenon in order to shape its development
Considering that a computerised procedure is based on human choices, which are not neutral by definition, it is not absurd to think that the steps should also be taken in the opposite direction. The “new players in the world of journalism” are computer engineers, linguists and data scientists. Companies that provide the media with technological solutions do not consider themselves to be doing journalism even though they are actively involved in the journalistic production chain.
Professional organisations should reflect on how to conduct inclusive policies, insofar as the exercise of the news media’s social responsibility is as much individual as it is collective. The major challenges of integrating AI technologies into journalism are also in the field of ethics. As French economist Michel Volle writes: “The good and the evil lie in the intention, not in the tool.”
According to a 2017 study by the Tow Centre of Digital Journalism, AI technologies should integrate editorial values into their design. The report also stresses that “readers deserve to be given a transparent methodology of how AI tool were used to perform an analysis, identify a pattern, or report a finding. But that description must be translated into non-technical terms, and told in a concise manner…”.
At the end of 2020, the Council for Mass Media in Finland published a report recommending that the profession’s self-regulatory bodies should not delay in taking up the issues of data processing, choices in computerised procedures and transparency towards audiences. According to the report, if the media councils do not take the lead, others will: “And whoever it is – whether national legislators, the EU or platform companies – they might jeopardise the freedom of the press.”

This is definitely the future of journalism. Media house will need to invest more in media lab or Media academic for internal training and hire more young scientists with strong background in data and computing to drive the growing artificial Intelligence (AI) presence in news practice to power websites and raise the bar of journalism. It will mean more financial investment s at a time  traditional media is staring in a bleak future going by ongoing massive staff  retrenchments of seasoned scribes across the globe and made worse by Covid-pandemic.

The artificial intelligence industry is predicted to be worth $37.9 billion by 2024. Subsets and specialties within AI are developing at record speeds — especially in the remote work and work productivity sectors. Now, many executives are leaning on AI to enhance or support new remote work routines. 


For many executives, scheduling and email productivity may be impacted due to the sheer increase in the number of virtual meetings. So, how do busy executives find solutions to newly created problems? I spoke with Maitrik Kataria, cofounder of email platform Newton and Simform.com, and Dennis Mortensen, founder of scheduling platform x.ai to get their thoughts on how executives and their companies can better use emerging technology in an increasingly remote work environment. 

Shama Hyder: What are the biggest challenges facing executives in terms of time management, scheduling, and email management since Covid?

Dennis Mortensen: One of the more obvious challenges we’re facing is the transition from an asynchronous work environment to an asynchronous one. In a synchronous office setting, it’s easier to call for an impromptu meeting or collaborate brainstorming session. In an asynchronous one, it’s not as easy because you’re not in the same space as your team, so meetings have to be scheduled in advance. I think this is for the better. 

PROMOTED
Often, the need for an impromptu meeting is the symptom of a flawed process somewhere in the organization. We have to learn to better and more efficiently structure our companies to align with the new remote work environment. Communication is a big part of this. Try not to constantly interrupt people with a barrage of Slack messages, but plan out consistent meetings using software, like x.ai scheduling, to respect and empower your colleague’s preferences for when they would like to meet. 
Hyder: Do you think remote executives have struggled with the practice of not being in the office or having their executive assistant right outside their door? 
Mortensen: I think the Executive Assistant as we've known it is becoming a thing of the past. Working with an Executive Assistant is already a luxury that is only afforded to the very few. There are a lot of automated technologies available for communication and scheduling that complete tasks usually reserved for the Assistant.

Hyder: Why is AI part of the solution and how big of a role can it play with scheduling specifically?
Mortensen: I am a big fan of humans doing human work and machines doing machine work. Meaning, let technology automate and do what it does best, and give human beings the space to think creatively and collaboratively.

Hyder: The email management landscape is also changing because it’s an issue. How does Newton cater to an executive client?
Maitrik Kataria: The executive’s standard email experience typically involves more than one email address and device. Newton’s technology means no more switching back and forth: all your emails are in one place. It does more than just send and receive. You could snooze an email if you needed to and schedule an email you don’t want to send right away. Newton brings all the benefits of an executive assistant right into the place where you spend most of your day - your email.
Hyder: What “symptoms” signify that a mostly remote executive is experiencing issues with email and/or schedule?
Kataria: Focus and productivity are the most important benefits of a remote executive. In an office environment, you hire around an idea of offloading work and tasks that keep you on track. When an executive goes remote, they don’t have this support system to fall back on anymore and begin to be a lot more self-reliant. You don’t have anyone to remind you about that email you didn’t reply to, so Newton’s AI feature Recap intelligently detects these and reminds you. You don’t have anyone fielding your calls for you anymore, but Newton’s Tidy Inbox will filter your inbox on your behalf, removing all those spammy promo emails as distractions. With X.ai and Newton, you don’t even need a personal assistant to handle your calendar for you anymore, it’s right there, in your email, at the tap of a button. 
The future of automation and adaptive technologies is the future of work. As we continue to do business in environments that remain fully remote, and amid economic uncertainty, it is important to continually reevaluate your processes and see where you can be more efficient. That’s where these technologies come in and will continue to be major players in 2021 and beyond.

Robots are writing more of what we read on the internet. And artificial intelligence (AI) writing tools are becoming freely available for anyone, including students, to use. 
In a period of rapid change, there are enormous ethical implications for post-human authorship — in which humans and machines collaborate. The study of AI ethics needs to be central to education as we increasingly use machine-generated content to communicate with others.
Robots can write, too
AI robot writers, such as GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) take seconds to create text that seems like it was written by humans. In September, 2020 GPT-3 wrote an entire essay in The Guardian to convince people not to fear artificial intelligence.

AI does this through what’s called natural language processing and generation. This involves converting human language to computer commands and vice versa. To do this, machine algorithms study millions of text samples, words, sentences and paragraphs humans use to gain a general understanding of the context of human language. Then machines use that knowledge to put together text.
As recently as 2019, this kind of technology seemed a long way off. But today, it is readily available.
For example, the free Zyro content generator provides text for websites. I can select the categories “Health and Living” and “Personal Trainer” (I happen to be one, as well as an academic). In two seconds, the following text appears:

I am experienced with personal training, athletic performance, and nutrition. This includes working with children, pregnant women, older adults, people with disabilities, athletes, and anyone looking to achieve a competitive edge, improve their overall health, and overall performance. I also have an interest in alternative health, including wellness coaching and nutrition counselling. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family, the outdoors, and writing.

This sums me up (despite the program knowing nothing about me) and would be fine for my website, if I had one. I have the option to generate more responses, and in two seconds, the program offers:

I am experienced in working with adults and children to improve their overall physical and emotional well-being. I have a strong desire to help you reach your goal […] I love helping others achieve their goals. I love working with others to achieve their goals. I am a mother of two healthy children and a wife to two incredible people.

While this is repetitive and Zyro does not notice the apparent error in the last sentence, these issues would be easy to correct. Text, even for niche purposes, can now be generated in a few clicks. 
There are other digital tools such as paraphrasers and rewriters that can generate up to 1,000 articles from a single seed article, each of them substantially unique. Quillbot and WordAI, for instance, can rapidly rewrite text and make it difficult to detect plagiarism. WordAI boasts “unlimited human quality content at your fingertips”.
Questions for schools and universities
So what does this mean for education, writing, and society? 
Of course, there’s the issue of cheating on essays and other assignments. School and university leaders need to have difficult conversations about what constitutes “authorship” and “editorship” in the post-human age. We are all (already) writing with machines, even just via spelling and grammar checkers.
Tools such as Turnitin — originally developed for detecting plagiarism — are already using more sophisticated means of determining who wrote a text by recognising a human author’s unique “fingerprint”. Part of this involves electronically checking a submitted piece of work against a student’s previous work.
Many student writers are already using AI writing tools. Perhaps, rather than banning or seeking to expose machine collaboration, it should be welcomed as “co-creativity”. Learning to write with machines is an important aspect of the workplace “writing” students will be doing in the future.

      OK computer: to prevent students cheating with AI text-generators, we should bring them into the classroom




AI writers work lightning fast. They can write in multiple languages and can provide images, create metadata, headlines, landing pages, Instagram ads, content ideas, expansions of bullet points and search-engine optimised text, all in seconds. Students need to exploit these machine capabilities, as writers for digital platforms and audiences.
Perhaps assessment should focus more on students’ capacities to use these tools skilfully instead of, or at least in addition to, pursuing “pure” human writing.
But is it fair?
Yet the question of fairness remains. Students who can access better AI writers (more “natural”, with more features) will be able to produce and edit better text. 
Better AI writers are more expensive and are available on monthly plans or high one-off payments wealthy families can afford. This will exacerbate inequality in schooling, unless schools themselves provide excellent AI writers to all.
We will need protocols for who gets credit for a piece of writing. We will need to know who gets cited. We need to know who is legally liable for content and potential harm it may create. We need transparent systems for identifying, verifying and quantifying human content. 




      Read more:
      When does getting help on an assignment turn into cheating?




And most importantly of all, we need to ask whether the use of AI writing tools is fair to all students.
For those who are new to the notion of AI writing, it is worthwhile playing and experimenting with the free tools available online, to better understand what “creation” means in our robot future.

Artificial Intelligence in Logistics – Maximizing Operational Efficiency

By Mitul Makadia -   April 9, 2021 2 446 








With growing complexity and interconnectivity in the supply chain industry, technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning has become central to logistics management. Firms across the globe are increasingly implementing AI to streamline and optimize handling of logistics and inventory management.
Computers can handle huge sets of data at a time, which would otherwise be impossible to humanely take into a single decision-making process. This is why Artificial Intelligence is a boon to Supply Chain Management.
Using numerous data sets and applying intelligent algorithms, a machine can analyse endless possibilities that lead to effective strategizing. AI minimizes the risks of human error.
In short, with the help of AI, operational efficiency can be maximized and costs can be minimized. As per executives and experts within the field, the prediction is clear – AI is here to stay and will further transform these fields over the upcoming years.

Elucidated below are 8 ways AI is revolutionizing the supply chain and logistics management-


Inventory Management
Maintaining the Warehouse
Optimising Shipping Process
Supplier Relationship Management
Workforce Management
Transportation Management
Foreign Language Decoder
Reduced Customer Response Time

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
No business can run properly without a correctly maintained inventory. Both overstocking and understocking can be a detriment. With the right inventory management system, a business can simply concentrate on selling their product instead of managing its storage.
A crucial need for AI in inventory management, other than its ability to ensure the maintenance of stock, is its ability to predict demand. Algorithms are now capable of studying customer demands across vast chunks of data and understand which items will soon be in demand and which might fail to generate enough buzz. This is known as ‘demand forecasting’ and is widely used across businesses and online platforms around the world. Thus instead of relying on real-time demand, a business can be prepared beforehand and take stock accordingly. This has proven to be the most revolutionising aspect of AI in logistics.
MAINTAINING THE WAREHOUSE
With the rise in facial recognition in AI, machines are now capable of handling security. An unmanned warehouse can easily be kept safe by tracking all those who enter and leave it. Furthermore, machines can keep track of items being put on shelves and those leaving the warehouse by simply reading the barcode on the package and updating inventory accordingly.
Unmanned warehouses have taken the fancy of the bigwigs of the online selling game. So far, they have proven to be effective in emulating the methods of manned warehouses while being far more efficient by eliminating human error.
OPTIMISING SHIPPING PROCESS
The effectiveness of AI doesn’t simply diminish when the item leaves inventory. It is also used to predict the best possible shipping route. Machines use graph theory to predict the shipping routes that can balance between the fastest and most cost-effective for the company. This is especially handy for companies that service multiple customers as shipping routes are then predicted to minimise cost while maximising reach for as many customers as possible.
AI is also able to predict traffic conditions and peak hour situations. These are factors that affect a company’s shipping time. By avoiding peak hour traffic and scheduling delivery during the lightest traffic hours, one can ensure that their delivery executives spend less time waiting on roads and more time delivering to even more people. Thus, effectiveness, and in turn, profits are maximised.
SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT
Shipping and logistic management isn’t the only phase of the supply chain process that AI helps maintain. One of the most important aspects of any business is its supplier. Identifying the right suppliers and maintaining a list of each item, corresponding to those suppliers is important. When refilling inventory or recalibrating item needs according to demand, the relationship with one’s suppliers is the deciding factor of how smoothly the transaction will run.
AI can monitor supplier parameters such as cost, credit score, quantifiable past experiences such as delivery speed, and create a list of the best possible options for any given situation. This ensures that a business runs smoothly and the relationship between it and its suppliers remains effective, unbiased and cordial.
WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT
Needless to say, with an effective AI managing your supply chain, dependence on an administrative staff becomes minimum. However, this isn’t the only use case for AI in workforce management. Today, Artificial Intelligence is being effectively used in recruiting employees, training them on the job, monitoring day to day performance, rating their performance as well as segregating their strengths and weaknesses to ensure each employee is assigned to a task they are best suited for.
AI can help an organisation plan its hiring and training process more effectively. This allows for smooth day to day transactions on the floors of the organisation. It also makes the work assignments better suited, leading to happy employees.
TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT
It is usual practice for many businesses to enter into contracts with shipping companies to deliver their goods. Some bigger companies, such as Amazon also have their own shipping division. As we already discussed, AI makes the whole experience a lot smoother when it comes to time and efficiency management for shipping. However, there is a lot more that AI can do. Artificial Intelligence can take away all the issues arising from the human problem.

Whenever there are people driving delivery trucks, there is a limited amount of time they can function. Having multiple drivers on the same route, to cater to the need of a 24×7 delivery system, is expensive. This is where AI in logistics can prove to be a lifesaver by automating the whole driving function. In fact, one of the largest door to door delivery businesses in the world, Amazon, has already shown great faith in automated delivery vehicles. As of 2019, Amazon has a combined investment of over a billion US dollars in Tesla competitor Rivian and autonomous driving startup Aurora. If this is anything to go by, we can safely assume that AI will gradually play an even larger role in building a transportation management solution.
FOREIGN LANGUAGE DECODER
The world is a global village. Despite the language and cultural barriers, every part of the world is consuming everything the other parts serve. As a business today, you are expected to cater to a global audience. As a result, miscommunication is a common problem. And not just miscommunication between the business and the customer, understanding foreign products or market trends may be a problem, as well.
However, with AI, this barrier no longer exists. Moreover, AI customer support systems and chatbots are also far better equipped to handle foreign customers without a business having to go to the trouble of hiring too many offshore support executives. Overall, AI makes the job easier.
REDUCED CUSTOMER RESPONSE TIME
One of the aspects of AI that businesses across the world are now leveraging is its foray into customer service. Chatbots have reduced the customer response time to almost zero and have reduced the number of customer service representatives any business needs to support to a minimum. Apart from being always to the point, polite and effective, chatbots are also a blessing when it comes to dealing with foreign customers who aren’t native speakers of the languages a business supports. AI has ensured much faster and effective customer service and chatbots are one of the primary advancements of AI in logistics.
AI in Logistics Management – Need For Improvement
We have long discussed the advantages of having AI as a part of a business’ supply chain management. But there is still a need for improvement in certain areas of AI in logistics. One of the biggest drawbacks of integrating AI into your system is getting them to work with all the legacy software most established businesses work on. There is also the matter of skill gap. Most employees working with businesses are not well acquainted with the new age scripting languages that support AI and ML systems. This means the business must find apt talent to manage their systems.
Moreover, AI, in its current form, isn’t completely self-sufficient. It still needs human supervision. Given the large volume of data AI systems handle, any error in the system is crucial to spot and can hold a business at ransom if they are solely dependent on AI systems with no backup in place. As is the case with any computer software, there can be security issues affecting a system.
However, training and updating AI models over time with the right expertise can pave the path to determining superiority in the domain of supply chain management.
SOME LEADING COMPANIES THAT USE AI 

Rolls Royce
Back in 2017, Rolls Royce partnered up with Google to build autonomous ships. Using AI, much like self-driving cars, they tried creating ships that can function with a minimum crew. The idea was to replace crew members with intelligent machines that could load and unload cargo, navigate through the ocean, without needing human intervention. The final goal is to make shipping and delivery of goods even faster.
UPS
One of the leading parcel delivery companies, UPS, uses an AI-powered GPS called ORION (On-road Integrated Optimisation and Navigation) to find the fastest and most cost-efficient route for its fleet. With data submitted by customers, drivers, and vehicles, ORION uses an algorithm to detect the optimal route for each delivery. It is a real-time system that modifies the routes depending on current traffic and other conditions.
Marble
Marble is a logistics company that has taken the idea another step further. It uses robots that run on the same AI system as automated cars (LIDAR) to deliver goods to people’s doorsteps. It cuts down the risk of a driver, is environment-friendly, and a fast and cost-effective way of getting the work done.
Lineage
Lineage uses AI to manage its warehouses. The algorithm predicts which items will stay in the warehouse longer and which will leave soon. Based on this, the items that will stay longer are stored towards the back, and the ones that will leave quicker are kept in the front. Using this approach, Lineage has, in fact, increased its efficiency by over 20%.
THE FUTURE
Use of AI in logistics is a relatively new concept, and although it seems to be thriving, a very small percentage of businesses are using it as of now. The rise in the number of organisations that use AI has practically tripled over the past five to six years. By 2021, about 80% of the upcoming technologies will have their foundation in AI. The most investment in AI has been in customer relations as a part of supply chain management. In fact, more than 60% of people prefer to interact with chatbots than actual customer service representatives. 

Although the supply chain has taken a chunk of its volume, AI is hardly limited to warehouses and self-driving cars. It is there when Netflix or YouTube recommends a video or when Facebook shows you a holiday trip similar to the one you had been eyeing for months. AI is working in the background of our constant companions which is our phones. AI is everywhere.
Any business that does not leverage the best of AI in logistics, whether for shipping and logistics management or a transportation management solution, is simply giving up on its chance to grow and keep up with the competition. Choosing the right AI solution for your business is the first step towards future success.

The concern about an artificial intelligence, or AI, workforce shortage in the United States is rapidly becoming a top national security priority. Calls for additional legislative action are mounting as the national security community sees talent as a key enabler in outcompeting China. An increasing number of proposals, including those in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act and others based on the recommendations of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, have the goal of growing and cultivating the domestic AI workforce based on the premise of shortages. 
However, there is little data on actual U.S. AI labor market dynamics to inform whether there is an AI workforce shortage, and if so, what type and to what extent. Moreover, there is no standard definition of “AI workforce.” This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to determine which workers are in short supply and how to best address it.
Workforce shortages generally come in two distinct forms, which is important for targeting policy. The first is a skills shortage in the traditional economic sense: an insufficient supply of talent with specific, in-demand skills often due to high barriers to entry. For example, a critical AI occupation often discussed synonymously with “AI workforce,” computer research scientists, requires years of advanced education and training. Domestic supply is limited, and as a result, the United States also relies on foreign talent.
The second type is a local talent shortage, in an organization or geographic area. There are many possible reasons for local shortages — workers’ geographic preferences, state occupational licensing requirements and, at the organizational level, limited career advancement opportunities, poor hiring practices, uniquely specific skills and/or experience requirements, below market average wages and compensation, among others.
New CSET research provides insight into the reality of U.S. AI talent shortages. We assess the state of the U.S. AI workforce, analyzing traditional economic indicators like employment and wages. We use an occupation-based definition of the AI workforce, enabling analysis using occupational data collected by the federal government over time. We also consider the entire team of talent involved with the design, development and implementation of AI. 
To assess the extent of shortages, we focus on five key occupations: Computer and information research scientists; software developers; mathematicians, statisticians and data scientists; user experience designers and project management specialists.
Although it is difficult to make an evidence-based determination, we find three variations in workforce dynamics across the five occupations. First, extremely strong employment and wage growth for computer and information research scientists over 2015 to 2019, coupled with high barriers to entry, likely indicates there is more demand than supply. Second, in other high-demand occupations such as software developers and data scientists, our analysis suggests existing education pipelines have responded as designed to meet rising demand. Over 2015 to 2018, for example, computer science and engineering were the fastest growing undergraduate majors, adding more than 200,000 new graduates. Third, in the case of project management specialists and user experience designers, we do not find evidence of a gap in demand relative to supply. 
The divergent trends within the AI workforce have implications for future policy. Importantly, we need to prioritize growing, cultivating, and attracting the highest tier of AI talent. Previous CSET research recommends increasing graduate education scholarships and reforming and streamlining immigration pathways for top AI talent entering the U.S. This also involves a better understanding of STEM workforce pipeline leakages domestically, which start early and continue throughout the entire education lifecycle and well into one’s career. 
For technical occupations where talent pipelines are working, we need to ensure their sustainability; for example, by incentivizing AI companies to closely partner with state workforce boards and universities to help schools prepare students with the necessary skills. For nontechnical AI occupations, the diversity of potential backgrounds suggests prioritizing AI literacy education for everyone.
Finally, in the quest to expand the talent pipeline, the prevailing wisdom of the need for a four-year college degree should be carefully considered. The current proliferation of certifications, coding academies and other online courses aimed at upskilling U.S. workers provide an alternate pathway for some. However, it is unclear if most employers are accepting these alternative credentials. This creates a risk of leaving many potentially qualified workers on the sidelines, if non-college graduates are less able to compete.


Effective education and workforce policy requires understanding the relevant labor market dynamics, including insights on the existence of workforce shortages. Our research suggests that policies aimed at equipping America’s talent for tomorrow’s jobs cannot and should not be a one-size-fits-all approach.

April 9 (UPI) -- The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence vice chair said on Friday the United States lacks a strategy to compete with China in military AI.
""The first thing is we have got to do is to take this competition seriously, and we need to win it,"" Robert O. Work, commission vice chair, told reporters at the Pentagon.

He recommended that the Defense Department should spend at least 3.4 percent of its budget on identified AI priorities through its Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.
Work noted that the United States is currently the world leader in AI, but that China has structured its army, private sector and academia to overtake it.

""We have a generational opportunity here for AI to be our future,"" Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Michael S. Groen, JAIC director, added, noting that beyond defense initiatives, AI will be a driver of the U.S. economy.
""We must act now. We need to start putting these pieces into place now,"" Groen said.
Work and Groen spoke Friday after the publication of an NCSAI report suggesting that AI is a groundbreaking and long-term technology, and urging that U.S. dominance in the area is crucial.

""The United States must act now to field AI systems and invest substantially more resources in AI innovation to protect its security, promote its prosperity, and safeguard the future of democracy,"" the 10-page report says in part.
According to the report, the U.S. government is lagging behind competitors at organizing and investing in AI development, and may not be prepared to defend against ""AI-enabled threats and rapidly adopt AI applications for national security purposes.""
""This will be expensive and require a significant change in mindset. America needs White House leadership, Cabinet-member action, and bipartisan Congressional support to win the AI era,"" the report said.
The report calls AI-enhanced capabilities ""the tools of first resort"" for defending against missile and cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns and swarming unmanned enemy aircraft, all of which could occur at speeds that ""human operators will not be able to keep up.""
Its recommendations include military AI readiness by 2025, a digitally literate U.S. workforce and a White House-led strategy for technical competition.
""Our armed forces' competitive military-technical advantage could be lost within the next decade if they do not accelerate the adoption of AI across their missions,"" the report reads.
In March, Groen told an industry conference that the U.S. military must scale up its artificial intelligence use or be left behind by adversaries.

He said that data must be standardized, cloud services must be adopted and AI must be integrated into military operations, adding that while current military use of AI ""is a step in the right direction, we need to start building on it.""
Groen noted that China has said it intends ""to be dominant in AI by 2030,"" while the Pentagon has focused on five-year program objective memorandums looking toward 2027.

Lt. Gen. Michael Groen, leader of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, promoted the efficiencies of AI, particularly for business systems, on the same day the Biden administration announced a topline defense budget proposal of $715 billion, which amounts to an overall decrease, when adjusted for inflation.“In an era of tightening budgets and focus on squeezing out things that are legacy and are not important in the budget, the productivity gains and the efficiency gains that AI can bring to the department, especially through the business process transformation, actually becomes an economic necessity,” Groen said at a press briefing. “So in a squeezed play between modernizing our warfare that moves at machine speed and tighter budgets, AI is doubly necessary.”The JAIC, tasked with increasing the use of artificial intelligence across the department, wants to drive the Pentagon to operate more like a data-driven software company. That includes establishing data feeds and algorithms that are shared across the department.Groen said that implementing those practices would create productivity gains, new insights and improved management across the department.“It really represents a transformation of our operating model,” Groen said. “That operating model will have to create a common data environment where data is shared, data is authoritative, [and] data is available.”He added, “it’s about making our organization, the Department of Defense in this case, as productive and efficient as any of these modern successful data-driven enterprises.”Earlier this month, Groen warned that the department’s biggest strategic threat was its own technological obsolescence and called for the department to invest more in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and resilient networks, that will define the future of warfare. Artificial intelligence and associated technologies underpin the DoD’s plans to stay competitive,  and it’s the JAIC’s responsibly to provide best practices and services to assist organizations on their AI efforts.Providing those services is core to the organization’s pivot to JAIC 2.0, in which it focuses more on providing broad AI-enabling services to department components rather than developing AI products.Under the JAIC 2.0, “we measure our success in the success of others,” Groen said.“We come in as archivists of best practice across the department, and say, ‘Hey, show us how you’re doing that. Let us learn from you,” he said. “And then we can share, ‘Hey, you know, there’s another agency in the department that has a problem very similar to yours and here’s how they’re addressing that.’ So we played broker for information and expertise across agencies, across services across combatant commands.”That shift has recently manifested itself through the release of solicitations to industry for test and evaluation help and data readiness services in an effort to boost its ability to help department components implement artificial intelligence.The JAIC is also viewed as central to AI efforts at the Pentagon by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a congressionally mandated organization that provided recommendations to boost the country’s AI readiness. The report urges the department to be “AI ready” by 2025 and suggests the JAIC take on a broad range of responsibilities, from developing workforce initiatives to advising components on AI development.The JAIC’s prominence has also increased because of a provision in the most recent National Defense Authorization Act that elevated the center’s reporting responsibility to the deputy secretary of defense, a move Groen said gives the JAIC more insight into department priorities and boosts the stature of the center internally.The move allows the deputy secretary and the “rest of the department leadership access to the tools and processes to reinforce their priorities, underline our ethical foundations, integrate our enterprises and transform our business processes,” he said.Bob Work, former deputy secretary of defense and vice chair of the NSCAI, echoed Groen’s comments at the press conference, arguing that AI leadership is core to the department’s future competitiveness.“You have to have top down leadership, you cannot say AI is important and let all of the agencies and subordinate departments figure out what that means,” Work said.About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.

There are abundance of literature on examining the best sci-fi movies ever made and speculating their conversion into reality in times to come..However, though not a sci-fi movie in its truest sense, this genre of children literature provides a vision on artificial intelligence under the garb of a fairy-tale. It would not be wrong to say that this movie is the love child of fairy tale and technology which is typically Tim Burtonesque..The Charlie and the chocolate factory theory .The initial scene in the movie was a tragic one which showed how the boy's father lost his job because machines have replaced the human workforce to screw toothpaste caps. While this scene was a gentle reminder of the fact that machines, robots and humanoids will soon be substituting humans..But the vision doesn't end here as the plot itself has been enveloped in technological advancements..As we slowly enter into the chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka, no other human except the kids and him, falls into our sight. It is only then one of the tourists of the factory raises a question, &quot;if not humans then who runs the factory?&quot;.This very question was striking when the movie itself was released in the year 2005 when the world was not yet familiar with artificial intelligence. However, the answer to it given by Willy Wonka was even more striking to the point of being indigestible..Willy Wonka, clearly fabricated a story about the oompa-loompa tribe. No such tribe exists. Not even in other planets in the galaxy..Clearly, the oompa-loompas were Lilliput humanoids crafted by Willy himself, using artificial intelligence. The oompa-loompas all looked the same performing different tasks and the entire factory was run by those petite humanoids, who in turn were running the machines to manufacture chocolates..In one of the scenes, we saw how the naughty and disobedient children were trapped in television screens. This rings a bell with augmented reality. But the children in fact were not naughty. They were only trying to satiate their curiosities..This resonates with how AI companies perform these days..Moving on, the tour of the factory that was given to the visitors and the audience was actually a tour of the possible technological advancements that were on their ways and in ways they could be adopted by companies to boost sales. The machines that were being used to craft chocolates of different kinds proved that handling too many creative moves is not humanly possible. This adheres to Ledger's &quot;quick creativity&quot; theory. To sum it up, it intends to teach its audience that how chocolate making can be an art..Try to recall that it was made clear that Willy Wonka was the best selling chocolate brand than the others. It was superior to all but its business strategy was mysterious to all as well..Did the movie show us the future?.Tech experts today always re-iterate that the future is digital and AI will be dominant. Charlie and the chocolate factory only held up a mirror of what is the present reality today..It also teaches us the importance of exposing kids to advanced technologies know-how's so that a nation could see the birth of innovations in even triviality..Who knows? May be this movie along with many others were the reason why AI is picking up speed in progress today..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

COLLAGE: Kazi Akib Bin Asad


Despite Klara and the Sun (Faber, 2021) coming out on my birthday, and soft science fiction being not only a genre I regularly read but write, I found myself with no real connection with the Nobel Prize-winning author's latest work. Kazuo Ishiguro, for me, has always been one of ""those writers""; the kind who you're sure write perfectly good stories, but the sheer amount of praise they receive from just about everyone leaves you a little sceptical. (Novel titles like Never Let Me Go surely didn't help). Or maybe it's just me. What I have found, though, once I actually leafed through the pages—and I'm sure this won't come as a surprise to any fans of the author—is that my opinion, one might call it bias, was completely unsubstantiated.



What I found in the 307 pages was indeed the deep meditation several reviewers promised. What I found were the exact many qualities the writer has always been celebrated for, that this particular reviewer had always dismissed with a shrug. The prose, elegantly simple, is as efficient and to-the-point as is Isaac Asimov's, though nowhere near as soulless. The spirit, the ""heart"" that the book's back cover takes great space to write of, was not unlike the humanity you find in a Bradbury or a Le Guin—but its focus, centred so fixedly at the base of human existence, is its own. What I found was a work of  science fiction with no direct analogue, no immediate referent, save for its own maker's. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
""To some extent as a writer you're always in dialogue with your earlier books"", Ishiguro told TIME. ""Part of me wanted to reply to Never Let Me Go (Faber, 2005), which is a very sad book. It's not pessimistic exactly, but it's very sad. I wanted to reply to that vision"". With a story similarly examining the hypothetical, and not wholly unrealistic, future rounded out by artificial intelligence, both novels approach and ultimately deal with the subject in their own ways. If you are anything resembling this reviewer, please do not conceive any notions based on the insipid film adaptations of Never Let Me Go (2010) and the thoroughly fine, if unremarkable, Remains of the Day (1993).



Don't be dissuaded, either, by the platitudes surrounding this novel's release. ""What does it mean to love?"" is a quote you'll find tied around its marketing. The back of the first edition pulls out the quote, ""Do you believe in the human heart?"", which sounds more like a Cher song than the circumstances in which the question is asked in the novel—in the middle of a taut, confused conversation the protagonist has three-quarters of the way through, spoken more literally than may seem without context.



The novel, which follows the narration of ""Artificial Friend"" Klara, far exceeds the sum of its parts. At its core, the story doubles as a Toy Story-coming of age tale, with central figure Josie, the terminally-ill adolescent, kicking the plot into gear. Klara, who is from the start more human than human, is our moral compass and audience surrogate. In pulling off this age-old SF trick, setting the parameters of the narrative around the android's naivety, Ishiguro transforms what might have been ""sick lit"" under lesser hands into a fully realised humanistic portrait of our modern, digitally-enhanced life.
Klara and the Sun, Ishiguro told Publishers Weekly, originally began life as an illustrated children's book, ""about a child who isn't well; confined to her room. She and her doll watch the sun go down until one night they are able to leave the room and visit outside"". It was when his daughter, writer Naomi Ishiguro, interjected that he changed courses. ""She said, no way. You cannot tell this story to children; you would traumatize them"".
Indeed, there is material enough in the novel to cause tremble to the most seasoned adults. We find out how in this world children are ""lifted"", an uncertain process involving genetic modification, and schooled thereon only through phones and tablets (""oblongs"", as Klara identifies them); parents hold ""interaction meetings"" to ensure socialisation; and those families that can't afford their children's ""lifting"" are seen immediately as members of different society.



There is little attempt to mask the technophobia present in the writing, but all the cruel things and cruel people that appear in the book appear in full three dimensions. Characters will often seem hateful, and they will later seem full of love. The advancement of technology is more hindrance than blessing, but Klara, who observes and absorbs humanity, is often the most compassionate in any given situation. Ishiguro has said in the past how in his writing he seeks to make a universal statement, and Klara and the Sun, his first novel in six years, is just that. There is nothing grandiose about it. He doesn't approach it with kid-gloves, nor does he yank our shoulders blaring his message. There is a gentleness to his writing, an assured sense of direction, that makes me regret, above all, my neglecting of his work.
