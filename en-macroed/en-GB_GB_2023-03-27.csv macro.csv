The investment bank said on Monday that “generative” AI systems such as ChatGPT, which can create content that is indistinguishable from human output, could spark a productivity boom that would eventually raise annual global gross domestic product by 7 per cent over a 10-year period.

But if the technology lived up to its promise, it would also bring “significant disruption” to the labour market, exposing the equivalent of 300mn full-time workers across big economies to automation, according to Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani, the paper’s authors. Lawyers and administrative staff would be among those at greatest risk of becoming redundant.

They calculate that roughly two-thirds of jobs in the US and Europe are exposed to some degree of AI automation, based on data on the tasks typically performed in thousands of occupations.

Most people would see less than half of their workload automated and would probably continue in their jobs, with some of their time freed up for more productive activities.

In the US, this should apply to 63 per cent of the workforce, they calculated. A further 30 per cent working in physical or outdoor jobs would be unaffected, although their work might be susceptible to other forms of automation.

But about 7 per cent of US workers are in jobs where at least half of their tasks could be done by generative AI and are vulnerable to replacement.

Goldman said its research pointed to a similar impact in Europe. At a global level, since manual jobs are a bigger share of employment in the developing world, it estimates about a fifth of work could be done by AI — or about 300mn full-time jobs across big economies.

The report will stoke debate over the potential of AI technologies both to revive the rich world’s flagging productivity growth and to create a new class of dispossessed white-collar workers, who risk suffering a similar fate to that of manufacturing workers in the 1980s.

Goldman’s estimates of the impact are more conservative than those of some academic studies, which included the effects of a wider range of related technologies.

A paper published last week by OpenAI, the creator of GPT-4, found that 80 per cent of the US workforce could see at least 10 per cent of their tasks performed by generative AI, based on analysis by human researchers and the company’s machine large language model (LLM).

Europol, the law enforcement agency, also warned this week that rapid advances in generative AI could aid online fraudsters and cyber criminals, so that “dark LLMs . . . may become a key criminal business model of the future”.

Goldman said that if corporate investment in AI continued to grow at a similar pace to software investment in the 1990s, US investment alone could approach 1 per cent of US GDP by 2030.

The Goldman estimates are based on an analysis of US and European data on the tasks typically performed in thousands of different occupations. The researchers assumed that AI would be capable of tasks such as completing tax returns for a small business; evaluating a complex insurance claim; or documenting the results of a crime scene investigation.

They did not envisage AI being adopted for more sensitive tasks such as making a court ruling, checking the status of a patient in critical care or studying international tax laws.",591.0,"{'@type': 'Organization', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'name': 'Financial Times', 'legalName': 'The Financial Times Ltd.', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'url': 'https://im.ft-static.com/m/img/masthead_main.jpg', 'width': 435, 'height': 36}, 'url': 'https://www.ft.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.twitter.com/FT', 'https://www.facebook.com/financialtimes', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/financial-times', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/FinancialTimesVideos', 'https://www.instagram.com/financialtimes']}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Americas', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/americas'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Companies', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/companies'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'EU economy', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/eu-economy'}]",Financial Times,FT.com,http://www.ft.com,N/A,N/A,"About two-thirds of jobs in the US and Europe are exposed to some degree of AI automation, according to research by Goldman Sachs © FT montage/Getty ImagesGenerative AI set to affect 300mn jobs across major economies on x (opens in a new window)Generative AI set to affect 300mn jobs across major economies on facebook (opens in a new window)Generative AI set to affect 300mn jobs across major economies on linkedin (opens in a new window)Generative AI set to affect 300mn jobs across major economies on whatsapp (opens in a new window)

If generative AI lives up to its hype, the workforce in the United States and Europe will be upended, Goldman Sachs reported this week in a sobering and alarming report about AI's ascendance. The investment bank estimates 300 million jobs could be lost or diminished by this fast-growing technology.


Goldman contends automation creates innovation, which leads to new types of jobs. For companies, there will be cost savings thanks to AI. They can deploy their resources toward building and growing businesses, ultimately increasing annual global GDP by 7%.

In recent months, the world has witnessed the ascendency of OpenAI software ChatGPT and DALL-E. ChatGPT surpassed one million users in its first five days of launching, the fastest that any company has ever reached this benchmark.

PROMOTED
Will AI impact Your Job?
Goldman predicts that the growth in AI will mirror the trajectory of past computer and tech products. Just as the world went from giant mainframe computers to modern-day technology, there will be a similar fast-paced growth of AI reshaping the world. AI can pass the attorney bar exam, score brilliantly on the SATs and produce unique artwork.

While the startup ecosystem has stalled due to adverse economic changes, investments in global AI projects have boomed. From 2021 to now, investments in AI totaled nearly $94 billion, according to Stanford’s AI Index Report. If AI continues this growth trajectory, it could add 1% to the U.S. GDP by 2030.

The Downside Of AI
According to an academic research study, automation technology has been the primary driver of U.S. income inequality over the past 40 years. The report, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that 50% to 70% of changes in U.S. wages since 1980 can be attributed to wage declines among blue-collar workers replaced or degraded by automation.
Artificial intelligence, robotics and new sophisticated technologies have caused a vast chasm in wealth and income inequality. It looks like this issue will accelerate. For now, college-educated, white-collar professionals have largely been spared the same fate as non-college-educated workers. People with a postgraduate degree saw their salaries rise, while “low-education workers declined significantly.” The study states, “The real earnings of men without a high-school degree are now 15% lower than they were in 1980.”
According to NBER, many changes in the U.S. wage structure were caused by companies automating tasks that used to be done by people. This includes “numerically-controlled machinery or industrial robots replacing blue-collar workers in manufacturing or specialized software replacing clerical workers.”
Truck and cab drivers, cashiers, retail sales associates and people who work in manufacturing plants and factories have been and will continue to be replaced by robotics and technology. Driverless vehicles, kiosks in fast-food restaurants and self-help, quick-phone scans at stores will soon eliminate most minimum-wage and low-skilled jobs.
Artificial intelligence systems are ubiquitous. AI-powered digital voice assistants share everything you want to know just
just
-2.1% by asking it a question. Instead of a live person addressing a problem, you can engage with an online chatbot. AI can help diagnose cancer and health issues. Banks use sophisticated software to check for fraud and noncompliance. AI predominantly controls driverless automobiles, newsfeeds, social media and job applications.
What Other Companies And Organizations Are Saying About AI
The World Economic Forum (WEF) concluded in a 2020 report, “A new generation of smart machines, fueled by rapid advances in AI and robotics, could potentially replace a large proportion of existing human jobs.” Robotics and AI will cause a serious “double-disruption,” as the pandemic pushed companies to fast-track the deployment of new technologies to slash costs, enhance productivity and be less reliant on real-life people.
Management consulting giant PriceWaterhouseCoopers reported, “AI, robotics and other forms of smart automation have the potential to bring great economic benefits, contributing up to $15 trillion to global GDP by 2030.” However, it will come with a high human cost. “This extra wealth will also generate the demand for many jobs, but there are also concerns that it could displace many existing jobs.”
This brings up another critical, often-overlooked issue. AI proponents say there’s nothing to worry about, as we’ve always successfully dealt with new technologies. However, what does this mean for the quality of jobs?
The world’s most advanced cities aren’t ready for the disruptions of artificial intelligence, claims Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm. It is believed that over 50 million Chinese workers may require retraining, as a result of AI-related deployment. The U.S. will be required to retool 11.5 million people in America with the skills needed to survive in the workforce. Millions of workers in Brazil, Japan and Germany will need assistance with the changes wrought by AI, robotics and related technology.
In a 2019 Wells Fargo
WFC
+0.1% study, the bank concluded that robots would eliminate 200,000 jobs in the banking industry within the next 10 years. This has already adversely impacted highly paid Wall Street professionals, including stock and bond traders. These are the people who used to work on the trading floors at investment banks and trade securities for their banks, clients and themselves. It was a very lucrative profession until algorithms, quant-trading software and programs disrupted the business and rendered their skills unnecessary—compared to the fast-acting technology.
What An AI Future May Look Like
There is no hiding from the robots. Well-trained and experienced doctors could be pushed aside by sophisticated robots that could perform delicate surgeries more precisely and read x-rays more efficiently and accurately to detect cancerous cells that the human eye can’t readily see.
The rise of artificial intelligence will make even software engineers less sought after. According to Jack Dorsey, the tech billionaire and founder of Twitter and Square, artificial intelligence will soon write its own software. That will put some beginner-level software engineers in a tough spot. When discussing how automation will replace human jobs, Dorsey told Yang on an episode of the Yang Speaks podcast, “We talk a lot about the self-driving trucks and whatnot.” He added, “[AI] is even coming for programming [jobs]. A lot of the goals of machine learning and deep learning is to write the software itself over time, so a lot of entry-level programming jobs will just not be as relevant anymore.”
When management consultants and companies that deploy AI and robotics say we don’t need to worry, we need to be concerned. Companies—whether they are McDonald’s, introducing self-serve kiosks and firing hourly workers to cut costs, or top-tier investment banks that rely on software instead of traders to make million-dollar bets on the stock market—will continue to implement technology and downsize people to enhance profits.
This trend has the potential to impact all classes of workers adversely. In light of the study’s spotlight on the dire results of AI, including lost wages and the rapid growth in income inequality, it's time to talk seriously about how AI should be managed before it's too late.

Employment prospectsThe government is keen to promote investment in AI in the UK, which it says will ""ultimately drive productivity across the economy"", and has tried to reassure the public about its impact.""We want to make sure that AI is complementing the way we work in the UK, not disrupting it - making our jobs better, rather than taking them away,"" Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan told the Sun.The report notes AI's impact will vary across different sectors - 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated but only 6% in construction 4% in maintenance, it says.BBC News has previously reported some artists' concerns AI image generators could harm their employment prospects.What is AI and is it dangerous?'Lower wages'""The only thing I am sure of is that there is no way of knowing how many jobs will be replaced by generative AI,"" Carl Benedikt Frey, future of-work director at the Oxford Martin School, Oxford University, told BBC News. ""What ChatGPT does, for example, is allow more people with average writing skills to produce essays and articles.""Journalists will therefore face more competition, which would drive down wages, unless we see a very significant increase in the demand for such work.""Consider the introduction of GPS technology and platforms like Uber. Suddenly, knowing all the streets in London had much less value - and so incumbent drivers experienced large wage cuts in response, of around 10% according to our research. ""The result was lower wages, not fewer drivers. ""Over the next few years, generative AI is likely to have similar effects on a broader set of creative tasks"".'Pinch of salt'According to research cited by the report, 60% of workers are in occupations that did not exist in 1940.But other research suggests technological change since the 1980s has displaced workers faster than it has created jobs.And if generative AI is like previous information-technology advances, the report concludes, it could reduce employment in the near term.The long-term impact of AI, however, was highly uncertain, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank Torsten Bell told BBC News, ""so all firm predictions should be taken with a very large pinch of salt"". ""We do not know how the technology will evolve or how firms will integrate it into how they work,"" he said.""That's not to say that AI won't disrupt the way we work - but we should focus too on the potential living-standards gains from higher-productivity work and cheaper-to-run services, as well as the risk of falling behind if other firms and economies better adapt to technological change.""Bill Gates: AI most important tech advance in decadesWhy the rise of AI art stirs fierce debateEconomicsArtificial intelligenceEmployment",,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65102150,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CFC4/production/_129188135_ai-index-getty.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

    <li>White paper sets out new approach to regulating artificial intelligence to build public trust in cutting-edge technologies and make it easier for businesses to innovate, grow and create jobs</li>
    <li>plan will help unleash the benefits of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, one of the 5 technologies of tomorrow, which already contributes £3.7 billion to the UK economy</li>
    <li>follows new expert taskforce to build the UK’s capabilities in foundation models, including large language models like ChatGPT, and £2 million for sandbox trial to help businesses test <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> rules before getting to market</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Five principles, including safety, transparency and fairness, will guide the use of artificial intelligence in the UK, as part of a new national blueprint for our world class regulators to drive responsible innovation and maintain public trust in this revolutionary technology.</p>

<p>The UK’s <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> industry is thriving, employing over 50,000 people and contributing £3.7 billion to the economy last year. Britain is home to twice as many companies providing <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> products and services as any other European country and hundreds more are created each year.</p>

<p><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is already delivering real social and economic benefits for people, from helping doctors to identify diseases faster to helping British farmers use their land more efficiently and sustainably. Adopting artificial intelligence in more sectors could improve productivity and unlock growth, which is why the government is committed to unleashing <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>’s potential across the economy.</p>

<p>As <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> continues developing rapidly, questions have been raised about the future risks it could pose to people’s privacy, their human rights or their safety. There are concerns about the fairness of using <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> tools to make decisions which impact people’s lives, such as assessing the worthiness of loan or mortgage applications.</p>

<p>Alongside hundreds of millions of pounds of government investment announced at Budget, the proposals in the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> regulation white paper will help create the right environment for artificial intelligence to flourish safely in the UK.</p>

<p>Currently, organisations can be held back from using <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> to its full potential because a patchwork of legal regimes causes confusion and financial and administrative burdens for businesses trying to comply with rules.</p>

<p>The government will avoid heavy-handed legislation which could stifle innovation and take an adaptable approach to regulating <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>. Instead of giving responsibility for <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> governance to a new single regulator, the government will empower existing regulators - such as the Health and Safety Executive, Equality and Human Rights Commission and Competition and Markets Authority - to come up with tailored, context-specific approaches that suit the way <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is actually being used in their sectors.</p>

<p>The white paper outlines 5 clear principles that these regulators should consider to best facilitate the safe and innovative use of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> in the industries they monitor. The principles are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>safety, security and robustness</strong>: applications of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> should function in a secure, safe and robust way where risks are carefully managed</li>
  <li>
<strong>transparency and explainability</strong>: organisations developing and deploying <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> should be able to communicate when and how it is used and explain a system’s decision-making process in an appropriate level of detail that matches the risks posed by the use of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>fairness</strong>: <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> should be used in a way which complies with the UK’s existing laws, for example the Equality Act 2010 or UK GDPR, and must not discriminate against individuals or create unfair commercial outcomes</li>
  <li>
<strong>accountability and governance</strong>: measures are needed to ensure there is appropriate oversight of the way <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is being used and clear accountability for the outcomes</li>
  <li>
<strong>contestability and redress</strong>: people need to have clear routes to dispute harmful outcomes or decisions generated by <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach will mean the UK’s rules can adapt as this fast-moving technology develops, ensuring protections for the public without holding businesses back from using <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> technology to deliver stronger economic growth, better jobs, and bold new discoveries that radically improve people’s lives.</p>

<p>Over the next 12 months, regulators will issue practical guidance to organisations, as well as other tools and resources like risk assessment templates, to set out how to implement these principles in their sectors. When parliamentary time allows, legislation could be introduced to ensure regulators consider the principles consistently.</p>

<p>Science, Innovation and Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> has the potential to make Britain a smarter, healthier and happier place to live and work. Artificial intelligence is no longer the stuff of science fiction, and the pace of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> development is staggering, so we need to have rules to make sure it is developed safely.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Our new approach is based on strong principles so that people can trust businesses to unleash this technology of tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Businesses warmly welcomed initial proposals for this proportionate approach during a consultation last year and highlighted the need for more coordination between regulators to ensure the new framework is implemented effectively across the economy. As part of the white paper published today, the government is consulting on new processes to improve coordination between regulators as well as monitor and evaluate the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> framework, making changes to improve the efficacy of the approach if needed.</p>

<p>£2 million will fund a new sandbox, a trial environment where businesses can test how regulation could be applied to <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> products and services, to support innovators bringing new ideas to market without being blocked by rulebook barriers.</p>

<p>Organisations and individuals working with <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> can share their views on the white paper as part of a new consultation launching today which will inform how the framework is developed in the months ahead.</p>

<p>Lila Ibrahim, Chief Operating Officer and UK <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> Council Member, DeepMind, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child""><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> has the potential to advance science and benefit humanity in numerous ways, from combating climate change to better understanding and treating diseases. This transformative technology can only reach its full potential if it is trusted, which requires public and private partnership in the spirit of pioneering responsibly. The UK’s proposed context-driven approach will help regulation keep pace with the development of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, support innovation and mitigate future risks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grazia Vittadini, Chief Technology Officer, Rolls-Royce, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Both our business and our customers will benefit from agile, context-driven <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> regulation. It will enable us to continue to lead the technical and quality assurance innovations for safety-critical industrial <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> applications, while remaining compliant with the standards of integrity, responsibility and trust that society demands from <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> developers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sue Daley, Director for Tech and Innovation at techUK, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">techUK welcomes the much-anticipated publication of the UK’s <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> white paper and supports its plans for a context-specific, principle-based approach to governing <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> that promotes innovation. The government must now prioritise building the necessary regulatory capacity, expertise, and coordination. techUK stands ready to work alongside government and regulators to ensure that the benefits of this powerful technology are felt across both society and the economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clare Barclay, CEO, Microsoft UK, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child""><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is the technology that will define the coming decades with the potential to supercharge economies, create new industries and amplify human ingenuity. If the UK is to succeed and lead in the age of intelligence, then it is critical to create an environment that fosters innovation, whilst ensuring an ethical and responsible approach. We welcome the UK’s commitment to being at the forefront of progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rashik Parmar MBE, chief executive, BCS The Chartered Institute for IT, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child""><abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> is transforming how we learn, work, manage our health, discover our next binge-watch and even find love. The government’s commitment to helping UK companies become global leaders in <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr>, while developing within responsible principles, strikes the right regulatory balance. As we watch <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> growing up, we welcome the fact that our regulation will be cross-sectoral and more flexible than that proposed in the EU, while seeking to lead on aligning approaches between international partners. It is right that the risk of use is regulated, not the <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> technology itself. It’s also positive that the paper aims to create a central function to help monitor developments and identify risks.  Similarly, the proposed multi-regulator sandbox [a safe testing environment] will help break down barriers and remove obstacles. We need to remember this future will be delivered by <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> professionals - people - who believe in shared ethical values. Managing the risk of <abbr title=""artificial intelligence"">AI</abbr> and building public trust is most effective when the people creating it work in an accountable and professional culture, rooted in world-leading standards and qualifications.</p>

It’s neither artificial nor intelligentThis article is more than 1 year oldEvgeny MorozovLet’s retire this hackneyed term: while ChatGPT is good at pattern-matching, the human mind does so much moreThu 30 Mar 2023 10.55 EDTLast modified on Thu 30 Mar 2023 13.34 EDTShareElon Musk and Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak have recently signed a letter calling for a six-month moratorium on the development of AI systems. The goal is to give society time to adapt to what the signatories describe as an “AI summer”, which they believe will ultimately benefit humanity, as long as the right guardrails are put in place. These guardrails include rigorously audited safety protocols.It is a laudable goal, but there is an even better way to spend these six months: retiring the hackneyed label of “artificial intelligence” from public debate. The term belongs to the same scrapheap of history that includes “iron curtain”, “domino theory” and “Sputnik moment”. It survived the end of the cold war because of its allure for science fiction enthusiasts and investors. We can afford to hurt their feelings.In reality, what we call “artificial intelligence” today is neither artificial nor intelligent. The early AI systems were heavily dominated by rules and programs, so some talk of “artificiality” was at least justified. But those of today, including everyone’s favourite, ChatGPT, draw their strength from the work of real humans: artists, musicians, programmers and writers whose creative and professional output is now appropriated in the name of saving civilisation. At best, this is “non-artificial intelligence.”As for the “intelligence” part, the cold war imperatives that funded much of the early work in AI left a heavy imprint on how we understand it. We are talking about the kind of intelligence that would come in handy in a battle. For example, modern AI’s strength lies in pattern-matching. It’s hardly surprising given that one of the first military uses of neural networks – the technology behind ChatGPT – was to spot ships in aerial photographs.Machines cannot have a sense (rather than mere knowledge) of the past, the present and the futureHowever, many critics have pointed out that intelligence is not just about pattern-matching. Equally important is the ability to draw generalisations. Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 work of art Fountain is a prime example of this. Before Duchamp’s piece, a urinal was just a urinal. But, with a change of perspective, Duchamp turned it into a work of art. At that moment, he was generalising about art.When we generalise, emotion overrides the entrenched and seemingly “rational” classifications of ideas and everyday objects. It suspends the usual, nearly machinic operations of pattern-matching. Not the kind of thing you want to do in the middle of a war.Human intelligence is not one-dimensional. It rests on what the 20th-century Chilean psychoanalyst Ignacio Matte Blanco called bi-logic: a fusion of the static and timeless logic of formal reasoning and the contextual and highly dynamic logic of emotion. The former searches for differences; the latter is quick to erase them. Marcel Duchamp’s mind knew that the urinal belonged in a bathroom; his heart didn’t. Bi-logic explains how we regroup mundane things in novel and insightful ways. We all do this – not just Duchamp.AI will never get there because machines cannot have a sense (rather than mere knowledge) of the past, the present and the future; of history, injury or nostalgia. Without that, there’s no emotion, depriving bi-logic of one of its components. Thus, machines remain trapped in the singular formal logic. So there goes the “intelligence” part.ChatGPT has its uses. It is a prediction engine that can also moonlight as an encyclopedia. When asked what the bottle rack, the snow shovel and the urinal have in common, it correctly answered that they are all everyday objects that Duchamp turned into art.But when asked which of today’s objects Duchamp would turn into art, it suggested: smartphones, electronic scooters and face masks. There is no hint of any genuine “intelligence” here. It’s a well-run but predictable statistical machine.The danger of continuing to use the term “artificial intelligence” is that it risks convincing us that the world runs on a singular logic: that of highly cognitive, cold-blooded rationalism. Many in Silicon Valley already believe that – and they are busy rebuilding the world informed by that belief.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to TechScapeFree weekly newsletterAlex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If we want such creativity to persist, we should also be funding the production of art, fiction and history – not just data centres and machine learning.That’s not at all where things point now. The ultimate risk of not retiring terms such as “artificial intelligence” is that they will render the creative work of intelligence invisible, while making the world more predictable and dumb.So, instead of spending six months auditing the algorithms while we wait for the “AI summer,” we might as well go and reread Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. That will do so much more to increase the intelligence in our world.

Two-Thirds of Jobs Are at Risk: Goldman Sachs A.I. Study
The investment bank's economists estimate that 46% of administrative positions, 44% of legal positions, and 37% of engineering jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence.

As many as 300 million full-time jobs in the world, including two-thirds of jobs in the U.S. and Europe, are at risk of being replaced in some way by generative artificial intelligence, the technology behind tools like ChatGPT, according to a Goldman Sachs (GS) study this week.

“If generative AI delivers on its promised capabilities, the labor market could face significant disruption,” the investment bank’s economists wrote in a report.
What jobs are at the most at-risk and where?
The impact of A.I. disruption will be felt most deeply in developed countries, like the U.S. and European Union nations, the study noted, because those economies support a large number of white-collar jobs that are more prone to automation than manual labor-intensive work does.
In the U.S., 46 percent of office and administrative support positions could potentially be replaced by A.I., Goldman Sachs estimates. About 44 percent of legal positions could be automated, and 37 percent of engineering jobs are at risk.
Overall, approximately two-thirds of current jobs in the U.S. and Europe are exposed to some degree of A.I. automation, and up to a quarter of all work could be replaced by machines completely, the bank said, adding that, of affected positions where humans are still needed, as much as half of their workload could be computerized.
Tech elites raise alarm on A.I.’s threat to human jobs
Bill Gates painted a similarly alarming picture recently. In a lengthy blog post last week, the Microsoft cofounder predicted using tools like ChatGPT will increasingly feel like “having a white-collar worker available to help you with various tasks.”
Gates said A.I. has the potential of outperforming human workers in job functions like sales, service and document handling, where there are a plethora of good and bad examples for an algorithm to learn from.
Earlier this week, Elon Musk and hundreds of tech entrepreneurs and academics signed a letter urging A.I. labs to pause training systems that are more powerful than OpenAI’s GPT-4 until the industry develops a shared set of safety protocols.
“We must ask ourselves: Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones?” said the letter, authored by nonprofit Future of Life Institute. “Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?”
It’s not all doom-and-gloom
Goldman Sachs economists appear more optimistic. They noted technological advancement that initially displaces human workers has historically also created employment and economic growth over the long term.
“Although the impact of A.I. on the labor market is likely to be significant, most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by A.I.,” the report said.
Widespread adoption of A.I. will greatly increase productivity and boost global economic output by 7 percent annually over a 10-year period, which is more than double the typical economic growth rate of industrialized nations, Goldman Sachs predicted.

The jobs most at risk to generative AI like ChatGPT 





Kimanthi SammyMar 29, 2023, 5:08 AM EDTMarch 29, 2023 11:08 am 









 



According to a new study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI, generative artificial intelligence (AI) is set to revolutionize several professions, with accountants, mathematicians, interpreters, and writers at the top of the list of those most exposed to the technology’s capabilities.
The study analyzed the share of tasks within each occupation that could be performed at least 50% faster using generative AI. Software that is powered by large language models, generative pre-trained transformers, or GPTs, can analyze and generate text at an unprecedented scale.
The researchers found that nearly 20% of the U.S. workforce could benefit from the technology, with 80% of workers in occupations where at least one job task can be performed more quickly by generative AI.

The friction of new technology
Information-processing roles, including public relations specialists, court reporters, and blockchain engineers, were highly exposed to the technology. They used a government database of occupations and associated activities and tasks, with people and AI models assigning exposure levels to the tasks.
The authors did not predict which jobs would be lost or whose jobs would be affected by the technology, emphasizing that implementing new technologies is often fraught with negotiation and resistance.
However, individuals have already begun using generative AI to work more efficiently, with some employers allowing experimentation with the technology. Recent studies have shown that generative AI can save time and produce better results than humans in specific tasks.
The future of work will never be the same
Furthermore, Microsoft recently analyzed the capabilities of GPT-4, the latest version of OpenAI’s tool, and found that it could solve “novel and difficult tasks” with “human-level performance” in fields such as mathematics, coding, medicine, law, and psychology.
According to experts, the challenge for companies, schools, and policymakers is to help people adapt to new technology.
Generative AI’s potential impact on the workforce is undeniable, with industries and professions set to change significantly in the coming years. It remains to be seen how companies, schools, and policymakers will respond to the challenge, but one thing is certain: the world of work is on the brink of a major transformation.

Could AI replace your job?

 In the report titled ‘The Potentially Large Effects of Artificial Intelligence on Economic Growth’. Goldman Sachs claims that two-thirds of current jobs could be at risk, but the impact of AI will vary across different sectors. Jobs thought to be most affected are the office and administrative roles of white-collar workers including Journalism, legal roles, architecture, engineering, management, financial operations, logistics, sales and customer services just to name a few. 

  If you can't see the poll, click here While the use of these AIs might not immediately replace humans they could have the unintended consequences of lowering wages and making finding jobs in those sectors more competitive. The report compares this to the introduction of GPS and ride-hailing apps like Uber.

 ""Suddenly, knowing all the streets in London had much less value - and so incumbent drivers experienced large wage cuts in response, of around 10%""Manual roles like those in the construction industry, cleaning and maintenance will be the safest with minimal impact expected.Some office workers are worried that much like the factory automation of the 1960s that caused waves of workers to lose their jobs, these artificial workers could be coming for them.However, the report isn't all doom and gloom, it does also counter this by saying: “Although the impact of AI on the labour market is likely to be significant, most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI.” 












AI is evolving at an incredible speed

 The report also stated that the adoption of AI could increase the value of goods and services created by 7% over the next decade.The impact of these new AIs is yet to be seen and with more workers striking and companies trying to reduce costs could AIs become more common in the workplace?

One thing is for is certain, the genie is out of the bottle, and the revolution AI will bring about is coming ""resistance is futile"" as Star Trek's hive mind machines the Borg often say. 








Google Bard: Google Rolls out their own AI tool to rival Chat GPT that has the potential to evolve 

 It's also very possible that AIs could become another everyday tool like personal computers and be incorporated into existing tech like mobile devices, personal assistants and computers which would lead to a massive productivity boost aiding future workers and creating entirely new jobs. No matter how advanced these AIs become there are still many basic elements they lack and while their generative abilities are impressive AI's still feature many flaws and vulnerabilities, it will still be some time before they replace us and it's much more likely they will work alongside us. Then again that's exactly what an AI might want you to think.  Read More

Since the release of powerful AI tools ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, discussions about whether “robots” will replace humans have grown, and studies show some jobs—surprisingly, some traditionally white-collar work—may be heavily impacted.

Key Facts


Generative AI, a form of artificial intelligence capable of creating text or other content in response to user prompts, has quickly gained popularity following the public launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.



Since its November 2022 release, people have used AI chatbot ChatGPT for an array of this, including writing college-level essays and generating code.​​



The AI race heated up after Google released Bard on March 21, a ChatGPT competitor and a separate entity from the company’s Google search engine.



A recent report from Goldman Sachs estimates around 300 million jobs could be affected by generative AI, meaning 18% of work globally could be automated—with more advanced economies heavily impacted than emerging markets.


The report also predicts two-thirds of jobs in the U.S. and Europe “are exposed to some degree of AI automation,” and around a quarter of all jobs could be performed by AI entirely.


Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI found some educated white-collar workers earning up to $80,000 a year are the most likely to be affected by workforce automation.


According to the report, jobs in agriculture, mining and manufacturing are the least exposed to generative AI, while jobs in the information processing industries, like IT, are the most exposed because jobs that use ""programming and writing skills"" are more closely related to GPT’s capabilities.


Generative AI isn’t perfect, both OpenAI and Google admit their program sometimes gives incorrect responses and has other flaws, like ChatGPT’s knowledge base that ends in 2021, and Bard’s limited conversation retention.

Jobs Most Impacted


Finance and banking: Banks have already begun incorporating AI into their business models. 56% of banks claim they’ve implemented the technology into their business domains like management, and 52% claim they’ve used it for revenue generation, according to Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and the World Economic Forum. Abhijit Bose, a Capital One senior vice president, told the Washington Post AI will potentially “monitor transactions” to give detailed financial advice on saving and spending. Morgan Stanley has begun using OpenAI-powered chatbots to organize its wealth management database, helping advisers pull up data and research more efficiently. The World Economic Forum also predicts AI will bring three changes to the finance division: job cuts, job creation and increased efficiency.​​ In addition, they estimate by 2027, 23% of jobs in China’s financial sector will be replaced by AI.
Media and marketing: Kristian Hammond, chief scientist of Natural Sciences told the BBC in 15 years, “90% of news will be written by machines.” Natural Sciences has a software called Quill, an AI paraphrasing tool that writes company reports ahead of earning announcements. German publisher Axel Springer announced in February plans to transition into “digital only,” which includes job cuts in favor of “modern technology” and automation. Reporters for different media outlets like Business Insider, CNET and CNBC have used ChatGPT to write news stories, though they have often been criticized for containing false information. In January, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti announced the company would rely on ChatGPT to personalize content and enhance quizzes, much to the employees’ dismay, according to the Wall Street Journal. In the marketing world, 84% of marketers reported using AI in 2020, a stark jump from 29% in 2019, according to Salesforce research. High-performing marketing teams averaged around seven different uses of AI and machine learning in 2020, and over half planned on increasing their use in 2021, the report also claims.
Legal services: An attorney used ChatGPT to publish a 14-page legal paper published in Social Science Research Network on a plethora of prompts, including creating a contract, explaining why the Supreme Court’s decision on same-sex marriage shouldn’t be appealed and developing deposition questions. The AI bot has the potential “to address access to justice questions” and make legal services available to those who can’t afford it, Andrew Perlman, the author of the paper and a Suffolk University Law School Dean told Reuters. Low-income Americans don’t get enough or any legal help for 92% of their civil legal problems, according to a 2022 report by Legal Services Corp. Some have already begun incorporating AI into legal service, like startup Lawgeex, which has a service that reads contracts faster than, and what they claim to be more accurate than humans.


Jobs Least Impacted


Manufacturing and factory workers: This industry has been undergoing automation for a while, with General Motors credited as the first major manufacturer to implement robotics in their assembly lines after the introduction of UNIMATE in 1961. However, generative AI may speed up the process. For example, Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Bot, or Optimus, an autonomous android made to replace humans in dangerous, repetitive jobs. Musk plans to place these bots in his Tesla factories and eventually expand to millions around the world. According to an MIT and Boston University report, AI is expected to replace as many as two million manufacturing workers by 2025. “Our evidence shows that robots increase productivity,” the researchers said. A Chinese factory in Dongguan City replaced 90% of its workforce with machines, resulting in a 250% increase in productivity and an 80% decrease in defects. A job that took 650 human workers to complete now takes about 60 robots and 60 humans, the company claims.
Agriculture: According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2021 there were 21.1 million full- and part-time jobs in the food and agriculture sectors, making up 10.5% of the labor force. Agriculture is considered one of the world’s oldest professions and has stood the test of time, lasting through four separate industrial revolutions. According to the Washington Post, many small farms don’t produce enough profit to invest in more machinery, though larger farms have already begun the process of automation for strenuous tasks. In the U.S., family farms make up 98% of all farms, with a majority being small family farms that operate about half of the country’s farm land. However, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture does fund AI research, education and extension activities in the areas of natural resources and environments, agricultural systems and engineering and economics and rural communities.
Healthcare: A study published in the International Journal of Health Services found on average, psychiatrists spend 20.3% of their day on paperwork, followed by internists and general practitioners at 17.3%. Mundane administrative tasks like this can be automated, but other areas probably won’t need AI. David Dranove, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management told the Kellogg Insight most adults want to hear about their health from a human, and there’s “a need for compassion…that AI is unable to contribute.” An Oxford University report predicts medical transcriptionists, medical records, medical secretaries and health information technicians are the most likely jobs in the field to be automated, not actual providers. This extends into mental health as well—the Washington Post has tried and failed at creating an AI version of infamous psychologist, Sigmund Freud.

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is poised to dramatically reshape the modern workplace, heralding a new era of unprecedented change. A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs highlights the situation's urgency, revealing that the automation of certain tasks could disrupt a staggering 300 million jobs worldwide. Industries involving routine, repetitive tasks that can be easily automated are at the forefront of this seismic shift. In the United States, jobs in office and administrative support, legal work, and architecture and engineering face the highest risk of automation, with 46%, 44%, and 37% of tasks, respectively, potentially replaceable by AI.

However, AI's impact on jobs will only be evenly distributed across some industries or countries. For example, jobs that demand physical labor are less susceptible to automation, and emerging markets may experience less exposure to automation than developed markets. Despite the looming threat of job displacement, the report emphasizes that AI technology could fuel labor productivity and catapult global GDP by a remarkable 7% over time. It is crucial to recognize that technological advancements have consistently generated new job opportunities throughout history while rendering others obsolete. In light of these findings, a recent Executive AI report by Hunter Marketing indicates that many senior business leaders have already embraced AI. In contrast, others are keenly poised to adopt this revolutionary technology.

This article delves into the future of AI in the workplace and how businesses can leverage its potential to achieve tremendous success. The following sections will provide an in-depth analysis of the key findings, including demographic trends and industry-specific AI adoption rates.

AI Adoption: Demographics and Industries
The Hunter Marketing new report, ""Executive AI: What senior leaders think about AI in the workplace"" highlights several key findings regarding AI adoption among senior business leaders. The study found that 61% of male and 29% of female executives currently use AI. This disparity suggests that there might be a gender gap in AI adoption, which could be influenced by factors such as accessibility, awareness, or confidence in the technology. Closing this gap should be a priority for organizations aiming to create a diverse and inclusive work environment.

The age group with the highest AI adoption rate is 25 to 44-year-olds, with 61% utilizing AI tools in daily operations. This can be attributed to the fact that this age group is more receptive to new technologies and more likely to embrace innovation. AI adoption decreases with age, with 22% of executives aged 65 and above using AI. This could be due to a lack of familiarity with the technology or a resistance to change in long-established working patterns.

Regarding income, the highest AI adoption rate (61%) is among executives earning between $100,000 and $199,000. Interestingly, the adoption rate is lower (53%) for those earning over $200,000, which may indicate that the highest earners are more likely to delegate AI-related tasks to their subordinates.

The Hunter Marketing report also reveals that AI adoption varies significantly across industries and geographical locations. Manufacturing (80%) and technology (64%) sectors have the highest AI usage among executives, whereas construction (52%) and finance (62%) have lower adoption rates. This suggests that AI's impact is more pronounced in specific industries while others are yet to experience its full potential. Geographically, executives in New York City (73%) have a higher AI adoption rate than those in Los Angeles (60%), indicating that regional differences may also affect AI utilization.
Challenges and Opportunities for AI Implementation
Senior business leaders face numerous challenges that AI can address. One of the main concerns of C-level executives is competitors are innovating faster (47% of C-level executives). Adopting AI can help organizations stay competitive by automating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling faster data-driven decision-making.
Several concerns need to be addressed through widespread AI adoption. Ethical considerations top the list, with 68% of leaders not using AI. Ensuring transparency and responsible deployment is critical to overcoming this obstacle. 45% of non-AI users believe the technology needs to be more accurate.
Ownership is another significant concern, with 72% of executives not using AI stating that the responsibility for AI lies with the IT department. This points to a need for better collaboration and integration between IT and other departments to facilitate AI adoption across the organization.
Moreover, 62% of business leaders feel the benefits of AI could be more transparent, indicating a need for more education on AI's potential applications and advantages. Companies should invest in internal education and training programs to help executives understand and embrace AI better.
Preparing For The Future of Work
To prepare for the future of work, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to managing the impact of AI on their operations and workforce. The following strategies can help organizations navigate the rapidly changing landscape and capitalize on the opportunities offered by AI:
Upskill and reskill employees
As AI automates routine tasks, the demand for skilled workers with expertise in AI, machine learning, and data analytics will increase. Companies should invest in upskilling and reskilling their workforce to ensure they have the necessary skills to adapt to new roles and responsibilities.
Foster a culture of innovation
Encourage employees to embrace change and explore new ways to use AI to improve business processes. This can be achieved through regular training, workshops, and brainstorming sessions focusing on AI's potential applications in the organization.
Develop a clear AI strategy
To maximize the benefits of AI, organizations must have a clear strategy that outlines the objectives, goals, and desired outcomes of AI implementation. This should include identifying areas where AI can have the most significant impact and addressing potential challenges and risks.
Collaborate with external partners
Organizations can benefit from partnering with AI solution providers, research institutions, and industry experts to gain access to cutting-edge technology and knowledge. This can help
Focus on ethical AI implementation
Companies must prioritize transparency, fairness, and accountability in their AI deployments to address ethical concerns and build trust among employees and customers. Establishing clear guidelines and ethical standards for AI use will be crucial in maintaining a responsible approach to AI adoption.
Promote diversity and inclusion
To harness the full potential of AI, organizations should promote diversity and inclusion within their workforce. This involves addressing the gender gap in AI adoption, ensuring equal access to AI tools and opportunities, and fostering a culture that values diverse perspectives and backgrounds.
Implement policies to support workforce transitions
Governments and businesses should collaborate to develop policies supporting workers whom AI may displace. This could include offering financial assistance for retraining, providing access to education and training programs, and promoting job creation in sectors with high growth potential.
Conclusion
Integrating AI in the workplace is set to reshape industries and redefine how we work profoundly. By recognizing the transformative potential of AI and proactively addressing the challenges that come with its adoption, businesses can unlock unprecedented opportunities for growth, innovation, and increased competitiveness. Preparing for this future requires a strategic, collaborative approach that emphasizes upskilling employees, fostering a culture of innovation, promoting diversity, and ensuring ethical AI implementation. As we navigate this exciting new era of technological advancement, the organizations that successfully harness the power of AI will be the ones that thrive and lead the way in shaping the future of work. Embracing this change with an open mind and a forward-thinking approach is not only necessary and imperative for businesses' continued success in the evolving global landscape.

Generative AI is the name of the game in big tech right now, and Adobe isn’t about to get left behind. The company recently announced a beta of its new creative generative AI support, Adobe Firefly, which promises to help users with little to no experience in graphic design create their own images and text effects. The announcement comes hot off the heels of Microsoft’s own generative AI launch. Its new solution, Copilot, is set to empower users of 365 and Dynamics 365 to auto-generate written content automatically. So, whether you struggle with writing, graphic design, or overall organizational skills, it’s an exciting time to get a boost from generative AI.


A Generative AI Recap
In case you’ve missed some of the hottest tech news lately, generative artificial intelligence is a sub-set of AI that can create text, art, imagery or other forms of content based on prompts from an individual user. The popularity was stoked last fall when OpenAI rolled our ChatGPT. Since then, tons of solutions, from AI art creator starryai to Shutterfly’s AI image generator, are turning the world on its head by empowering literally anyone to create world-class writing, art, images, and content with the click of a button.

And it’s making headlines all over. This week Bill Gates published a blog on his website where he called generative AI “the most important advance in technology since the graphical user interface.” And I would have to agree with him. The advancements that have been made in the last few months are astounding. It’s no wonder that Adobe is throwing its proverbial hat in the ring.

How does Adobe Firefly work?
While a lot of people may not associate Adobe with AI, it’s actually been integrating things like neural filters, content aware fills and other features in its products for years, helping users create and edit their images and documents more quickly and easily. According to Adobe, Firefly is set to give creators “new superpowers” in their day-to-day work. Using Firefly, users will be able to create images, vectors, 3D imagery, audio and video, brushes, gradients and more, on brand, instantly. Ideally, this will help them keep up with the huge demand for new content being felt on social, email, and other channels. Firefly will also be able to train with a company’s specific collateral to help it learn to recreate the nuances of a specific brand or style. Essentially, Adobe Firefly promises to disrupt marketing teams everywhere by empowering literally anyone in the enterprise to create images and graphic design effects at any experience level.

What do Creatives Say about Generative AI?
Generative AI is full of amazing promise, but it’s also opening a pandora’s box of issues in the creative realm. Some artists have held protests to show their growing frustration with AI-generated art apps that allow lay people to sell and create art that they didn’t actually “create.” Businesses have had to adjust the way they work with artists to prevent legal issues surrounding licensing and copyright. For instance, Getty Images has banned the sale of illustrations and content created by AI on its site. Meanwhile, the Wix-owned site DeviantArt decided to create protections for creators that prevent generative AI platforms from “scraping” artist work from their site.

For its part, Adobe is trying to avoid any controversy surrounding generative AI. It says Firefly is being “trained” using Adobe Stock images, which are openly licensed graphics that won’t infringe on copyrighted work. This ensures, at least theoretically, that the content Firefly produces will not be based on any specific company’s brand or other licensed images available online.


In addition to the above protections, Adobe says creators will be able to hide their content from its AI training model to ensure Firefly doesn’t learn from their designs if they don’t want it to. Adobe also says it will be creating a compensation model for Adobe Stock contributors so they can rightly benefit from Firefly’s success (and yes, I’m assuming it will be wildly successful).
Lastly, to keep the buyers of artwork safe, designs created with Firefly will contain metadata that indicates it was created in part (or whole) by generative AI.
Personally, I’m impressed with the length Adobe has gone to be transparent about how its models are being trained and how it intends to innovate with AI while being cognizant of its community of designers and creatives that have been paramount to building Adobe’s success.
Adobe Firefly - Request Access
Folks interested in trying out Adobe Firefly will first need to request access here. The company says it will be sending out invitations over time to individuals who express interest in being part of its beta group. Current Firefly betas are available for text to image, text effects, and recoloring vectors. Other options in development include text to pattern, 3D to image, sketch to image, text to brush and more.
The Generative AI Road Ahead 
While generative AI is driving a fundamental change to so many industries in such a short amount of time, it is a certainty to play a role in the growth of productivity in a vast number of professions. Watching the tech industries iconic companies enter one after another should surprise no one, but the longer term affects will be important to watch as we certainly see the excitement around generative AI, but the way people advance with this technology will act as a fascinating lesson in human evolution.

The job's main function is to help train the emerging crop of AI, also known as large language models (LLMs), to deliver more accurate and useful responses to the natural-language queries that people pose. More generally, the goal is to make AI smarter and more capable of accomplishing a wide array of professional tasks.Notably, and unlike many higher-level jobs in tech, working as a prompt engineer doesn't necessarily require an engineering or coding background. One job listing for a prompt engineer describes the role as an ""art"" that's ""a hybrid between programming, instructing and teaching."" Hot new programming language: EnglishAndrej Karpathy, a founding member of ChatGPT maker OpenAI and former senior director of AI at Tesla, recently tweeted that a prompt engineer can also be thought of ""as a kind of LLM psychologist.""""The hottest new programming language is English,"" he tweeted in January after ChatGPT was publicly released, a reference to the fact that LLMs are trained based on prompts written in plain English, rather than computer code. The good news for job seekers? Some companies are willing to pay big bucks for such jobs, also referred to colloquially by some prompt engineers as an ""AI whisperer.""""We are all amateur prompt engineers, but there is definitely a nuanced understanding to these models,"" said Edward Tian, a student at Princeton University who built GPTZero, an app that can detect whether a text was written by a human being or ChatGPT. For example, LLMs are better at spitting out text in a certain style — say, in the voice of an elementary school student or a comedian — if they are shown an example, Tian explained. ""You'll get better results if you say to ChatGPT: 'Here is an example of elementary school writing and then you make the ask,'"" he said. ""It significantly improves results.""Prompt engineering is also typically less structured than traditional research experiments, which begin with hypotheses. ""With prompt engineering, no one really knows what the results are going to be, so we try a bunch of things and hopefully the LLM responds in a positive way,"" Tian said. Seeking ""creative hacker spirit"" A range of companies and industries are recruiting prompt engineers.Anthropic, an AI research company and maker of Claude, an AI assistant, is currently seeking a ""prompt engineer and librarian,"" according to a job posting on the company's website. The role involves building a library of prompts that get LLMs to accomplish different tasks.Requirements for the position at the San Francisco company include familiarity with how LLMs work, excellent communication skills and what Anthropic describes as ""a creative hacker spirit,"" among other qualifications. Basic programming skills and the ability to write small Python programs are also desirable. The pay: Between $175,000 and $335,000 a year.British law firm Mishcon de Reya is hiring a ""GPT legal prompt engineer.""

Study finds AI could replace millions of jobs 











Study finds that artificial intelligence could replace the equivalent of 300 million jobs
07:42

Artificial intelligence tools such as Chat GPT and Dall-E are sparking fears of the technology automating people out of a job, yet like previous waves of innovation, the advent of so-called generative AI is also starting to create new kinds of work. ""The good news is that worker displacement from automation has historically been offset by creation of new jobs, and the emergence of new occupations following technological innovations accounts for the vast majority of long-run employment growth,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent report that also forecast a sizable economic boost from AI.One role now showing up in job listings: ""prompt engineer."" The job's main function is to help train the emerging crop of AI, also known as large language models (LLMs), to deliver more accurate and useful responses to the natural-language queries that people pose. More generally, the goal is to make AI smarter and more capable of accomplishing a wide array of professional tasks. 






Notably, and unlike many higher-level jobs in tech, working as a prompt engineer doesn't necessarily require an engineering or coding background. One job listing for a prompt engineer describes the role as an ""art"" that's ""a hybrid between programming, instructing and teaching."" Hot new programming language: EnglishAndrej Karpathy, a founding member of ChatGPT maker OpenAI and former senior director of AI at Tesla, recently tweeted that a prompt engineer can also be thought of ""as a kind of LLM psychologist.""


""The hottest new programming language is English,"" he tweeted in January after ChatGPT was publicly released, a reference to the fact that LLMs are trained based on prompts written in plain English, rather than computer code.

The good news for job seekers? Some companies are willing to pay big bucks for such jobs, also referred to colloquially by some prompt engineers as an ""AI whisperer.""""We are all amateur prompt engineers, but there is definitely a nuanced understanding to these models,"" said Edward Tian, a student at Princeton University who built GPTZero, an app that can detect whether a text was written by a human being or ChatGPT. For example, LLMs are better at spitting out text in a certain style — say, in the voice of an elementary school student or a comedian — if they are shown an example, Tian explained. 


""You'll get better results if you say to ChatGPT: 'Here is an example of elementary school writing and then you make the ask,'"" he said. ""It significantly improves results.""Prompt engineering is also typically less structured than traditional research experiments, which begin with hypotheses. ""With prompt engineering, no one really knows what the results are going to be, so we try a bunch of things and hopefully the LLM responds in a positive way,"" Tian said. Seeking ""creative hacker spirit"" A range of companies and industries are recruiting prompt engineers.Anthropic, an AI research company and maker of Claude, an AI assistant, is currently seeking a ""prompt engineer and librarian,"" according to a job posting on the company's website. The role involves building a library of prompts that get LLMs to accomplish different tasks.Requirements for the position at the San Francisco company include familiarity with how LLMs work, excellent communication skills and what Anthropic describes as ""a creative hacker spirit,"" among other qualifications. Basic programming skills and the ability to write small Python programs are also desirable. The pay: Between $175,000 and $335,000 a year.
Anthropic's job listing says the field of prompt engineering is less than two years old, making the role challenging to hire for.

British law firm Mishcon de Reya is hiring a ""GPT legal prompt engineer."" The role will focus on helping the business ""increase our understanding of how generative AI can be used within a law firm, including its application to legal practice tasks and wider law firm business tasks,"" the job posting states.


Klarity, a company that helps automate contract review, is hiring its own AI whisperer, who will earn between $130,000 and $230,000 a year to fine-tune LLM applications within the company. Boston Children's Hospital in Boston is hiring an AI prompt engineer to work on its digital health platform. The desired candidate will have a strong background in both AI and machine learning (a subset of AI), as well health care research experience. The job entails designing AI prompts for LLMs ""as they emerge for health care research studies and clinical practice.""""Super important"" skill To be sure, any job related to an AI chatbot requires a high level of familiarity and understanding of how LLMs work. ""They have to understand how to code, leverage AI models and understand how to talk to them,"" Gabor Soter, founder of Generative Nation, a site that educates the public about generative AI, told CBS MoneyWatch.

“In the limit, if capital can replace labor entirely, growth rates could explode, with incomes becoming infinite in finite time.” – “The Future of U.S. Economic Growth” by John G. Fernald and Charles I. Jones, January 2014
The Essay

🤖 Why Goldman Sachs thinks generative AI could have a huge impact on economic growth and productivity
The raison d’être of this newsletter is building a better world — wealthier, healthier, more opportunity, more resilience, more fun — through faster technological progress and economic growth. And while big advances in artificial intelligence are likely going to be a big part of making that goal a reality, I’m not banking on human-level AI, much less superhuman machine intelligence. Humanity can accomplish a lot merely by progressing as fast in the future as it has during peak periods of the past. And at least one Wall Street megabank thinks generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT and Bard can do the trick.
The title of the new Goldman Sachs report, “The Potentially Large Effects of Artificial Intelligence on Economic Growth,” is pro-progress, Up Wing music to my conservative-futurist ears. From the report:
The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) raises whether we are on the brink of a rapid acceleration in task automation that will drive labor cost savings and raise productivity. Despite significant uncertainty around the potential of generative AI, its ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects. … The combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation, and a productivity boost for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a labor productivity boom like those that followed the emergence of earlier general-purpose technologies like the electric motor and personal computer.
Here are the main takeaways from GS economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani, which I shall subsequently dive into:
Generative AI could raise annual US labor productivity growth by just under 1½ percentage points over a 10-year period following widespread business adoption.Generative AI could eventually increase annual global GDP by 7 percent, equal to an almost $7 trillion increase in annual global GDP over a 10-year period.Generative AI will be disruptive to jobs: “We find that roughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation, and that generative AI could substitute up to one-fourth of current work.”AI investment could approach 1 percent of US GDP by 2030 if it increases at the pace of software investment in the 1990s. (That said, US and global private investment in AI totaled $53 billion and $94 billion in 2021, a fivefold increase in real terms from five years prior.)
For context, such a labor productivity increase would double the long-term Congressional Budget Office forecast of US productivity — and economic growth.


It would create a long-term 3 percent economy (again), instead of a 1.5 percent economy, with productivity growth at the highest levels since the boomy late 1990s and early 2000s. The Long Stagnation could soon be over. Well, soon-ish. Key caveats here include how good generative AI gets (the difficulty level of the tasks it can automate) and how fast the evolving technology is adopted throughout the economy.


As the above analysis suggests, the GS forecasts revolve around how GenAI affects the labor market. Remember, economists often disaggregate jobs into specific tasks (there’s a database for this, O*NET) when researching the impact of automation. And in this scenario, GS assumes 13 of the 39 work activities of over 900 occupations in the database are exposed to AI automation, with the assumption that AI “is capable of completing tasks up to a difficulty of 4 on the 7-point O*NET ‘level’ scale.” (Also: GS ignores jobs involving working outdoors and performing physical labor, so their forecast doesn’t look at the impact of advances in robotics.) So: When looking at the tasks that are bundled into occupations, GS finds the following:
[Roughly] two-thirds of US occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI, and that of those occupations which are exposed, most have a significant—but partial—share of their workload (25-50%) that can be replaced. … We next extend our US and European estimates globally, adjusting for differences in industry composition across countries and further assuming that AI does not impact the agricultural sector in EM economies due to significant differences in the composition and production approaches in that industry between EM and DM economies. Our estimates intuitively suggest that fewer jobs in EMs are exposed to automation than in DMs, but that 18% of work globally could be automated by AI on an employment-weighted basis. … Our scenario analysis suggests that the ultimate share of work exposed to automation could range from 15-35%, a range which is consistent with—but on the conservative side of—existing estimates in the literature.


Now, this does not mean 25 percent of jobs are going away due to GenAI. Technology can replace some tasks, but it can also make us more productive performing other tasks, and create new tasks — and new jobs. GS cites research that finds “60% of workers today are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that over 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions.” The GS operating assumption here is that GenAI will substitute for 7 percent of current US employment, complement 63 percent, and leave 30 percent unaffected.


Again, lots of caveats and variables here. How good will GenAI get? As GS puts it: Will it be only able to “skim a short article to gather the main point” or will it eventually be able to accomplish a difficult task such as analyzing “the cost of medical care services for all US hospitals”? And what will be the adoption time? (You may have heard, ChatGPT reached 100 million users just two months after launch.) GS: “The productivity growth boost would only be roughly half as large if the gains are realized over a 20-year period and one-third as large if realized over a 30-year period.”

Two final points here: First, at the high end of the forecasts, we would be talking about GDP growth of about 4.5 percent, same as in the Go-Go 1960s — but without the same rapid labor force growth. (About 1.5 percent back then versus 0.5 percent now.) Phenomenal, but not the Singularity. Second, it’s impossible for any model to anticipate the impact of AI/machine learning — not just GenAI — on scientific discovery and technological invention where it could function as a super research assistant. Consider this piece, “Biologists Say Deep Learning Is Revolutionizing Pace of Innovation,” from The Wall Street Journal:
Dr. Baker leads Baker Lab, which has nearly 80 pre- and post-doctoral students and is part of the university’s Institute for Protein Design. The proteins it designs can be used in a range of ways such as developing drugs and vaccines. Dr. Baker estimates that the pace of innovation in his field has increased by a factor of 10 during the past 18 months, due to a combination of deep learning and laboratory methods used to verify that new proteins are working as expected.
Signs and wonders, my friends, signs and wonders.

Moore, a co-founder and former chairman of Intel Corporation, the California semiconductor chip maker that helped give Silicon Valley its name, achieving the kind of industrial dominance once held by the giant American railroad or steel companies of another age, died on Friday at his home in Hawaii. … Along with a handful of colleagues, Mr. Moore could claim credit for bringing laptop computers to hundreds of millions of people and embedding microprocessors into everything from bathroom scales, toasters and toy fire engines to cellphones, cars and jets. … In 1965, in what became known as Moore’s Law, he predicted that the number of transistors that could be placed on a silicon chip would double at regular intervals for the foreseeable future, thus increasing the data-processing power of computers exponentially.

SAI and space based SRM complement each other. While SAI can be deployed quickly and inexpensively, it must be replenished constantly and maintained until carbon is removed from the atmosphere. On the other hand, deploying the sunshade will take longer and cost more, but it is a cleaner, more sustainable proposal. The planetary sunshade should be considered a wind-down strategy for SAI. The sunshade also has many positive benefits beyond addressing climate change that should be understood by policy makers.

The concept, known as ‘pellet-beam’ propulsion, was awarded an early-stage US$175,000 NASA grant for further development earlier this year. … The pellet-beam concept was partly inspired by the Breakthrough Starshot initiative, which is working on a ‘light-sail’ propulsion system.

The freelance economy is a $5.4 trillion dollar market that McKinsey calls a “seismic shift in how Americans work”.


Yet the headlines this past month have been Open AI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, with Bill Gates saying, “Artificial intelligence is as revolutionary as mobile phones and the Internet”. Rightfully so, the current applications of AI engulf practically every role and skill from content generation, to customer support, to coding to name a few.

So how will this impact the already rapidly rising freelance economy? Will freelancers be replaced? Will companies focus on existing employees and AI rather than freelancers?

Not quite. From my vantage point, artificial intelligence, workflow automation, and applications like ChatGPT will increasingly accelerate the freelance economy for four main reasons.

1. The Freelance Economy is already here
The freelance economy already has a firm foothold with no signs of slowing down.
On the demand side, in the past 12 months, amidst economic uncertainty, layoffs, and hiring freezes, Resume Builder found that 40% of companies are hiring contractors to replace laid off workers, while Mercer reported that 60% of executives say they will substantially replace full time employees with independent workers in the next 3 years.
Supply follows. McKinsey’s recent American Opportunity Survey showed “independent workers reveal a distinctive characteristic: they are far more optimistic about their own futures than the average American worker”.

Even the venture landscape is promising. While startup funding has shrank over 50% in Q3 of 2022, Gale Wilkinson, Managing Partner of Future of Work fund VITALIZE expects the freelance economy to double or triple in the next five years. In her words, “Millennials and Gen Z have a much bigger appetite for freelancing in general. Purely from generational effects, we’re going to double or triple”.

2. Historically Automation has led to more freelancers
In 2018, McKinsey released ‘Automation and the future of the workforce’. In it, they said “More work will be done by freelancers and other contractors, a shift that will boost the emerging ‘gig’ or ‘sharing’ economy”.
This was prior to Covid, a time when remote work was a leading barrier to the benefits of the freelance economy. Post Covid, the normality of remote work has amplified the benefits of the freelance economy. Take HBR’s report in 2020 that highlighted 90% of leaders are prioritizing independent workers.
It makes sense. In September, 2022, Vinod Kartha, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives at UST, said “we realized that more and more people are moving to the independent workforce. When we looked at that pool, it’s like when people talk about talent shortage, open talent was screaming what shortage? So that’s when we realized that there’s really not a talent shortage, but it’s more of a talent shift.” Likewise in November 22, 2022, Mina Bastawros, VP of Creative & Digital Marketing at Airbus, said “There are 70+ million people. We’re 130,000. Imagine having access to 70 million people as a workforce going forward”.
The fundamentals of the freelance economy are inherently technology driven, thus the more technology like AI advances, the more the freelance economy makes sense.

3. AI can level the playing field for freelance marketplaces
Freelance marketplaces are the bridge between independent freelancers and companies. While Open Assembly’s Open Talent Landscape shows over 500 global marketplaces, traditionally freelance marketplaces have been overlooked for larger and already established Managed Service Providers (MSP’s) in order to manage risk, security, compliance, and prevent cases like Microsoft’s $97 million misclassification lawsuit.
AI can level the playing field by enabling these platforms to compete and scale. According to Michael Burdick, CoFounder of Paro, “A large barrier to disruption has been the data and IP traditional incumbents have built up over decades. Large language models and AI enable us to access the internet in a structured way, supercharging foundational capabilities that accelerate the pathway to disruption.”
Take Gigster, a US software development marketplace that executes large scale software projects through a global freelance network. According to Cory Hymel, VP of Product & Research, “we’ve implemented generative AI with positive results into our staffing process and content generation process. We have further plans to integrate into our core platform which will super charge our developer network delivery capabilities.”
Or Scotland based Gigged.AI, they use OpenAI to help their clients best scope work. According to CEO Rich Wilson, “Clients can now use natural language to explain their needs, answer questions, and provide feedback, without any technical barriers. This means our clients can create better milestones, and ultimately, better results.”
Or American based creative marketplace Uncompany. They use ChatGPT to develop project teams quickly. According to CEO Maari Casey, “Before using ChatGPT we were spending about 2 hours a week on building scopes to support clients and freelancers. ChatGPT has reduced that to 30-45 min because we've been able to build a growing catalog of scopes and priced contracts”
Or German software developer marketplace Code Control. They use AI to generate freelancer-enticing job ads within one minute. According to Marc Clemens, Founder & CEO, “often job ads do not have the necessary quality to convince the best applicants. We believe Artificial Intelligence can help solve this problem.”

4. Generative AI exposes the need for upskilling, not more headcount
Who best adopts advanced skills and technologies, freelancers or full time employees?
In Deloitte’s Perspective on the future of shared services, they state, “The alternative workforce tends to update their skills more frequently and can typically ramp up within days rather than weeks”. According to Upwork’s Tony Buffum, “freelancers are upskilling and reskilling 50% more than traditional workers. Updating skills more frequently and ramping up more quickly are key traits of the on-demand workforce compared to the traditional workforce.”
The potential this upskilling creates is material.
Balaji Bondili, Head of Deloitte Pixel recently showed what’s possible in his article Augmented Freelancers: How freelancing marketplaces can win with Generative AI. He analyzed the difference in conducting a literature review on the pricing of software development projects, and in his words, “the estimated time savings using Generative AI for this project would be approximately 70 hours or 70% savings”. That means if you’re hiring a freelancer, they have a higher likelihood to embrace technology with this transformational change in output. Whether this means the project is 70% cheaper is up for debate, but directionally the case is clear.

Remember, Both Technologies Are Early
Both the freelance economy and Generative AI are early in their maturity. Many issues need to be carefully considered, and many questions are yet to pop up. For example in Bondili’s article, he asked, “Will the cost of generating that report proportionally reduce by 70%? And, I am paying the freelancer only 30% of the fee for his/her actual effort?”

By Jonathan Barrett and Stephanie ConverySun 26 Mar 2023 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Mar 2023 00.31 EDTShare3434Michael Scott, the protagonist from the US version of The Office, is using an AI recruiter to hire a receptionist.Guardian Australia applies.The text-based system asks applicants five questions that delve into how they responded to past work situations, including dealing with difficult colleagues and juggling competing work demands.Potential employees type their answers into a chat-style program that resembles a responsive help desk. The real – and unnerving – power of AI then kicks in, sending a score and traits profile to the employer, and a personality report to the applicant. (More on our results later.)This demonstration, by the Melbourne-based startup Sapia.ai, resembles the initial structured interview process used by their clients, who include some of Australia’s biggest companies such as Qantas, Medibank, Suncorp and Woolworths.The process would typically create a shortlist an employer can follow up on, with insights on personality markers including humility, extraversion and conscientiousness.6:05How an AI voice clone fooled Centrelink – videoFor customer service roles, it is designed to help an employer know whether someone is amiable. For a manual role, an employer might want to know whether an applicant will turn up on time.“You basically interview the world; everybody gets an interview,” says Sapia’s founder and chief executive, Barb Hyman.The selling points of AI hiring are clear: it can automate costly and time-consuming processes for businesses and government agencies, especially in large recruitment drives for non-managerial roles.Sapia’s biggest claim, however, might be that it is the only way to give someone a fair interview.“The only way to remove bias in hiring is to not use people right at the first gate,” Hyman says. “That’s where our technology comes in: it’s blind; it’s untimed, it doesn’t use résumé data or your social media data or demographic data. All it is using is the text results.”View image in fullscreenSapia founder and chief executive Barb Hyman says AI hiring is the only way to give someone a fair interview. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianA patchy track recordSapia is not the only AI company claiming its technology will reduce bias in the hiring process. A host of companies around Australia are offering AI-augmented recruitment tools, including not just chat-based models but also one-way video interviews, automated reference checks, social media analysers and more.In 2022 a survey of Australian public sector agencies found at least a quarter had used AI-assisted tech in recruitment that year. Separate research from the Diversity Council of Australia and Monash University suggests that a third of Australian organisations are using it at some point in the hiring process.Applicants, though, are often not aware that they will be subjected to an automated process, or on what basis they will be assessed within that.The office of the Merit Protection Commissioner advises public service agencies that when they use AI tools for recruitment, there should be “a clear demonstrated connection between the candidate’s qualities being assessed and the qualities required to perform the duties of the job”.

The commissioner’s office also cautions that AI may assess candidates on something other than merit, raise ethical and legal concerns about transparency and data bias, produce biased results or cause “statistical bias” by erroneously interpreting socioeconomic markers as indicative of success.There’s good reason for that warning. AI’s track record on bias has been worrying.Finding it hard to get a new job? Robot recruiters might be to blameRead moreIn 2017 Amazon quietly scrapped an experimental candidate-ranking tool that had been trained on CVs from the mostly male tech industry, effectively teaching itself that male candidates were preferable. The tool systematically downgraded women’s CVs, penalising those that included phrases such as “women’s chess club captain”, and elevating those that used verbs more commonly found on male engineers’ CVs, such as “executed” and “captured”.Research out of the US in 2020 demonstrated that facial-analysis technology created by Microsoft and IBM, among others, performed better on lighter-skinned subjects and men, with darker-skinned females most often misgendered by the programs.Last year a study out of Cambridge University showed that AI is not a benign intermediary but that “by constructing associations between words and people’s bodies” it helps to produce the “ideal candidate” rather than merely observing or identifying it.Natalie Sheard, a lawyer and PhD candidate at La Trobe University whose doctorate examines the regulation of and discrimination in AI-based hiring systems, says this lack of transparency is a huge problem for equity.View image in fullscreenAt least a quarter of Australian public sector agencies used AI-assisted tech in recruitment in 2022. Illustration: JYPIX/Alamy“Messenger-style apps are based on natural language processing, similar to ChatGPT, so the training data for those systems tends to be the words or vocal sounds of people who speak standard English,” Sheard says.“So if you’re a non-native speaker, how does it deal with you? It might say you don’t have good communication skills if you don’t use standard English grammar, or you might have different cultural traits that the system might not recognise because it was trained on native speakers.”Another concern is how physical disability is accounted for in something like a chat or video interview. And with the lack of transparency around whether assessments are being made with AI and on what basis, it’s often impossible for candidates to know that they may need reasonable adjustments to which they are legally entitled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And these systems change traditional recruitment practices, so you don’t know what the assessment is all about, you don’t know an algorithm is going to assess you or how. You might not know that you need a reasonable adjustment.”Australia has no laws specifically governing AI recruitment tools. While the department of industry has developed an AI ethics framework, which includes principles of transparency, explainability, accountability and privacy, the code is voluntary.“There are low levels of understanding in the community about AI systems, and because employers are very reliant on these vendors, they deploy [the tools] without any governance systems,” Sheard says.“Employers don’t have any bad intent, they want to do the right things but they have no idea what they should be doing. There are no internal oversight mechanisms set up, no independent auditing systems to ensure there is no bias.”A question of diversityHyman says client feedback and independent research shows that the broader community is comfortable with recruiters using AI.“They need to have an experience that is inviting, inclusive and attracts more diversity,” Hyman says. She says Sapia’s untimed, low-stress, text-based system fits this criteria.“You are twice as likely to get women and keep women in the hiring process when you’re using AI. It’s a complete fiction that people don’t want it and don’t trust it. We see the complete opposite in our data.”View image in fullscreenHyman says Sapia’s language analysis is based on the ‘billion words of data’ collected from responses in the years since the tech company was founded in 2013. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianResearch from the Diversity Council of Australia and Monash University is not quite so enthusiastic, showing there is a “clear divide” between employers and candidates who were “converted” or “cautious” about AI recruitment tools, with 50% of employers converted to the technology but only a third of job applicants. First Nations job applicants were among those most likely to be worried.DCA recommends recruiters be transparent about the due diligence protocols they have in place to ensure AI-supported recruitment tools are “bias-free, inclusive and accessible”.In the Sapia demonstration, the AI quickly generates brief notes of personality feedback at the end of the application for the interviewee.This is based on how someone rates on various markers, including conscientiousness and agreeableness, which the AI matches with pre-written phrases that resemble something a life coach might say.How AI fooled Centrelink, and could fool youRead moreA more thorough assessment – not visible to the applicant – would be sent to the recruiter.Sapia says its chat-interview software analysed language proficiency, with a profanity detector included too, with the company saying these were important considerations for customer-facing roles.Hyman says the language analysis is based on the “billion words of data” collected from responses in the years since the tech company was founded in 2013. The data itself is proprietary.You’re (not) hired!So, could Guardian Australian work for Michael Scott at the fictional paper company Dunder Mifflin?“You are self-assured but not overly confident,” the personality feedback says in response to Guardian Australia’s application in the AI demonstration.It follows with a subtle suggestion that this applicant might not be a good fit for the receptionist role, which requires “repetition, routine and following a defined process”.But it has some helpful advice: “Potentially balance that with variety outside of work.”Looks like we’re not a good fit for this job.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingBusinessfeaturesShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based in New York, Runway builds generative AI tools that run in the browser to generate, edit, remix, and reimagine media. After the Oscars hubbub waned a bit, we talked about the future of movies and design with Runway co-founder and CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela.AWS scholarship recipient is creating a slam dunk solution for parents who have to miss their kids’ sports gamesAn AWS AI &amp; ML Scholarship program gives students hands-on experience and skills to compete in the job market.Watch nowTell us about the origins of Runway and how your background in researching and teaching design led to its founding. How is Runway an extension of that thinking and exploration?My two co-founders and I met in art school at New York University. We were really interested to see how computational creativity and neural techniques—an approach used in machine learning models that mimics in part how we learn—could serve filmmakers, artists, and creatives. And so, we started building tools and conducting research for storytellers to interact with this emerging technology. Today, our research has continued to advance, and we have over 30 AI Magic Tools across video, image, 3D, and text, all with the goal of democratizing content creation and making creative tools more accessible.What does Runway do and offer?Runway is a full-stack AI applied research company. We invent and build AI models for content creation, and we develop tools for our users to create and edit content, through every aspect of the creative process, from preproduction to postproduction. We’re allowing anyone, regardless of skill level, to be able to create professional-grade content.For those of us without a background in machine learning, can you give us some of the fundamentals of generative AI and how it gets applied in your world?At a general level, generative AI and AI systems are complex mathematical algorithms used to understand data or generate new data points. But for our users, they are simple tools that make videomaking workflows effortless. That’s a huge part of why tools like ours have taken off, because they fit right into an existing workflow with a familiar look and feel. Of course, underneath those interfaces, there’s incredibly complex algorithms working together to produce the results you see.More broadly, generative AI tools work by generating new data using patterns learned in existing data. These algorithms can then synthesize new data that didn’t exist before. To generate new things—like images, video, or text—you can use different input mechanisms. For example, natural language has become one of the easiest ways to control image generation algorithms, but other input systems like video are also possible. This is how the first iteration of our video generation model, Gen-1, works.How was AI used in making 'Everything Everywhere All at Once'? And can you please also explain what the “multiverse” is?The Everything Everywhere All at Once film had an unusually small team of visual effects artists who were working against tight deadlines. Evan Halleck was on this team, and he used Runway's AI tools to save time and automate tedious aspects of editing. Specifically in the film’s rock scene, he used Runway’s rotoscoping tool to get a quick, clean cut of the rocks as sand and dust were moving around the shot. This translated days of work to a matter of minutes.Graphic provided by Runway.Graphic provided by Runway.01 / 02Where does AWS and the cloud fit in the creation process?AWS is critical for what we do. To create, train, and deploy enterprise-scale AI models requires immense computing power, and our work with AWS has helped us deliver products that millions of people can use.How the nation’s largest classroom—PBS—uses AWS to teach everyonePBS is making media of all kinds more accessible to more people than ever, with help from the cloud.Watch nowMovies are phenomenally expensive to make, and in particular, visual effects are expensive. Do the tools that Runway offers coupled with the AWS Cloud change that calculus?Yes, absolutely. The power of tools like Runway paired with the cloud make it possible for filmmakers and other creatives to save significant amounts of time and money as they bring their ideas to life. We are building toward a future where it will be possible to craft entire feature-length films and stories—from the characters, scores, b-roll, backgrounds, and everything in between—through words alone and in a fraction of the time.Are AI-driven tools the future of design? And if so, are they part of a continuum of design tools or a completely new way of thinking about design?AI-driven tools are absolutely the future of design, allowing artists to express themselves in new and previously unimaginable ways. Tools and technological advancements throughout history have had an impact on design. If we go back to the mid-1800s, there’s a great example of this in the invention of the paint tube, which gave paint a longer shelf life and could be repeatedly opened and closed for painting outdoors. This ultimately led to the impressionist movement for modern painting—it’s no different from the massive creative shift we’re experiencing now in content creation.How will generative AI drive the film world going forward? What does that look like for creators and for movie fans?As adoption of generative AI tools continues to increase, we’re moving toward a world where everyone is going to be able to make the films that only a handful of people were able to create before. The rise of generative AI is saving hours to days of editing labor, freeing up time for users to focus on more creative aspects of the job. Movie fans can expect to see entirely generated films in the future.You just sponsored an AI film festival. What were the rules, and what was the outcome?Runway hosted the first-ever AI Film Festival with an event in New York City, where we showcased ten short films from creators. The films considered had to be created using AI-powered editing techniques and/or feature AI-generated content. The festival also featured an expert panel to discuss the future of filmmaking more broadly, and this included award-winning filmmaker Darren Aronofsky.Can we see the winners?Absolutely. Here are the 10 films that took home the prizes.Final question, for all the artists—and the artist inside all of us—how should we think about the relationship between technologies like generative AI and art?We’re on the precipice of a massive shift when it comes to content creation that is empowering for creatives around the world. New technologies like generative AI are allowing more diverse stories to be told and opening the door to possibilities that artists could only dream of in the past. These tools are ushering in the next generation of artistic expression, which will be highly democratized and accessible.Visit Runway’s new entertainment and production division for a taste of how they’re partnering with the next generation of storytellers.",AWS,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/how-ai-tools-are-creating-new-possibilities-for-movies-and-visual-design-according-to-this-aws-powered-startup'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beamery recently launched TalentGPT, the first generative AI for HR technology. The AI is expected to personalize the insights and recommendations for its users. It is also expected to transform talent acquisition and management experience.
Beamery, a talent lifecycle management solutions provider, has announced that it has launched TalentGPT, the first generative AI for HR technology. With TalentGPT, Beamery aims to transform talent acquisition as well as talent management experience with generative AI.
TalentGPT To Deliver Personalized Experiences to Users
TalentGPT offers a single assistant using Beamery’s proprietary AI and Talent Graph, OpenAI’s GPT-4, and a few other pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). This combination is expected to help TalentGPT personalize the insights and recommendations it provides to its users, such as recruiters, candidates, managers, and employees. The combination is also expected to allow TalentGPT to generate content that adapts to changing customer requirements and information in real time.

Beamery also claims that it is the first organization to undergo an independent audit of its AI models to ensure there is no bias.
Talking about TalentGPT, Sultan Saidov, co-founder and president of Beamery, saidOpens a new window , “We are not just incorporating TalentGPT into all of our products — this new technology is enabling us to radically simplify and redesign all of our user experiences. It is hard to overstate how much these advances in AI technology are improving the interactions we can provide to our users, and how much time we can save people in achieving complex tasks.”
He further told Spiceworks, “Generative AI in HR presents an opportunity to create uniquely personalized experiences across the talent lifecycle — from generating better job descriptions, to helping employees take the next step in their career, to helping executives answer critical talent questions. With concerns around compliance within AI rising, we’ve also focused on mitigating the risks typically associated with ChatGPT and other large language models by connecting them with our bias-audited AI controls.”

Cisco is introducing a suite of generative artificial intelligence-driven features in its Webex video conferencing platform, from meeting summaries to visual enhancements. These features are aimed at both customer communications and hybrid working end users.
The company joins enterprises like Microsoft, Salesforce, Adobe and Google in adding generative AI capabilities to its service. The new upgrades to Webex include AI-powered audio, video, natural language understanding and analytics enhancements.

Webex looks to grab market share from Zoom, others
According to customer relationship management data company Datanyze, Zoom is the market leader in video conferencing, with 72.61% market share and more than 176,757 companies using it. It reports that Cisco Webex is a distant second with 8.6% with more than 20,935 companies using Webex.
After Webex, according to Datanyze, are GoToWebinar with 7% of the global market share, On24, Adobe Connect, Livestorm, GoToMeeting and Google Hangouts.
Cisco on multi-year path to incorporate machine learning
Javed Khan, senior vice president and general manager of collaboration at Cisco, said the company has been advancing its use of machine learning systems for at least three years.

“Cisco has been investing in this for 10 or 15 [years], starting with basic things like noise cancellation and with some of our video conferencing technologies that have the ability to detect faces and zoom in and out,” Khan said. “So, we have been working on this for a while.
“What’s happened in the last couple of years is that the underlying technologies reached a point where the level of processing in real time and the amount of training data available has just grown exponentially. So these technologies, I think, have gotten 100 times better, which is allowing for things that weren’t possible before.”
Khan said that in the last three years Cisco spent about $1.5 billion acquiring several companies including Voicea and BabbleLabs for voice enhancing technologies as well as MindMeld, a natural language-processing company.
AI enhancements in Webex
Cisco said the integration of AI has allowed the company to make several text and image enhancements that include image optimizing, 3D effects and natural-language queries.
Cinematics for Webex devices
The upgrades to Webex add a cinematic quality to user video using its RoomOS conference video system, which optimizes video by automatically switching between cameras, for example, if a user is employing more than one.
The company said the feature also allows IT administrators to create virtual spaces, or meeting zones, that automatically exclude distracting objects or people.
The cinematic feature includes the ability to capture the speaker at their best angle by automatically switching views.
Webex’s portrait effect
The AI baked into Webex also lets users choose to do complex visual optimizing effects, such as adding depth and sharpness to one’s appearance and making low-resolution video high definition (Figure A).

Further, the AI recognizes human gestures and can add on-screen emojis corresponding to them, including gestures like hands raised for celebration, pressed together for thanks and request, and a heart for affection. It also adds animated features like confetti, fireflies and universe effects (Figure B).

And if a speaker leaves the camera view zone without departing the meeting, the AI can recognize this and display a “be right back” icon (Figure C).

Message recommendations
The message recommendations feature uses AI to prioritize chat and space messages based on interactions with team members and other people users engage with most. Space recommendations suggest relevant Webex spaces to join based on similar people and engagements.
Webex’s tools for customer-facing communications
Cisco said its use of large language models in Webex customer experience made it possible to deploy in its Webex Contact Center automated, AI-fueled features like:

Virtual Agents: A self-service chatbot.
Agent Answers: A feature that provides real-time recommendations to an agent based on their inquiry.
Contextual Chat Summary: A new feature, which will be available on the Webex Connect platform to automatically summarize any long-form text across digital channels. It can be used with Webex Contact Center or any other third-party contact center solution.

The company said it is also adding generative AI capabilities to Webex Campaign, part of Webex’s communications platform-as-a-service solutions portfolio. These functions include:

A subject line generator for email subject lines for marketers and content creators.
Evaluate Node for developers and IT professionals, designed to simplify building new flows and applications.

Khan said Webex AI capabilities will roll out over the course of 2023, with some available now.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted surveys of both employers and workers to understand the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the workplace. Here are some of the main findings from the surveys:
 

Increased productivity: Employers reported that AI has helped to increase productivity in their organizations. The majority of employers (nearly 70%) reported that AI has led to moderate or significant productivity gains.


New types of jobs: While AI is expected to automate some jobs, it is also creating new types of jobs. Over 50% of employers reported that AI has led to the creation of new job categories in their organizations.


Upskilling and reskilling: AI is also leading to a need for upskilling and reskilling among workers. Over 60% of employers reported that AI has created a need for new skills in their organizations.


Improved decision-making: AI is helping employers make better decisions. Nearly 60% of employers reported that AI has led to better decision-making in their organizations.


Worker anxiety: While workers generally have positive attitudes towards AI, there is some anxiety about the impact on jobs. Nearly 60% of workers are concerned about job displacement due to AI, and nearly 50% are concerned about the impact on job quality.


Support for training: Both employers and workers support training programs to help workers develop the skills needed for the AI-driven workplace. Over 70% of employers and workers support government investment in training programs.

Overall, the surveys suggest that AI is having a positive impact on the workplace in terms of productivity gains and new job opportunities. However, it is also leading to a need for upskilling and reskilling among workers, and there is some anxiety about the impact on jobs. Both employers and workers support training programs to help workers adapt to the changing workplace.

ChatGPT
Every word of this article up to now was written by ChatGPT in a fraction of the time it took to read them. ChatGPT an artificial intelligence tool that allows for human like conversations by using natural language and it learns as it goes. It is being used more and more to assist with the writing of emails, code, academic essays and as we can see, analysis and website articles.  By simply inputting the title of the piece of research, ChaptGPT was able to produce an analysis in seconds. The tool also ""remembers what user said earlier in the conversation, allows user to provide follow-up corrections and is trained to decline inappropriate requests"". It also sets out some of the limitations of the tool such as that it ""may occasionally generate incorrect information, may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content and has a limited knowledge of world and events after 2021"".

The Future of Work
A 2019 report by the OECD on Well-being in the Digital Age found that the digital transformation could compound existing socio-economic inequalities, with the benefits in terms of earnings and opportunities accruing to a few, and the risks falling more heavily on people with lower levels of education and skills. The report notes that 14 per cent of all jobs are at high risk of being lost due to automation, with another 32 per cent at risk of significant change over the next 10 to 20 years. This means that nearly half of the labour force will be impacted by changes to their jobs as a result of automation by 2040. The pandemic provided a powerful test of the potential of online learning, and it also revealed its key limitations, including the prerequisite of adequate digital skills, computer equipment and internet connection to undertake training online, the difficulty of delivering traditional work-based learning online, and the struggle of teachers used to classroom instruction. Our training and skills development policy must be adapted to meet this challenge.
in light of the growth and availability of powerful tools like ChatGPT, lifelong learning, up-skilling and re-skilling are becoming more and more important to ensure relevant skills for the labour force as well as making an important contribution to make to people’s wellbeing, to creating a more inclusive society and to supporting a vibrant and sustainable economy. The non-vocational element of lifelong learning and community education also brings major social and health benefits to participants outside the labour force. Access to lifelong learning should be an integral part of the education system in order to address the income and labour market challenges that some members of society face. It also must be accessible and flexible to address the challenges which were identified in the Adult Skills Survey, those of unmet demand and being difficult to access. Various agencies (European Commission, Expert Group on Future Skills Needs) identify generic skills and key competences as a core element of the lifelong learning framework. These include basic skills such as literacy, numeracy, digital competence, language skills, people-related and conceptual skills, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, risk assessment and decision making.

Further Education and Training
The lifelong opportunities of those who are educationally disadvantaged are in sharp contrast to the opportunities for meaningful participation of those who have completed a second or third-level education. If the Constitutionally-enshrined right to education is to be meaningful, there needs to be recognition of the barriers to learning that some children of school-going age experience, particularly in disadvantaged areas, which result in premature exit from education. In this context, second chance education and continuing education are vitally important and require on-going support and resourcing. Although the funding available for education increased in Budgets since 2016, the deficits that exist within the system, particularly as a result of the impact of austerity budgeting, require significant additional resources. This requires the development of a long-term education policy strategy across the whole educational spectrum to ensure that education and continuous upskilling and development of the workforce is prioritised if Ireland is to remain competitive in an increasingly global marketplace and ensure the availability of sustainable employment. A key policy component must be a review of the age profile of apprenticeships and how this can be expanded (as outlined earlier in this chapter) and the integration of the latest OECD recommendations on training and skills into the National Skills Strategy. Further Education has a key role to play to ensure we meet our lifelong learning targets and it must be supported and resourced to ensure we meet our targets.

Artificial intelligence could impact the work tasks of roughly 80 percent of the U.S. workforce, according to new research, as the tech develops in ways that could augment or even displace some labor. 
Researchers from OpenAI, OpenResearch and the University of Pennsylvania argue in a new paper, posted to arXiv, that around 80 percent of the workforce could have at least 10 percent of their work affected by the implementation of large language models, including Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), in their industry. 


  

Nearly 20 percent of workers could see at least 50 percent of their work tasks impacted — and around 15 percent of all work tasks in the U.S. “could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality” with access to the artificial intelligence tool.
The researchers used AI to get to their findings and looked at exposure to the tech “as a proxy for potential economic impact” and didn’t distinguish “between labor-augmenting or labor-displacing effects.”
Several occupations — including mathematicians, writers and authors, journalists, web and digital interface designers and tax preparers — as highly exposed, meaning the researchers predict GPT tech could significantly cut down work task time in the jobs.
The paper concludes that LLM technologies “could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications” if implemented in the U.S. workforce. 
OpenAI developed the language processing system ChatGPT, which used advanced tech to generate human-like conversation, and its growing popularity has sparked both interest and concerns about the possible broader implications of using artificial intelligence in school, in the workforce and elsewhere.
Some have raised worries AI could be abused by students in school settings to generate essays with information pulled from the internet. Last week, fabricated AI-generated images of former President Trump being arrested circulated on the internet.

They are revolutionizing the way we approach complex generative AI tasks. These models are based on the mathematics of gaussian principles, variance, differential equations, and generative sequences. (We’ll explain the technical jargon below)Modern AI-centric products and solutions developed by Nvidia, Google, Adobe, and OpenAI have put diffusion models at the center of the limelight. DALL.E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney are prominent examples of diffusion models that are making rounds on the internet recently. Users provide a simple text prompt as input, and these models can convert them into realistic images, such as the one shown below.An image generated with Midjourney v5 using input prompt: vibrant California poppies. Source: MidjourneyLet’s explore the fundamental working principles of diffusion models and how they are changing the directions and norms of the world as we see it today.What Are Diffusion Models?According to the research publication “Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models,” the diffusion models are defined as:“A diffusion model or probabilistic diffusion model is a parameterized Markov chain trained using variational inference to produce samples matching the data after finite time”Simply put, diffusion models can generate data similar to the ones they are trained on. If the model trains on images of cats, it can generate similar realistic images of cats.Now let’s try to break down the technical definition mentioned above. The diffusion models take inspiration from the working principle and mathematical foundation of a probabilistic model that can analyze and predict a system’s behavior that varies with time, such as predicting stock market return or the pandemic's spread.The definition states that they are parameterized Markov chains trained with variational inference. Markov chains are mathematical models that define a system that switches between different states over time. The existing state of the system can only determine the probability of transitioning to a specific state. In other words, the current state of a system holds the possible states a system can follow or acquire at any given time.Training the model using variational inference involves complex calculations for probability distributions. It aims to find the exact parameters of the Markov chain that match the observed (known or actual) data after a specific time. This process minimizes the value of the model’s loss function, which is the difference between the predicted (unknown) and observed (known) state.Once trained, the model can generate samples matching the observed data. These samples represent possible trajectories or state the system could follow or acquire over time, and each trajectory has a different probability of happening. Hence, the model can predict the system's future behavior by generating a range of samples and finding their respective probabilities (likelihood of these events to happen).How to Interpret Diffusion Models in AI?Diffusion models are deep generative models that work by adding noise (Gaussian noise) to the available training data (also known as the forward diffusion process) and then reversing the process (known as denoising or the reverse diffusion process) to recover the data. The model gradually learns to remove the noise. This learned denoising process generates new, high-quality images from random seeds (random noised images), as shown in the illustration below.Reverse diffusion process: A noisy image is denoised to recover the original image (or generate its variations) via a trained diffusion model. Source: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models3 Diffusion Model CategoriesThere are three fundamental mathematical frameworks that underpin the science behind diffusion models. All three work on the same principles of adding noise and then removing it to generate new samples. Let’s discuss them below.A diffusion model adds and removes noise from an image. Source: Diffusion Models in Vision: A Survey1. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)As explained above, DDPMs are generative models mainly used to remove noise from visual or audio data. They have shown impressive results on various image and audio denoising tasks. For instance, the filmmaking industry uses modern image and video processing tools to improve production quality.2. Noise-Conditioned Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs)SGMs can generate new samples from a given distribution. They work by learning an estimation score function that can estimate the log density of the target distribution. Log density estimation makes assumptions for available data points that its a part of an unknown dataset (test set). This score function can then generate new data points from the distribution.For instance, deep fakes are notorious for producing fake videos and audios of famous personalities. But they are mostly attributed to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, SGMs have shown similar capabilities – at times outperform – in generating high-quality celebrity faces. Also, SGMs can help expand healthcare datasets, which are not readily available in large quantities due to strict regulations and industry standards.3. Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)SDEs describe changes in random processes concerning time. They are widely used in physics and financial markets involving random factors that significantly impact market outcomes.For instance, the prices of commodities are highly dynamic and impacted by a range of random factors. SDEs calculate financial derivatives like futures contracts (like crude oil contracts). They can model the fluctuations and calculate favorable prices accurately to give a sense of security.Major Applications of Diffusion Models in AILet’s look at some widely adapted practices and uses of diffusion models in AI.High-Quality Video GenerationCreating high-end videos using deep learning is challenging as it requires high continuity of video frames. This is where diffusion models come in handy as they can generate a subset of video frames to fill in between the missing frames, resulting in high-quality and smooth videos with no latency.Researchers have developed the Flexible Diffusion Model and Residual Video Diffusion techniques to serve this purpose. These models can also produce realistic videos by seamlessly adding AI-generated frames between the actual frames.These models can simply extend the FPS (frames per second) of a low FPS video by adding dummy frames after learning the patterns from available frames. With almost no frame loss, these frameworks can further assist deep learning-based models to generate AI-based videos from scratch that look like natural shots from high-end cam setups.A wide range of remarkable AI video generators is available in 2023 to make video content production and editing quick and straightforward.Text-to-Image GenerationText-to-image models use input prompts to generate high-quality images. For instance, giving input “red apple on a plate” and producing a photorealistic image of an apple on a plate. Blended diffusion and unCLIP are two prominent examples of such models that can generate highly relevant and accurate images based on user input.Also, GLIDE by OpenAI is another widely known solution released in 2021 that produces photorealistic images using user input. Later, OpenAI released DALL.E-2, its most advanced image generation model yet.Similarly, Google has also developed an image generation model known as Imagen, which uses a large language model to develop a deep textual understanding of the input text and then generates photorealistic images.We have mentioned other popular image-generation tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion (DreamStudio) above. Have a look at an image generated using Stable Diffusion below.An image created with Stable Diffusion 1.5 using the following prompt: “collages, hyper-realistic, many variations portrait of very old thom yorke, face variations, singer-songwriter, ( side ) profile, various ages, macro lens, liminal space, by lee bermejo, alphonse mucha and greg rutkowski, greybeard, smooth face, cheekbones”Diffusion Models in AI – What to Expect in the Future?Diffusion models have revealed promising potential as a robust approach to generating high-quality samples from complex image and video datasets. By improving human capability to use and manipulate data, diffusion models can potentially revolutionize the world as we see it today. We can expect to see even more applications of diffusion models becoming an integral part of our daily lives.Having said that, diffusion models are not the only generative AI technique. Researchers also use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders, and flow-based deep generative models to generate AI content. Understanding the fundamental characteristics that differentiate diffusion models from other generative models can help produce more effective solutions in the coming days.To learn more about AI-based technologies, visit Unite.ai.

The recent splash of Large Language Model (LLM) applications like GPT has generated considerable discourse around how society and government should respond to the technology.
Some worry that LLM technology will create AI companions that could become a new type of vice in the sense that some people could get so sucked into them that it may disrupt their normal functioning in harmful ways, especially when it comes to creating and maintaining important social ties. Others worry that LLM technology could be used by malicious actors or perhaps become so advanced that it becomes capable of independent malicious action.
But right now, the most common concern you hear, which is also the most immediate, is about LLMs being used as labor-saving technology that results in widespread job loss and displacement.
Every time a new technology or a new economic proposal requires a significant reallocation of labor — such as the phasing out of fossil fuels or the creation of a universal public health insurance system — we see this exact same discourse. It’s a strange discourse in that it never really changes but we also treat every instance of it as if it is a novel thing that requires a novel response.
The problem of job reallocation is a general one that is rooted in the fact that our national income is primarily doled out using factor payments to labor and capital. When people lose their jobs, their labor factor payments are reduced to $0 until such time as they find a new job. Finding a new job may also be difficult if the kinds of jobs a person is capable of doing are shrinking in number due to technological shifts. Once a new job is found, the factor payments that flow to it may also be significantly lower than the factor payments that flowed to the person’s prior job.
This constellation of issues is not constrained to a small group of people nor is it constrained to unique mass job loss events. In a typical year, there are around 20 million unemployment events in the US, defined as the number of times a person went from employed in one month to unemployed in the next month. 

The solution to this problem is fairly straightforward and well-known. Give unemployed people cash benefits to replace their prior wages. Give them job search and retraining assistance to help them find new work. And, possibly, give them wage insurance to ensure that, if they do end up reallocated into a lower-paying job, they can receive benefits to make up for some of the difference, at least for some time.
When you ask ChatGPT “what kinds of welfare programs could help people whose suffer job loss and lower pay due to being displaced by artificial intelligence,” it actually gives the same answer:
As artificial intelligence continues to advance, it may lead to job displacement and lower wages for some workers. To help those affected by these changes, governments can implement various welfare programs aimed at easing the transition and supporting workers as they adapt to the new job landscape. Some potential welfare programs include:1. Unemployment benefits: Providing financial assistance to workers who have lost their jobs, allowing them to meet basic needs while they search for new employment opportunities.2. Wage insurance: As previously mentioned, wage insurance programs can help workers who find new jobs with lower pay by compensating them for a portion of the difference between their previous and current wages for a limited period.3. Job training and reskilling programs: Investing in training programs to help displaced workers acquire new skills that are in demand, making them more competitive in the job market.4. Education subsidies and grants: Offering financial assistance for workers to pursue further education, including university degrees or vocational training, to improve their job prospects.5. Career counseling and job placement services: Providing guidance and support to help workers navigate the job market, identify new opportunities, and find suitable employment.
To this, I would add a couple of points.
Wage insurance is the conceptually clear answer to how to cushion the income shock from someone being reallocated into a lower-paying job, but this is a very uncommon program in the world. I actually don’t know of any country that has a significant wage insurance program in their welfare state.As a general matter, how possible it is for someone to be reallocated into a job that pays much less than their current job is a function of how compressed or uncompressed a society’s wage scale is and how much of each person’s income and consumption bundle depends on their personal employment. In societies with very compressed wages and robust universal welfare states — like the Nordic societies — the ultimate differences between different labor market positions are relatively small, making it mathematically difficult for people to experience a major cut in their standard of living due to changing jobs. In the US, the opposite is true.
My writing frequently comes back to this same point, but that’s because it really is the solution to so much of the economic distress people experience and worry about in the US. An egalitarian society with a robust welfare state creates the kind of stability and minimum living standards that takes the financial sting out of things like unemployment, labor reallocation, disability, old age, and having children. We need this kind of society at all times, not just during splashy labor reallocation events like the one LLMs might cause.

New Intelligence Announcements for Talent Acquisition and Talent Management

The Product Innovation Keynote at IAMPHENOM established that insights for knowledge workers are critical to optimize performance and process. To appropriately address the needs of the modern organization, Phenom introduced new technology that improves the hiring cycle for candidates, interview process for internal stakeholders, and growth and retention aspirations of talent management and managers:


Interview Intelligence disrupts the traditional interview process by bringing transparency to hiring teams with recordings, transcriptions, and key takeaways to move the process forward faster and improve decision making. Analysis of interview sentiment, talk speed, talk-to-listen ratio and voice energy are available to inform interview training opportunities and improvements for hiring teams.


Candidate Hub is a one-stop-shop that helps candidates understand where they are in the hiring process and prepare for next steps. Taking context into account, it gives exposure to relevant jobs, company information, hiring status, and potential future career pathing opportunities. Candidates can easily schedule and reschedule interviews, and access a digital interview coach that provides them with a preparation checklist.


Workforce Intelligence provides talent management teams with context and oversight into talent within their organization to ensure they are appropriately onboarded, retained and developed. A main dashboard provides hiring trends, churn rate, retention risks and high performers. Talent management can further drill down into three key areas: 1) Dynamic role architecture to analyze skills, competencies, and additional contexts to determine which employees are available to upskill or reskill into future roles, and initiate upskilling/reskilling initiatives; 2) Comprehensive employee profiles to identify tenure, performance, growth trajectory, fit for openings and progressions, and options for succession planning; and 3) Skills intelligence to determine where gaps and training needs exist, providing visibility into endorsed skills, self-reported skills, open jobs and roles that require skills, and the learning opportunities, mentors and gig projects available to address gaps. With workforce intelligence at their disposal, Employee Relationship Management (ERM) enables talent management and people managers to take appropriate action such as initiating an upskilling project to acquire new skills to enhance one’s job performance or career advancements.


Succession Planning facilitates growth, development, and movement within the organization, providing a means to plan for the future. It identifies existing employees who are suitable for succession for specific roles, and determines eligibility and readiness based on tenure, performance, skills, competencies, and other relevant signals. This feature makes it easy to add new employees to a succession plan, evaluate which successors have been assigned to specific roles, and move and grow employees in the organization.


People Manager provides business leaders with the actionable intelligence they need to build high-performing teams by surfacing an employee’s current sentiment, career growth plans, learning opportunities, recommendations for upskilling/reskilling, and overall talent retention effectiveness. It also simplifies the process of endorsing a direct report’s skills.


New Automation Announcements for Talent Acquisition and Talent Management

Phenom also announced new automation technology for frontline and hourly workers that will empower them to reduce friction and connect candidates with jobs faster, foster employee development, and reduce tedious, manual tasks for recruiters.


Automation Engine is the powerful backend behind phenomenal hiring, growth and retention experiences. It provides the framework and components to identify, build, implement, and monitor automation workflows into new or existing talent lifecycle processes (e.g., hiring, career development, and retention). It includes workflow intelligence for constant monitoring and qualitative analysis of workflow performance and provides recommendations for optimization. Process mining capabilities identify opportunities to optimize further — leading to outcomes such as improved conversion rates and higher volume of hires in less time.


Talent Companion provides an always-on, omnichannel approach to engage candidates throughout the hiring process — facilitating a streamlined application, interview and hiring experience. It provides real-time responses to questions, helps prepare for interviews and shares reminders at the right time to eliminate any guesswork.


High-Volume Hiring delivers full end-to-end automation of the hiring process, from first interaction to hire. It is designed specifically for industries such as retail, transportation, hospitality, and manufacturing that require a fast and frictionless candidate onboarding experience. Using AI-based workflows, High-Volume Hiring removes redundant processes that can clog the volume hiring pipeline. It also reduces the strain on recruiting teams by automating for high-volume and seasonal staffing surges so they can shift their focus to lengthier knowledge worker hiring cycles.


Requisition and Offer Management for High-Volume Hiring enables hiring managers to autonomously raise requisitions and extend offers to candidates, accelerating the process of making opportunities available to candidates, while reducing reliance on other stakeholders and decreasing time to hire.


Career Pathing for Frontline gathers an employee’s experience, tenure and behaviors and surfaces their next best-fit role within their organization. Growth trajectories can be tailored based on an organization’s unique role requirements.


Alumni Network re-engages former employees to strengthen and maintain positive long-term company relationships. The network can be leveraged from a recruitment perspective to make alumni employees aware of new openings that can bring them back to the company — supporting aspirations to rehire already trained talent and provide potential career advancement opportunities.


New Platform Experience Announcements

Phenom designed additional platform enhancements, including: Design Studio which provides talent and brand marketers with high-fidelity career design within a no-code framework; People Analytics that puts data behind every hiring, growth and retention decision; AI Control Center that enables organizations with controls and configurations to maximize the full potential of intelligence across the platform based on individual preferences and requirements; Connector Studio which improves integration with critical third-party applications and technology to improve business performance.

Goldman Sachs warned in a report Sunday that around the world, as many as 300 million jobs could be impacted by artificial intelligence automation, CNBC reported. While CEOs and c-suite level employees have long predicted AI would significantly impact jobs requiring manual labor and customer service, the rapid evolution of generative AI like ChatGPT and its ability to debug and create code has illuminated the potential for disturbances in the tech field. This industry has already experienced over 118,000 layoffs in 2023, according to Crunchbase. &#xA0; INDIAN JUDGE ASKS CHATGPT TO HELP DECIDE BAIL FOR MURDER SUSPECT  Tom Taulli, the author of &quot;Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction,&quot; suggested that some of these layoffs were due to automation technology being able to take over functions and &quot;repetitive processes&quot; in various fields. &quot;Over the next few years, several professions that we thought may have been immune to this we will find are not,&quot; he said. He said that things like ChatGPT can configure and write the code for programmers, debug problems and even find the most optimal way to lay out the algorithm. &quot;If you&apos;re more of a cut and paste early level programmer you better up your skills. Those are skills that are going to be automated,&quot; Taulli added. Taulli also warned that safeguards need to be implemented for &quot;life and death industries,&quot; those involving large cash flows, essentially any heavily regulated industry. &quot;If you&apos;re an airline pilot, and you&apos;re using generative AI for the manual, it better be correct, or else maybe the jet crashes,&quot; he said. Founder Prequel CEO Timur Khabirov said that AI is already proving to be &quot;incredibly disruptive&quot; and has made many workers fearful they will become redundant. MUSK LOOKS TO BUILD CHATGPT ALTERNATIVE TO COMBAT &#x2018;WOKE AI&#x2019;: REPORT  &quot;However, if you look back at technological advancements of the past, while the reduction of labor required to accomplish tasks ushers in change, the demand never goes away,&quot; he said. &quot;The move from transportation via horseback to the combustion engine is a good example. People always needed to get from A to B, but one method was simply faster and more efficient.&quot; Greg Kogan, VP of Marketing at Pinecone, a vector database company providing long-term memory for AI, said the impact of AI on the jobs of programmers and software engineers will largely be determined by those in the field. Some companies have already outright banned AI like ChatGPT.&#xA0; &quot;The way software is programmed is already starting to look drastically different. It&apos;s up to each individual programmer if they&apos;re going to adapt to this new AI-assisted way of programming or not. The same has been true for every monumental shift in computing for the past century,&quot; he told Fox News Digital. Speaking specifically on engineers, Kogan said those who learn to collaborate with AI to design and build software will survive in the industry and thrive in the coming years. Though Kogan does not think &quot;any job is safe&quot; from AI, he does not mean every job will be eliminated, merely affected by the evolving technology. POPE FRANCIS DECLARES A.I.

However, he noted that &quot;hallucinations,&quot; or falsehoods presented as fact by ChatGPT and other generative AI, indicate these tools are not mature enough to stand independently and create &quot;production-ready assets&quot; without human correction. Elaborating on his 2019 Ted Talk, Siraman said AI will change job descriptions more than eliminate jobs outright. &quot;Engineers won&apos;t write as much code. Instead, they will manage, debug, and deploy AI-written code, Siraman said. &quot;Doctors won&apos;t come up with diagnoses themselves. Instead, they will use AI to correlate symptoms to diagnosis and lawyers won&apos;t write legal docs from scratch. Instead, they will guide and revise AI-written contracts.&quot; EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: WHAT IS IT USED FOR?  Yaniv Makover, the CEO and co-founder of generative AI copywriting platform Anyword, said the technology would change the way we work by eliminating or collapsing certain job functions. &quot;Mathematicians don&apos;t fear calculators - and gen-AI is analogous in this case. Initially, when the calculator was first invented, yes it might have replaced some people who solely did complex calculations, and suddenly it was solved by a calculator,&quot; Makover said. &quot;But quickly, mathematicians universally recognized it as a useful tool. Mathematicians today are defining the equations, not solving them.&quot; Speaking on writing-centric jobs like journalism and marketing, Makover said these workers still need to define the message and guide their writing themes. To that point, generative AI is a tool that will make it easier to convey that purpose, but according to Makover, there is still a lot of room for creativity. &quot;The jobs in the most danger are those that include repetitive information tasks, like customer support, copywriting, processing and organizing data, simple graphic design,&quot; Makover said. &quot;Though, in all cases, someone will need to curate and guide whatever the AI spits out.
