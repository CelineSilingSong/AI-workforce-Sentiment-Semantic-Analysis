Generative artificial intelligence has rapidly gained traction amongst businesses, professionals and consumers. But what is generative AI, how does it work and what is all the buzz about? Read on to find out.
What is generative AI in simple terms?
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that broadly describes machine learning systems capable of generating text, images, code or other types of content, often in response to a prompt entered by a user.
Generative AI models are increasingly being incorporated into online tools and chatbots that allow users to type questions or instructions into an input field, upon which the AI model will generate a human-like response.

How does generative AI work?
Generative AI uses a computing process known as deep learning to analyze patterns in large sets of data and then replicates this to create new data that appears human-generated. It does this by employing neural networks, a type of machine learning process that is loosely inspired by the way the human brain processes, interprets and learns from information over time.
To give an example, if you were to feed lots of fiction writing into a generative AI model, it would eventually gain the ability to craft stories or story elements based on the literature it’s been trained on. This is because the machine learning algorithms that power generative AI models learn from the information they’re fed — in the case of fiction, this would include elements like plot structure, characters, themes and other narrative devices.
Generative AI models get more sophisticated over time — the more data a model is trained on and generates, the more convincing and human-like its outputs become.
Examples of generative AI
The popularity of generative AI has exploded in recent years, largely thanks to the arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E models, which put accessible AI tools into the hands of consumers.
Since then, big tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have launched their own generative AI tools to capitalize on the technology’s rapid uptake. Google integrates generative AI into Search with AI Overviews. Microsoft plans to build generative AI even more deeply into its PCs with Recall, although the feature has been delayed following security concerns. Apple will debut Apple Intelligence, a mix of proprietary AI models and OpenAI technology, in iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia later this year.
Various generative AI tools now exist, although text and image generation models are arguably the most well-known. Generative AI models typically rely on a user feeding a prompt into the engine that guides it towards producing some sort of desired output, be it text, an image, a video or a piece of music, though this isn’t always the case.
Examples of generative AI models include:
ChatGPT: An AI language model developed by OpenAI that can answer questions and generate human-like responses from text prompts.

Types of generative AI models
Various types of generative AI models exist, each designed for specific tasks and purposes. These can broadly be categorized into the following types.
Transformer-based models
Transformer-based models are trained on large sets of data to understand the relationships between sequential information like words and sentences. Underpinned by deep learning, transformer-based models tend to be adept at natural language processing and understanding the structure and context of language, making them well suited for text-generation tasks. ChatGPT-3 and Google Gemini are examples of transformer-based generative AI models.
Generative adversarial networks
Generative adversarial networks are made up of two neural networks known as a generator and a discriminator, which essentially work against each other to create authentic-looking data. As the name implies, the generator’s role is to generate convincing output, such as an image based on a prompt, while the discriminator works to evaluate the authenticity of said image. Over time, each component gets better at their respective roles, resulting in more convincing outputs. DALL-E and Midjourney are examples of GAN-based generative AI models.
Variational autoencoders
Variational autoencoders leverage two networks to interpret and generate data — in this case, an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the input data and compresses it into a simplified format. The decoder then takes this compressed information and reconstructs it into something new that resembles the original data but isn’t entirely the same.
One example might be teaching a computer program to generate human faces using photos as training data. Over time, the program learns how to simplify the photos of people’s faces into a few important characteristics — such as the size and shape of the eyes, nose, mouth, ears and so on — and then use these to create new faces.
This type of VAE might be used to, say, increase the diversity and accuracy of facial recognition systems. By using VAEs to generate new faces, facial recognition systems can be trained to recognize more diverse facial features, including those that are less common.
Multimodal models
Multimodal models can understand and process multiple types of data simultaneously, such as text, images and audio, allowing them to create more sophisticated outputs. An example might be an AI model capable of generating an image based on a text prompt, as well as a text description of an image prompt. DALL-E 3 and OpenAI’s GPT-4 are examples of multimodal models.
What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. It’s a large language model that uses transformer architecture — specifically, the generative pretrained transformer, hence GPT — to understand and generate human-like text.
You can learn everything you need to know about ChatGPT in this TechRepublic cheat sheet.
What is Google Gemini?
Google Gemini (previously Bard) is another example of an LLM based on transformer architecture. Similar to ChatGPT, Gemini is a generative AI chatbot that generates responses to user prompts.
Google launched Bard in the U.S. in March 2023 in response to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot AI tool. It was launched in Europe and Brazil later that year.

Benefits of generative AI
For businesses, efficiency is arguably the most compelling benefit of generative AI because it can help automate specific tasks and focus employees’ time, energy and resources on more important strategic objectives. This can result in lower labor costs, greater operational efficiency and insights into how well certain business processes are — or are not — performing.
For professionals and content creators, generative AI tools can help with idea creation, content planning and scheduling, search engine optimization, marketing, audience engagement, research and editing, and potentially more. Again, the key proposed advantage is efficiency, because generative AI tools can help users reduce the time they spend on certain tasks and invest their energy elsewhere. That said, manual oversight and scrutiny of generative AI models remains highly important; we explain why later in this article.
Use cases of generative AI
McKinsey estimates that, by 2030, activities that currently account for around 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated, prompted by the acceleration of generative AI.

Generative AI has found a foothold in a number of industry sectors and is now popular in both commercial and consumer markets. The use of generative AI varies from industry to industry and is more established in some than in others. Current and proposed use cases include the following:

Healthcare: Generative AI is being explored as a tool for accelerating drug discovery, while tools such as AWS HealthScribe allow clinicians to transcribe patient consultations and upload important information into their electronic health record.
Digital marketing: Advertisers, salespeople and commerce teams can use generative AI to craft personalized campaigns and adapt content to consumers’ preferences, especially when combined with customer relationship management data.
Education: Some educational tools are beginning to incorporate generative AI to develop customized learning materials that cater to students’ individual learning styles.
Finance: Generative AI is one of the many tools within complex financial systems to analyze market patterns and anticipate stock market trends, and it’s used alongside other forecasting methods to assist financial analysts.
Environment: In environmental science, researchers use generative AI models to predict weather patterns and simulate the effects of climate change.

In terms of role-specific use cases of generative AI, some examples include:

In customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can help businesses reduce response times and quickly deal with common customer queries, reducing the burden on staff.
In software development, generative AI tools can help developers code more cleanly and efficiently by reviewing code, highlighting bugs and suggesting potential fixes before they become bigger issues.
Writers can use generative AI tools to plan, draft and review essays, articles and other written work — though often with mixed results.

Dangers and limitations of generative AI
A major concern around the use of generative AI tools — and particularly those accessible to the public — is their potential for spreading misinformation and harmful content. The impact of doing so can be wide-ranging and severe, from perpetuating stereotypes, hate speech and harmful ideologies to damaging personal and professional reputation.
SEE: Gartner analyst’s take on 5 ways generative AI will impact culture & society
The risk of legal and financial repercussions from the misuse of generative AI is also very real; indeed, it has been suggested that generative AI could put national security at risk if used improperly or irresponsibly.
These risks haven’t escaped policymakers. On Feb. 13, 2024, the European Council approved the AI Act, a first-of-kind piece of legislation designed to regulate the use of AI in Europe. The legislation takes a risk-based approach to regulating AI, with some AI systems banned outright.
Security agencies have made moves to ensure AI systems are built with safety and security in mind. In November 2023, 16 agencies including the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released the Guidelines for Secure AI System Development, which promote security as a fundamental aspect of AI development and deployment.
Generative AI has prompted workforce concerns, most notably that the automation of tasks could lead to job losses. Research from McKinsey suggests that, by 2030, around 12 million people may need to switch jobs, with office support, customer service and food service roles most at risk. The consulting firm predicts that clerks will see a decrease of 1.6 million jobs, “in addition to losses of 830,000 for retail salespersons, 710,000 for administrative assistants and 630,000 for cashiers.”

What is the difference between generative AI and general AI?
Generative AI and general AI represent different sides of the same coin; both relate to the field of artificial intelligence, but the former is a subtype of the latter.
Generative AI uses various machine learning techniques, such as GANs, VAEs or LLMs, to generate new content from patterns learned from training data.
General AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, broadly refers to the concept of computer systems and robotics that possess human-like intelligence and autonomy. This is still the stuff of science fiction — think Disney Pixar’s WALL-E, Sonny from 2004’s I, Robot or HAL 9000, the malevolent AI from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Most current AI systems are examples of “narrow AI,” in that they’re designed for very specific tasks.
To learn more about what artificial intelligence is and isn’t, read our comprehensive AI cheat sheet.
What is the difference between generative AI and machine learning?
Generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence; broadly, AI refers to the concept of computers capable of performing tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence, such as decision making and NLP. Generative AI models use machine learning techniques to process and generate data.
Machine learning is the foundational component of AI and refers to the application of computer algorithms to data for the purposes of teaching a computer to perform a specific task. Machine learning is the process that enables AI systems to make informed decisions or predictions based on the patterns they have learned.

What is the difference between generative AI and discriminative AI?
Whereas generative AI is used for generating new content by learning from existing data, discriminative AI specializes in classifying or categorizing data into predefined groups or classes.
Discriminative AI works by learning how to tell different types of data apart. It’s used for tasks where data needs to be sorted into groups; for example, figuring out if an email is spam, recognizing what’s in a picture or diagnosing diseases from medical images. It looks at data it already knows to classify new data correctly.
So, while generative AI is designed to create original content or data, discriminative AI is used for analyzing and sorting it, making each useful for different applications.
What is the difference between generative AI and regenerative AI?
Regenerative AI, while less commonly discussed, refers to AI systems that can fix themselves or improve over time without human help. The concept of regenerative AI is centered around building AI systems that can last longer and work more efficiently, potentially even helping the environment by making smarter decisions that result in less waste.
In this way, generative AI and regenerative AI serve different roles: Generative AI for creativity and originality, and regenerative AI for durability and sustainability within AI systems.
How big a role will generative AI play in the future of business?
It certainly looks as though generative AI will play a huge role in the future. As more businesses embrace digitization and automation, generative AI looks set to play a central role in industries of all types, with many organizations already establishing guidelines for the acceptable use of AI in the workplace. The capabilities of gen AI have already proven valuable in areas such as content creation, software development, medicine, productivity, business transformation and much more. As the technology continues to evolve, gen AI’s applications and use cases will only continue to grow.
SEE: Deloitte’s 2024 Tech Predictions: Gen AI Will Continue to Shape Chips Market
That said, the impact of generative AI on businesses, individuals and society as a whole is contingent on properly addressing and mitigating its risks. Key to this is ensuring AI is used ethically by reducing biases, enhancing transparency and accountability and upholding proper data governance.
None of this will be straightforward. Keeping laws up to date with fast-moving tech is tough but necessary, and finding the right mix of automation and human involvement will be key to democratizing the benefits of generative AI. Recent legislation, such as President Biden’s Executive Order on AI, Europe’s AI Act and the U.K.’s Artificial Intelligence Bill suggests that governments around the world understand the importance of getting on top of these issues quickly.

This is according to the AI and the Future of Work in Africa whitepaper produced by Microsoft (www.Microsoft.com) and a collective of industry experts from across the continent.Nearly one billion people in Africa are currently under the age of 35 with the continent projected to be home to almost half of the world’s youth population by the turn of the century, in effect making up half of the potential global workforce of the future. Currently, up to 12 million young Africans enter the labour market annually, but according to a report from the International Labour Organisation, more than 20% are neither in employment, education nor training.“We see a significant role for generative AI to not only transform work environments, but also foster opportunities for the youth to create jobs, innovate and help drive economic growth and stability across the continent,” says Ravi Bhat, Chief Technology and Solutions Officer at Microsoft Africa.According to the whitepaper, many expect generative AI to drastically change knowledge worker jobs, especially in terms of the type of work done, the skills required, and the outputs produced. McKinsey research (http://apo-opa.co/3VBE9Rl) shows that generative AI (GenAI) could enable labour productivity growth of up to 0.6% annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology adoption and the redeployment of worker time into other activities.“Generative AI has significant potential to advance human capabilities,” says Jacki O’Neill, Director at Microsoft Research Africa. “As more people across Africa get access to GenAI tools through their internet-enabled devices and more affordable data, the barriers to access are being reduced and opportunities for skilling can increase.”“But it is not only information workers that stand to benefit from GenAI.”The promise of GenAI to transform industries such as agriculture, healthcare, and services must be balanced by equipping the youth with the skills needed for an AI-disrupted labour market to ensure that they are not left behind in this technological shift.It is therefore important to build skills across the spectrum, from how to deploy and use GenAI tools effectively at work, to how to build appropriate and innovative applications and technologies on top of these models, to the post-graduate skills of research and innovation in machine learning, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, cybersecurity, and systems to name a few.“Investing in this range of skills gives Africans the best opportunity to create dignified, appropriate jobs, to adapt AI sensitively to indigenous knowledge, to create new value chains, and better AI systems which might reflect for example human-centred and community values. Such systems would add value globally and could counter typical tech-centric models of automation and deskilling,” adds O’Neill.

With culturally and linguistically sensitive design, GenAI can become more tailored to individual workers, learning from interactions and becoming a personalised tool that respects privacy and enhances each worker’s unique skills. It can serve as a guide to foster inclusivity and showcase the diverse skills and abilities of African workers. GenAI can also be appropriated as a community-focused tool that supports collaborative work and communal development.The technology can assist in decision-making, risk assessment, and data analysis, empowering entrepreneurs in their ventures. For the informal sector, tailored GenAI tools will elevate the capabilities of entrepreneurs, providing customised assistance for their unique needs.According to the whitepaper, ensuring a beneficial outcome with GenAI involves proactive governance, inclusive design, investment in education, and a commitment to regulatory and ethical standards. This is a collective responsibility, requiring engagement from policymakers, technologists, and citizens alike.“Technology alone cannot solve the challenges that our youthful continent faces. We need to create policies and practices to ensure that GenAI, and AI in general, is deployed responsibly with AI-related labour being valued and dignified. It requires the macro-economic, labour, and regulatory markets to adapt and be capable of supporting positive change,” adds Bhat.The AI revolution in Africa is no longer just a possibility; it is already underway, and Microsoft is committed to working alongside individuals, governments, partners and stakeholders across the continent to prepare for a future where AI is intricately woven into the fabric of work and society in Africa.To learn more, visit AI and the future of work in Africa (http://apo-opa.co/4cBTfxd) to download the whitepaper.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Microsoft.About Microsoft:  Microsoft (Nasdaq “MSFT” http://apo-opa.co/3XDeKJM) creates platforms and tools powered by AI to deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.

With two-thirds of jobs exposed to some degree of automation and GenAI expected to deliver $4.4 trillion in productivity gains, leaders must adopt innovative talent development strategies to stay competitive. Despite an increase in overall enrolments, Coursera data from the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2024 shows widening gender disparities in artificial intelligence (AI) and digital skills. To harness the full potential of emerging technologies and mitigate opportunity gaps, we must prioritize AI literacy, address the persistent digital skills gap, and train workforces for the jobs of the future.AI literacy emerges as a global imperativeChatGPT’s launch ignited a global race towards AI literacy. According to Microsoft, 66% of leaders wouldn't hire someone without AI skills, yet, according to Accenture, only 5% of companies have rolled out reskilling at scale.The demand is clear: According to Accenture, 94% of employees want to learn AI skills and individuals are taking the initiative. Meanwhile, Coursera’s Global Skills Report 2024 notes a 1,061% surge in GenAI enrolments on the platform over the past year. Regions like Asia-Pacific (1,270% YoY), Sub-Saharan Africa (1,500% YoY), and Latin America (882% YoY) are also witnessing significant growth, highlighting the global appetite for AI literacy. Have you read?Global Gender Gap Report 2024 Image: World Economic ForumPopular courses from the world’s top AI research institutions and companies, including Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT (Vanderbilt) and Introduction to Generative AI (Google Cloud) are driving this demand. In the first five months of 2024, the platform witnessed more than 900,000 GenAI enrolments as individuals and enterprise learners sought AI skills to boost productivity and remain competitive in a fast-changing workplace. However, women account for only 30% of these enrolments and support from institutions is needed to ensure equitable outcomes for all. Businesses and academic institutions must enable executive education and foundational AI literacy for all employees. Governments also play a crucial role in facilitating mass AI training and adoption. Investments in AI infrastructure, research, and workforce development are essential. For instance, India's $1.2 billion investment in AI projects, Malaysia's National AI Studies Centre and Thailand's AI infrastructure development programme are exemplary efforts. Closing the digital skills gapMore than 9 in 10 jobs now require at least some level of digital proficiency. If digital skills gaps are not addressed, G20 countries could lose as much as $11.5 trillion of cumulative GDP growth by 2028. In 2023, 40% of EU adults lacked basic digital skills.At the World Bank’s 2024 Spring Meetings, ministers from Morocco, Cape Verde, Kenya, and Armenia stressed the importance of electricity and internet access as a precursor to universal digital skills training.Digital connectivity and online learning are powerful tools for promoting equal access in the digital economy. A 2022 International Finance Corporation, European Commission, and Coursera study found that 45% of women and 60% of women caregivers would have had to postpone or stop their studies without online learning. Online education drives broader economic growth, creating one job for every 30 people trained on Coursera in countries like Egypt, India, Mexico and Nigeria.Preparing for future jobs with industry micro-credentials The World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2023 estimates that 60% of workers will require retraining by 2027. Industry micro-credentials have emerged as a vital tool to address growing labour shortages, bridge curriculum gaps, and retrain impacted workers.Companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft, and AWS, have created more than 45 professional certificates to prepare learners without a university degree or prior work experience for in-demand digital jobs. There was a 61% year-over-year growth in professional certificate enrolments in North America and a 41% growth in the Middle East and North Africa, with learners gravitating toward careers in data analytics, cybersecurity, and project management. In Guyana, President Mohamed Irfaan Ali launched a national workforce development program providing free access to Coursera for every Guyanese citizen and public sector employee. Citizens are encouraged to train for digital jobs in fast-growing local industries through credentials like IT Support Specialist from Google, Customer Service Representative from CVS, or Bookkeeper from Intuit.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesSimilarly, in the US, the University of Texas System expanded its Texas Credentials of the Future Initiative, offering no-cost career training to 240,000 students across nine campuses. ACE and ECTS credit recommendations help students and academic institutions get and give academic credit for industry micro-credentials, and AI translations enable learners to take more than 4,700 courses and 50 certificate programmes in 21 local languages. If some sections of the labour force adopt emerging technologies faster due to greater access, while others fall behind, the opportunity gap will widen. Coordinated effort between public and private institutions is essential to ensure equitable outcomes for all in our rapidly changing world.Don't miss any update on this topicSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Share:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Job security is redefined by layoffs and generative AI


A global study reveals that in the age of GenAI, workers are redefining job security to emphasize upskilling, adaptable skills and opportunities for growth.

Patrick Thibodeau,
Editor at Large



Published: 21 Jun 2024


 
As generative AI reshapes the workplace, a new global study revealed workers' hopes and concerns about their future careers.
Surveying more than 150,000 workers worldwide, the study found that employees are seeking a new kind of job security, rooted in reskilling and career flexibility -- a shift driven in part by GenAI.







This key finding was detailed in the report ""How Work Preferences Are Shifting in the Age of GenAI"" by Boston Consulting Group (BCG); a global alliance of recruitment websites called The Network; and The Stepstone Group, a job platform.
Employees want job security that ensures they can adapt and thrive as skills evolve, regardless of generative AI's impact on their jobs, said Orsolya Kovács-Ondrejkovic, associate director of people strategy at BCG and co-author of the report. She discussed some of the report's main findings with TechTarget Editorial. 
Editor's note: This interview has been edited for clarity and length.
Your study found that over 60% of job seekers believe they have the upper hand in labor market negotiations. What's the basis for this belief?



We are still more likely to run out of talent than to run out of jobs.


Orsolya Kovács-OndrejkovicAssociate director of people strategy, Boston Consulting Group




Orsolya Kovács-Ondrejkovic: Despite some recessions and layoffs, particularly in tech, the overall trend shows a persistent talent shortage in most Western economies. Aging populations and a mismatch between available and needed skills contribute to this confidence. If you have specialized skills, you feel confident. We are still more likely to run out of talent than to run out of jobs.
How significant is the aging baby boomer population in workforce trends?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: In countries with decreasing or stagnating populations, which are most of the best [advanced industrialized nations], our clients are painfully aware that they will run out of talent quite soon.
Your research found that work-life balance is a top priority for workers. Why is that?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: People increasingly work to live and not live to work. The importance of a job, as part of one's personal identity and whole life, is going down compared to previous generations. There is a strong desire for rapid advancement into leadership roles in emerging markets, yet work-life balance remains the top priority.
Job security is also a top priority for workers in your survey. How do you reconcile that with recent tech industry layoffs?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: It is not so much that they are worried about losing their current job. It's more they want to be employable in the long term. Employees seek employers who provide opportunities to develop new skills. If a role becomes automated, they prefer employers who offer opportunities to learn new skills rather than simply letting employees go.
Your study found that about 40% of workers use generative AI tools, but the rate was higher in emerging economies. Can you explain the high use of generative AI tools in emerging economies?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: This trend is surprising and may be due to less regulation and a more open mindset in these regions. In Germany, for instance, it's much more regulated. One theory relates to how certain economies leapfrog certain technological development steps.
In the emerging world, not many people use desktop computers; they go straight to mobile. Generative AI's accessibility and availability on mobile may be similar.
Only 5% of workers in the study fear job replacement by AI in the next five years. Some other studies suggest the number is much higher. Can you explain this?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: Our survey asked workers what they expect in a five-year timeline, which might be why the number is lower than other studies that look further ahead. Another BCG study about generative AI's impact over 10 years found that 20% were fearful. Additionally, our sample included a wide range of job types, and many studies that show higher fear percentages often focus on high-skill office jobs.
What was the most surprising finding for you in this report?
Kovács-Ondrejkovic: The heightened importance of job security was surprising, especially given that we conducted a similar survey during the height of the COVID crisis. How can job security be more important now than it was back then? The only answer we could come up with was GenAI, which people now have internalized that their jobs may fundamentally change.

Assessing the impact of large language models on the labour market

Though large language models (LLMs) and associated technologies are poised to disrupt jobs, little has been done to evaluate this risk or develop a policy to address it.
Now, a new study has developed a rubric to assess the effects of large language models on labour markets.
The study, ‘GPTs are GPTs: Labor market impact potential of LLMs,’ is published in Science.
Can large language models improve our experiences at work?
Despite a growing literature that aims to understand the labour market impacts of LLMs, there is still no clear understanding of how exposure to AI systems will translate to real-world impacts on labour demand, wages, inequality, job quality, and other key outcomes.
To assess this, the researchers used the O*NET 27.2 database – which covers dozens of occupations and their detailed workflows – and focused on 923 occupations.
They used humans and trained GPT-4 to evaluate if LLMs could reduce the time required for a human to complete a task by at least 50% while preserving or improving quality.
The authors estimate that about 80% of workers are in occupations with at least 10% of job tasks exposed to large language models influence in this way, with 18.5% of workers in occupations with 50% of their tasks exposed.
An additional exploratory analysis revealed 1.86% of tasks could be fully automated with no human oversight.
The science and research industry is fully embracing AI
Overall, the researchers found that generally, higher wage occupations were more exposed to the effects of LLMs than lower wage occupations.
In fact, the two job groups most exposed to LLMs are ‘Scientists and Researchers’ and ‘Technologists’.
However, tasks currently considered out of reach of large language models might become more viable with future innovations, and conversely, tasks that seem more likely to be handled by LLMs might encounter unexpected barriers.
This work highlights the importance of developing policies to ease transitions in LLM adoption and direct their development in a more socially beneficial direction, ensuring that economic gains are large and broadly distributed.

Reports thus far have pointed to a partnership with OpenAI that will, among other things, help supercharge Siri.A fresh round of rumors reported by Bloomberg shed more light on the news expected to be unveiled at Monday’s 10 a.m. PT keynote. First there’s the name: Apple Intelligence. The company was clearly invested in maintaining the AI initials for its own whack at the large language model (LLM) piñata.The name appears to apply to a broader push into the category that could include that OpenAI partnership and a resulting chatbot. Apple Intelligence will arrive as an opt-in beta, similar to developer-focused operating system updates the company releases after WWDC. The system should ship on upcoming versions of the iPhone, iPad and Macs.According to the report, a limited number of older devices will also be able to run the system, including iPads and Macs running an M1 chip or higher and the iPhone 15 Pro.

The rise of Artificial Intelligence poses a significant threat to jobs focused on data entry and administrative tasks. AI excels in processing and organizing vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, making these roles highly susceptible to automation. Systems powered by AI can input, organize, and manage data more efficiently than humans, reducing errors and allowing employees to focus on more complex activities.Manufacturing and Assembly Lines:
In the manufacturing sector, Artificial Intelligence and robots have become essential, particularly in repetitive physical tasks. Robots equipped with AI can perform tasks such as product assembly, welding, packaging, with greater precision and efficiency than humans. These systems are particularly useful in high-volume production settings, enabling continuous operation, reducing costs, and increasing productivity.Retail Sales:
Artificial Intelligence has made significant strides in retail sales, with increasing implementation of automated checkout processes and self-service kiosks in supermarkets and retail stores. AI-powered systems can handle transactions independently, manage inventory, provide personalized shopping experiences, and facilitate automated payment processes, diminishing the need for human cashiers.Core Analytical Roles:
Basic analytical functions, such as financial analysis or report generation, are also shifting towards automation. AI systems can process large data sets, identify trends, and create reports faster and more accurately than humans. This automation is particularly beneficial for tasks involving routine data analysis, paving the way for more sophisticated analytical roles that require human creativity and problem-solving skills.Graphic Design for Beginners:
Artificial Intelligence tools are now capable of producing basic design elements and automating simple graphic design tasks that previously required human designers. These tools can create logos, social media posts, and even website layouts efficiently and cost-effectively, posing a threat to entry-level graphic design jobs.Translation Services:
The field of translation has been significantly impacted by AI, with increasingly advanced automated translation services. While accurate language understanding and cultural context still require human expertise, beginner translation roles involving direct text translation are particularly vulnerable to automation.Routine Photography:
AI has also revolutionized corporate photography by automating basic photography tasks such as capturing web shots or company events. AI-powered systems can adjust lighting, framing, and even editing to produce high-quality images with minimal human intervention. While complex and creative photography still demands human talent, routine corporate photography tasks are increasingly handled by AI.Adaptation and Creativity:
As Artificial Intelligence continues to evolve, it is crucial for workforce preparation to focus on areas where human creative and problem-solving abilities are irreplaceable. By embracing change and developing skills that complement intelligent systems rather than compete with them, humans can ensure harmonious coexistence with AI, enhancing human potential rather than replacing it.New Horizons in Artificial Intelligence Impact on Future Job MarketAs Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to shape the landscape of the job market, new challenges and opportunities are emerging that demand closer examination. While the previous article touched on various aspects of how AI is affecting different job sectors, there are additional facets to consider in understanding its impact on future employment trends.Key Questions:
1. How will the rise of AI impact job creation in emerging industries?
2. What are the ethical implications of AI replacing human workers in certain roles?
3. How can workers adapt and upskill to remain competitive in an AI-driven economy?
4. What regulatory measures are needed to ensure a balanced transition in the job market?Advantages:
One of the key advantages of AI in the job market is increased efficiency and productivity. Automation powered by AI can streamline processes, reduce errors, and free up human resources for more strategic and creative tasks. Additionally, AI technologies can help businesses make data-driven decisions faster and more accurately, leading to improved outcomes and innovation.Disadvantages:
On the flip side, the automation of jobs through AI can lead to displacement of workers in certain industries, raising concerns about job security and income inequality. The rapid advancement of AI also poses challenges in terms of maintaining privacy and data security, as well as potential biases embedded in AI algorithms that may perpetuate social inequalities.Challenges:
One of the key challenges associated with the increasing integration of AI in the job market is the need for continuous learning and upskilling. Workers will need to adapt to new technologies and develop skills that complement AI capabilities to remain competitive.

Nothing better captures the influence of technology on the general public than the Collins Dictionary selecting &quot;AI&quot; as the word of the year for 2023. As a result, people might believe that in a future where artificial intelligence is unfailing, AI-based technology, at large, can do everything. It can quickly diagnose ailments; our groceries could be purchased by robots and delivered by self-driving cars; AI could even run trains and airplanes; and it could even prepare all our meals, without any human aid. However, this is far from true. Despite the advancements in technology, the majority of jobs will still need to be performed by humans. So instead of trying to replace people, generative AI will be most useful when it comes to enhancing human creativity. In fact, the World Economic Forum predicts that AI will be a net job creator between now and 2027. So let’s try to debunk some myths about AI and human jobs. Spoiler alert: Your jobs are safe, and if anything, they are better enhanced because of AI. No AI, No Job? With the advent of AI, over half of the skills that people use on a daily basis at work will need to be revised. Hence, the employees who are skilled in AI might pose a threat to those who are not.&nbsp; AI and Big Data jointly ranks 15th as a general core skill today, and it is the third most important skill that businesses are looking for at present. A striking 66% of leaders admit they wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills. Furthermore, 71% of these leaders would prefer to hire a less experienced candidate who has AI skills over a more experienced candidate without them. For instance, emerging job roles such as prompt engineers, AI trainers, AI auditors, data detectives, and AI ethicists require specialized skills and knowledge, underscoring the importance of rapid reskilling and upskilling within the workforce.&nbsp; Many employees are capable of and willing to be self-motivated. As a result of which there has been a 160% spike in the use of learning courses designed to build AI aptitude. However, in certain instances, companies will have to pay for this upskilling and reskilling. Hence, businesses are increasingly investing in training programs to upgrade their workforce skills and address talent gaps in their organizations. Also read: Deeptech surge in 2023: India sees 480 new startups but faces funding struggles In India, specifically, the technology companies are involved in this transformation. Over 94% of Indian firms invest in upskilling their employees because of the progress made by artificial intelligence technologies. For instance, tech giants have created AI research centers across the country where they run wide-ranging AI skilling programs through workshops and certifications.&nbsp; The future is brighter than we think&nbsp; There are people who still believe that cellphones can harm human health, regardless of the fact that this thought comes from limited and non-reputable sources. It is easier to look at new inventions and raise questions about its ill effects. Embracing innovation, on the other hand, has the potential to change things for better. Of course, every job will be impacted by AI. However, most of that will be augmenting the skills of the workforce rather than replacing them. Humans created AI, which shows that there is little to no match for our skills and aptitude. In other words, humans will always triumph over AI and other technological systems in all aspects. Hence, rather than fearing AI or other technologies that crop up in the future, we can benefit from viewing them as an added tool that can ease the day-to-day tasks, and enhance our quality of work. In short, AI should be viewed as a complement to human capabilities rather than a replacement. (The author is MD and global CTO of Visionet.

Roblox, the popular online gaming platform, has announced its progress in developing AI tools, specifically in the area of 4D generative AI. The fourth dimension of generative AI is interaction, which means that Roblox is working on creating AI creations that can dynamically interact with the virtual world they inhabit. This advancement would allow game developers to set the stage for unscripted interactions within their games.
According to Morgan McGuire, Roblox’s chief scientist, the power of the platform lies in its focus on interaction between people, objects, and environments. Unlike traditional online games, Roblox’s runtime engine is designed to facilitate complex and spontaneous interactions, inspired by the concept of a metaverse. The goal is to create a world where elements can interact in many-to-many ways, rather than being limited by predetermined actions.

To achieve 4D generative AI, Roblox is addressing several challenges. These include functionality, control, and interactivity. The generated objects need to behave as expected by developers while interacting with the virtual world in a logical manner. McGuire states that the company is training its AI generator using a multimodal approach and incorporating purpose-built optimizers to improve control over the generation process.
Founder David Baszucki provided an example of how a 4D genAI-created object would work. A race car, for instance, would have an engine, moveable parts, and a physics rig that enables it to drive down a track. All of these components would be generated based on a simple text or voice prompt.

Overall, Roblox’s advancements in 4D generative AI have the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry. By allowing for more interactive and dynamic experiences, game developers can create virtual worlds that are more immersive and engaging for players. This development aligns with Roblox’s vision of building a metaverse where users can connect and interact in unprecedented ways. With its focus on interaction and innovation, Roblox continues to be at the forefront of the gaming industry.

Large language models are the dynamite behind the generative AI boom of 2023. However, they've been around for a while.
LLMs are black box AI systems that use deep learning on extremely large datasets to understand and generate new text. Modern LLMs began taking shape in 2014 when the attention mechanism -- a machine learning technique designed to mimic human cognitive attention -- was introduced in a research paper titled ""Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate."" In 2017, that attention mechanism was honed with the introduction of the transformer model in another paper, ""Attention Is All You Need.""







Some of the most well-known language models today are based on the transformer model, including the generative pre-trained transformer series of LLMs and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT).
ChatGPT, which runs on a set of language models from OpenAI, attracted more than 100 million users just two months after its release in 2022. Since then, many competing models have been released. Some belong to big companies such as Google and Microsoft; others are open source.
Constant developments in the field can be difficult to keep track of. Here are some of the most influential models, both past and present. Included in it are models that paved the way for today's leaders as well as those that could have a significant effect in the future.

19 of the best large language models in 2024





Top current LLMs
Below are some of the most relevant large language models today. They do natural language processing and influence the architecture of future models.
BERT
BERT is a family of LLMs that Google introduced in 2018. BERT is a transformer-based model that can convert sequences of data to other sequences of data. BERT's architecture is a stack of transformer encoders and features 342 million parameters. BERT was pre-trained on a large corpus of data then fine-tuned to perform specific tasks along with natural language inference and sentence text similarity. It was used to improve query understanding in the 2019 iteration of Google search.
Claude
The Claude LLM focuses on constitutional AI, which shapes AI outputs guided by a set of principles that help the AI assistant it powers helpful, harmless and accurate. Claude was created by the company Anthropic. The latest iteration of the Claude LLM is Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It understands nuance, humor and complex instructions better than earlier versions of the LLM, and operates at twice the speed of Claude 3 Opus. It’s available for free via Claude.ai and the Claude iOS app.
Cohere
Cohere is an enterprise AI platform that provides several LLMs including Command, Rerank and Embed. These LLMs can be custom-trained and fine-tuned to a specific company’s use case. The company that created the Cohere LLM was founded by one of the authors of Attention Is All You Need. One of Cohere’s strengths is that it is not tied to one single cloud -- unlike OpenAI, which is bound to Microsoft Azure.
Ernie
Ernie is Baidu’s large language model which powers the Ernie 4.0 chatbot. The bot was released in August 2023 and has garnered more than 45 million users. Ernie is rumored to have 10 trillion parameters. The bot works best in Mandarin but is capable in other languages.
Falcon 40B
Falcon 40B is a transformer-based, causal decoder-only model developed by the Technology Innovation Institute. It is open source and was trained on English data. The model is available in two smaller variants as well: Falcon 1B and Falcon 7B (1 billion and 7 billion parameters). Amazon has made Falcon 40B available on Amazon SageMaker. It is also available for free on GitHub.



Gemini
Gemini is Google's family of LLMs that power the company's chatbot of the same name. The model replaced Palm in powering the chatbot, which was rebranded from Bard to Gemini upon the model switch. Gemini models are multimodal, meaning they can handle images, audio and video as well as text. Gemini is also integrated in many Google applications and products. It comes in three sizes -- Ultra, Pro and Nano. Ultra is the largest and most capable model, Pro is the mid-tier model and Nano is the smallest model, designed for efficiency with on-device tasks. Gemini outperforms GPT-4 on most evaluated benchmarks.
Gemma
Gemma is a family of open-source language models from Google that were trained on the same resources as Gemini. Gemma comes in two sizes -- a 2 billion parameter model and a 7 billion parameter model. Gemma models can be run locally on a personal computer, and surpass similarly sized Llama 2 models on several evaluated benchmarks.
GPT-3
GPT-3 is OpenAI's large language model with more than 175 billion parameters, released in 2020. GPT-3 uses a decoder-only transformer architecture. In September 2022, Microsoft announced it had exclusive use of GPT-3's underlying model. GPT-3 is 10 times larger than its predecessor. GPT-3's training data includes Common Crawl, WebText2, Books1, Books2 and Wikipedia.
GPT-3 is the last of the GPT series of models in which OpenAI made the parameter counts publicly available. The GPT series was first introduced in 2018 with OpenAI's paper ""Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.""
GPT-3.5
GPT-3.5 is an upgraded version of GPT-3 with fewer parameters. GPT-3.5 was fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback. GPT-3.5 is the version of GPT that powers ChatGPT. There are several models, with GPT-3.5 turbo being the most capable, according to OpenAI. GPT-3.5's training data extends to September 2021.
It was also integrated into the Bing search engine but has since been replaced with GPT-4.
GPT-4
GPT-4 is the largest model in OpenAI's GPT series, released in 2023. Like the others, it's a transformer-based model. Unlike the others, its parameter count has not been released to the public, though there are rumors that the model has more than 170 trillion. OpenAI describes GPT-4 as a multimodal model, meaning it can process and generate both language and images as opposed to being limited to only language. GPT-4 also introduced a system message, which lets users specify tone of voice and task.
GPT-4 demonstrated human-level performance in multiple academic exams. At the model's release, some speculated that GPT-4 came close to artificial general intelligence (AGI), which means it is as smart or smarter than a human. GPT-4 powers Microsoft Bing search, is available in ChatGPT Plus and will eventually be integrated into Microsoft Office products.
GPT-4o
GPT-4 Omni (GPT-4o) is OpenAI’s successor to GPT-4 and offers several improvements over the previous model. GPT-4o creates a more natural human interaction for ChatGPT and is a large multimodal model, accepting various inputs including audio, image and text. The conversations let users engage as they would in a normal human conversation, and the real-time interactivity can also pick up on emotions. GPT-4o can see photos or screens and ask questions about them during interaction.
GPT-4o can respond in 232 milliseconds, similar to human response time and faster than GPT-4 Turbo. The GPT-4o model is free and will be available for developer and customer products.
Lamda
Lamda (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is a family of LLMs developed by Google Brain announced in 2021. Lamda used a decoder-only transformer language model and was pre-trained on a large corpus of text. In 2022, LaMDA gained widespread attention when then-Google engineer Blake Lemoine went public with claims that the program was sentient. It was built on the Seq2Seq architecture.
Llama
Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama) is Meta's LLM released in 2023. The largest version is 65 billion parameters in size. Llama was originally released to approved researchers and developers but is now open source. Llama comes in smaller sizes that require less computing power to use, test and experiment with.
Llama uses a transformer architecture and was trained on a variety of public data sources, including webpages from CommonCrawl, GitHub, Wikipedia and Project Gutenberg. Llama was effectively leaked and spawned many descendants, including Vicuna and Orca.
Mistral
Mistral is a 7 billion parameter language model that outperforms Llama's language model of a similar size on all evaluated benchmarks. Mistral also has a fine-tuned model that is specialized to follow instructions. Its smaller size enables self-hosting and competent performance for business purposes. It was released under the Apache 2.0 license.
Orca
Orca was developed by Microsoft and has 13 billion parameters, meaning it's small enough to run on a laptop. It aims to improve on advancements made by other open source models by imitating the reasoning procedures achieved by LLMs. Orca achieves the same performance as GPT-4 with significantly fewer parameters and is on par with GPT-3.5 for many tasks. Orca is built on top of the 13 billion parameter version of LLaMA.
Palm
The Pathways Language Model is a 540 billion parameter transformer-based model from Google powering its AI chatbot Bard. It was trained across multiple TPU 4 Pods -- Google's custom hardware for machine learning. Palm specializes in reasoning tasks such as coding, math, classification and question answering. Palm also excels at decomposing complex tasks into simpler subtasks.
PaLM gets its name from a Google research initiative to build Pathways, ultimately creating a single model that serves as a foundation for multiple use cases. There are several fine-tuned versions of Palm, including Med-Palm 2 for life sciences and medical information as well as Sec-Palm for cybersecurity deployments to speed up threat analysis.
Phi-1
Phi-1 is a transformer-based language model from Microsoft. At just 1.3 billion parameters, Phi-1 was trained for four days on a collection of textbook-quality data. Phi-1 is an example of a trend toward smaller models trained on better quality data and synthetic data.
""We'll probably see a lot more creative scaling down work: prioritizing data quality and diversity over quantity, a lot more synthetic data generation, and small but highly capable expert models,"" wrote Andrej Karpathy, former director of AI at Tesla and OpenAI employee, in a tweet.
Phi-1 specializes in Python coding and has fewer general capabilities because of its smaller size.
StableLM
StableLM is a series of open source language models developed by Stability AI, the company behind image generator Stable Diffusion. There are 3 billion and 7 billion parameter models available and 15 billion, 30 billion, 65 billion and 175 billion parameter models in progress at time of writing. StableLM aims to be transparent, accessible and supportive.
Vicuna 33B
Vicuna is another influential open source LLM derived from Llama. It was developed by LMSYS and was fine-tuned using data from sharegpt.com. It is smaller and less capable that GPT-4 according to several benchmarks, but does well for a model of its size. Vicuna has only 33 billion parameters, whereas GPT-4 has trillions.


LLM precursors
Although LLMs are a recent phenomenon, their precursors go back decades. Learn how recent precursor Seq2Seq and distant precursor ELIZA set the stage for modern LLMs.
Seq2Seq
Seq2Seq is a deep learning approach used for machine translation, image captioning and natural language processing. It was developed by Google and underlies some of their modern LLMs, including LaMDA. Seq2Seq also underlies AlexaTM 20B, Amazon's large language model. It uses a mix of encoders and decoders.
Eliza
Eliza was an early natural language processing program created in 1966. It is one of the earliest examples of a language model. Eliza simulated conversation using pattern matching and substitution. Eliza, running a certain script, could parody the interaction between a patient and therapist by applying weights to certain keywords and responding to the user accordingly. The creator of Eliza, Joshua Weizenbaum, wrote a book on the limits of computation and artificial intelligence.

Published: 25 Jun 2024


 
Many people feel it's time AI companies paid for the free data lunches that have made their generative systems big and strong.
Recently, a bevy of legal action demanding compensation from AI companies has been filed in the U.S. and Europe. The plaintiffs include authors, artists and major media organizations who have consistently expressed concern about AI stealing their work and producing mediocre derivatives.







An open letter from the Authors Guild -- signed by more than 8,500 authors, including Margaret Atwood, Dan Brown and Jodi Picoult -- urges tech companies responsible for generative AI applications, such as ChatGPT and Bard, to cease using their works without proper authorization or compensation. The authors want companies to pay for the data they scraped for training -- the ""food"" for AI systems, endless meals for which there has been no bill.
Authors also express concern that generative AI threatens their profession by flooding the market with machine-written content based on their work. This was a problem in recent months as Amazon took action against AI authors spamming the bestseller list with generated works.
Prior to the release of the Authors Guild letter, two North American authors -- Mona Awad and Paul Tremblay -- filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming the organization breached copyright law. The suit argued that OpenAI breached copyright law because ChatGPT generated accurate summaries of the author's works and, therefore, must've trained on the authors' works. They aren't the only ones. Author and comedian Sarah Silverman is also suing OpenAI and Meta for illegally reproducing her memoir, The Bedwetter, without permission. But that argument may not hold up in court because of the way generative AI works.
Individual authors and artists aren’t the only plaintiffs. In December 2023, The New York Times became the first major American news publication to sue OpenAI for using copyrighted works in AI development.

What is generative AI?
Generative AI is the technology that powers ChatGPT and Bard. Text-based generative AI uses algorithms to predict the likely next words in text and generates that text based on a prompt from the user. ChatGPT knows what to generate because it was trained on a large corpus of publicly available data from the internet. It learned patterns from the training and matches those patterns to prompts from the user.
Generative AIs are usually black box AI systems, meaning nobody -- not even the programmers -- understands the exact steps the machine takes to go from input to output. Input goes in, the magic happens and output comes out.
All machine learning and generative AI tools use preexisting works of some kind.


Why are people suing?
People are suing AI companies over copyright. Even though ChatGPT's trained on data from the internet, it does so without permission from the data creators. For example, GPT-3 was trained on Wikipedia and Reddit, among other sources. However, conversations about and segments of copyrighted works could exist in the training material and give large language models enough context to accurately summarize those copyrighted works.
On a larger scale, people are suing because AI is a black box, and it's impossible to know how it works on a granular level. The fear is that people will use AI to avoid taking responsibility for their decisions or the things it produces.
""If AI companies are allowed to market AI systems that are essentially black boxes, they could become the ultimate ends-justify-the-means devices,"" Matthew Butterick, one of the lawyers behind several of the lawsuits, wrote in his blog. ""Before too long, we will not delegate decisions to AI systems because they perform better. Rather, we will delegate decisions to AI systems because they can get away with everything that we can't.""


What AI lawsuits have been filed?
Numerous cases have been brought against generative AI companies regarding copyright and misuse. Here are some of the companies being sued.
GitHub, Microsoft and OpenAI
A class-action suit was filed against these companies involving GitHub's Copilot tool. The tool predictively generates code based on what the programmer has already written. The plaintiffs allege that Copilot copies and republishes code from GitHub without abiding by the requirements of GitHub's open source license, such as failing to provide attribution. The complaint also includes claims related to GitHub's mishandling of personal data and information, as well as claims of fraud. The complaint was filed in November 2022. Microsoft and GitHub have repeatedly tried to get the case dismissed.
Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt
A complaint against these AI image generator providers was filed in January 2023. The plaintiffs alleged the systems directly infringe on plaintiffs' copyrights by training on works created by the plaintiffs and creating unauthorized derivative works. The complaint also takes issue with the fact that the tools can be used to generate work in the style of artists. The judge on the case, William Orrick, said he was inclined to dismiss the lawsuit.
Stability AI
In January 2023, Getty Images issued a complaint against Stability AI for allegedly copying and processing millions of images and associated metadata owned by Getty in the U.K. Getty filed another lawsuit against Stability AI in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware days later, which raised many copyright- and trademark-related claims, and pointed to ""bizarre or grotesque"" generated images that contained the Getty Images watermark and, therefore, damaged Getty's reputation.
OpenAI
Authors Paul Tremblay and Mona Awad are suing OpenAI for allegedly infringing on authors' copyrights. Butterick is one of the attorneys representing the authors. The complaint estimated that more than 300,000 books were copied in OpenAI's training data. The suit seeks an unspecified amount of money. The case was filed in June 2023.
OpenAI and Microsoft
The New York Times is suing OpenAI for copyright infringement. The case, filed December 2023, alleges that millions of New York Times articles were used to train and develop OpenAI’s chatbot and other technology, which now competes with the news organization as a source of reliable information. The case also alleges that OpenAI’s language models mimic the Time’s style and recites its content verbatim. The Times is the first major American news outlet to sue OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The Times approached the companies earlier in the year to discuss the copyright issue but never reached an agreement.
Eight other newspapers filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft on April 30, 2024, alleging they've purloined millions of copyrighted news articles to train their AI. Newspapers included in the suit are The New York Daily News, Chicago Tribune, Denver Post, Mercury News, Orange County Register, St. Paul Pioneer-Press, Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun Sentinel.
Meta and OpenAI
Sarah Silverman's lawsuit against Meta and OpenAI alleged copyright infringement and said ChatGPT and Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama) were trained on illegally acquired data sets with her work contained. The suit alleges the books were acquired from shadow libraries, such as Library Genesis, Z-Library and Bibliotek, where the books can be torrented. Torrenting is a common method of downloading files without proper legal permission. Specifically, Meta's language model, Llama, was trained on a data set called the Pile, which uses data from Bibliotek, according to a paper from EleutherAI, the company that assembled the Pile. The suit was filed in July 2023.
Google
A class-action lawsuit is being brought against Google for alleged misuse of personal information and copyright infringement. Some of the data specified in the lawsuit includes photos from dating websites, Spotify playlists, TikTok videos and books used to train Bard. The lawsuit, filed in July 2023, said Google could owe at least $5 billion. The plaintiffs have elected to remain anonymous.
These copyright cases against big tech companies aren't the first of their kind. In 2015, the Author's Guild sued Google for making digital copies of millions of books and providing snippets of them to the public. The court ultimately favored Google, saying the works were transformative and did not provide a market substitute for the books.
Suno and Udio
Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records filed lawsuits against AI song-generator start-ups Suno and Udio in June 2024 for alleged copyright infringement. One lawsuit describes how Suno-generated songs sound very similar to Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode,” using prompts such as “1950s rock and roll,” “12-bar blues” and “energetic male vocalist.” The Udio lawsuit alleges something similar, saying many outputs sounded like Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” The record labels are seeking up to $150,000 for each work that was copied without permission.


What questions do these cases address?
The above lawsuits will be important in answering the following questions:

Does training a model on copyrighted material require a license? Generative AI systems make copies of the training materials as part of the training process. Does that interim copying require a license, or is it fair use?
Does generative AI output infringe on copyright for the materials on which the model was trained? If generative output constitutes a derivative work or infringes the training data's reproduction right, then it infringes on copyright. Courts will need to rule whether similarities in output and training data are derived from protected materials or unprotected materials. Who is liable for copyright infringement when AI infringes?
Does generative AI violate restrictions on removing, altering or falsifying copyright management information? The Digital Millenium Copyright Act provides restrictions on removal or alteration of copyright management information, such as watermarks. This is exemplified in the Stability AI case, where the watermark reproduced by Stable Diffusion on generated works constituted false copyright management information.
Does generating work in the style of someone violate that person's rights? This is known as the right of publicity, which varies from state to state. It prohibits the use of someone's likeness, name, image, voice or signature for commercial gain.
How do open source licenses apply to training AI models and distributing the resulting output? The plaintiffs in the Copilot case argued that republishing Copilot training materials without attribution -- and not making Copilot itself open source -- violates open source license terms.

As the cases continue to take shape and answers emerge, companies involved with generative AI tools should watch for guidance around the intersection of AI and intellectual property and check to see if they need risk mitigation strategies.

Continuum’s Witness Protection ML effect has got me excited about Artificial Intelligence in my NLE






Kevin P. McAuliffe 

June 24, 2024


Comment





I’ll be honest.  For me, much like the 3D phase for post, Artificial Intelligence has really been a big bust.  I can’t think of any Artificial Intelligence workflows that have enhanced my workflows, or made them better.  I’ve seen the videos from Adobe for what’s coming to Premiere and, to be honest, Adobe’s let me down with all the enhancements that were added that would “revolutionize” my workflows in the past.  Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m sure that there are certain bits and pieces of Artificial Intelligence workflows that help people out, but there really isn’t anything that I can say I use on a regular basis in my workflows.  Until now.  A couple of months ago, I had a “THAT’S IT” moment, where I can easily see myself not only using an AI tool in a whole bunch of different projects, but also where I can easily see this “machine learning” artificial intelligence workflow going in the future.  Good job Boris FX, good job!
INTELLIGENT….IT CERTAINLY IS
Now, I’ll start this article out by saying that I’m not getting a dime from Boris FX for this article.  I’ve been a Continuum since before it was offered free to all Media Composer editors who upgraded to Symphony (I know Media Composer editors all remember that), and have used it in After Effects for as long as I can remember.  Most of my “WOW” benchmarks for advancing my workflows haven’t come from the NLE or Compositing applications.  It’s been from Continuum.   
I mean, let’s be honest, Boris FX have pulled out some pretty surprising acquisitions over the last few years.  GenArts, Imagineer Systems, WonderTouch, Syntheyes, and even the licensing of Primatte technology has really made Boris FX the one stop shop for just about anything an editor or compositor could need.  For me, the biggest leap forward in, easily, the last 15 years has been the integration of Mocha technology not only across almost all of the effects inside of both Continuum and Sapphire, but its licensing in After Effects, which easily makes it the standard for tracking in AE today.  So, you’re probably thinking, what does this have to do with AE and machine learning.  Well, Boris FX just released the 2024.5 update for Continuum, and in it, is a tucked away look at the future of the effects package.  Believe it or not, it’s the Witness Protection effect that will lead the way to the next generation of effects in Continuum, and in the process, save editors and graphic designers countless hours of tedious work, even with the best tools available now.
Now, since everything these days is called “SOMETHING AI”, Boris FX decided to go down a bit of a different path by calling theirs ML or “MACHINE LEARNING”, and you can find the four “ML” effects in Continuum, simply by searching for them.

So, looking at the Media Composer version pictured above (the ML effects are available across the other host applications of Continuum as well), you’ll notice that there are actually four different ML effects including DeNoise, ReTimer, UpRez and Witness Protection which, for Media Composer, is a real-time effect.  So, what is the Witness Protection effect exactly?  Well, you’ve seen it a million times before.  Need to blur someone’s face out who’s walking down the street, as you don’t have permission to use their likeness in your production?  That’s where you would use an effect like this.  However, it’s worked very differently in the past and, to be honest, the effect went from wonky to very cool to awesome.  It started out wonky as it used the Continuum tracker to do all the motion tracking.  We all know how terrible point tracking can be, and having Mocha integrated with almost all the effects in Continuum really stepped this effect up a notch, as it made the tracking process much easier and much more precise.  It was, however, not without its issues.  If the talent walked behind a tree, or lamppost, or other object, it would require more work to be done inside of Mocha and, really, any time this type of effect was required, it always came with a bit of cringe from the editor, as we know how much time it really took to do this type of work, and it could be painfully slow.  Well, not anymore.  How does it work?  Drag and drop.  Yep.  That’s it.  Drag the effect (or apply it, depending on the application you’re using), and that’s it.  Talent walks behind something?  No problem.  The ML (Machine Learning) effect will be dropped back on as they come back out from behind it.  Does your character walk on or off screen?  Again, no problem, as ML will add the effect back on when they reappear.  Take a look at what I mean below:

The effect still contains everything else that you had available to you before, like the ability to switch to a mosaic pattern instead of a blur if you want to, and you can even turn ML off all together if you wanted to apply the effect to something different like a logo on someone’s shirt.



With that said, this is where I really see the potential in this effect.  Right now, the ML component is designed to detect faces, and basically add an ellipse to it as a mask, to then have Continuum either blur or add a mosaic to someone’s face.


I was floored by how quick and accurate it was.  The only adjustment I actually had to make was to add a bit of a feather to the mask, and make it slightly bigger, but otherwise, it did all the work for me.  It’s the first time that I’ve done anything with AI and thought “HOLY ****, I CAN ACTUALLY SEE MYSELF USING THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS”.  Now, let’s take a look at this effect moving forward.  What about logos on shirts or on products?  What about the ability to blur out nudity?  What about the ability to look at a transcript and blur over someone’s mouth who swears.  Now these applications are something that editors, especially ones who work on reality TV can really use in their day to day workflow that will save them an absolute ton of time in the compositing chair.  We can even look across other effects in Continuum to see where applications like this can speed up our workflows.  For example, in any lens flare effect.  Simply type in what you want your lens flare “attached” to, and you’ve already saved me a ton of time.  Sun, headlight, flashlight.  Something so simple, can save use minutes and even hours of time tracking.    For me, this one effect has gotten me excited about Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning in my NLE/Compositing application, as it’s something that I can easily see a wide range of editors using, in all different types of productions.  For more information about Continuum 2024.5, you can check it out at borisfx.com .

Mira Murati, chief technology officer of OpenAI, stirred up quite a bit of controversy last week in a discussion when she proclaimed that with generative AI, “some creative jobs maybe will go away, but maybe they shouldn’t have been there in the first place.”


While’s Murati’s remarks were framed within a context that AI is helping to boost creative pursuits, that’s not how many read it. The pushback was fast and furious. “OpenAI’s mission is to create AGI that can replace people in every viable economic activity. Killing jobs is the end goal,” wrote Dare Obasanjo in an X post.

“Aside from this despicable soundbite, Murati keeps stressing that generative AI will make people ‘more creative.’ But how?” asked Giovanni Colantonio in another X post. “You literally aren't creating. A machine creates the thing for you. It kneecaps creativity, not fosters it.”

PROMOTED
AI advocates “talk about democratizing creativity, but that's not what the tech does,’ Colantonio adds. “It discourages people from actually doing the real creative act of bringing an idea to life and instead encourages ‘creativity’ to be a thing that can be assembled and served like a Big Mac.”

Is AI, particularly generative AI, on a path to usurp the jobs of creatives, as well as the very essence of creativity? Whether its graphic illustrations, written content, photos, films, games, or other creative pursuits, could AI produce new things at the touch of a button?

It’s early, but so far, the evidence seems to point away from that.
“There's no easing up in the race for creative talent in 2024,” a talent report published in the first quarter of this year by Robert Half suggests. A majority of creative and marketing managers covered by the placement service, 55%, “are hiring for new roles, from graphic designer to UX designers, while 43% need to recruit for vacant positions.”

At least 200,000 creative jobs were added to corporate payrolls in 2023, Robert Half estimates. The unemployment rate for graphic designers and web designers was at a relatively low 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Still, underneath what appears to be a solid creative job market lurks uneasiness about its long-term prospects. Close to seven in ten of 4,000 global marketing and creative leaders, 69%, expressed concern over potential job loss across industries due to AI. a survey by Canva attests.
The surveyed leaders also welcomed the addition of AI tools to their activities. At least 69% believe generative AI is enhancing the creativity of their teams. And almost all, 97%, are comfortable with the rise of generative AI — with 72% stating they are “very” comfortable and 25% “somewhat” comfortable.
“We’re in a golden age of creativity and design right now,” said Deepa Subramaniam, vice president at Adobe, which now supports more than seven billion AI-generated images available through its Firefly models. At Adobe Summit in March, I put the question of creative job-killing to Subramaniam, who disagrees with such an assessment, and actually foresees expansion of creative roles.
AI provides the capability to customize and produce art and content on an increasingly wide scale that today’s organizations need, she said. “The hungry consumption for personalized content is not going to be satiated any time soon,” she pointed out. It’s only going to increase. But it’s really hard to create that volume of content manually, and manage it at scale, especially in a world where you're marketing at a global level. There are many languages and cultures that need to be reached.”
Generative AI “is taking the tedium out of content distribution, she said. “You still have to create creative concepts for marketing campaigns. But when you have that concept, you need to create it, localize it, and personalize it at scale.”
To meet these demands, there are “more people doing creative work across all sorts of industries across all sorts of job roles more so than ever before,” Subramaniam added.
For an example of technology’s impact on design-oriented professions, look to engineering, she illustrated. “Engineering has been growing as a really critical domain and group of people with the explosion of technology over the last few decades,” she said. “You're not seeing a shrinking of engineering.”
The takeaway is that technology took on many of the mundane, lower-level tasks of engineering. “Technology and software and coding has taken rote calculations away, but engineering has only been growing, because that unlocks the craft of engineering to figure out higher and higher complex problems.”
Likewise, in creative fields, “there's something like that happening right now,” Subramaniam continued. “Tedious time-consuming tasks can be obviated if not wholly accelerated by AI, opening creatives up to do that higher level thinking.”
As AI and technology open up more creative avenues, “it’s actually going to invite more people in to take on more creative roles,” she continued. “Whether it’s as a creative professional, as a marketer, in any of the creative roles that digital content is powering our entire world.”

       Don’t look now, but budget season is around the corner, and hoteliers will soon have to decide how much time and resources to dedicate to Artificial Intelligence in 2024. To help understand where AI adoption is heading, I’ve rounded up a few key stats on the impact of AI on work and the labor market. 1. Generative AI is now used by 65% of organizations. In 2024, generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude went mainstream. According to a global survey from McKinsey, almost two-thirds of organizations now use them, nearly double the percentage from ten months prior. The most common applications are in sales and marketing and product and service development, but use cases are proliferating across organizations. Three-quarters of respondents predicted that generative AI will lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the years ahead. Source: McKinsey, Global Survey on AI, March 2024 2. AI is poised to contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030. The potential financial impact of AI is enormous. PwC predicts that global GDP (gross domestic product) will increase by as much as 14% in 2030 as a result of AI – the equivalent of an additional $15.7 trillion. Growth will be driven by productivity gains and increased consumer demand, as organizations utilize AI to augment labor productivity and automate roles and tasks. Source: PwC, Global Artificial Intelligence Study, 2019 3. AI will affect almost 40 percent of jobs around the world. Historically, automation and information technology have affected routine tasks and low-skilled jobs. “One of the things that sets AI apart is its ability to impact high-skilled jobs,” reports the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “As a result, advanced economies face greater risks from AI—but also more opportunities to leverage its benefits.” In advanced economies, about 60% of jobs may be impacted by AI, with roughly half of jobs benefiting from enhanced productivity and half of jobs being reduced or replaced. In contrast, AI exposure is expected to affect 40% of jobs in emerging markets and 26% of jobs in low-income countries. Source: IMF, Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work, January 2024 4. 79% of business leaders believe AI adoption is critical to remain competitive. Many employees have gone all-in on AI, reporting that it saves time, boosts creativity, and allows them to focus on their most important work. Yet company leadership is lagging, according to a global survey from Microsoft and LinkedIn. Sixty percent of business leaders said their company lacks a vision and plan to implement AI, and only 25% of companies plan to offer AI training this year. Yet 66% of leaders also said they wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills. Not content to wait for their employers to catch up, employees are learning and upskilling in AI on their own. Of the AI users surveyed, 78% said they bring their own AI tools to work. Source: Microsoft and LinkedIn, 2024 Work Trends Index Annual Report, May 2024 5. 56% of executives believe their roles will be completely or partially replaced by AI. Much of the discussion about the impact of AI revolves around entry-level employees and mid-level managers. Yet it appears that senior-level positions are also at risk of being displaced or at least heavily augmented by AI. That’s according to a survey of 800 C-suite executives (including 500 CEOs) from edX, the online learning platform created by administrators at Harvard and M.I.T. A few more of the survey’s findings: 77% of executives say AI is disrupting their business strategy 87% are struggling to find talent with AI skills 81% feel they have no choice but to learn how to use AI 82% believe workers skilled at using AI should be paid more Source: edX, Navigating the Workplace in the Age of AI, September 2023. 6. 70.1% of short-term rental operators use AI. Statistics on AI usage in the lodging industry are scarce, but I did unearth a survey of 500 short-term rental (STR) property owners and managers from Hostaway. The survey indicates that AI isn’t just for big hotel companies with big budgets. Just over seventy percent of STR managers report using AI tools, and 61.8% believe AI represents a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Currently, STRs are primary using AI tools for: Price optimization Customer service Operational efficiency Marketing Energy management Of respondents, 35.0% said they’re on track to save an equivalent of four workdays this year, or at least two hours per week. For managers of 26 properties or more, the number jumps to 46.6%. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that more than three-quarters of the property managers surveyed are optimistic about AI, whereas only 7.2% expressed a pessimistic view. Source: Hostaway, 2024 Report: AI in the Short-term Rental Industry, May 2024 7. These Are the 8 Most Popular AI Tools in 2024. So, exactly what generative AI tools are people using? According to Quartz, these are the visitor volumes for the top tools for just a three-month period this year, from March to May. ChatGPT — 2.5 billion Gemini — 1.27 billion DeepL — 810.5 million Character — 723.6 million Perplexity – 217.4 million Claude — 186 million Poe — 148 million Copilot — 104.1 million Source: Quartz and Similarweb, June 2024 What Does This Mean for the Hospitality Industry? The data indicates that it’s time for hoteliers to stop dabbling in AI and start getting serious. While the hospitality industry is primarily a people-driven business, the AI use cases are piling up. AI has the potential to transform roles in virtually every department. But it’s not physical jobs in housekeeping, F&B, and guest services that will be most affected, it’s white-collar jobs in sales & marketing, revenue management, operations, finance, and human resources. To stay competitive, hoteliers need to figure out how to leverage AI to increase efficiency and productivity across the property or group, enhance the guest experience, and upskill employees for the future. 8 Key Steps to AI Planning for Hospitality Businesses As a starting point, consider the following steps: Assemble an AI committee Identify AI use cases across departments (think big, start small) Talk to tech vendors about how to leverage AI Familiarize yourself with AI-related ethics and regulations Develop an AI plan with objectives, a timeline, and performance metrics Incorporate AI into company policies and procedures Provide training, exploration, and upskilling opportunities to team members Be transparent about how AI will impact the workplace No sweat, right? There will be winners and losers in the AI race. Now is the time to decide how to ensure your company—and your career—come out on the winning side. Chatbots, Robotics & AI Daniel  E.

Unlocking the Potential of Generative AI

By Broadridge -   June 24, 2024 



ShareTweetShare
By Ariel Junqueira-DeGarcia, Managing Director, Broadridge
Since coming to the scene in November 2022, generative AI (GenAI) has been revolutionizing how we work and pushing companies to explore its benefits. But GenAI, which is capable of producing new content — like images, text, or music — isn’t without its limitations and risks. 
Tools like ChatGPT might seem like they understand user commands, but they don’t actually understand the content. GenAI merely predicts what’s likely to come next based on patterns. Critics warn against blindly trusting GenAI, which can “hallucinate” by making things up. Content that comes from GenAI needs to be checked by a human. Additionally, security is another concern, as many companies fear inadvertently leaking sensitive information to these systems and, in turn, have restricted or prohibited their use in day-to-day operations. 
Despite the shortcomings, the momentum behind GenAI adoption is strong. In Broadridge’s 2024 Digital Transformation and Next-Gen Tech Study, 45% of firms allow staff to use GenAI tools for work purposes, and another quarter are training staff on how to use them. To stay competitive, companies need to find use cases that use GenAI to its fullest potential while also mitigating risks.
Finding opportunities 
Identifying practical GenAI use cases isn’t always straightforward. Legacy systems, data quality issues, and legal constraints all pose challenges. Even small-scale AI projects can consume resources with little payoff. A strategic approach is essential.
Companies can start by targeting low-hanging fruit by looking for areas where GenAI can augment existing workflows or automate processes. Take client onboarding: firms currently rely on Know Your Customer ops teams to spot high-risk clients by manually sifting through red flags. AI can do this more accurately and quickly.
Another area is trade capture, where firms sometimes struggle to incorporate news headlines into algorithms, relying on standardized data inputs to convert text information into scores. GenAI models trained on large datasets of news and market data can quickly and accurately incorporate headlines into algorithms, leading to more informed decision-making. 
Generative AI can also help firms deal with regulatory changes and upped reporting requirements. With a tsunami of regulatory changes such as T+1, CSDR, and EMIR Refit Phase 2 on the horizon, firms have plenty of opportunities to capitalize on this technology. One example is the move to shorten the U.S. securities settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1. The change requires significant re-engineering of existing exception management practices. Deep learning models can help streamline the settlement process. There are also potential use cases for AI in other parts of the trade life cycle, such as collateral management, settlements, and regulatory reporting. 
A three-step plan to get started 
So, which project is the best to get started with? Before diving into GenAI projects, companies need to ensure that any implementation aligns with long-term strategies and business goals. To help narrow down the field, there are three points that successful projects need to fulfill. 
What: Identify the business case for AI adoption. Identify manual tasks that can be automated or pain points that can alleviated with AI. Out of those projects, identify which can be implemented quickly, in weeks rather than months. 
Why: Describe the measurable benefits of implementing AI by identifying quantifiable metrics and measurable business outcomes to measure success. 
How: Evaluate the cost and feasibility of the project. Gather information on what data is needed to train the model, how the prototype would be implemented and tested, and whether to use a third-party vendor or build in-house. 
By embracing generative AI and adopting a strategic, risk-mitigating approach, companies can unlock a competitive edge, streamline operations, navigate regulatory landscapes, and ultimately, shape the future of their industry. This is not just about staying afloat; it’s about harnessing the power of AI to thrive in the years to come.

However, it cannot replace the originality and creative power of the human mind. This is the message Colette Stallbaumer, GM of Microsoft’s Copilot and co-founder of WorkLab, wants workers to understand.Stallbaumer's message comes in the wake of recent data from a work survey organised by Microsoft and LinkedIn which highlights the surging use of AI in the white-collar workforce. The survey showed that AI is already having a significant impact on how people do their jobs.The integration of AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot are transforming workplaces - a change that should be embraced rather than feared, says Stallbaumer, because AI will not only change individual work practices, but could transform the DNA of entire organisations.Rise in use of AI tools at the individual levelAccording to the 2024 annual Work Trend Index report which surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries, 75 per cent are already using generative AI at work - a figure that has doubled in the last six months.The growing trend of individuals integrating AI tools at a grassroots level is already showing significant benefits; 85 per cent of respondents reported increased productivity, and 84 per cent noted improvements in creativity, leading to higher employee satisfaction.Women participate more in meeting with an AI female teammate, research showsGenerative AI tools allow workers to allocate more time to human-centric activities, such as team engagement and creative thinking. As such humans will be less doers and more supervisors of AI and AI-generated work and outcomes, explained Stallbaumer.""A salesperson can spend less time on data entry or navigating systems of record and more time nurturing customer relationships. Similarly, a finance professional can reduce time spent searching for data anomalies and focus more on strategic business growth.""While it's encouraging that individuals are deriving value from these changes in their roles, the challenge lies in organising, scaling, and integrating these practices across organisations at a strategic level.Adobe: ‘AI is not going to replace people, but people that use AI may be replacing those that don't’‘Coffee badging’ is the new return to the office trend. What is it and why do mostly men do it? Scaling AI adoption to an organisational level“After individual use begins the hard part of where we are in this technology adoption cycle. Now comes the real work, where people need to really build the habit of working in this new way with AI,” said Stallbaumer.According to the survey, 41 per cent of leaders expect to have to redesign business processes with AI, although how this will happen is still evolving. For example, some efficiencies will be similar across all companies while other AI solutions and changes will be designed for the organisation’s goals.“It's about looking at the opportunities in their business, in those horizontal workflows to actually apply AI to those processes. Every role is a series of tasks, right? And if you begin to break down those tasks, [you can] look at where AI can help.”It’s the companies that can face the challenges and opportunities head on - even as the 'how' is still evolving - that will thrive in the future.Watch the video above to learn more about the findings of Microsoft’s 2024 Work Trends Index report.You can see more content from Cannes Lions here.",NewsArticle,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ai-not-creative-ai-change-050033126.html,"‘AI is not creative, you are’: How AI will change the way we work, according to Microsoft","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://media.zenfs.com/en/euronews_uk_articles_973/4749285fc61c1dedac5d9250a966ea28'}",2024-06-21T05:00:33.000Z,2024-06-21T05:00:33.000Z,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Annabel Murphy', 'url': '', 'jobTitle': ''}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Yahoo News', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_news_en-US_h_p_news_2.png', 'width': 310, 'height': 50}, 'url': 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/'}",,,,https://media.zenfs.com/en/euronews_uk_articles_973/4749285fc61c1dedac5d9250a966ea28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Annabel Murphy', 'url': '', 'jobTitle': ''}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Euronews', 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 400, 'height': 400, 'url': 'https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ec36b150-e968-11eb-baef-3c41b6928f57'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A growing number of workers worldwide are considering changing employers within the next year due to rising workloads and the rapid pace of technological change, surpassing the levels seen during the “Great Resignation” of 2022, a report by PwC said.
The 2024 Global Workforce Hopes & Fears Survey, conducted among over 56,000 workers in 50 countries, revealed that a surprising 28% of respondents are likely to switch employers within the next year.
This figure marks a notable increase compared to the peak of the “Great Resignation” in 2022, which saw 19% of workers considering a change, and 26% in 2023.
 
 
 













 
 

“As workers face heightened uncertainty, rising workloads, and continue to confront financial stress, they are prioritizing skills growth and embracing new and emerging technologies such as generative AI to accelerate their careers,” Carol Stubbings, Global Markets and Tax & Legal Services Leader at PwC UK said in the report. “Job satisfaction is no longer enough. Employees are placing an increased premium on skills growth in a climate characterized by constant technological change.”

The desire to move is strongly linked to the need for skills development and the adoption of new technologies.
“Employee desires to job-switch will be driven by a multitude of reasons, but notably this year, two-thirds (67%) who said they are likely to switch in the next 12 months said opportunities to learn new skills are a key factor in any decision to job-switch,” Pete Brown, Global Workforce Leader at PwC UK said.  “All the while, fewer than half (46%) said they strongly or moderately agree that their employer provides adequate opportunities to learn new skills. Investing in employee upskilling programs will be critical to the retention of talent and ensuring their organizations remain competitive in a constantly evolving marketplace.”
 
 
 













 
 

According to another poll conducted by EY in March with over 250 industry leaders, half of the participants expect a trend of simultaneous layoffs and hiring as companies grapple with the evolving skillsets required in the AI era.
“How employees and employers address rising workloads, heightened uncertainty, macroeconomic pressures and technological transformation will vary based on geography, industry, and role,” Brown said.  “But survey responses this year highlight employees are embracing new and emerging technology such as GenAI to transform their roles and responsibilities and to create efficiencies.”
What’s driving the shift?
While the specific reasons behind this trend may vary, the report sheds light on several potential contributing factors.  A significant number of employees reported experiencing a faster pace of change in their workplaces compared to the previous year. 
 
 
 













 
 

“Nearly two-thirds (62%) say they have experienced more change at work in the past year than the 12 months prior, with two-fifths (40%) noting their daily responsibilities have changed to a large or very large extent,” the report added.

Ask




Nearly half (44%) admitted feeling a lack of clarity regarding the purpose behind these changes, potentially leading to confusion and frustration.
This sense of uncertainty appears to coincide with rising workloads.  The survey found that 45% of respondents reported an increase in their daily responsibilities, potentially leading to feelings of overwhelm and dissatisfaction.
 
 
 













 
 

Around 45% of respondents said, “I have had to learn to use new tools or technologies in order to do my job.”
In response to these pressures, employees are increasingly looking to AI and other technologies to improve their work efficiency and career prospects.
“Nearly two-thirds (62%) of employees surveyed say it will create efficiencies in their time at work, rising to 82% for daily users of the technology,” Brown said. “However, organizations and business leaders play a critical role. They must drive this change, ensuring they have AI strategies, frameworks, guidance, and training in place to ensure their employees are skills-ready for a constantly evolving workplace.”
 
 
 













 
 

Additionally, 76% of daily GenAI users anticipate that these tools will lead to higher salaries.
“Technology is fundamentally changing the way work gets done and the skills employers seek. Employees value organizations that invest in their skills growth, enabling them to stay relevant and thrive in a digital world,” Pete Brown, Global Workforce Leader at PwC UK said in the report highlighting the transformative potential of AI in the workplace. “Proactive upskilling programs and a focus on the employee experience are crucial for businesses looking to retain talent and drive successful transformations.”
The upskilling imperative
Upskilling has become so valuable to employees that they see it as a company differentiator. Almost half of employees say that having opportunities to learn new skills is a key consideration when it comes to their decision to stay with their employer or leave for another job, the report said.
 
 
 













 
 

Despite the enthusiasm for AI, there remains a significant gap in access and training. Among employees who have not used GenAI at work in the past year, one-third (33%) do not see opportunities to use the technology, 24% lack access to the tools, and 23% do not know how to use them.
This gap underscores the need for employers to invest in comprehensive training and technology access to ensure all employees can benefit from advancements in AI.
“Leaders must provide a clear and transparent roadmap for the future, which includes laying out their ambitions and the steps required to meet those objectives,” Brown added. “When it comes to ensuring employees are skilled for the AI age, organizations must ensure they are developing AI strategies, frameworks, guidance, and training programs. More broadly, they also need to create guidance and mentoring about the types of skills employees need to build as technology transforms all industries. It’s also important to create a culture of learning and experimentation, recognizing that new and emerging technologies and their impact on roles and responsibilities are constantly evolving.”
 
 
 













 
 

The survey also revealed that less than half (46%) of all employees believe their employer provides adequate opportunities to learn new skills that will be beneficial to their careers. This lack of development opportunities is a driving force behind the high percentage of workers considering job changes.

While challenges remain, there are also positive signs. Job satisfaction has increased, with 60% of workers expressing at least moderate satisfaction, up from 56% in 2023. Additionally, financial stress has slightly eased, with 45% of workers having money left over each month, an increase from 38% last year. However, more than half (52%) still report experiencing some degree of financial stress.
“Taken together, these stats show how critical it is for companies to create ample opportunities for all employees to develop skills on the job and to ensure that leaders are providing guidance and mentoring about what kinds of skills employees need to build,” the report suggested. “It’s also important to create a culture of learning, where creating time for learning on the job is part of the organization’s DNA.”

Be honest: Are your company values and AI aligned?
Regulators, experts, and AI vendors talk a lot about alignment: the degree to which an AI model conforms to values. But enterprises are still coming to terms with what or whose values should be prioritized.

User-ChatGPT Interaction Model: A Comprehensive Overview:
The interaction between users and AI, particularly with ChatGPT, represents a dynamic and evolving domain. This relationship is defined by the user’s task-oriented prompts and the AI’s responses. Users start by defining a task based on their expectations and skills and then communicate this via prompts to ChatGPT. The AI processes these prompts and generates textual responses. Users then evaluate these responses against their expectations, refining their prompts and expectations through iterative engagement. This model highlights the challenges of understanding ChatGPT’s internal workings and the proprietary nature of its data while emphasizing the importance of analyzing user tasks to gauge the impact of AI on human skills.
Data and Methodology:
This study investigates the tasks users assign to ChatGPT and the potential impact on human skills using Twitter data and the European Skills, Competencies, and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy. Data were gathered from 911,637 English tweets from November 2022 to January 2023, focusing on various terms related to ChatGPT. After filtering and processing, 616,073 tweets were analyzed. Tasks mentioned in these tweets were identified using Named Entity Recognition (NER), capturing patterns involving ChatGPT and action verbs. A rule-based approach was applied, yielding 87,313 tasks. To refine the data, preprocessing included lemmatization and synonym grouping, resulting in 5,554 unique functions. These tasks were then semantically matched to relevant ESCO skills. Finally, sentiment analysis using the Twitter RoBERTa model assessed user reactions to these tasks, with sentiment scores calculated for each skill to determine the overall impact.
Exploring Public Opinions and Polarization Around ChatGPT: A BERT-Based Analysis:
This study explores public sentiment and topic polarization regarding ChatGPT by leveraging confirmation bias theory and advanced NLP models. By analyzing tweets, the research aims to understand public opinions and develop a polarization model based on confirmation bias. Utilizing BERT for sentiment analysis (BERTSentiment) and topic modeling (BERTopic), the study identifies emotional responses and thematic discussions related to ChatGPT. The findings highlight ChatGPT’s societal significance, how opinions form and diverge, and the role of group dynamics in online discussions. This approach provides a perspective on the impact of emerging technologies on public discourse.
Conclusion: Looking Ahead in the Era of ChatGPT and Generative AI:
As ChatGPT and similar Generative AI technologies continue to evolve, they promise significant impacts on human skills across various domains, from technical proficiency to creative problem-solving. The study underscores the transformative potential of these tools in reshaping job markets and educational paradigms. However, it also highlights the critical need for responsible deployment and skill development among users to maximize benefits and mitigate risks. As we navigate this dynamic landscape, understanding AI tools’ nuanced capabilities and limitations, like ChatGPT, will be crucial in harnessing their full potential for societal advancement and sustainable innovation. This marks just the beginning of a narrative that will shape the future of human-AI interaction.

The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse digital workplace applications is advancing at a rapid pace. Digital workplace leaders need to leverage “productivity zones” to identify what aspects of productivity can be improved for information-centric work.
Employees that are engaged in information-centric work do not generally do that work in strict, task-driven or rigid workflow structures where productivity is easily measured. They often organize the way they work in a flexible manner, frequently switch activities, and interact with many people. These interactions may only be tangentially related to their tasks, but they still have an impact on productivity.
Measuring and improving information worker’s productivity needs to factor in experiences that go beyond the task itself such as the choices the staffs make when sequencing and prioritizing their work, or how much they depend on the input of others. Treating work patterns as zones can help identify where technologies like GenAI can help employees to be more productive.
Productivity zones represent a way to better understand information work employee experiences beyond task-driven productivity approaches. Digital workplace leaders can consider the following nine zones to help segment the different digital experiences employees encounter as they perform information-centric work.

Planning: Organizing and self-managing the work.
Creating: Composing, designing and refining knowledge artifacts.
Meeting: Gathering people to share information, make decisions, document actions, and grant individual perspectives and a shared vision.
Analyzing: Assessing the effort, artifacts, data and content needed for work.
Collaborating: Conducting conversations and joint efforts to execute the work.
Coordinating: Interacting with team members and others to refine work efforts, align timelines, schedule deliverables, and reevaluate assignments.
Networking: Connecting with colleagues to gain and share expertise, community feedback, or information.
Decision-making: Reaching an authoritative judgment or conclusion that affects individual and team actions for a given work activity.
Finding: This zone deals with discovering and utilizing the content, people, or other data related to the work at hand.

There isn’t a uniform route through these zones. It’s possible for employees to navigate through the zones multiple times for a specific activity. Digital workplace leaders must analyze and understand of what zones to “weight” more than others. The areas where GenAI might have a more profound impact and productivity value are those zones with more weight attached to them.
With GenAI, the lack of historical insights necessitates identifying areas of potential benefit. While GenAI appears to offer a general uplift in work efficiency for all types of work, questions remain as to whether GenAI will deliver improvements to business results beyond personal productivity. Personal productivity might be improved, but if the work is dependent on synchronizing tasks and results with team members, then individual productivity gains can be negated — unless the productivity gain is felt across the team. For instance, GenAI in collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and Slack can help summarize chat threads and highlight key conversations, saving time compared to scanning lengthy chat histories.
To equip business stakeholders and GenAI advocates with deeper insights, applying the concept of productivity zones to use cases proves beneficial. These use cases allow digital workplace leaders to frame GenAI’s potential business value and productivity impact for line of business leaders. They can also guide decisions on whether to implement GenAI broadly across the organization for overall productivity enhancement or restrict it to specific work activities and employee groups.
Ultimately, use cases can distinguish the capabilities and impact of numerous digital workplace application vendors, all of whom are integrating GenAI into their products. These accumulated insights form a feedback loop to fine-tune deployment scenarios.
Gartner analysts will discuss more topics related to AI and digital workplace technologies at the Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo conference, taking place November 11-13, in Kochi, India. Media registration can be booked via sonika.choubey@gartner.com.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not just a buzzword, or a concept confined to the realms of science fiction. It is a rapidly evolving technology that has already begun to reshape various aspects of our lives and holds the potential to fundamentally transform society in ways we are only beginning to understand.
The concept of AI, which encompasses machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and more, has been a subject of both awe and controversy. Its capabilities have expanded from simple automated tasks to complex problem-solving, predictive analytics, and even mimicking human interactions. The impact of AI on society is multifaceted, influencing everything from the economy and employment to ethics and governance.
Economically, AI has the potential to create significant efficiencies, reduce costs, and drive innovation. Industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing have seen AI-driven advancements that improve service delivery and product development. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of medical data to assist in diagnosing diseases or tailor financial advice to individual consumer profiles.

However, the rise of AI also brings challenges, particularly in the job market. Automation and intelligent systems could displace certain job roles, necessitating a shift in workforce skills and education. This transition may lead to short-term disruptions but could also open up new opportunities for employment in AI-related fields.
Ethically, AI presents complex questions about privacy, surveillance, and decision-making. As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the balance between leveraging AI for societal benefits and protecting individual rights becomes increasingly delicate. There is a growing call for transparent and responsible AI development, ensuring that these systems are fair, unbiased, and accountable.
Governance is another area where AI’s influence is evident. AI can enhance public services, improve policy decisions, and streamline governmental processes. However, it also requires new regulations and frameworks to manage its deployment and mitigate risks associated with advanced AI technologies.
The advent of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked a global conversation about the future of work. With the potential to automate a wide range of tasks, ML is often viewed with a mix of anticipation and apprehension. The question on many minds is: Will machine learning replace humans in the workforce?
The answer is nuanced. Reports suggest that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs, potentially affecting a quarter of work tasks in the US and Europe. However, this shift does not necessarily equate to a direct loss of jobs. Instead, it heralds a transformation in the nature of work itself.
Machine learning is poised to automate routine and repetitive tasks, which can lead to job displacement in certain sectors. Yet, it also has the potential to create new jobs and spur a productivity boom. The key lies in adaptation and reskilling. As AI reshapes industries, new roles are emerging for AI and machine learning specialists, data analysts, scientists, and digital transformation experts.
The economic impact of AI is significant. The McKinsey Global Institute projects that AI could add approximately $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, translating to an additional 1.2% GDP growth per year. This growth stems from labor automation and innovation in products and services.
For businesses and individuals alike, the imperative is to embrace the change. Companies must invest in training their workforce to harness the power of AI effectively. For workers, acquiring new skills and adapting to evolving job demands will be crucial for thriving in the age of AI.
The transformative nature of AI is not without its skeptics. Some argue that the hype surrounding AI exceeds its actual impact, while others caution against unchecked AI development leading to unintended consequences. Nonetheless, the consensus among experts is that AI is a transformational technology that warrants informed engagement from all sectors of society.
AI is genuinely transformational, with the capacity to alter the fabric of society in significant ways. It is a technology that demands careful consideration, inclusive dialogue, and careful regulations.

Crikey
AI-generated news is unhuman slop. Crikey is banning it
Until artificial intelligence can generate a headline as incisive or beautiful as 'Pissing in the Sink', we will never use it to write our articles.

Crikey’s first-ever edition arrived in inboxes on Valentine’s Day, February 14, 2000. It included a reflection on Lachlan Murdoch from his former philosophy tutor, pseudonymous insider gossip from the former political staffer Christian Kerr, and lists of journalists who’d previously worked in politics. There was a profile of Rupert Murdoch lieutenant Col Allan titled “Pissing in the Sink”. 
From our inception, we have been so very Crikey. There are a lot of things that make up Crikeyness, but central is its humanness. Like most people, we want to cut through the bullshit, know how the world and power works, hear the gossip, tell stories, take the piss and have fun. We write the way we wish other people would write, which is the way we talk to each other, for our readers.
In the near quarter-century of dispatches — during which newsletters went from being cool, to cringe, back to cool and is now swinging back towards cringe again — Crikey has remained remarkably consistent because our job didn’t change. We didn’t pivot to iPad or video. We just kept doing the same old Crikey: having people write about people for other people. Fundamentally, this is what we think journalism is about.
But there is a threat to this philosophy. Artificial intelligence, specifically advances in generative AI, has been the defining tech trend of the past 18-odd months. Every industry has been experimenting with how to use the technology, including the media. Predictably, some are already using it to create the news. While some outlets have been caught publishing AI-written articles without disclosure, others are openly publishing articles and artwork made by a machine even though it makes most Australians uneasy.
OpenAI, Meta and Google’s AI chatbots repeated Australian political paedophile conspiracy theoryRead More
Our official position at Crikey is that this stinks. To understand our revulsion, you need to understand how generative AI, specifically large language models, work.
The first step in creating one of these models is hoovering up a huge amount of data. Most data is ripped from the internet without permission en masse. Companies that do this have ingested lots of intellectual property belonging to people who did not agree to being sucked into someone’s AI-generated, low-quality information and even some illegal and abhorrent images. 
The next step is training on the data to understand the relationships between all the words and phrases. For example, if you input “the founder of Crikey is”, the most common response among its dataset is probably something like “Stephen Mayne”, which is true. But AI doesn’t draw on years of close observation of Australian media when it answers this question. It makes a calculation based on all the times other people have continued that sentence to come up with its response.
The point is that AI does not understand what it’s being asked to do. It doesn’t know what words mean. It does not think or care about who’s reading what it’s putting out. It certainly does not consider the different angles of a story and who stands to gain from accepting the spin. It’s mindless regurgitation, like a press gallery journalist repeating a politician’s promise without interrogating it.
There are a lot of other reasons to dislike the AI hype and its industry of boosters. It’s a hugely energy-intensive technology that requires incredible amounts of power to use and train, significantly more than other computing methods to complete the same task like searching the web. 
It produces bullshit — not our words, bullshit is a scientific, technical term — when it frequently and confidently tells lies. Even when it tells the truth, its answers have racial and sexual biases. 
The technology can’t be separated from its unscrupulous creators. The industry’s original sin was stealing the world’s data without permission. Everything it produces is fruit from the poisonous tree. Companies say you can opt out of having your data collected, but only told us this after they got their fill of information. And sometimes these companies lie about letting you opt out.
These companies have grown rich and fat by selling subscriptions and advertising on the data they stole from us. This digital colonial mindset continues in AI’s users, too. They use it to reproduce our art, our photographs, our writing and our faces, all without permission and often to our displeasure.
I tricked a selfie AI age-verification demo into letting a child ‘buy’ a knifeRead More
No matter how advanced it gets, AI can never do the work of journalism. It can’t pick up the phone, go somewhere, speak to people, or think of a new angle or problem or solution. That doesn’t mean it can’t be used as a poor substitute. As we’ve already seen in Australia, people are already using AI to rip off other people’s journalism for their own gain and to compete against real stuff. They steal the eyeballs and dollars required to do the work that they think is valuable enough to take for themselves. 
The current state of AI is an industry built around a wasteful, violating technology used to create poor imitations of work, riddled with errors and biases, that threaten the very systems that produce the information from which they seek to extract value.
That’s a good reason to boycott it, but our reason is simpler: AI-generated content is bad to read and see. It’s bland and beige. It’s slop that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny but is a close enough approximation to something real that it can fill up space where people don’t pay attention. It’s something that someone didn’t care enough about to spend time to write or create. 
It is the opposite of what Crikey is. We believe that AI can never replicate our essential Crikeyness. A thousand chatbots in a thousand years would never come up with a title as evocative, incisive or beautiful as “Pissing in the Sink”. Using AI to generate Crikey would be an insult to you, the reader, as well as everyone who has made Crikey what it is. We’ve fiddled with AI image generation and the occasional block of text as a proof of concept in the past, and our editorial guidelines already require that any AI-generated content is disclosed. But we want to go a step further.
Crikey will never use AI to create what you read and see from us. We will spend the time writing the drafts, we will make the calls, we will read the documents, we will scheme for ways to piss off the right people. We will do the hard, time-consuming, expensive work — because if we didn’t, we wouldn’t be doing what our audience deserves. We join a movement of people rejecting AI-generated content to fight for the real stuff, and we invite other news organisations to join us.
We promise that everything you read and see in Crikey is made by a real person who gives a shit.

The recent “AI for Community Impact Summit” organised by Microsoft in Johannesburg, South Africa, buzzed with excitement.  As a participant, I was particularly thrilled to witness the launch of a groundbreaking white paper: “AI and the Future of Work in Africa.” This insightful document co-authored by a diverse group of thought leaders explores the potential impact of generative AI on the African workforce.
Here are 7 key points to understand why this white paper is must-read:
                           Next   Stay       Stunned by thousands of storks flying over the sky in Gia Viễn dike, Ninh Bình - Nếm TV            40         42                                                                                                              00:00                                                       00:00  /  00:00           10 Sec             
Collaborative Expertise: The paper benefits from the combined insights of thought leaders from Microsoft Research Africa, Microsoft Philanthropies, University of Pretoria, NEPAD, Lelapa AI, and Oxford University.
Focus Areas: This comprehensive analysis explores the impact of generative AI on various aspects of African work. Ultimately, the goal is to chart a course for a dignified and inclusive future of work.

Motivation and Context: The workshop that produced this white paper was driven by the potential of generative AI to transform the African workplace. Africa’s young population and diverse socio-economic landscape present unique challenges and opportunities. The core question is: How can generative AI be harnessed to create a dignified future of work for all Africans?
Key Themes: To address this question, the workshop focused on four key themes: macroeconomic impacts, jobs and skills in the labour market, worker perspectives, and the development of Africa-centric AI platforms.
Challenges and Concerns: The paper acknowledges the challenges Africa faces in adopting AI. These include a lack of data reflecting African realities, which hinders the effectiveness of AI models. Additionally, broader economic impacts, like job displacement and inequality, require careful policy design. Limited digital infrastructure and a skilled workforce could further restrict Africa’s ability to harness AI’s potential.
A Promising Future: Despite the challenges, the paper paints a promising picture for generative AI in Africa. From automating tasks in manufacturing and transportation (leading to significant productivity gains) to creating new AI-driven jobs for the continent’s young, tech-savvy population, AI presents a chance to empower workers by freeing them from repetitive tasks. Most importantly, the development of African-centric AI tools specifically designed for the continent’s unique needs offers the chance to tackle socio-economic challenges and position Africa as a frontrunner in responsible AI development.


Building a Strong Foundation: The white paper emphasizes the need for a strong foundation for responsible AI in Africa. This requires investments in digital infrastructure and education to equip the workforce with the necessary skills. Creating inclusive AI policies that prioritize education, worker protections, and stakeholder involvement is crucial. Furthermore, AI development should be designed with a human-centered approach, focusing on complementing human skills rather than replacing them. This necessitates training data and AI tools built specifically for African contexts. Prioritizing the development of Africa-centric solutions and fostering collaboration among stakeholders are paramount to ensure AI development respects local knowledge and traditions.
To gain a deeper understanding, you can access the white paper’s executive summary via https://shorturl.at/YXsd5 or download the full report here https://shorturl.at/6biYD.
This insightful document provides a valuable framework and recommendations for Africans, particularly policymakers, industry leaders, research communities, and various stakeholders, to navigate the challenges and possibilities of AI. The paper serves as a wake-up call for Africa to actively participate in shaping its own future and ensure it is not left behind in this technological shift. Significantly, the paper highlights that of the 29 countries in the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (designed to promote responsible AI development grounded in human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and economic growth), only one African country (Senegal) is currently represented [Pg. 15 of the white paper].
This white paper offers a compelling roadmap for Africa to embrace AI as a tool for progress and shared prosperity.

California Lawmakers Consider Action to Regulate AI
The effects of artificial intelligence on employment, society and culture are wide reaching, and that’s reflected in the number of bills circulating the Legislature.

For four years, Jacob Hilton worked for one of the most influential startups in the Bay Area — OpenAI. His research helped test and improve the truthfulness of AI models such as ChatGPT. He believes artificial intelligence can benefit society, but he also recognizes the serious risks if the technology is left unchecked.
Hilton was among 13 current and former OpenAI and Google employees who this month signed an open letter that called for more whistleblower protections, citing broad confidentiality agreements as problematic.


“The basic situation is that employees, the people closest to the technology, they’re also the ones with the most to lose from being retaliated against for speaking up,” says Hilton, 33, now a researcher at the nonprofit Alignment Research Center, who lives in Berkeley, California.
California legislators are rushing to address such concerns through roughly 50 AI-related bills, many of which aim to place safeguards around the rapidly evolving technology, which lawmakers say could cause societal harm.
However, groups representing large tech companies argue that the proposed legislation could stifle innovation and creativity, causing California to lose its competitive edge and dramatically change how AI is developed in the state.
The effects of artificial intelligence on employment, society and culture are wide reaching, and that’s reflected in the number of bills circulating the Legislature. They cover a range of AI-related fears, including job replacement, data security and racial discrimination.
One bill, co-sponsored by the Teamsters, aims to mandate human oversight on driverless heavy-duty trucks. A bill backed by the Service Employees International Union attempts to ban the automation or replacement of jobs by AI systems at call centers that provide public benefit services, such as Medi-Cal. Another bill, written by Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, would require companies developing large AI models to do safety testing.
The plethora of bills come after politicians were criticized for not cracking down hard enough on social media companies until it was too late. During the Biden administration, federal and state Democrats have become more aggressive in going after big tech firms.
“We’ve seen with other technologies that we don’t do anything until well after there’s a big problem,” Wiener said. “Social media had contributed many good things to society … but we know there have been significant downsides to social media, and we did nothing to reduce or to mitigate those harms. And now we’re playing catch-up. I prefer not to play catch-up.”
The push comes as AI tools are quickly progressing. They read bedtime stories to children, sort drive-through orders at fast food locations and help make music videos. While some tech enthusiasts enthuse about AI’s potential benefits, others fear job losses and safety issues.
“It caught almost everybody by surprise, including many of the experts, in how rapidly (the tech is) progressing,” said Dan Hendrycks, director of the San Francisco-based nonprofit Center for AI Safety. “If we just delay and don’t do anything for several years, then we may be waiting until it’s too late.”
Wiener’s bill, SB1047, which is backed by the Center for AI Safety, calls for companies building large AI models to conduct safety testing and have the ability to turn off models that they directly control.
The bill’s proponents say it would protect against situations such as AI being used to create biological weapons or shut down the electrical grid, for example. The bill also would require AI companies to implement ways for employees to file anonymous concerns. The state attorney general could sue to enforce safety rules.
“Very powerful technology brings both benefits and risks, and I want to make sure that the benefits of AI profoundly outweigh the risks,” Wiener said.
Opponents of the bill, including TechNet, a trade group that counts tech companies including Meta, Google and OpenAI among its members, say policymakers should move cautiously. Meta and OpenAI did not return a request for comment. Google declined to comment.
“Moving too quickly has its own sort of consequences, potentially stifling and tamping down some of the benefits that can come with this technology,” said Dylan Hoffman, executive director for California and the Southwest for TechNet.
The bill passed the Assembly Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee on Tuesday and will next go to the Assembly Judiciary Committee and Assembly Appropriations Committee, and if it passes, to the Assembly floor.
Proponents of Wiener’s bill say they’re responding to the public’s wishes. In a poll of 800 potential voters in California commissioned by the Center for AI Safety Action Fund, 86% of participants said it was an important priority for the state to develop AI safety regulations. According to the poll, 77% of participants supported the proposal to subject AI systems to safety testing.
“The status quo right now is that, when it comes to safety and security, we’re relying on voluntary public commitments made by these companies,” said Hilton, the former OpenAI employee. “But part of the problem is that there isn’t a good accountability mechanism.”
Another bill with sweeping implications for workplaces is AB 2930, which seeks to prevent “algorithmic discrimination,” or when automated systems put certain people at a disadvantage based on their race, gender or sexual orientation when it comes to hiring, pay and termination.
“We see example after example in the AI space where outputs are biased,” said Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, D-Orinda.
The anti-discrimination bill failed in last year’s legislative session, with major opposition from tech companies. Reintroduced this year, the measure initially had backing from high-profile tech companies Workday and Microsoft, although they have wavered in their support, expressing concerns over amendments that would put more responsibility on firms developing AI products to curb bias.
“Usually, you don’t have industries saying, ‘Regulate me’, but various communities don’t trust AI, and what this effort is trying to do is build trust in these AI systems, which I think is really beneficial for industry,” Bauer-Kahan said.
Some labor and data privacy advocates worry that language in the proposed anti-discrimination legislation is too weak. Opponents say it’s too broad.
Chandler Morse, head of public policy at Workday, said the company supports AB 2930 as introduced. “We are currently evaluating our position on the new amendments,” Morse said.
Microsoft declined to comment.
The threat of AI is also a rallying cry for Hollywood unions. The Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists negotiated AI protections for their members during last year’s strikes, but the risks of the tech go beyond the scope of union contracts, said actors guild National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.
“We need public policy to catch up and to start putting these norms in place so that there is less of a Wild West kind of environment going on with AI,” Crabtree-Ireland said.
SAG-AFTRA has helped draft three federal bills related to deepfakes (misleading images and videos often involving celebrity likenesses), along with two measures in California, including AB 2602, that would strengthen worker control over use of their digital image. The legislation, if approved, would require that workers be represented by their union or legal counsel for agreements involving AI-generated likenesses to be legally binding.
Tech companies urge caution against overregulation. Todd O’Boyle, of the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said California AI companies may opt to move elsewhere if government oversight becomes overbearing. It’s important for legislators to “not let fears of speculative harms drive policymaking when we’ve got this transformative, technological innovation that stands to create so much prosperity in its earliest days,” he said.
When regulations are put in place, it’s hard to roll them back, warned Aaron Levie, chief executive of the Redwood City, California-based cloud computing company Box, which is incorporating AI into its products.
“We need to actually have more powerful models that do even more and are more capable,” Levie said, “and then let’s start to assess the risk incrementally from there.”
But Crabtree-Ireland said tech companies are trying to slow-roll regulation by making the issues seem more complicated than they are and by saying they need to be solved in one comprehensive public policy proposal.
“We reject that completely,” Crabtree-Ireland said. “We don’t think everything about AI has to be solved all at once.”

Africa stands at a pivotal moment to redefine the future of work with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), according to a whitepaper jointly authored by Microsoft and industry experts across the continent. 
With nearly one billion Africans under the age of 35, representing a substantial portion of the global youth workforce by the century’s turn, the potential for leveraging AI to drive economic growth and innovation is immense.
Ravi Bhat, Chief Technology and Solutions Officer at Microsoft Africa, emphasizes the transformative role of generative AI (GenAI) in not only reshaping work environments but also in creating new opportunities for youth employment and entrepreneurship across Africa.
The whitepaper highlights McKinsey research projecting that GenAI could boost annual labor productivity growth by up to 0.6% through 2040, contingent on widespread adoption and effective redeployment of worker time. Jacki O’Neill, Director at Microsoft Research Africa, underscores the democratizing impact of GenAI tools, now increasingly accessible through internet-enabled devices and affordable data plans.
Beyond enhancing traditional knowledge worker roles, GenAI holds promise for revolutionizing sectors such as agriculture and healthcare, provided that African youth are equipped with requisite skills to thrive in an AI-driven job market. Skills development spanning AI deployment, application development, and advanced research are crucial to harnessing AI’s potential while preserving indigenous knowledge and community-centric values.
Microsoft advocates for culturally sensitive AI design that respects privacy and promotes inclusivity, tailoring AI tools to empower entrepreneurs and enhance decision-making capabilities across diverse sectors, including the informal economy.
Effective governance, inclusive design practices, educational investment, and adherence to ethical standards are identified as essential prerequisites for realizing the full benefits of GenAI in Africa. Microsoft reaffirms its commitment to collaborating with governments, partners, and stakeholders to ensure responsible AI deployment that fosters dignified labor practices and sustainable economic development.
As Africa accelerates into an AI-enabled future, proactive adaptation of macroeconomic policies and regulatory frameworks is imperative to support positive societal transformation.

Live00:0001:3301:33 A new analysis conducted by researchers from Harvard Business School, the German Institute for Economic Research, Technische Universität Berlin, and Imperial College Business School highlights a significant change in the freelance job market. It concludes that the launch of ChatGPT has resulted in a 21 percent drop in job postings for writing and coding roles on a major freelance platform. The team examined data from a prominent global freelancing platform and compared it with Google Trends data. This thorough approach enabled them to draw conclusions about AI's impact on freelance jobs. Decline in Writing and Coding Jobs Researchers Ozge Demirci, Jonas Hannane, and Xinrong Zhu revealed a notable reduction in the demand for freelancers with skills in writing and coding. The study attributes this decline to advancements in generative AI such as ChatGPT, which can efficiently handle these tasks. They write: “Using data from a global freelancer platform, we quantify a 21% greater decline in demand for automation-prone jobs compared to manual-intensive jobs after ChatGPT introduction. Writing is the job category most affected by ChatGPT, followed by software, app and web development, and engineering.” Interestingly, the study shows that jobs requiring manual labor have remained steady. This indicates that while AI has taken over certain cognitive tasks, it has not yet made inroads into jobs that require physical skills. Impact of Image-Generating AI The rise of AI technologies that generate images has also influenced the market, causing a 17 percent decrease in job postings for image creation. This aspect further demonstrates AI's growing role in automating traditionally human-driven creative tasks, say the authors: “We also find a 17% more pronounced decrease in demand for graphic design and 3D  odeling jobs following the release of Image-generating AI technologies. Our findings also suggest that freelancers with certain skills may face more competition after the introduction of GenAI tools. Given the already intense competition for job opportunities in online labor markets […], the increased substitutability between freelancer jobs and GenAI could further decrease earnings in the short term.” The study's findings emphasize how generative AI is reshaping the freelancing landscape. Fields, where AI can replace human workers, are witnessing a significant reduction in job opportunities for freelancers. Other Research Henley Wing Chiu, an analyst at Bloomberry, reports similar findings regarding generative AI's impact on the freelance sector. He analyzed real freelancing positions on Upwork, the prominent freelance platform, from November 1, 2022—a month prior to the release of ChatGPT—until February 14, 2024, to determine which jobs have been most adversely affected. The 3 categories with the largest declines were writing, translation and customer service jobs. The # of writing jobs declined 33%, translation jobs declined 19%, and customer service jobs declined 16%. Outside of these 3-4 job categories, most of the other job categories were not negatively impacted. Source: Henley Wing Chiu / Bloomberry Regarding pay, there have also been substantial shifts since ChatGPT and other generative AI tools emerged. Translation jobs were the worst hit, with more than a 20% decrease in hourly rates, followed by video editing/production and market research. Graphic design and web design jobs were the most resilient. Both of them not only increased in volume but also increased in hourly pay a bit. Source: Henley Wing Chiu / Bloomberry Upwork: AI Skills in High Demand Research from Upwork also highlights the significant impact of generative AI on the freelance job market. According to an internal study, there has been a remarkable increase in job posts and searches related to generative AI on the platform. From Q1 to Q2 of 2023, job posts in this category surged by over 1000%, while related searches grew by more than 1500%. This indicates a growing recognition of the value and potential applications of generative AI among businesses. Key findings from the research include the top generative AI-related skills in demand, such as ChatGPT, BERT, Stable Diffusion, TensorFlow, and in general AI chatbots. The demand is not limited to specific tools but extends to comprehensive applications and services that utilize these technologies. This shift shows that businesses are moving beyond searching for singular AI tools to exploring broader applications and services that can enhance various aspects of their operations. Upwork has responded to this trend by launching a new AI Services Hub, which connects businesses with skilled AI professionals and offers tools like the AI-powered job post generator and enhanced chat features to streamline the hiring process. Additionally, Upwork has partnered with Jasper, a leading generative AI content generation platform, to provide freelancers with advanced tools that boost productivity and quality of work.
