Generative AI could re-shape how we experience the internet

Generative AI is being hailed as the next era-defining technological innovation, changing how we create new content online or even experience the internet, and in the process sparking a Silicon Valley frenzy.Is it possible for AI to achieve sentience? 52 ideas that changed the world: 26. Artificial intelligence AI will deepen divisions, say Yuval Noah Harari and Slavoj ZizekYet even as venture capitalists pump billions of dollars into AI tools such as Chat GPT, there is growing concern about their ethical and legal ramifications.What is generative AI?Put simply, generative AI is artificial intelligence that can generate new content, rather than simply analysing or acting on existing data.

Able to produce text and images, programme code, poetry, and artwork, Harvard Business Review said the software uses “complex machine-learning models to predict the next word based on previous word sequences, or the next image based on words describing previous images”.LATEST VIDEOS FROM theweekTheWeekThe most talked about field is text-to-image AI models, such as OpenAI’s DALL-E programme, which generate detailed original images based on simple written inputs.“The buzz around generative AI today is deafening,” said Forbes.The sudden emergence of generative AI technology has sparked a “frenzy” in Silicon Valley, said Forbes, with “no topic in the world of technology attracting more attention and hype right now.”Sign up for Today's Best Articles in your inboxA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.comContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Why the buzz around Chat GPT?Released less than two weeks ago by San Francisco-based Open AI, which was co-founded by Tesla billionaire Elon Musk in 2015, Chat GPT is already making huge waves in the technology sector with over a million regular users, according to CEO Sam Altman.A “stunningly lifelike conversational language system” designed to “answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests,” The Times described it as the “world’s first truly useful chatbot”.Based on natural language generation technology, it is “implemented in such a way that you just chat with it in a web browser as if you were slacking with a colleague or interacting with a customer support agent on a website”, reported TechCrunch.What are the real-world implications?Generative AI is already “revolutionising how we experience the internet and the world around us”, reported VentureBeat, highlighting the surge in global AI investment from $12.75 million in 2015 to $93.5 billion in 2021, with the market projected to reach $422.37 billion by 2028.Image-generating AI in particular will transform industries including advertising, gaming and filmmaking, while other models will help clinicians compose medical notes, further medical research and speed up novel drug development.It could also transform how the internet itself functions.Since Open AI opened its Chat GPT programme to the public last week, “the breathless predictions have come thick and fast”, said The Times.“This is ‘the death of Google’, predicted many. Why scroll through mountains of ads and useless results when you can just ask a question and then a system trained on the entire corpus of the English-language internet provides just that answer?” asked the paper.“The potential for something like OpenAI’s ChatGPT to eventually supplant a search engine like Google isn’t a new idea,” agreed Tech Crunch, “but this delivery of OpenAI’s underlying technology is the closest approximation yet to how that would actually work in a fully fleshed-out system, and it should have Google scared.”What are the downsides?“While this outlook might make it sound as if generative AI is the ‘silver bullet’ for pushing our global society forward,” said VentureBeat, “it comes with an important footnote: the ethical implications are not yet well defined. This is a severe problem that can inhibit continued growth and expansion.”“People can easily find themselves the target of AI-generated fake videos, explicit content and propaganda,” said the news site. “This raises concerns about privacy and consent. There is also a looming possibility that people will be out of work once AI can create content in their style with or without their permission.”According to Axios some see the emerging AI creation tools “as a threat to jobs or a legal minefield (or both)”.A prime example is the recent announcement that Shutterstock, one of the internet’s leading stock image companies, was partnering with OpenAI to launch a new tool that would integrate the generative AI DALL-E 2 into its online marketplace.“The announcement was a huge win for the still-burgeoning AI industry, but was met with shock and outrage by creatives all over the internet, many of whom see generative AI like DALL-E 2 as an existential threat to their livelihoods and the use of their images for machine learning as a form of theft,” said Fast Company.Highlighting these concerns, one anonymous Shutterstock photographer told Artnet News “it’s disappointing to know we have so little respect and it’s worrying to now be competing with bots for sales.”But others dismiss concerns that generative AI could eventually replace human labour as unnecessarily alarmist.“I think there are two choices in this world,” Shutterstock CEO Paul Hennessy said recently. “Be the blacksmiths that are saying, ‘Cars are going to put us out of the horseshoe-making business’, or be the technical leaders that bring people, maybe kicking and screaming, into the new world.”

Although it may be impressive from a technical standpoint, the idea of relying on a machine to have conversations and generate responses raises serious concerns.First and foremost, ChatGPT lacks the ability to truly understand the complexity of human language and conversation. It is simply trained to generate words based on a given input, but it does not have the ability to truly comprehend the meaning behind those words. This means that any responses it generates are likely to be shallow and lacking in depth and insight.Furthermore, the reliance on ChatGPT for conversation raises ethical concerns. If people begin to rely on a machine to have conversations for them, it could lead to a loss of genuine human connection. The ability to connect with others through conversation is a fundamental aspect of being human, and outsourcing that to a machine could have detrimental side effects on our society.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

The robots are coming, we've all seen the movies. At just 12 years of age, Will Smith's 2004 film I, Robot, was my first introduction to the potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence, and Hollywood has done its best to warn me ever since. Wall-E in 2008 was another - and a great film, might I add - but AI has always felt like science fiction, rather than science fact. This week, however, it feels like the robots are gaining strength. Artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT is gaining as much traction on Twitter as its eccentric owner, and it's got us worried. Why? I hear you ask… Well, sit down, plug in your batteries, and allow me to explain. Over the decades, we've seen robots - computing power, more specifically - revolutionise various industries. Way back, there was such a job as a Human Computer, whose role was to perform complex calculations - see 2016's Hidden Figures, a true story and another Hollywood warning shot. Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksCardiologists: Teaspoon On An Empty Stomach Slims Waist From 38 To 29Seeking Health NewsLearn MoreUndoMore recently, car factory lines have become largely automated, and we've all seen videos of Amazon's warehouse operatives beep-booping their way around while picking orders. LATEST VIDEOS FROM cyclingnewsCycling NewsChatGPT is an 'Open AI' website.

You can also - and here's the crux of our despair - ask it to write a product review, a race report, or, within reason, anything you like. You can even give it a word count.But can artificial intelligence seriously take my job? I obviously would rather it didn't, but I'm a fair person, so I thought I'd give it a chance. The results of this extremely scientific experiment is below. My prompts are in bold, ChatGPT's responses follow, and my analysis follows that. Review the Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Shakedry cycling jacket favourably, highlighting its packability and waterproof capabilities.Get The Leadout NewsletterThe latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Shakedry cycling jacket is a fantastic piece of kit for any cyclist looking to stay dry on their rides.

This means that the jacket is completely waterproof and breathable, without any need for a traditional waterproof membrane. This not only keeps you dry, but also reduces the weight of the jacket, making it perfect for those long, wet rides.The jacket itself is also extremely lightweight, making it easy to wear on even the hottest of days. The fit is also spot on, with a close, aerodynamic cut that won't catch the wind and slow you down.Overall, the Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Shakedry cycling jacket is a must-have for any serious cyclist looking to stay dry and comfortable on their rides. Its packability and waterproof capabilities make it an excellent choice for riders of all levels.--It had me in the first half, not going to lie. The mention of Shakedry as a technology was smart, and the reference to stuffing it in my jersey pocket was totally unprompted. However, the recommendation to wear it on ""even the hottest of days"" is where the robots trip up. That hiccup aside, though, I would have to agree with the final paragraph, it's an excellent choice, as I explained in my actual Rapha Shakedry review. This is fun, let's try a race report...Write a race report for the final stage of the 1989 Tour de France, highlighting Greg LeMond's use of aerodynamics and technology to snatch the race win from Laurent Fignon. The final stage of the 1989 Tour de France was an exciting and suspenseful one, as Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon went head to head in a battle for the yellow jersey.As the riders took to the streets of Paris, Fignon held a commanding 50-second lead over LeMond. However, LeMond was not deterred and was determined to make up the time deficit.One of the key factors in LeMond's strategy was his use of aerodynamics and technology. He rode a bike equipped with triathlon handlebars, which allowed him to tuck into a more aerodynamic position, reducing drag and increasing speed. He also wore a helmet with a long tail, which further reduced drag and increased his speed.As the riders made their way around the course, LeMond was able to make up significant time on Fignon. He was aided by a strong team effort, with his teammates working together to set a fast pace and help him make up the time.In the final stretch, LeMond was able to close the gap and even take the lead. He crossed the finish line just eight seconds ahead of Fignon, securing his victory in the 1989 Tour de France.LeMond's use of aerodynamics and technology was crucial in his victory, allowing him to overcome the time deficit and snatch the race win from Fignon. It was a thrilling and historic win, and one that will be remembered for years to come.--""That's quite a lot scary,"" replied my colleague, when I shared this just now. Apart from that one sentence - ""his teammates working together to set a fast pace and help him make up the time"" - this is pretty spot on. With that said, the 1989 Tour finale is one of the most documented races in history, and my prompt was pretty detailed, but it's impressive nonetheless.Now let's try it on something a little more niche: Stage 3 of the 2022 Critérium du Dauphiné - a race I just plucked from the skynet. Write a race report for stage 3 of the 2022 Critérium du DauphinéStage 3 of the 2022 Critérium du Dauphiné was a challenging day for the riders, with a hilly course and a summit finish at the Col de la Croix de Fer.The early breakaway consisted of three riders, with Marco Canola, Julien Bernard, and Simon Geschke building up a lead of over three minutes. However, the peloton was determined to bring them back, and with 30 kilometers to go, the gap had been reduced to just over a minute.As the leaders approached the final climb, Canola attacked, dropping Bernard and Geschke. He managed to hold onto his lead for a few kilometers, but the peloton was closing in fast.In the final kilometers, the attacks started coming from the peloton, with several riders trying to break away. But it was ultimately Thibaut Pinot who emerged as the strongest, launching a solo attack with 5 kilometers to go and holding off the chase to take the stage victory.Behind him, the battle for the overall lead heated up, with several riders making their move on the steep slopes of the Col de la Croix de Fer. In the end, it was defending champion Egan Bernal who emerged as the leader, taking the yellow jersey from previous leader Romain Bardet.Overall, it was a thrilling stage that set the stage for a thrilling final few days of racing at the Critérium du Dauphiné.--At first, I panicked. I will admit, in plucking this race from thin air, I had no idea who actually won this stage. However, as I read on, I came to realise that this was a totally made-up series of events. Good try ChatGPT, but you can't fool me! As real cycling reporters will all know, Egan Bernal has spent the majority of this season recovering from pretty significant injuries, and Thibaut Pinot was elsewhere racing at the Tour de Suisse. For those who care, it was actually Pinot's teammate and fellow Frenchman, David Gaudu, who took the stage. My race-team colleagues are safe, then. So let's turn back to tech and try to cement my employment for at least a few more months. Explain the difference between road bikes and gravel bikesRoad bikes and gravel bikes are both designed for use on paved roads, but there are some key differences between the two.Road bikes are built for speed and efficiency on smooth, paved surfaces. They typically have a lightweight frame, narrow tires, and a dropped handlebar to allow for a more aerodynamic riding position. Road bikes are ideal for racing and long distance riding on smooth roads.Gravel bikes, on the other hand, are designed for off-road adventures and have a more durable frame and wider tires to handle rougher terrain. They also have a more upright riding position and often have additional features such as mounting points for water bottles and racks. Gravel bikes are ideal for exploring dirt roads and trails, and can also be used on paved roads.Overall, the main difference between road bikes and gravel bikes is the type of terrain they are designed for. Road bikes are built for speed and efficiency on smooth roads, while gravel bikes are built for durability and versatility on a variety of terrain.Skynet has become self-aware.

Event highlights 13 December 2022Takeaways: Understanding users to plan servicesThe key takeaways of the meeting were that big data and artificial intelligence (AI) tools can help us better understand users of mental health services, including what they need and what questions they are asking – flagging those who may be at
    risk for developing a mental health condition through the use of electronic health records and social media data.“If big private companies and organizations can create AI-assisted ads to target people who have been to their website once, why can’t we do the same when someone searches in TikTok about mental health, like ‘how do I help my depression
    or anxiety?’,” said Ben Ogden, social media manager and mental health advocate, who opened the meeting with a powerful story of the potential for AI tools to connect people who need mental health services with those who provide them.One of the main challenges facing the field is digital exclusion, including ensuring people who lack access to digital technologies or the ability to use them (called “digital literacy”) do not fall through the cracks. This means creating
    AI tools with the involvement of people living with mental health conditions from the beginning.“Digital inequalities are the same as social inequalities,” said Dr Joseph Tay Wee Teck, Clinical Director of Forward Leeds. WHO/Europe is planning further work in this area, including publishing a systematic review on the use of AI models for research on mental health, which will be published in 2023.Event notice7 December 2022 WHO/Europe is holding a 1-day hybrid meeting on 7 December focusing on innovations related to Big Data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of mental health. The meeting aims to provide an opportunity to discuss how health policy-makers
    can make use of these tools to better allocate resources and predict mental health conditions in populations.The event seeks to bring together professionals working with mental health data and health information systems and on policy-making, with a goal of exploring how to improve existing mental health data using emerging Big Data analytics and AI-powered tools
    and providing a forum for the exchange of ideas and country experiences on implementing these tools in decision-making.AI-assisted mental health reformThe mental health and well-being of the WHO European Region has been hit hard by several large-scale public health emergencies over the past few years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and an increasing cost-of-living crisis. While mental health services have attempted to adapt to the increased demand, they remain deprioritized and under-resourced, preventing many from getting the help they need. AI and Big Data analytics are seen as novel tools in the planning of mental health services as well as identifying and monitoring mental health problems in individuals and populations. AI-driven tools can harness readily available, real-time data –
    such as that generated through social media and electronic health records – to effectively plan and allocate resources for mental health services, identify and prevent misinformation related to public health concerns, develop targeted communications
    to promote behaviour change and predict and intervene early in mental ill health. A key objective of the meeting is to clarify and guide the use of Big Data and AI in mental health to ensure that countries are implementing these technologies in a safe and effective manner. The use of publicly available data, such as that collected
    by social media enterprises (so called “Big Data”) raises significant ethical issues related to privacy and discrimination, particularly in the context of predicting and identifying those who may be at risk of developing mental health
    conditions. Moreover, the sensitive management of health data cannot be carried out without sufficient digital health literacy among the people using that data.Participants will have the opportunity to discuss case studies across Member States on the use of data from social media and electronic health records for planning mental health services and how this may shape the future of such services.European Programme of Work in actionDigital health and mental health are 2 of the 4 flagships under the European Programme of Work 2020–2025, acting as “accelerators of change”, increasing focus on critical issues that can be transformative to health. This past September,
    WHO/Europe unveiled an action plan for digital health that was resoundingly endorsed by Member States at the 72nd session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe. The Pan-European Mental Health Coalition, launched by WHO/Europe in 2021, brings together
    influential stakeholders to mobilize investment in mental health and works with individuals and communities to transform societal attitudes about mental health.Registration for this event is now closed.

Artificial intelligence (AI) engineers are in charge of developing intelligent algorithms capable of learning, analyzing and predicting future events, turning those algorithms into AI models and systems, and then testing and maintaining them.
What Is An AI Engineer?An artificial intelligence engineer develops, implements, tests and maintains an organization’s AI applications and systems. This requires not only a deep working knowledge of the artificial intelligence space, but also programming and statistics.
We encounter the work of AI engineers every time we use Netflix, Spotify or YouTube, when machine learning customizes suggestions based on past behavior. Or when we’re able to have productive conversations with a chatbot or AI voice assistant. AI engineers develop a lot of company-facing products as well, helping them increase their efficiency and profits, cut costs and make more informed business decisions.
Tariq Haque works as an AI engineer at CVS Health, where he helps the company make more informed decisions about their customers and interact with them more efficiently.
“For example, I want to identify what my customer would like to buy. I cannot do it manually,” Haque told Built In. “That’s where AI comes in. It will run all those complex calculations and do it for me and identify what the customer wants, and I can deliver that to the customer.”
Meanwhile, Gayatri Shandar, a software engineer focusing on AI at LinkedIn, mainly works on the site’s advertising AI, which essentially allows LinkedIn to continue showing users ads that are relevant to them despite the privacy and transparency constraints imposed by Apple, Google and others. Before LinkedIn, she was a machine learning engineer at Peloton, where she worked on the company’s recommender system, providing suggestions for which classes users should sign up for based on their instructor preferences, fitness level and so on.
“We do a bit of data science, we do a bit of engineering, and — depending on the company you work for and the size of the company — we also do a little bit of product, doing stack for new features and talking to product managers and other stakeholders as well in getting that feature up and running,” Shandar told Built In. “[AI engineers] wear a lot of hats.”
Check Out These Open RolesAI Engineer Job Postings 
The Responsibilities of an AI Engineer
AI engineers play an important role in organizations that rely on artificial intelligence. They are responsible for not only identifying problems that could be solved using AI, but they’re also in charge of the development and production of AI systems, as well as implementing them. 
Some specific tasks include creating and managing the development and production of an AI infrastructure, conducting statistical analyses and interpreting the results in order to guide future decisions, building AI models from scratch and helping product managers and other teams implement and analyze them, and transforming machine learning models into specific applications.

Data Wrangling and Preparation 
Day to day, Shandar said AI engineers are responsible for doing a lot of data wrangling, or making sure that the data being fed to the models is correct and what is expected, as well as finding ways to better store, prepare, extract, transform and load that data. 
 
Model Adjustment and Problem-Solving
AI engineers are also tasked with figuring out which modeling techniques work for the given problem they want to solve, whether that be machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision and so on.
 
Programming and Software Development
Haque said most of his time working as an AI engineer at CVS Health involves just good, old-fashioned programming. It’s a lot of building software, testing, deploying, testing it again and going back to refine it. In the end, he and his team come out with products that have proven to be massively beneficial to the company.
 
Focused Machine Learning Research and Analysis
Not all AI engineers are responsible for improving a company’s efficiency, though. Kulsoom Abdullah, an AI engineer at Duke University Health Systems’ Bashir Lab is more interested in furthering medical research and diagnostics — specifically by applying deep learning technology to the analysis of medical images. Because Abdullah works in academia, her role as an AI engineer looks different from those working in the corporate world. She’s not a professor or postdoctoral fellow, so the work she’s doing has an application as opposed to just pure research. But the audience for the work she does is smaller than what it likely would be were she working at an industry level.
“You have more time in academia to work on something,” she told Built In. “In industry, because of it being more on a quarter kind of system, and you have your stakeholders and business units, you do have to spend a certain amount of your time on things that are going to provide, say, immediate value.”

AI Engineer vs. Data Scientist
AI Engineer vs. Data ScientistAI engineer: builds AI systems and tools to apply data insights without human intervention.
Data scientist: collects and analyzes data to find insights, plus sometimes builds AI models to help make predictions.

Before Duke University, Abdullah worked as a data scientist at companies like Anthem and ADP, and she says there is “a lot of overlap” between AI engineers and positions like data engineers and data scientists. In some cases, the work of a data scientist at one company could be the work of an AI engineer at another.
There are some key differences, however. Data scientists handle the data collection, analysis and visualization, then sometimes build models off of what they find. AI engineers design and build AI systems and products, among other things.
For instance, a data scientist may be able to figure out what perfume a 25-year-old woman living in New York City and making $70,000 a year would be more likely to buy. And an AI engineer will use that information to create an automated product or a tool to put those insights into action without the need for human intervention, like a shopping suggestion tool or a targeted email marketing campaign.
Andrew Seligson, an AI engineer at Entanglement, a quantum computing and AI startup focused on cyber threat detection, describes the work of AI engineers as a kind of “outgrowth” of what data scientists have been doing for the last five or 10 years.
“There’s been kind of a seachange in the growth of data science and data engineering roles,” he told Built In. “What that means is that AI engineers sort of have to have a pretty broad skill set. … Someone who is able to work across a lot of the different domains of the data science, engineering, AI and ML space.”

Important Skills for AI Engineers
AI Engineer Required SkillsArtificial intelligence knowledgeProgrammingMath, statistics and probabilityCommunicationCritical thinking
 
Software Engineering and Programming Skills
While a comprehensive and firm knowledge of the various facets of artificial intelligence is important as an AI engineer, software engineering skills are also essential. Python, R, Java and C++ are among the most used languages in this space. 
 
Math and Statistics Skills
Statistics and probability are also important components of AI engineering, since machine learning models are based on mathematical principles. Plus, a firm grasp on concepts like statistical significance helps if an AI engineer needs to determine the validity and accuracy of a given model.
 
Problem Solving, Communication and Critical Thinking Skills
Being an AI engineer also requires some soft skills, particularly as it relates to problem solving, communication and critical thinking. Seligson, whose educational background is in musical composition and religious studies, says he often has to lean on his non-technical background as an AI engineer at Entanglement, particularly when it comes to communication.
“Engineers respect good technical work, and being able to articulate yourself as a technician in ways that are clear, concise [and] logical,” Seligson said. “I’ve found that a lot of my old skills didn’t necessarily have to get thrown out the window just because I was working in STEM.”

AI Engineer Education Requirements  
With technical knowledge like programming and data handling needed for the role, several AI engineer positions require earning a bachelor’s degree in the fields of computer science, data science or information technology. Those looking for positions with higher seniority or that tackle niche machine learning projects can also benefit from earning a master’s degree in artificial intelligence or another relevant discipline.
While some AI engineers commonly have collegiate backgrounds in computer science and software engineering, that isn’t necessarily a prerequisite for landing a job in this field. Candidates can also find an education through accelerated bootcamps or training courses, or even through developing personal projects that can flex their AI expertise.
 
How to Become an AI Engineer
Becoming a successful AI engineer really comes down to an individual person’s willingness to learn, their passion for the industry and the opportunities they create for themselves.
Tips for Becoming an AI EngineerLearn the technical skills requiredFind a mentor to help narrow your interestsLearn through experience
 
Learn the Technical Skills Required
Working as an AI engineer requires quite a bit of technical know-how, particularly when it comes to programming and mathematics, as well as AI algorithms and how to implement them with frameworks. Common machine learning algorithms include linear regression and decision trees, while common deep learning algorithms include recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Some common AI frameworks include Theano, TensorFlow and PyTorch. 
“I think the most important thing is self-learning because nobody is going to teach you all of this,” CVS Health’s Haque said. “Anybody who has done high school and has good programming [skills] can start.”
There are tons of educational resources available online on sites like Codecademy, Simplilearn and even here on Built In. Of course, keeping up to date with the ways AI is evolving is vital, but knowing the fundamentals is just as important.
“If you know the fundamentals as everything keeps changing,” Abdullah, of Duke University, said you’ll still be able to understand what’s going on.”

Find a Mentor to Help Narrow Your Interests
Learning the ins and outs of AI on one’s own can get “overwhelming,” Abdullah said, especially if you’re in the really early stages of career development and want to narrow your interests down. She suggests finding a mentor who actively works in the industry, so they can give you a clear idea of what working in the space is actually like, and even help narrow down an area of focus.
Once your area of interest is narrowed a bit more, prioritize learning the specific tools or technology required. That way, you can avoid getting too overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the artificial intelligence space.
 
Learn Through Experience
The next step toward establishing a career in AI engineering is striking a balance between “the learning part and the doing part,” Abdullah said. It’s great to continue learning, but a textbook or class can only teach you so much. Sometimes, the best way to learn and get comfortable with this technology is to jump into it and experiment.
“It’s one thing to have talent or problem-solving ability. Even if you have all that, you still need to get a lot of repetitions as an engineer in order to notice and kind of evaluate,” Seligson said, likening it to playing a sport. “Even if you’re really fast or really tall or really strong, if you don’t know how to play and if you haven’t seen the field a lot, you might go out there and fumble the ball the first few times. But the more you’re out there, the more you realize, ‘OK, this is kind of the flow of the game.’”
Want a Career in Machine Learning?Here’s What You Need to Know 
Benefits of Being an AI Engineer
Working as an AI engineer can be quite a rewarding career. And there are lots of reasons to enjoy the work it entails. Artificial intelligence is at the forefront of virtually every company’s growth strategy, so the folks working behind the scenes of this technology can have a real impact — both technologically and financially.
“The gratifying part about the job is being able to say, ‘Hey, I made a change to this model and it had a tangible revenue impact,’” Shandar said, adding that, in the work she does with LinkedIn’s ads, the changes she makes have the potential to make the company hundreds of thousands of dollars.
 
Challenges of Being an AI Engineer
That’s not to say that this technology is any walk in the park, though. AI technology is constantly evolving and gaining complexity. And while working with something so experimental and new can be exciting and rewarding, it can also be challenging.
AI Engineering ChallengesBuilding an AI model can be time-consuming and tedious, and can end in failure.Sometimes there’s a disconnect between the lofty goals of managers and executives, and what their AI engineers are actually capable of doing given the time constraints and resources available.Artificial intelligence tends to be misunderstood, and its capabilities can be overestimated.If an organization has low-quality data, AI engineers have to do a lot more work to massage the data to make it compatible with a model.
“You will spend a lot of time running experiments, poring over models, and sometimes these experiments fail. Or sometimes it feels like you have nothing to show for it because you tried a bunch of things and they didn’t work the way you wanted them to,” Shandar continued. “Sometimes it gets frustrating.”
And because artificial intelligence requires quite a bit of expertise and know-how, there can sometimes be a disconnect between AI engineers and the people in charge. Generally, engineers rely on guidelines for the work they’re doing so that they have a concrete goal or mission for the otherwise very technical work that they do. For instance, if a system must be able to sort through 50 million data points in a certain amount of seconds with a certain amount of accuracy.
Managers and executives focus on what the goal is and what a given product will provide to the larger market. Meanwhile, engineers focus more on “OK, how do we actually do that thing?” Seligson explained. “Managers and executives can expect kind of crazy things from what they call and think of as AI, wherein it can’t really do those things with the resources that they allocate.”
Not every business function or problem requires artificial intelligence. Shandar says she’s been asked “many times” over the course of her career to implement machine learning solutions for things that don’t necessarily need machine learning. Instead, she suggests starting with a “solid statistical foundation” — something simple, and rules-based — and then going from there. This provides more of an understanding of the data, which is crucial if you eventually want to build a machine learning model that actually serves its purpose.
“[People] think that, if they have data, they can just throw it into a machine learning model, and it’s going to work, and you’re going to have millions of dollars. But you need to really understand your data,” Shandar said. “A lot of people try to build production machine learning models with, pardon my French, shitty data. Or data that comes in every six months, or is poorly annotated, or is filled with zeros or a lot of missing values. Or just straight up in formats that are not amenable to machine learning.” 
This creates more work for the AI engineers, who then have to massage the data in order to get it compatible with a machine learning model.

AI Engineer Compensation and Job Outlook
AI engineers receive an average salary range of $99,000 to $167,000 in the United States as of 2023, according to Glassdoor. 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics also notes that computer and information research scientist roles, which include AI engineers, saw an annual median wage of over $131,000 as of 2021. With this same job area projected to grow 21 percent by 2031, AI engineers can expect to see healthy financial compensation and job growth over the next decade. 
 
The Future of AI Engineering
It’s important to remember the space that this job exists in. Just as artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and expanding, so too are the job descriptions of the people who work with this technology.
Consider all of the advancements made in AI within just the decade: virtual home smart devices, self-driving cars, facial recognition robots, ChatGPT, the list goes on. In just a few short years, artificial intelligence has revolutionized everything from healthcare to manufacturing to manufacturing to art.

“I definitely don’t think it’ll look the same, because it didn’t look the same five years ago.”

Looking ahead, the tech industry will continue to push the boundaries of what artificial intelligence is capable of, which will inevitably redefine the daily work of AI engineers — particularly when it comes to matters of bias and privacy, which are growing concerns with this technology. 
“AI is as good as we make it. And if we are not thoughtful or conscientious about how we make our models, then our AI will be just as unfair and unjust as we are,” Shandar said. “I definitely don’t think it’ll look the same, because it didn’t look the same five years ago.”
As for exactly how much change occurs, Seligson says it’s a question of “revolutionary versus evolutionary change.”
“I don’t think we’re going to necessarily see a huge revolutionary change in the way people do AI,” he said. But he does think the realities of what it means to be an AI engineer will change in the next few years, particularly as things like automated AI and machine learning become more prevalent. “Evolutionary changes end up kind of revolutionizing in the long term.”
But no matter what direction AI takes us in the next five years, 10 years and beyond, AI engineers are going to be right at the center of it.
“It’s cutting edge, it’s impactful, it’s so cool,” Haque said. “I feel extremely powerful, in a positive way, about how I can change my and others’ lives with it.”

Selfies?Images generated with Lensa AI are all over social media, but at what cost?Share full articleRead in appLensa AI, a popular iPhone app, uses your selfies and artificial intelligence to create portraits in a variety of styles.Credit...Lensa AIBy Madison Malone Kircher and Callie HoltermannDec. 7, 2022Have you noticed that many of your friends are suddenly fairy princesses or space travelers? Is your Instagram feed overrun with Renaissance-style paintings of people who were definitely born in the ’90s? If so, you are entitled to an explanation of what exactly is going on here (and it’s not time travel).In the past week, users have flocked to Lensa AI, an app that uses your selfies and artificial intelligence to create portraits in a variety of styles. Created by the company Prisma Labs, the app is generating images — and controversy.What is Lensa AI?Even if you haven’t heard of Lensa AI, you’ve possibly seen its work this week. As of Wednesday, it was the most popular iPhone app in the United States in Apple’s app store. Lensa takes your selfies, studies them and churns out original, computer-generated portraits of you — or anyone whose photos you feed it.Do I have to pay for it?You do. Right now, you can get 50 avatars — 10 images in five styles — for $3.99 during a one-week trial period. (For $35.99 you can subscribe to Lensa AI for the year, which gets you a 51 percent discount on future avatars.) “Magic Avatars consume tremendous computation power to create amazing avatars for you,” according to Lensa’s checkout page. “It’s expensive, but we made it as affordable as possible.” Fair warning: Prices have been fluctuating as the app has gotten more and more popular and may have changed since this article was published.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow does it work?After downloading the app, you’ll upload a bunch of selfies. (Do yourself a favor and don’t include any where your hands are touching your face unless you want to pay money to get back a mess of images with phantom phalanges hanging from your mouth.) Select a gender — male, female or other — and walk away from your phone for around half an hour, and when you return, presto. Your face, or something like it, has been stretched and squeezed across a suite of 50 to 200 — depending on what package you purchase — A.I.-generated images with themes including “cosmic,” “fairy princess” and “anime.”OK, but how does it really work?Lensa uses Stable Diffusion, which is when all the horses in a barn spread out to give each other a little space. Just kidding: Stable Diffusion is a “really powerful” A.I.-based image generator, said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University. Similar to DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, Stable Diffusion uses image prompts (like your selfies) and text prompts (like “fantasy,” one of Lensa AI’s categories) to generate high-quality images that sometimes get “trippy,” Dr. Kambhampati said. “It’s showing you pictures that nobody took; it’s just able to stitch them up from all the other images that it has seen.”Cool.It is cool! It’s fun to see yourself rendered as a painting or an anime character or a little woodland elf with eyes of two very different sizes and only one hand, even if you have two IRL. (Not every image is going to be perfect.) Some users, particularly transgender and gender-nonconforming people, are even finding that using Lensa to create can offer a sense of gender euphoria.I think some people are mad about this? Should I be mad about this, too?There are a couple of reasons that some users are bristling at the images Lensa AI is spitting out. The first is that many users are reporting that the art is sexualizing them. When we tested the app, several of the images we received after uploading selfies and selecting “female” included full-body renderings, despite the fact that users are specifically instructed to upload only close-up selfies. One image featured our avatar in a metallic bikini à la Princess Leia in “Return of the Jedi.” Another included only half a face atop a scantily clad body.ImageOne of the images the Lensa AI app generated during a test by The Times depicted half of a face atop a scantily clad body.Credit...Lensa AIPrisma Labs states on its F.A.Q. page that “occasional sexualization is observed across all gender categories.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThus, it’s fairly simple to use the app to create lewd images of anyone you want. This week, Tech Crunch was able to create topless avatars of celebrities using images of an actor’s head edited onto topless bodies. “It turns out the AI takes those Photoshopped images as permission to go wild, and it appears it disables an NSFW filter,” Tech Crunch reported. Now imagine that same experiment, but through the lens of someone who is angling to make revenge porn. It gets murky in a hurry.Andrey Usoltsev, Prisma Labs’ chief executive and co-founder, told TechCrunch that using Lensa AI to engage in “harmful or harassing behavior” was a breach of its terms of use.What are users saying about the app?Yasemin Anders, 29, decided to use Lensa AI after seeing it on social media and was particularly excited to see herself recreated into an ethereal fairy.She was, however, ultimately disappointed to see that Lensa had given her a thinner body and a slimmer face and neck. “If it’s smart enough to turn you into either a fairy or a manga figure, you would think there was some sort of smart enough software behind it to detect fat people, too,” said Mx. Anders, who lives in Berlin and works in marketing.“Even if I imagine myself as a fairy, as like an idealized fantasy version of myself, I would still want to look like myself,” she added. “And I have always been fat. I’ve been a fat kid. I’ve been a fat teenager, and I’m a fat adult now. So why would I want to imagine an ideal version of me that doesn’t even look like me?”Other users are reporting that the app is making their skin appear lighter or whiter and is markedly altering their facial features, which Dr. Kambhampati said was an ongoing issue with generative A.I. tools, including Snapchat’s face lenses. “If most of the images you fed the system were of white faces, then it’s not surprising that when it tries to make an image that looks supposedly ‘better,’ it just makes it whiter,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHow do artists feel about Lensa?Stable Diffusion was trained on the creations of many artists who did not explicitly consent to the use of their work for Prisma Labs’s profit, Dr. Kambhampati said, adding, “If van Gogh was alive today, you’d probably need to pay van Gogh some licensing fee to make your pictures be in van Gogh’s style.” That is not what has happened here.“To a lot of people, having our art stolen, they don’t view it as anything personal — like, ‘Oh, well, you know, it’s just a style; you can’t copyright a style,’” said Jonathan Lam, a storyboard artist who works in video games and animation. “But I would argue that for us, our style is actually our identity. It’s is what sets us apart from each other. It’s what makes us marketable to clients.” Mr. Lam, who lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, is one of many artists who have since spoken out on social media about the app.ImageOne photo generated by Lensa AI appeared to include artists’ signatures. Credit...Lensa AIHe also noted that some of the works being generated by Lensa include what appear to be renderings of artists’ signatures. (Several of our own Lensa-generated images had scribbles where a signature might go on an IRL painting.) “All these tech enthusiasts are saying that these generators are creating something new, but if the artist’s signature is still there, it’s not something new,” Mr. Lam said. “It’s just generating something based on the data it was fed.”“I think the general public is under the assumption that it is a program that has just learned to draw by itself in a vacuum, and they don’t realize the greater implication of the exploitation of data,” he added. “When you’re starting to see these things becoming monetized and real people being exploited and abused, it’s quite scary. And it’s even scarier when it’s disguised as a pretty application.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHas Prisma Labs responded to these concerns?Prisma Labs wrote in a Twitter thread that A.I. “will not replace digital artists” and pushed back against the characterization that Lensa was ripping off artists’ work. “The AI learns to recognize the connections between the images and their descriptions, not the artworks,” the company wrote. “As cinema didn’t kill theater and accounting software hasn’t eradicated the profession, AI won’t replace artists but can become a great assisting tool.”Are there any privacy concerns?“I doubt that the whole business model is, ‘Give us $10 or $15 and we’ll send you back an A.I. glam shot,’” said Jen King, the privacy and data policy fellow at the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University. Lensa AI’s privacy policy claims that “face data” is deleted within 24 hours after it has been processed and is not used to identify any individual user — but it also states that your photos and videos can be used to further train Lensa’s algorithms. Would Dr. King use Lensa AI? “No.”It Happened Online is a column in which we explain very particular bits of news enabled and amplified by social media.Madison Malone Kircher is a reporter for The Times. She writes about the internet for the Styles desk.

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other automated decision-making tools in recruitment is on the rise among Australian organisations. However, research shows these tools may be unreliable and discriminatory, and in some cases rely on discredited science. 
At present, Australia has no specific laws to regulate how these tools operate or how organisations may use them. 
The closest thing we have is new guidance for employers in the public sector, issued by the Merit Protection Commissioner after overturning several automated promotion decisions.  
A first step
The commissioner reviews promotion decisions in the Australian public sector to make sure they are lawful, fair and reasonable. In the 2021-22 financial year, Commissioner Linda Waugh overturned 11 promotion decisions made by government agency Services Australia in a single recruitment round. 
These decisions were made using a new automated process that required applicants to pass through a sequence of AI assessments, including psychometric testing, questionnaires and self-recorded video responses. The commissioner found this process, which involved no human decision-making or review, led to meritorious applicants missing out on promotions.

      Algorithms can decide your marks, your work prospects and your financial security. How do you know they're fair?




The commissioner has now issued guidance material for Australian government departments on how to choose and use AI recruitment tools. 
This is the first official guidance given to employers in Australia. It warns that not all AI recruitment tools on the market here have been thoroughly tested, nor are they guaranteed to be completely unbiased.
AI recruitment tools risky and unregulated
AI tools are used to automate or assist recruiters with sourcing, screening and onboarding job applicants. By one estimate, more than 250 commercial AI recruitment tools are available in Australia, including CV screening and video assessment. 
A recent survey by researchers at Monash University and the Diversity Council of Australia found one in three Australian organisations have used AI in recruitment recently.
The use of AI recruitment tools is a “high risk” activity. By affecting decisions related to employment, these tools may impact the human rights of job seekers and risk locking disadvantaged groups out of employment opportunities. 
Australia has no specific legislation regulating the use of these tools. Australia’s Department of Industry has published AI Ethics Principles, but these are not legally binding. Existing laws, such as the Privacy Act and anti-discrimination legislation, are in urgent need of reform.
Unreliable and discriminatory?
AI recruitment tools involve new and developing technologies. They may be unreliable and there are well-publicised examples of discrimination against historically disadvantaged groups.  
AI recruitment tools may discriminate against these groups when their members are missing from the datasets on which AI is trained, or when discriminatory structures, practices or attitudes are transmitted to these tools in their development or deployment. 
There is currently no standard test that identifies when an AI recruitment tool is discriminatory. Further, as these tools are often made outside Australia, they are not attuned to Australian law or demographics. For example, it is very likely training datasets do not include Australia’s First Nations peoples.
Lack of safeguards
AI recruitment tools used by and on behalf of employers in Australia lack adequate safeguards. 
Human rights risk and impact assessments are not required prior to deployment.  Monitoring and evaluation once they are in use may not occur. Job seekers lack meaningful opportunities to provide input on their use. 
While the vendors of these tools may conduct internal testing and auditing, the results are often not publicly available. Independent external auditing is rare.
Power imbalance
Job seekers are at a considerable disadvantage when employers use these tools.  They may be invisible and inscrutable, and they are changing hiring practices in ways that are not well understood.  
Job seekers have no legal right to be told when AI is used to assess them in the hiring process. Nor are they required to be given an explanation of how an AI recruitment tool will assess them.

      Artificial intelligence can deepen social inequality. Here are 5 ways to help prevent this




My research has found this is particularly problematic for job seekers with disabilities. For example, job seekers with low vision or limited manual dexterity may not know they will be assessed on the speed of their responses until it is too late.
Job seekers in Australia also lack the protection available to their counterparts in the European Union, who have the right not to be subjected to a fully automated recruitment decision.
Facial analysis
The use of video assessment tools, like those used by Services Australia, is particularly concerning. Many of these AI tools rely on facial analysis, which uses facial features and movements to infer behavioural, emotional and character traits.  
This type of analysis has been scientifically discredited. 
One prominent vendor, HireVue, ceased the use of facial analysis in its AI tool after a formal complaint in the United States.
What’s next?
The Services Australia example highlights the urgent need for a regulatory response. The Australian government is currently consulting on the regulation of AI and automated decision-making.  
We can hope that new regulations will address the many issues with the use of AI tools in recruitment. Until legal protections are in place, it might be best to hold off on the use of these tools to screen job seekers.

Correction: an earlier version of this article suggested HireVue was forced to stop using facial analysis as a result of a complaint filed against them. This has been amended.

	It took exactly three days for someone to resurrect beloved Korean artist Kim Jung Gi after his death in early October at the age of 47. Not in flesh and blood, of course, but in code through the use of an AI image generator. 

	By October 6, a former French game developer known online as 5you announced that he had released a tool, based on popular open-source AI image generator Stable Diffusion, that could generate images in Kim’s iconic style with a text prompt. 5you described the tool as an “hommage [sic]” and encouraged users to “feel free to use it” so long as they “credit plz.”

	Manga, anime, and comic book artists were universally outraged, with 5you telling Rest of World that he had received death threats from Kim’s fans and fellow artists. Some denounced the move as a tasteless ploy for publicity; others, meanwhile, read it as a premonition of the dystopian future that lay ahead—“they won’t let people die, they’ll work forever” read one popular comment on a TikTok. For many, 5you’s request for credit echoed a long line of white creators appropriating and then benefitting from Asian art styles.



	But the controversy illuminates a truth long held by technology ethicists: New technology is not ideologically neutral; these tools latch onto and aggravate existing structural inequalities. Image generators like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and others are poised to do the same, creating new avenues of exploitation while also reinforcing our existing biases. 

	While all artists stand to lose from AI, the Kim Jung Gi bot reveals how Asian artists in particular — long racialized as the robotic Other — are uniquely vulnerable to these tools as well as a new form of technologically-inflected Orientalism.

		The Old and the New Orientalism	








In the early 1900s, many advertisements, like these from New York based Murad cigarettes, incorporated Orientalist motifs or models dressed in Middle Eastern dress.

	Historically, Orientalism in Western art was motivated by a vision of Asia as an archaic, traditionalist alternative to Europe— prone to barbarism, yet in contact with a mystic essence lost to those in modernity. 

	During the early period of Orientalism — typically considered the 18th and 19th centuries — it wasn’t uncommon for artists to adopt the styles and signifiers of these cultures from clothing and decor to artistic practices like printmaking, in the hopes of imbuing their work with a kind of exotic authenticity. 



	In the post-World War II era, however, Asia became an increasingly dominant player in the global economy and in the development of technology. The notion of Eastern backwardness could no longer hold in the face of its growing influence, and so a new myth arose to rationalize the superiority of the Western subject while making sense of this global reconfiguration. Asian peoples began to be depicted in the media as essentially robotic— automata capable of fine-tuned execution and coordination, but lacking the sort of individual creativity and spirit that defined the Western subject. 

	As the theorist Wendy Hui Kyong Chun wrote in her 2019 study on “High-Tech Orientalism,” these depictions protected whiteness’ hegemony over the human by “jettisoning… the Asian/Asian American as robotic, as machine-like,” while explaining Asia’s technological proficiency in dehumanizing terms that justified their continued exploitation.

	This framework has since been dubbed “techno-Orientalism,” where the traditional and premodern imagery that once stereotyped Asia is replaced by “hyper technological terms,” as the editors of an essay collection on the subject note. In this formulation, Asian people are racialized using the language of machines, as industrious, hard-working, and functionally competent, yet hollow and lacking personality, while their art is rendered “soulless and mechanical.” 

	Techno-Orientalist stereotypes have become commonplace in mainstream media, from Hollywood blockbuster films like Blade Runner, with its Tokyo inspired cityscapes and Asian holograms, to musicians like Grimes, who frequently draws on Asian iconography in her flirtations with technoscapes, to video games like 2022’s Stray, which depicts a thinly disguised Kowloon Walled City populated solely by robots. White creators in nearly every medium have and continue to use Asianness to symbolize robotic futurity, and vice versa.

		The Logical End of Techno-Orientalism

	5You’s model simulating Kim Jung Gi and his art style is just the latest evolution in this twisted association between Asian bodies and roboticism. Finally, the Asian artist, long racialized as mechanistic, is reproduced via technology. The Asian artist is fully realized as a machine, thrust into the public as a product to be exploited and consumed. It’s not just their art, but the artists themselves that are now appropriated— pacified, transformed into a pure tool, made manipulable for anyone who might be so inclined (as long as they give the developer credit, of course). 

	Though one might point out that historically famous white artists have also been simulated by image generators, the speed with which Kim was mechanically refashioned after his death gestures towards an underlying attitude that already saw him as mechanistic to begin with. 

	In September, Jennifer Gradecki, a Northeastern University art and design professor, said in an interview about the future of artists that “creativity is actually the one thing that isn’t going to be able to be automated” in the future. Gradecki may have meant to reassure artists, but for Asians, a group often denied claims to creativity — and characterized at best as effective replicators, but rarely creators or originators — her statement rings like a warning for how these tools might push us further towards the margins and alienate us from our art. 

	Jet Li, for instance, voiced precisely this fear when he explained in 2018 that his refusal to work on The Matrix franchise stemmed from the fact that the filmmakers wanted Li to “record and copy all [his] moves into a digital library,” meaning that the movements of his body, honed during a lifetime of training, would become someone else’s intellectual property forever.

	When you’re already seen as mechanistic, the reproduction of your bodies and art through machines isn’t seen as theft, but simply the next logical step.

	We shouldn’t simply resign ourselves to this alienated future — and many artists aren’t, instead using a range of disciplines to interrogate the boundaries between human and machine creativity.

	Chinese Canadian painter Sougwen Chung, for example, incorporates a robotic arm into her art-making practice. As the robotic arm and Chung read each other’s brush strokes and respond in an ever-evolving dance, the machine collaboration centers her body— rather than divorcing her from it— by highlighting the physical performance between these organic and inorganic beings. 

	Meanwhile, last year, Korean American artist Anicka Yi, installed a series of floating “biologized machines” — giant ovoid airborne structures that suggest jellyfish — in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall. The installation contained another component often included in Yi’s practice: a particular aroma that changed week to week based on different time periods. One scent profile was meant to evoke the bubonic plague. Yi’s semi-autonomous robo-organisms challenge the cold, sterile notion of artificial intelligence as disembodied “pure cognition” by integrating them in natural forms, while her olfactory scent-scapes serve as a carnal reminder of embodiment.

	Korean American filmmaker Kogonada has challenged techno-Orientalist ideology directly in his latest film, After Yang. In the film, starring Colin Farrell, Jodie Turner-Smith, and Justin Min, a father goes on a mission to repair his daughter’s non-responsive robotic “big brother” and caretaker, Yang.  The film is a profound meditation on the figure of the Asian robot in the sci-fi genre, complicating this archetype beyond recognition and making space for something new.

	The impact of these technologies is not yet written, but if history is to serve as a guide, new tools tend to carry on the mistakes of the past without direct intervention. Liberating these devices from their dehumanizing potential will require us to challenge and reimagine the frameworks we use to navigate the oppressive binaries of man and machine and East and West. 

	Only then might we truly live up to Kim Jung Gi, who hoped that these technologies would help us pave new paths forward— enabling us to express ourselves more clearly and ultimately “make our lives more diverse and interesting.”

The company has partnered with Udacity, an educational organization. If successful, the training program could become a model for other companies during a time of drastic and rapid change due to artificial intelligence technology. The classes are offered online through Udacity and are meant to help the company increase its AI skills among workers. According to Shell, around 2,000 of its total 82,000 employees around the globe have expressed interest in the AI classes. Many workers have said that their managers are approaching them and asking about courses regarding things like Python programming and training neural networks. The training is all voluntary. The pilot program with Udacity launched back in 2019 after Shell needed more AI-skilled workers due to the large number of AI-related projects. The company has relied on AI for many aspects of its operations, from deepwater drilling and maintenance to predictive analysis and autonomous computing. After the pilot program proved to be successful, the company expanded it and looked toward petroleum engineers, chemists, data scientists, geophysicists, and more. The online program takes around four to six months to complete, and employees work on it about 10 to 15 hours per week. Shell pays for the customized online coursework, which is called a nanodegree. Reasons for AI WorkersThere are two major reasons why Shell is in need of AI-skilled workers. First, the company is currently developing alternative sources of energy, and they are set to spend up to $2 billion on new energy technologies. According to Dan Jeavons, general manager of data science at Shell, its power business is “digitally native, and the differentiation is going to be around AI.”The other reason for the need of AI workers is that Shell is still running its massive oil business. By reskilling workers in AI through the online program, they will be able to find problems within maintenance equipment before it breaks down. The new knowledge will also help them identify areas where there can be reduced carbon emissions. On top of all this, machine learning algorithms could be used to automatically process seismic data and collect information on underground rock formations. “The potential to move the needle and help people understand that we’re serious about trying to change the way we do things for the better is not an easy task,” Jeavons says. “But one thing we do know is that technology is a huge element of that change. We need to find a way to provide more and cleaner energy and investing in AI is a key way in which we’re going to do that.”Shell also hopes that the Udacity AI collaboration will attract younger workers, who view this type of work as dangerous and physically-demanding. Paul Donnelly is director of industry marketing at Aspen Technology. The company specializes in complex manufacturing processes. “Young people are digital natives,” says Donnelly. “When they come into the workforce, energy and chemical companies are unfortunately competing with Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. It’s tough to compete with those companies.”Targeting Existing WorkforceOne of the biggest challenges for these companies is to transition their current workforce. “The worst case scenario is laying people off and then going out and hiring all new workers with the skills you need,” says Gabe Dalporto, CEO of Udacity. “First of all, our universities can’t turn out all the workers we’ll need for the jobs of the future and it’s expensive. The cost of reskilling is so much less.”According to the company, the Udacity pilot program resulted in an increase in employee satisfaction among workers who completed the coursework. “We don’t want people to feel that they’re stagnant and not growing as the company changes,” Jeavons says.As artificial intelligence becomes more important in many different industries, companies will be forced to adapt. Retraining will be one of the top approaches to dealing with the change. There have been many instances of retraining that did not provide sufficient results, but if Shell’s program is successful, it could be used as a model in the future.          Related Topics:AIartificial intelligenceretraining programs  Up NextNew Research Shows How AI Can Act as Mediators     Don't MissAnthony Macciola, Chief Innovation Officer at ABBYY – Interview Series   Alex McFarland  Alex McFarland is an AI journalist and writer exploring the latest developments in artificial intelligence.

Student Researchers Share What They Know About AI and Health

By Victoria Wilson
On December 8, 2022
In Artificial Intelligence, Data, Medicine, Students



The healthcare industry and academic medicine are excited about the potential for artificial intelligence — really clever computers — to make our care better and more efficient.  
The students from Duke’s Health Data Science (HDS) and AI Health Data Science Fellowship who presented their work at the 2022 Duke AI Health Poster Showcase on Dec. 6 did an excellent job explaining their research findings to someone like me, who knows very little about artificial intelligence and how it works. Here’s what I learned:
Artificial intelligence is a way of training computer systems to complete complex tasks that ordinarily require human thinking, like visual categorization, language translation, and decision-making. Several different forms of artificial intelligence were presented that do healthcare-related things like sorting images of kidney cells, measuring the angles of a joint, or classifying brain injury in CT scans. 
Talking to the researchers made it clear that this technology is mainly intended to be supplemental to experts by saving them time or providing clinical decision support. 
Meet Researcher Akhil Ambekar

Akhil standing next to his poster “Glomerular Segmentation and Classification Pipeline Using NEPTUNE Whole Slide Images”
Akhil Ambekar and team developed a pipeline to automate the classification of glomerulosclerosis, or scarring of the filtering part of the kidneys, using microscopic biopsy images. Conventionally, this kind of classification is done by a pathologist. It is time-consuming and limited in terms of accuracy and reproducibility of observations. This AI model was trained by providing it with many questions and corresponding answers so that it could learn how to correctly answer questions. A real pathologist oversaw this work, ensuring that the computer’s training was accurate. 
Akil’s findings suggest that this is a feasible approach for machine classification of glomerulosclerosis. I asked him how this research might be used in medicine and learned that a program like this could save expert pathologists a lot of time. 
What was Akhil’s favorite part of this project? Engaging in research, experimenting with Python and running different models, trying to find what works best.
Meet Researcher Irene Tanner
Irene Tanner and her poster, “Developing a Deep Learning Pipeline to Measure the Hip-Knee-Ankle Angle in Full Leg Radiographs”
The research Irene Tanner and her team have done aims to develop a deep learning-based pipeline to calculate hip-knee-ankle angles from full leg x-rays. This work is currently in progress, but preliminary results suggest the model can precisely identify points needed to calculate the angles of hip to knee to ankle. In the future, this algorithm could be applied to predict outcomes like pain and physical function after a patient has a joint replacement surgery. 
What was Irene’s favorite part of this project? Developing a relationship with mentor, Dr. Maggie Horn, who she said provided endless support whenever help was needed.
Meet Researcher Brian Lerner
Brian Lerner and his poster, “Using Deep Learning to Classify Traumatic Brain Injury in CT Scans”
Brian Lerner and his team investigated the application of deep learning to standardize and sharpen diagnoses of traumatic brain injury (TBI) from Computerized Tomography (CT) scans of the brain. Preliminary findings suggest that the model used (simple slice) is likely not sufficient to capture the patterns in the data. However, future directions for this work might examine how the model could be improved. Through this project, Brian had the opportunity to shadow a neurologist in the ER and speculated upon many possibilities for the use of this research in the field.
What was Brian’s favorite part of this project? Shadowing neurosurgeon Dr. Syed Adil at Duke Hospital and learning what the real-world needs for this science are.
Many congratulations to all who presented at this year’s AI Health Poster Showcase, including the many not featured in this article. A big thanks for helping me to learn about how AI Health research might be transformative in answering difficult problems in medicine and population health.

Gartner recently released its list of 7 Technology Disruptions That Will Impact Sales Through 2027. One was generative Artificial Intelligence. Gartner defined generative AI as AI that “learns from existing content artifacts to generate new, realistic artifacts that reflect the characteristics of the training data, but do not repeat it.” In simple terms, it can produce entirely new content, like images, videos, text and code, with very simple inputs.
Generative AI is going to completely alter the marketing landscape, among many other areas. For example, type any combination of descriptors into OpenAI’s DALL·E 2, and AI creates realistic and/or artistic images. In fact, the title image of this piece was created using that technology by simply typing the phrase: “How generative AI will help marketing teams around the world.” Suddenly, any firm can become a one-stop creative shop with tools that can increase efficiency and creativity.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



With nearly limitless possibilities, what does this mean for professionals and their job security? 
While new AI tools are changing marketing, they’re not entirely replacing human marketers. At nearly every AI company that I represented at my communications firm, the computer intelligence was there to augment people’s abilities — but not fully supplant it. While the AI’s capacity to make new things possible was unmistakable, these tasks were best executed with an expert’s touch at the end to make final decisions.
Here are three ways to increase a marketing firm’s range by using new AI tools while still keeping professionals in the creative driver’s seat. 
Foster unlimited brainstorming potential with generative AI
Few things haunt a marketer quite like a blank page, and often the first step is the hardest. That’s where generative AI can come to the rescue. According to a blog by Sequoia Capital, this technology will help users “thrive from a tight iterative creative cycle between human and machine.” These sped-up cycles can be very advantageous early in any initiative. 
If a visually-driven project needs inspiration, programs like DALL-E 2 or Stable Diffusion can rapidly generate images from text prompts. These distinctive works can either fuel new creative ideas, or be the jumping off point for visual artists to build upon. For the linguistically minded, products like Jasper and Copy.ai use generative AI to help get marketing copy ideas flowing. Not only can these increase anyone’s imaginative capacity, but Sequoia believes that generative AI can make workers at least 10% more efficient and/or creative. 
Hack creative brains for new inputs
Beyond simply brainstorming, these tools can expand business offerings by creating visuals to their writing, enhanced copy to their visual images, or even unearth wholly novel creative realms. This is a game changer for smaller firms, where you can now add a new dimension to your work. If someone is generally a visual artist, I suggest using AI-generated content sparingly at first and pay attention to what it comes up with. Or, for those who are deft copywriters, start by creating images as a way to augment an article, blog, press release, etc.  advertisement
The most promising development in generative AI’s semantic creativity is the tsunami being produced by OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Akin to DALL·E 2’s ability to transform language into brilliant images, ChatGPT’s model does the same thing with words and is trained to interact in a conversational way. Prompts to explain complex topics are produced with ease, but where ChatGPT shines is in the more imaginative requests. Just check out its answer to “write a biblical verse in the style of the King James bible explaining how to remove a peanut butter sandwich from a VCR.” This is cultivating exponential imaginative potential right before marketers’ eyes.



 While this technology is still in its infancy, people should proceed cautiously and use them with continual supervision. The key to implementing any of these powerful programs is to start small and build up, all while acclimating to how these tools operate. While they may be generating the final product, starting slowly will help users define input processes — thus fostering unique and on-brand outcomes. 
Constantly iterate at speedadvertisement
One key element of a marketer’s job is to craft foundational brand elements — from written messaging and position to brand logos, colors and more — and constantly tweak concepts on the go. Rowan Curran, a Forrester AI/ML and data science analyst, cites speed constraints as a reason for adopting generative AI. According to his report, “Human-produced content creation will never be fast enough to address the need for personalized content at scale, and in the next year, we expect to see at least 10% of [Fortune 500] companies invest in AI-supported digital content creation.” Like Curran, Gartner predicts that by 2025, 30% of outbound messages from large organizations will be synthetically generated. This means that iterations can happen at much faster speeds.
There’s also an opportunity for companies to unlock new content from unlikely sources. For example, a marketing lead can have their writers create generative AI images, and their designers bring their visual minds to work on AI-assisted copy. All of a sudden, there will be entirely new concepts created by hacking into creative minds traversing unusual media — all unlocked by generative AI.
So, does this spell the end of the marketer? Not quite. Campaigns still require expert oversight at the end to ensure that content is fully within a brand’s ethos and are deployed in the right place and at the right time. However, make no mistake: these processes will soon become fully intertwined with human-powered content creation.

Generative AI artwork of a Warhol-style painting of Baby Darth Vader on a Harley by DALL-E

Andy Warhol might have appreciated the irony. The late artist who put the act of reproduction — of copying — at the centre of his oeuvre is now the focus of a copyright case before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The case involves a set of silkscreens Warhol made of pop star Prince based on a portrait taken by a professional photographer who is now suing Warhol's estate for copyright infringement. At issue is whether what Warhol brought to the image — the flat, masklike face, the day-glo colours — was ""transformative"" enough in legal terms to qualify as ""fair use"" under the U.S. Copyright Act.
Courts deal with such hazy questions of authorship and artistic style all the time — questions that might come more naturally to curators and critics. But now those questions are getting a lot hazier, because artificial intelligence is getting into the game.
""Generative AI"" refers to semi-autonomous machine learning algorithms that allow computers to use existing content — text, images, video and audio — to create new works. A text-to-image AI turns user prompts into images; the user types in words describing what they want to see (""Baby Darth Vader on a Harley,"" for example) and the AI ""creates"" the image (we tried, it works).
How? Generative AI algorithms are built upon vast amounts of content scraped from the internet. In the case of Stable Diffusion, one of the most popular text-to-AI systems, the algorithm was ""trained"" on billions of images pulled from hundreds of domains — blogs, stock art libraries, art sites, everything. Some of that scraped material is not copyrighted anywhere. Much of it is.
It's new technology and it's posing some puzzling new questions for people in the copyright field. Who owns the images made by generative AI? Who owns the inputs? Can artists claim some stake in an image created by an AI trained on their work? Does an artist whose style is being ripped off by a machine have any recourse?
Right now, there's no legal consensus on any of these questions, either in Canada or in the major jurisdictions for AI startups (the U.S., U.K., EU). The companies behind generative AI can make their own assertions — OpenAI, the firm behind the wildly popular DALL-E platform, claims it retains ownership of the ""original"" images, although its subscribers get full rights to reprint, sell and merchandise them. But that claim has yet to be tested in court.
Canadian copyright law takes its cue from a 2004 decision of the Supreme Court: CCH Canada Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada. In it, the high court defined an ""original work"" in terms of effort — as a product of ""an exercise of skill and judgment."" That exercise of skill and judgment, wrote then Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, ""must not be so trivial that it could be characterized as a purely mechanical exercise."" 
It's hard to imagine a creative act more mechanical than feeding an AI a few prompts. Tom Lebrun, a Quebec-based lawyer who specializes in digital law and copyright, said that ""for most AI-generated images, the copyright would belong to no one.
""No one would own the image because no one would have contributed the talent or judgment required to produce an original work,"" he said. ""So it would be public.""
But what happens when the user actually puts in some effort? What if the user expends considerable time and effort refining the prompts? What if an advertising firm uses AI-generated imagery in a campaign — could they find their work appropriated by others legally?
""The maker of the camera is not the creator of the photos. That's not up for debate,"" said Alan Macek, a partner and patent agent at DLA Piper. ""I think advertising campaigns will be careful to make sure there's enough human authorship to forestall any arguments about copyright. But as the user's role becomes less and less, the questions get trickier.
""The thing is, we don't know. What if the user spends all morning refining the keywords and prompts to produce the image they want? On the other hand, if I hand the words over to my friend the painter to paint a painting, I don't think anyone would regard me as the creator.""
So much for output. What about input? Could an artist prove that their work formed part of an AI's training dataset and, as a result, was exploited by that algorithm to produce work in the artist's style? Would it matter?
Both Canadian and American copyright law make exceptions that allow third parties to make use of copyrighted material. The ""fair use"" doctrine in U.S. law is blurrier than the ""fair dealing"" doctrine in Canadian law, which limits third-party use to a handful of purposes: education, satire, parody, research, private study, criticism and journalism. Canadian law is more protective of an individual artist's expression.
""Style is protected under Canadian copyright law,"" said Lebrun. ""Judges try to view the artwork as a whole. They're looking to determine whether there is enough of the original work in the work in question to justify protection. Sometimes it's a key feature of the composition. Sometimes it's the style itself.
""But the artist may have to find something better than style to prove the case. What would really help would be proof that the artist's work was part of the original dataset used to train the AI. That would definitely help.""
Best of luck getting that proof, said Eve Gaumond, a Quebec-based researcher in information technology law. She said AI companies would be extremely reluctant to open their datasets to scrutiny, even if they managed to retain them.
""The company would argue the dataset is proprietary information,"" she said. ""And in any case, you'd be talking about millions and millions of images. Tech companies tend to move fast and break things, so they don't necessarily preserve all aspects of their development processes.""
Tech companies also tend to have deep pockets. Artists seldom do. Gaumond predicts stock image companies will be the ""first out of the gate"" with lawsuits alleging copyright violation through generative AI.
""They're the ones whose images are being ripped off and they've got the resources to take a case all the way,"" she said.
But because Canada is a little fish in a big copyright pond, said Lebrun, many decisions about the legal status of generative AI may be settled abroad. ""The principal problem facing any artist in this situation is jurisdiction,"" he said. ""This isn't happening in Quebec. It's happening in California, mostly. This is an international issue. It's international data.""
So keep an eye on that Warhol case in the U.S. Even though it doesn't deal directly with generative AI, it's a rare instance of the U.S. Supreme Court touching on the law of fair use. Given the United States' vast cultural footprint, any significant changes to the court's interpretation could have ripple effects worldwide.
But until it does, and until Canadian courts start generating case law of their own, the legal status of AI art remains a blank canvas.
