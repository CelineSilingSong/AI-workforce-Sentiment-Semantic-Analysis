By Michel Bais, managing director, Mobile Viewpoint
Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to be adopted across the broadcast arena as a new initiative to enable productions and operational processes that were previously cost prohibitive or expensive. It is not positioned to replace jobs, but to enable productions that were previously just not possible. But can AI be applied to the audio?
As a video technology company, we often get wrongly accused of not prioritising the audio element as much as the video quality. We have been implementing AI for video as an alternative to camera people so it may be interesting to some that as a video technology company, we are developing what we believe is a world first: a method to also capture audio as part of the production, but without the need of an audio engineer.
But what is this exactly?  One example is in sports production where a panoramic camera is utilised above the field of play and captures the whole pitch in super high resolution. Then, using the power of AI, a virtual cutout of the action in full HD is created which live streams only the ball and the action of the players around the ball. There isn’t a cameraperson or director in sight and it enables live sports production at a fraction of the traditional cost. This could be ideal for those games that previously could not be live streamed, such as youth sports, training games and grassroots games, and it allows sports clubs and media right holders effective ways to monetise or promote their content that were previously not possible.
AI audio
But what about the audio element? A major part of any sports production is capturing the mood of the game, of which all the sounds and noise are a fundamental part of the experience. Traditionally there would be a bank of microphones on the pitch-side, capturing different parts of the pitch and the reaction of the spectators. So, if a goal is scored by the home supporters than the reaction of the home supporters can be ingested into the production. Any swearing or bad language can be taken out. It is the job of the audio engineer to do this.
As part of an AI production where AI creates a virtual camera to track the ball, we believe it would be interesting to also allow the AI to follow the audio in the same way, taking the place of the audio engineer and giving a much more varied and compelling audio experience. This we feel is a world first. In reality this means developing a panoramic audio capturing device which replaces the bank of costly microphones. The AI will only reveal the audio that is relevant to the video shot and embed that with the live stream.
Wide appeal
It is something under serious development at IQ Video Solutions.  The future of this technology could be applied to many situations. At some point for budget productions, we see the panoramic camera being used as a replacement for a multicamera production, whether that be in a panel show, a council meeting or a studio set up. If the audio capture device can filter out other noises and only pick up the relevant audio to that specific shot, then we can create much more relevant productions and reduce costs accordingly.
Are we trying to replace jobs with AI? First, we remove the need for the camera person and director, and now the audio engineer? This is not our intention – the AI platform is designed to enable productions that previously were not feasible by not having the budget or resource to create a professional production. The AI Audio Engineer is an extension of that philosophy and adding to the overall AI proposition. There will continue to be a place for manned productions for those who have the budget.

Always at the forefront of innovation, the UAE is fast adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a key technology aiding digital transformation and a move towards a high-tech economy. Key strategies, such as the adoption of the ‘UAE Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI)’, applied to future services, sectors and infrastructure projects are driving this AI vision as much as the appointment of the first ever Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications, His Excellency Omar Bin Sultan Al Olama.
Crucially, the application of this fast-moving technology is not just confined to advanced industries such as manufacturing or aeronautics as many might imagine: AI has the potential to impact every area of our lives and empower those working to solve humanitarian issues and create a more sustainable and accessible world.
Using AI for Good


Microsoft is focused on helping businesses and organisations across industries re-imagine the way they do business going forward, building resilience for the future. To do this, we are continuously investing in technology infrastructure – into data centres but more importantly into skilling and technical capabilities of the UAE population.
Ultimately, we believe that AI innovation has huge potential to transform not only businesses but our entire society for the better, as we champion applications that empower those working to solve humanitarian issues and create a more sustainable and accessible world.
To further harness this potential, under its ‘AI for Good Programme’ Microsoft is investing $115 million over five years, providing funding, technology and expertise to individuals and organisations so they can tackle some of society’s big issues.


UAE Food Security
One of the areas under the spotlight in Microsoft’s AI for Good programme is food supply: how do we make sure that we can grow food locally and sustainably and that supply chains are protected? By 2050, it is estimated that there will be a need to feed 9-10 billion people with a finite amount of additional arable land and water. Cloud technology may prove critical to mitigate this agricultural challenge.
Particularly for the UAE, which is a net importer of food, this is mission critical and entails considerations from increasing local food production to exploring ways to diversify food import sources. Recognising the challenge, the UAE government quickly created a comprehensive food security approach that would stand the country in good stead throughout the pandemic and create a strong food infrastructure for the future – an area which is crucial for the UAE for its long-term planning.

His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, has indicated the priority given to technologies, saying “We want to invest in new agricultural fields and mechanisms by harnessing advanced technologies and make proactive changes in agricultural and food systems.”
A first step in this direction has been the launch of the Food Security Dashboard of Dubai in June 2020, which is capable of using artificial intelligence and data analytics to rapidly measure the five important indicators of food security including, the supply index; stock availability; local production; consumption levels; and the cost of vital commodities in the Emirate.
Azure FarmBeats – bringing technology to the farm
With this priority given to technologies in delivering food security, Microsoft’s goal is to enable data-driven farming. We believe that data, coupled with the farmer’s knowledge and intuition about his or her farm, can help increase farm productivity, and help reduce costs. However, getting data from the farm is extremely difficult, since there is often no power in the field, or Internet on the farms.
We are building several unique solutions to solve these problems using low-cost sensors, drones, and vision and machine learning algorithms. Our solution, Azure FarmBeats, provides farmers with access to the Microsoft cloud and AI technologies, enabling data driven decisions that growers can act on. Capabilities include aggregating agricultural data from different sources; fusing different agricultural datasets from sensors, drones & satellites; rapidly building AI/ML models using the fused datasets and building customised digital agriculture solutions.
Microsoft has successfully rolled out FarmBeats around the world, including a partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on an initiative outfitting a network of high-tech sensors, putting data in the hands of farmers and scientists in ways unimaginable a few years ago. The sensors at the 7,000-acre farm at the USDA’s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland harness data and artificial intelligence to help farmers cut costs, increase yields and sustainably grow crops that are more resilient to climate change.
FarmBeats is also offering tech and business resources to Series C startups in India, which can boost their business with Azure benefits, technical support, market strategies, unlimited technical support, and new sale opportunities. Companies that have plans to build digital agriculture solutions now have the opportunity to co-build customised solutions Azure FarmBeats without the need to invest in deep data engineering. By using Azure FarmBeats, startups can acquire, aggregate and process agricultural data and rapidly develop their own AI/ML model.
Microsoft will be showcasing its new solution Azure FarmBeats at GITEX as one of the examples of how technology can help farming communities to be more sustainable and productive.
AI for a better world
The world has gone through a series of challenges through the course of the year when digital transformation has been compressed from leaps that would usually take years to a matter of months. As we have all been forced to rethink the ways we go about our lives, governments and organisations are now looking with fresh eyes to positive applications.
Human ingenuity and technology have dovetailed together to firstly provide a response to the pandemic and then support a recovery, providing a rapid learning curve and a newfound appreciation of and openness to technology. These shared experiences have opened people’s eyes in recognition of how technology can provide solutions to all manner of challenges, beyond the theoretical to the practical at a grand scale. Now this same digital transformation journey paves the way for a reimagining and rebuilding of essential foundations of our lives including food security, creating a more resilient and sustainable world.

Which Technology Jobs Will Require A.I. and Machine Learning Skills?

Artificial intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning seem poised to dominate the future. Companies everywhere are pouring resources into making their apps and services “smarter.” But which technology jobs will actually require A.I. skills?  
For an answer to that question, we turn to Burning Glass, which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country. Specifically, we wanted to see which professions had the highest percentage of job postings requesting A.I. skills. Here’s that breakdown; as the cliché goes, some of these results may surprise you:   
  
What can we conclude from this breakdown? Although you might think that artificial intelligence skills are very much in demand among software developers and engineers (after all, someone needs to build a smarter chatbot), data science is clearly the profession where A.I. is most in vogue.   
Indeed, there’s a lot of overlap between A.I. and data science. Both disciplines involve collecting, wrangling, cleaning, and analyzing massive amounts of data. But whereas a data scientist will analyze data for insights that they present to the broader organization, artificial intelligence and machine learning experts will use those datasets to train A.I. platforms to become “smarter.” Once sufficiently trained, those platforms can then make their own (hopefully correct) inferences about data.   
Given that intersection of artificial intelligence and data science, many machine-learning and A.I. experts become data scientists, and vice versa. That relationship will likely only deepen in the years ahead. Burning Glass suggests that machine learning is a “defining skill” among data scientists, necessary for day-to-day tasks; if you’re aiming for a job as a data scientist, having extensive knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine-learning tools and platforms can give you a crucial advantage in a crowded market.   
Many other technologist roles will see the need for artificial intelligence skills increase in the years ahead. If you’re involved in software development, for instance, learning A.I. skills now will prepare you for a future in which A.I. tools and platforms are a prevalent element in many companies’ tech stacks. And make no mistake about it: Managers and executives will also need to become familiar with A.I. concepts and skills. “A.I. is not going to replace managers but managers that use A.I. will replace those that do not,” Rob Thomas, senior vice president of IBM’s cloud and data platform, recently told CNBC.  
Overall, jobs utilizing artificial intelligence skills are projected to grow 43.4 percent over the next decade; the current median salary for jobs that heavily utilize A.I. skills is $105,000, higher than for many other professions. It must be noted, though, that A.I. and machine learning are areas where you really need to know your stuff, and hiring managers will surely test you on both your knowledge of fundamental concepts as well as your ability to execute. When applying for A.I.-related jobs, a portfolio of previous projects can only help your prospects.     
Granted, it’s still early days for A.I.: Despite all the hype, relatively few companies have integrated A.I. into either their front-end products or back-end infrastructure. Nonetheless, it’s clear that employers are already interested in technologists who are familiar with the A.I. and machine learning platforms that will help determine the future.

Like many who have skied their entire lives but have rarely seen themselves ski on video, I fancy myself an above-average skier. Carv, however, thought there was room for improvement. According to Carv, an AI ski coach analyzing my skiing via 48 pressure sensors in my ski boots, I do have some carving chops (Carv picked up high edge angles)—but my turns weren’t symmetrical. Through headphones connected to the Bluetooth trackers mounted on the back of my ski boots, Carv let me know mid-run that I was applying uneven and inconsistent pressure in my turns to the right. I course-corrected by pressuring my downhill ski more consistently throughout my next right turn. I was rewarded with a “ding” and “That’s it, nice work!” from Carv.
Launched as a prototype on Kickstarter in 2016 with a 3.0 version set to debut in December 2019, Carv is the brainchild of Jamie Grant, a recreational skier with a background in physics and machine learning who was hungry for concrete ski data to help him improve on the slopes. “I wanted a way to measure technique and understand what I needed to do to improve,” says Grant. “To date, there has been virtually no digital innovation in skiing. As an industry it has been vastly outperformed by other sports such as cycling and golf.”
So Grant and Carv co-developer Pruthvikar Reddy designed a system of smart inserts that fit beneath the liner of any ski boot; a hardware piece that attaches to the cuff of the ski boot and tracks over 35 metrics on every turn; and the Carv app that analyzes your skiing ability, provides real-time audio feedback, and incentivizes you to learn and progress through skill-specific drills and challenges.
“Carv allows anybody to be able to track their skiing, diagnose issues, and improve their technique on their own terms and in their own time,” says Grant. While the idea of an AI ski coach may meet skepticism, it has piqued the interest of ski instructors. “Carv shows the truth about how I stand and move versus how I think I stand and move on skis,” says Michael Rogan, head coach of the Professional Ski Instructors of America alpine demo team. After testing Carv 2.0, Rogan believes Carv could be an effective tool to enhance coaching and learning between instructors and students on the slopes. That said, Carv isn’t a substitute for ski instructors. “Carv gives you a lot of information, almost too much. Trying to make sense of it all can be overwhelming,” says Rogan.

How to Bash Bumps

In other words, Carv gives you a comprehensive diagnosis of your skiing problems, but not a treatment plan as actionable or astute as one you would receive from an instructor IRL. However, if you’re a data nerd, Carv has the potential to get you hooked on the coolest aspect of skiing—technique. At that point, you might as well embrace the nerd.

But an alternative approach turns the question on its head and asks how institutions or systems could be more intelligent. The spread of intelligent machines often coincides with less intelligence at a systems level. How should 'thought' happen at a large scale, involving many people and frequently many machines, to better solve social problems? In particular, let's discuss collective intelligence and AI to benefit society..There's a great potential in AI if handled well, but many of the biggest gains will come from better approaches to combining human and machine intelligence, especially harnessing the intelligence of groups for social purposes..A solar-infused autonomous drone scans for forest fires. A surgeon first operates on a digital heart before the individual picks up a scalpel. Global community bands together are going to print personal protection equipment to fight a pandemic..And this is possible with cloud computing, AI and a virtual 3D design shop or the 3DEXPERIENCE innovation lab. This open innovation laboratory adopts the concept of the social enterprise and merges collective intelligence with a cross-collaborative approach by building communities of people who are passionate and willing to accomplish a common objective..3DEXPERIENCE innovation lab is neither only a software nor only cloud, but it's also a community of people's skills and services available for the marketplace. As technologies are now more accessible, newcomers can also disrupt. And for software companies like Dassault Systèmes, there are unlimited real-world opportunities with the power of collective intelligence, especially when one is bringing together industry experts, healthcare professionals, makers, and scientists to tackle COVID-19 pandemic. This approach could be an interesting way to accelerate, to transfer the know-how, and avoid any mistakes..3DEXPERIENCE Lab program provides those start-ups that impact society as a disruptive product or project aiming to make real impact access to this software and professional solutions that the industry is using in their everyday activities. Because of the cloud platform with its communities, start-ups get access to mentors. And these mentors help them boost their development, providing know-how and knowledge..As 3DExperience Lab creates a way for an enterprise to develop an entire product as a 3D vision, integrating feedback from the research lab, the factory floor, and the customer, all the stakeholders can work in a single environment in the cloud using some apps like CATIA or SolidWorks. They can get done the engineering part of the job on the same data model they would use to perform their own simulations. Any kind of digital simulation helps those people to accelerate the engineering and the design of their product. By following that, they can optimise the design and then go to the manufacturing aspect, delivering all the processes required for programming the machines. It is a standard way to operate..This platform also offers accessibility to services for the marketplace. As early-stage start-ups struggle to find the right partner or the right supplier to manufacture something, they can source components from millions of components that are available through qualified suppliers online at one click of a button..They can access thousands of factories globally, wherein they can produce their parts through those factories, managing all the business online between the two suppliers. They may also have access to engineering services where one wishes to do something, but one doesn't have the skills to do it. Hence the individual then contracts the job to a service bureau or qualified partners that could deliver the job. So it is not only software or cloud but also a community of people's skills and services available for the marketplace..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

With the necessary technological precursors now in place, the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence promises to reshape countless aspects of the world as we know it, according to Caltech Professor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences Yisong Yue.
Yue’s inviting the community to join in an online lecture Wednesday to share a bit about what he’s learned in recent years, and where the technology may be headed.
The free lecture is part of Caltech’s Earnest C. Watson Lecture Series and will be held at 5 p.m. via Zoom.
“I have been studying various aspects of machine learning and artificial intelligence, in particular, now that the technology has been maturing,” Yue said. “How do we identify, expose, characterize and then address all the challenges related to getting machine learning deployed and working in various real-world settings that arise in the sciences and the engineering?”
At the Watson lecture, Yue said he was looking forward to chatting with the public “about some of the lessons that I’ve learned. Some of those are success stories and some are the challenges that remain in this quest.”
Both computing power and data collection have advanced to levels capable of supporting meaningful A.I., he said.
And the third one is, of course, better algorithm and better and better approaches,” according to Yue. “That’s really my bread and butter. That’s the part that I help out with the most: new software designs and algorithms to address these new modalities that people want to apply machine learning, artificial intelligence to.”
Yue said he expected to see some major developments in the field in the near future.
“It’s a long path from basic science to what ends up being a sustainable commercial enterprise. That long path is part of what makes it hard to predict,” he said. “But I’m very optimistic that in the next 10 to 20 years, we’ll see some things that are very unexpected.”
At its core, A.I. focuses on teaching machines to think for themselves in order to solve problems for humans, Yue explained.
“Rather than having a human figure out every little detail by hand, the A.I. would just do it automatically from collecting lots of data,” he said.
At Caltech’s Center for Autonomous Systems and Technology lab, or CAST, for example, scientists have applied A.I. to design new types of robotics controllers, Yue said.
Robots in the past are, for lack of a better term, robotic,” he said. “They’re rigid and not flexible. And one of the reasons why they’re rigid and not flexible is because the way you write down the governing models are just so approximate that you can’t do anything flexible. And so A.I. gives an opportunity to be able to very cost-effectively build these flexible models for robotics that were not possible before.”
Potential applications are limited only by the imagination, from swarms of drones working as teams to deliver packages or extinguish fires, to new ways to develop materials, to self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles, he said. “I think that in the foreseeable future, every field will be impacted by A.I.”
But like with any new and powerful technology, there are ethical considerations that will need to be addressed, in addition to scientific ones.
“I think it’s important to recognize that whenever we have a transformative technology, it can both be used for good and be misused for harm,” Yue said. “If you make it really cheap to design new materials, you can make it really cheap to design new bioweapons, potentially.”
“These technologies are very transformative and I’m very excited about their potential, but I think it’s important to recognize that as we think about the transformative potential of these technologies and we understand how they may be used for harm and we try to figure out a solution as a society,” he said. “Understanding how an A.I. system can be misused or can make mistakes, and just having a better understanding of how A.I. works, is going to be beneficial for everyone.”

Companies have been using applicant tracking systems (ATS) since the 1990s, but most job seekers still don’t understand what happens between the time they upload a resume and the time when it’s finally viewed by a recruiter or hiring manager.
When I found myself on the job hunt back in 2013, I spent hours each day submitting my resume online but wasn’t hearing back. Job seekers refer to this as the “resume black hole.” So, I started investigating and discovered that the online portals used for hiring — ATS — were simply parsing resumes, and recruiters were searching resumes based on keywords and skills.
In order to get more interviews, I knew I would have to carefully tailor each and every resume to the job description with ATS in mind. I built the first version of Jobscan to help myself automate the process of seeing which skills and keywords were featured in the job description but weren’t on my resume.
It turns out, millions of job seekers needed the same help.
 
Why Applicant Tracking Systems Exist
Virtually all Fortune 500 companies use ATS as part of their hiring process. Top employers have several open positions across multiple departments at any given time. And because applying for jobs online is now easier than ever, each of these job openings gets flooded with hundreds if not thousands of applicants, many of whom are not qualified.
ATS helps to organize and sort the applicants for a company’s team of recruiters and hiring managers. And it’s not just Fortune 500. At Jobscan, we often receive over 500 applicants per open position, which our small recruiting team couldn’t handle without the help of a powerful ATS.
With ATS, recruiters and hiring managers can efficiently narrow down the applicant pool. Unfortunately, the systems aren’t perfect, which means well-qualified candidates can slip through the cracks.
 
How Applicant Tracking Systems Work
ATS collect and store resumes in a database accessible by the company’s hiring professionals. There are dozens of popular ATS in the marketplace, and they all behave a little bit differently, but here are a few ways recruiters use ATS to interact with your resume:
Viewing Applications
Most recruiters still manually skim as many incoming resumes as possible. Experienced recruiters can rule out applicants in a matter of seconds. They scan your resume for hard skills, job titles, accomplishments and notable companies. If they don’t see what they need at a glance, they’ll move on to the next applicant. Because of this, it’s important for job seekers to make sure their most relevant skills and qualifications can be easily identified.
Keyword Searches
Recruiters can filter through the applicants by searching for job titles and key skills. For example, if a recruiter is overwhelmed by 700 applications for a product manager position, they might start by searching for “Product Manager” to eliminate anyone who hasn’t held the exact job title in the past. Then, they can take the filtering a step further by searching for hard skills and softwares critical to the role, like InVision for prototyping or Asana for prioritization.
Automatic Rankings
Some ATS can even automatically compare your resume to the job description. For example, Taleo, one of the most popular ATS among Fortune 500 companies, has a feature called “Req Rank” that stack ranks each applicant based on how well their resume scores against the job description. That way, instead of reviewing every single application, a recruiter could choose to focus on candidates the ATS identified as a great match.
 
How to ‘Beat’ Applicant Tracking Systems
What’s the common thread between a recruiter manually skimming an application, searching their ATS or utilizing an automated ranking algorithm?
Job titles, skills and keywords.
And what’s the easiest way to figure out which keywords the recruiter and/or ATS algorithms are targeting?
The job description.
Identify the specific skills and qualifications mentioned in the job description and add them to your resume when appropriate. (This should go without saying, but don’t lie about your qualifications!) If a skill or keyword is mentioned multiple times in the job description, it’s probably important. Mention the same skill multiple times in your resume.
Career coaches used to tell job seekers to print out the job description and use a highlighter to identify skills and keywords. Now, this process has been automated by Jobscan through the use of AI and machine learning algorithms.
The other aspect of creating an ATS-friendly resume is to pay close attention to formatting. Here are three common formatting traps to avoid:
Don’t use a resume template that has tables or columns. Most ATS scan your resume from top-to-bottom, left-to-right, no matter what. This causes unreadable parsing errors when the ATS attempts to import your resume information into a digital applicant profile.
	 
Use common section headings like “Work Experience” and “Education” rather than trying to be cute or creative. ATS are programmed to parse out experience based on expected section headings, so anything out of the ordinary could cause a parsing error.
	 
For skills and qualifications that have a common acronym, spell it out and include the acronym to maximize searchability. For example, “generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)” or “customer experience (CX).”
You don’t have to get lost in the applicant tracking system’s black hole. Make ATS work for you by tailoring your resume with targeted keywords from the job description. That’s how you get to the top of the list and one step closer to your dream job.

Nonetheless, at this moment, the vast majority of these AI devices are working independently of one another. However, as the volume of data moving through these gadgets increments in the coming years, technology organizations and implementers should sort out a path for every one of them to learn, think, and work together to genuinely harness the potential that AI can deliver..An interesting report by ABI Research envisions that while the total installed base of AI devices will increase from 2.69 billion in 2019 to 4.47 billion out of 2024, nearly not many will be interoperable temporarily. Instead of consolidating the gigabytes to petabytes of data coursing through them into a single AI model or framework, they'll work independently and heterogeneously to sort out the data they're fed..Derived from the Latin words 'multus' which means numerous and 'modalis' which means mode, multimodality, with regards to human perception, is basically that the capacity to use various multiple sensory modalities to encode and decode external surroundings. At the point when joined, they make a united, singular perspective on the world..Multimodal perception rises above the universe of innovation. When applied to Artificial Intelligence explicitly, joining different AI information sources into one model is known as Multimodal Learning..In contrast to conventional unimodal learning frameworks, multimodal systems can convey correlative data about one another, which will possibly become evident when they are both included in the learning cycle. In this manner, learning-based techniques that consolidate signals from various modalities are fit for creating more robust inference, or even new insights, which would be inconceivable in a unimodal framework..Multimodal learning presents two essential advantages:.Firstly, numerous sensors observing the same data can make more strong forecasts, since recognizing changes in it may be possible when the two modalities are available. Secondly, the combination of numerous sensors can encourage the capture of complementary information or trends that may not be caught by individual modalities..With its visual dialogue framework, Facebook would have all the earmarks to be pursuing a digital assistant that copies human partners by reacting to pictures, messages, and messages about pictures as normally as an individual may. For instance, given the brief &quot;I need to get a few seats — show me earthy colored ones and enlighten me regarding the materials,&quot; the assistant may reply with a picture of earthy colored seats and the content &quot;How would you like these? They have a strong earthy colored tone with a foam fitting.&quot;.In the automotive space, multimodal learning is being presented with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), In-Vehicle Human Machine Interface (HMI) associates, and Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) for real-time inferencing and forecast..Robotics vendors are fusing multimodal systems into robotics HMIs and movement automation to widen customer appeal and give more noteworthy collaboration among laborers and robots in the industrial space..Similarly, as we have set up that human perception is emotional, the equivalent can be said for machines. In a time when AI is changing the way people live and work-AI, utilizing the multimodal approach, can see and perceive outer situations. Simultaneously, this methodology imitates the human way to deal with perception, including imperfections as well..All the more explicitly, the advantage is that machines can replicate this human way to deal with the perception of external scenarios. However, certain AI technology can see data up to 150x faster than a human (in corresponding with a human guard)..With this new turn of events, we are drawing nearer to mirroring human insight, and well, the possibilities are endless..There's only one issue. Multimodal systems get on inclinations in datasets. The variety of questions and ideas engaged with assignments like VQA, as well as the absence of great data, regularly keep models from figuring out how to &quot;reason,&quot; driving them to make educated guesses by depending on dataset statistics..The solution will probably include bigger, more comprehensive training datasets. A paper published by engineers at École Normale Supérieure in Paris, Inria Paris, and the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics, and Cybernetics proposes a VQA dataset made from millions of narrated videos. Comprising naturally produced sets of questions and answers from transcribed recordings, the dataset dispenses with the requirement for manual annotation while empowering strong performance on well-known benchmarks, as per the analysts..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

According to Perfumer Flavorist, &quot;Givaudan created Carto, an AI scent creation tool which allows perfumers to develop their formulas with the help of Givaudan's Odor Value Map; Eve, an AI inspired tool used to create products based on the requests and capabilities of the customer; and, also, opened a digital factory in Paris.&quot; .One of the most significant benefits of AI for fragrance manufacturing is the ability to easily recommend alternative ingredients or formulations. The fragrance industry is currently addressing many cultural forces, such as the development of natural or 'clean' fragrances that reduce the use of synthetic ingredients, as well as the effects of raw ingredients from natural calamities or deforestation/desertification..There is also a first-ever AI-made fragrance, called Philyra, which was developed as a collaboration between IBM and Symrise, a major supplier of flavors and fragrances, available in Brazil..Philyra is capable of learning about formulas, raw materials, historical performance data, market trends and is being produced by perfumer David Apel to create new fragrances for one of the world's top beauty companies, the Brazilian cosmetics business called O Boticário..Philyra uses a number of modern and sophisticated machine learning algorithms to recognize various trends and perfume combinations quickly by going through hundreds of different perfume formulas and raw materials. This then also allows it to design completely new fragrance formulas..As AI can beat nothing in terms of data work, IBM researchers have used data-based methods to use the information on the formats, fragrance families, raw materials, and background data on fragrances and formulations that were previously designed. The algorithm for machine learning creates new variations of these equations that were customized to the demographic and character of the consumer..The entire framework is focused on machine learning, and IBM &amp; Symrise researchers aim to introduce AI perfume technology to the world. In addition, the device can also be used for other forms of applications, including the creation of flavors, cosmetics, and household goods, such as washing products and detergents..In the production of new fragrances, it seems probable that solutions like Philyra will become standard instruments. Since Symrise will eventually have the competitive advantage of analyzing data and learning machinery, the business must increasingly employ knowledge and data capital. The company is unique in terms of creating proprietary software, with its large database of fragrances, which help it gain a competitive edge. The collaborative effort of data scientists and perfumers appears to be just a continuity of art and science which have produced fragrances since prehistoric times. While IBM's collaboration has been used to draw publicity, AI technology will be used behind the curtain for generations to come to maintain the enchantment that embraces our preferred fragrances..NINU, the world's 1st SMART perfume (patent-pending), with an AI-driven app, is another recent example. It was inspired by Peter Florjančič, the greatest innovator in the history of perfume. NINU has also been named as a tribute to the first two recorded perfumers in the world..In the traditional perfume industry, NINU is a fresh breeze. It respects the tradition and builds on a centuries-old legacy by leveraging the latest technological advances. It enables you to find your scent and play with it by integrating three distinct high-quality fragrances in a single high-tech interface. This is a simple and patent-pending invention that helps you to adapt your perfume to match all moods and occasions. Their goal is to give vibrance (and new dimensions) each day..What makes NINU intelligent is an AI-guided application that delivers every drop of your precious perfume and an electronic micro precision extracting device. It embarks on a journey of perfume fusion led by Pierre, the AI perfume master. With only a few quick taps on your phone, he will take care of your every request. You've got total power over your fragrance. And he will tell you to restore it exactly when you start running out. You can still find something for yourself with over a million different fragrances to choose from. They believe that something special is created when beauty and technology fuse together..Every year, the global cosmetics industry produces 120 billion packaging units, which means 12 billion tonnes of plastic by 2050, if the trend continues. It is also earth-friendly since it uses natural ink in packaging cartons, has a cartridge refill mechanism, and less packaging to minimize the use of plastic. Perfume bottles are made of recycled glass as well. NINU is on a quest to make the perfume industry more user-friendly and greener..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
