As Artificial Intelligence(AI) is used in more BBC products and everything else online, we think it’s important to deliver AI-powered systems that are responsibly and ethically designed. We also want to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to understand more about how this influential technology works in the world. This is part of a series of posts on this topic.
We have noticed that news stories or press releases about AI are often illustrated with stock photos of shiny gendered robots, glowing blue brains or the Terminator. We don't think that these images actually represent the technologies of AI and ML that are in use and being developed. Indeed, we think these are unhelpful stereotypes; they set unrealistic expectations, hinder wider understanding of the technology and potentially sow fear. Ultimately this affects public understanding and critical discourse around this increasingly influential technology. We are working towards better, less clichéd, more accurate and more representative images and media for AI.
Try going to your search engine of choice and search for images of AI. What do you get? 







What are the issues?
The problems with stock images of AI has been discussed and analysed a number of times already and there are some great articles and papers about it that describe the issues better than we can. The Is Seeing Believing? project asks how we can evolve the visual language of AI. The Real Scandal of AI also identifies issues with stock photos. The AI Myths project, amongst other topics, includes a feature on how shiny robots are often used to represent AI.Going a bit deeper, this article explores how researchers have illustrated AI over the decades, this paper discusses how AI is often portrayed as white “in colour, ethnicity, or both” and this paper investigates the “AI Creation” meme that features a human hand and a machine hand nearly touching. Wider issues with the portrayal and perception of AI have also been frequently studied, as by the Royal Society here.To help us think through the problem we developed a workshop format in which we discuss existing imagery and then think about, sketch and create some better alternatives. The workshop isn’t just about pictures though, it’s thinking through what we talk about when we talk about AI. We have run the workshop with BBC teams several times and earlier in the year we took it to the 2021 Mozilla Festival. We start our workshops by examining and discussing existing images that represent AI and ML.

In our sessions there is often disagreement on which images are helpful and unhelpful, it's not clear cut. Some of the diagram-style images might be helpful, but only if you know a bit about the subject, and they're not visually striking or immediately recognisable. Similarly, funny images don't work unless you know enough to get the joke.The style of the existing images is often influenced by science fiction and there are many visual cliches of technology, such as 0s and 1s or circuit boards. The colour blue is predominant - although in this case it seems to be representing technology, blue can also be seen as representing male-ness.
The frequent representation of brains associate these images with human intelligence, although much AI and ML in use today is far removed from human intelligence. Robots occur frequently, but AI applications are very often nothing to do with robots or embodied systems. The robots are often white or they’re sexualised female representations. We also often see “evil” robots from popular culture, like the Terminator.The people we’ve workshopped with liked images that illustrate AI finding patterns, order or connections. Or images that try to embed AI & ML into the reality and context in which used - like surveillance cameras or voice assistants.
What do we think about AI?
From reviewing the research literature and by interviewing AI engineers and developers in the BBC we have identified some common themes which we think are important in describing AI and ML and that could help when thinking about imagery.

AI is all based on maths, statistics and probabilities
AI is about finding patterns and connections in data
AI works at a very large scale, manipulating almost unimaginable amounts of data
AI is often very complex and opaque and it’s hard to explain how it works. It’s even hard for the experts and practitioners to understand exactly what’s going on inside these systems
Most AI systems in use today only really know about one thing, it is “narrow” intelligence
AI works quite differently to the human brain, in some ways it is an alien non-human intelligence
AI systems are artificial and constructed and coded by humans
AI is a sociotechnical system; it is combinations of computers and humans, creating, selecting and processing the data
AI is quite invisible and often hidden
AI is increasingly common, becoming pervasive, and affects almost all of us in so many areas. It can be powerful when connected to systems of power and affects individuals, society and the world

We would like to see more images that realistically portray the technology and point towards its strengths, weaknesses, context and applications. Maybe they could...

Represent a wider range of humans and human cultures than ‘caucasian businessperson’ or ‘humanoid robot’
Represent the human, social and environmental impacts of AI systems
Reflect the realistically messy, complex, repetitive and statistical nature of AI systems
Accurately reflect the capabilities of the technology: generally applied to specific tasks and are not of human-level intelligence
Show realistic applications of AI
Avoid monolithic or unknowable representations of AI systems
Avoid using electronic representations of human brains, or robots

Towards better images
In creating new stock photos and imagery we need to consider what makes a good stock photo. Why do people use them and how? Is the image representing a particular part of the technology or is it trying to tell a wider story? What emotional response should the viewers have when looking at it? Does it help them understand the technology and is it an accurate representation? Consider the visual style; a diagram, a cartoon or a photo each brings different attributes and will communicate ideas in different ways. Imagery is often used to draw attention so it may be important to create something that has impact and is recognisable. A lot of existing stock photos of AI may be misrepresentative and unhelpful, but they are distinctive and impactful and you know them when you see them.To conclude our workshops we wanted people to start making their own images, or think about what those images might be. They didn't need to be ""good"" - we were more interested in seeing what people focused on and how they wanted to represent it.Some of the themes we’ve seen develop from these creations include:

Putting humans front and centre, and showing AI as a helper, a tool or something to be harnessed.
Showing the human involvement in AI; in coding the systems or creating the training data.
Positively reinforcing what AI can do, rather than showing the negative and dangerous aspects.
Showing the input and outputs and how human knowledge is translated into data.
Making the invisible visible.
AI getting things wrong

Interesting metaphors used include sieves and filters (of data), friendly ghosts, training circus animals, social animals, like bees or ants with emergent behaviours, child-like learning and the past predicting the future.
A new image representing datasets / creating order / digitisation
 

This is just a starting point and there is much more thinking to be done, sketches to be drawn, ideas to be harnessed, definitions agreed on and metaphors minted.We have already kicked off a project with students at the London College of Communication, giving them this brief and we’re excited about what they’ve created and how they thought about the problem. We are now working with We and AI to develop more ideas and spread the word. Ultimately we’re hoping to help create a library of better stock photos for AI; we’re starting to look for artists to commission and we’re looking for collaborators to work with. Please get in touch if you’re interested in working with us. This work is part of a wider project that we're working on to try to make AI and ML more understandable to everyone. See previous posts on why we think this is important, different ways we can approach explaining, prototypes that demonstrate understandable AI and a video about AI aimed at young people.Icon creditsComplexity by SBTS from the Noun ProjectOctopus by Atif Arshad from the Noun Projectpattern by Eliricon from the Noun Projectwatch world by corpus delicti from the Noun Projectsts by Nithinan Tatah from the Noun Projectnarrowing by andriwidodo from the Noun ProjectError 404 by Aneeque Ahmed from the Noun Projectbox icon by Fithratul Hafizd from the Noun ProjectGhost by Pelin Kahraman from the Noun Projectstack by Alex Fuller from the Noun ProjectMath by Ralf Schmitzer from the Noun Projectchip by Chintuza from the Noun Project

Reflecting on DeepMind’s AlphaFold artificial intelligence success – what’s the real significance for protein folding research and drug discovery?

In a long read, Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive and President of the ICR, and also a drug discovery scientist, reflects on the significance of the latest version of AlphaFold – a powerful AI system that has been applied to predict structures for almost 99% of human proteins – for fundamental research and drug discovery.

by Professor Paul Workman









Last month, DeepMind published the much anticipated, detailed methodology underlying the latest version of AlphaFold – the UK-based science company’s powerful AI system that blew away its rivals in the latest major competition to predict the 3D structure of proteins.
 AlphaFold’s machine learning methodology has been applied to predict structures for almost 99% of human proteins which have now been made publicly available. In this long read, I reflect on the significance of these developments for fundamental research and drug discovery. 
I wrote this as the ICR celebrates the 10th anniversary of its AI-enabled drug discovery knowledgebase canSAR – which features multiple approaches to predicting ‘druggability’ as an aid to selecting drug targets and accelerating drug discovery.
The coronavirus pandemic has, understandably, soaked up a lot of bandwidth when it comes to science news – but this particular non-Covid science story was able to cut through and hit the headlines in the UK and around the world.
On 30 November 2020 it was announced that DeepMind – a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet focusing on artificial intelligence – had made what was hailed as a huge leap towards solving one of biology’s greatest remaining challenges: the ability to predict the correct, three-dimensional structures of proteins based on their constituent, one-dimensional amino acid sequences.
The announcement attracted huge interest, but the expert community has been waiting for the peer-reviewed science publication. The AI methodology has now been published in the leading journal Nature and this was followed rapidly by a second Nature paper from DeepMind and collaborators at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), which reports the application of the most recent AlphaFold machine learning system to predict the 3D structures at scale for almost the entire human proteome – 98.5% of human proteins.
Founded in the UK in 2010, a statement on DeepMind’s website says: ‘Our long-term aim is to solve intelligence, developing more general and capable problem-solving systems, known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).’
DeepMind made an initial impact by using its AI methods to beat a professional Go game champion and by learning to play from scratch 49 different Atari games – based only on the pixels and the score on the screen.
DeepMind’s intention was to use these gaming challenges as a basis upon which to develop solutions to major, real world problems.
Indeed DeepMind’s AI technology has been applied successfully in the biomedical field – for example in identifying early signs of retinal disease from eye scans and the detection of breast cancer from mammography scans.
The company’s strategy is to use advanced AI methodology known as machine learning and neural networks to power its predictions.
As a further real world, major biomedical challenge, DeepMind decided to focus its attention on making much-needed improvements in our ability to predict accurate 3D structures of proteins based on the linear polymeric sequence of amino acids – which are encoded in our genes and arranged like the beads on a string.

The importance of protein folding

 
Before looking at what was achieved by DeepMind’s latest version of AlphaFold, we need to consider why it is that being able to predict the different 3D origami structures into which different proteins fold up is such a big deal.
This is because proteins perform the biological functions that are required for life – whether, for example, that be catalysing a biochemical reaction, recognising an infection, or enabling muscles to contract. And knowing the 3D shape of proteins is important because it is a foundational principal in biology that structure determines function, in the same way that the design and shape of a piece of furniture – say a chair, table or bed – dictates how it is used.
Overall, proteins fall into two main structural classes: globular proteins, which are compact, spherical and soluble, and others that are elongated, fibrous and insoluble. 
Within these broad classes, individual proteins fold up into a unique shape, the exact details of which define the jobs they carry out. So determining the precise 3D structure of a given protein is a crucial part of understanding how it performs its function in the cell and in the body – and therefore is vital to understanding the molecular basis of life itself.
Truly a grand challenge!
Furthermore, as I address later, in addition to the importance of being able to predict protein structure for our fundamental molecular comprehension of life, there are also huge practical benefits – for example in understanding and treating disease and in the design of proteins for practical use in the biotechnology industry.
So no pressure there either!
The historical context
It’s important, too, to view the protein folding grand challenge in its historical context.
The so-called ‘Central Dogma of molecular biology’ was originally hypothesised in a conference lecture in 1957 by the British physicist-turned-biologist Francis Crick. In that talk, Crick famously used the memorable depiction ‘DNA → RNA → protein’, where the arrows indicate the ‘flow of information’. Crick of course later won the Nobel Prize with Jim Watson (and also Maurice Wilkins with a major contribution from the by then sadly deceased Rosalind Franklin) for their research published in 1953 in which they solved the double-helix structure of DNA – and which revealed the explanation for how genetic information encoded by the sequence of base pairs in the double helix can be precisely copied.
Also importantly, Crick’s extraordinary insight into the fundamental molecular information flow of life proposed correctly in broad terms how the 1D linear sequence of bases in DNA – making up the genetic code – could be translated, via the corresponding 1D messenger RNA sequences, into the 1D sequence of amino acid building blocks that make up the polypeptide chains of proteins. 
However, although brilliant, the Central Dogma did not explain at all how the linear amino acid chains are folded up into the correct twists and turns of the proteins that make up the 3D molecular machines of life.
Twelve years later, in another important conference lecture delivered in 1969, the American molecular biologist Cyrus Levinthal estimated that the number of theoretically possible configurations that a representative polypeptide chain might adopt could be as high as the mind-blowing number of 10300 – meaning that the protein would take longer to fold correctly than the age of the then-known universe. This is in stark contrast to the observed ability of proteins to achieve their correct 3D shape in as little time as a few seconds. The conundrum became known as the Levinthal Paradox of protein folding.
A further three years later, in 1972, the US biochemist Christian Afinson won the Nobel Prize for the ‘thermodynamic hypothesis’ – based on his studies of the protein called ribonuclease, and ‘in particular the relationship between the amino acid sequence and the biologically active conformation’. 
Afinson concluded his Nobel prize lecture paper with a look into the future when it would be possible predict how the 3D shape of a protein structure could relate to its corresponding genetic code and amino acid sequence, saying: 
‘Empirical considerations of the large amount of data now available on correlations between sequence and three dimensional structure, together with an increasing sophistication in the theoretical treatment of the energetics of polypeptide chain folding, are beginning to make more realistic the idea of the a priori prediction of protein conformation. It is certain that major advances in the understanding of cellular organization, and of the causes and control of abnormalities in such organization, will occur when we can predict, in advance, the three dimensional, phenotypic consequences of a genetic message.’
The Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) ‘competition’

Despite gradual progress being made, in 1994 the frustratingly limited ability to correctly predict the 3D conformation of proteins from the constituent amino acid sequence led a group of structural biologists to set up the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) ‘competition’. Note that the organisers don’t like the term ‘competition’ and prefer ‘experiment’, but to outsiders it certainly looks like a competition!
The aim of this biennial exercise is to accelerate progress. Every two years around a hundred research teams strive to see how accurately their computational methods can predict the 3D structures of proteins for which the solutions have been revealed by painstaking empirical structure determination – typically done by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy – but not yet publicly released. 
Because the entrants in the protein structure prediction Olympics are asked to predict the structures of a hundred proteins ‘blind’, CASP really does challenge each team’s ability to make accurate estimates. 
To provide a bit of technical detail, the accuracy of protein folding predictions is measured by the so-called global distance test or GDT. This compares the predicted 3D structure of a given protein with the experimentally determined conformation – which represents the so-called ‘ground truth.’
In the latest round – CASP 14, which was run over several months last year – DeepMind’s new AlphaFold AI technology (referred to as AlphaFold2) blew the other entrants away by achieving a median GDT score of 92.4 across all the proteins to be solved in the competition – with 100 being the highest possible score. 
This would effectively represent 100% perfect accuracy, with all the atoms in the amino acids being in the precisely correct position. Anything over 90 is comparable with the results of laborious experimental determinations of protein structures and is considered as a correct solution that scientists can rely on with confidence. 
For the hardest category of all – known as free-modelling, where the teams are asked to predict protein structures that do not have any comparable related protein structures available as template guides – the new AlphaFold2 technology achieved the remarkable median GDT score of 87.0. 
Overall, the DeepMind team’s predictions had an average error (calculated technically as the root-mean-square deviation or RMSD) of approximately 1.6 Ångströms – where one Ångström is equal to 1 x 10-10 metres or 0.0000000001 metre. This means that the error in prediction is as small as the estimated width of a carbon atom (1.4 Ångströms). 
So not too bad at all!
To emphasise just how much progress had been made, compare the above-mentioned AlphaFold2 median GDT score of 92.4 with the score achieved by DeepMind’s previous version of AlphaFold, which was around 70-75. This earlier version won the CASP 13 exercise in 2018 – representing the first major impact of AI on protein structure prediction. Before that the GDT scores achieved in several previous CASP competitions were down around the 60 mark.
Importantly, the new AlphaFold2 AI predictions in CASP 14 worked well across a wide range of different types of protein, which is obviously important for the general application of the methodology.
An interesting and topical protein in the competition was the SARS-CoV-2 virus protein ORF8, the structure of which was subsequently published.
ORF8 is a rapidly evolving coronavirus protein that has been implicated in immune evasion. Not only did AlphaFold accurately forecast the conformation of the components of the 3D shape known as antiparallel β-sheets – a common structural motif found in proteins – but even more impressively, the new methodology apparently also got it right in forecasting the spatial location of the loops that connect the β-sheets together. Such loops are notoriously difficult challenges in structure prediction.
Positive reception
The response of experts in the field of protein folding was widely very positive, although it was acknowledged that a full analysis of the new AlphaFold2 AI approach must await formal peer review and publication – as duly occurred with the earlier version of AlphaFold – and some commentators pointed out the current inevitable limitations.
A news piece in the leading journal Science quoted the expert computational protein scientist Janet Thornton as saying, ‘What the DeepMind team has managed to achieve is fantastic and will change the future of structural biology and protein research.’ The Science report also quotes the Nobel Prize-winning structural biologist Venki Ramakrishnan, who described the work as ‘a stunning advance on the protein folding problem’.
Similarly, in a Nature news piece the computational biologist and co-founder of CASP John Moult said: ‘This is a big deal. In some sense the problem is solved.’ And the same news article also quotes Andrei Lupas, who studies protein evolution, as saying: ‘This will change everything’. Not surprisingly Lupas was impressed that AlphaFold enabled him to determine in half an hour the structure of a protein that he’d failed to solve for 10 years!
More detailed commentaries last November aimed at experts in protein informatics can be found on the Oxford Protein Informatics Group's blog and Mohammed AlQuraishi's blog.
How was it done?


 
In terms of how the AlphaFold2 breakthrough was actually achieved, last year DeepMind provided some initial information. The Science news piece paraphrases John Jumper from the AlphaFold team as saying that they combined deep learning with an ‘attention algorithm’ that mimics how humans assemble a jigsaw puzzle. 
The team used a computer network built around 128 machine learning processors to train the algorithm on the 170,000 experimentally determined protein structures in Protein Data Base or PDB. DeepMind also said that the AlphaFold team used large databases containing protein sequences of unknown structure.
What was also clear is that the AlphaFold2 predictions would have required an awesome amount of compute power and benefited from intense team working at DeepMind.
The details are now made fully transparent in last month’s Nature publication. There, the authors state: ‘Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.’
 They also confirm that the neural network AlphaFold system they developed is a completely different model from their earlier approach used successfully in the previous CASP event.
In addition, the authors comment: ‘AlphaFold greatly improves the accuracy of structure prediction by incorporating novel neural network architectures and training procedures based on the evolutionary, physical and geometric constraints of protein structure. In particular, we demonstrate a new architecture to jointly embed multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and pairwise features, a new output representation and associated loss which enable accurate end-to-end structure prediction, a new equivariant attention architecture, use of intermediate losses to achieve iterative refinement of predictions, masked MSA loss to jointly train with structure, learning from unlabelled protein sequences using self-distillation, and self-estimates of accuracy.’
For those needing it, further detail is provided in the text of the Nature publication and associated supplementary data. Also the source code for the AlphaFold2 model, trained weights and inference script are made freely available under an open-source license.
What are the benefits of AlphaFold’s predictive power?

Access to the source code and other details not only allows independent validation of the AlphaFold2 predictions, but also researchers can now use the methodology to predict structures for their own proteins of interest.
An immediate and important benefit is that free access to AlphaFold’s protein structure predictions is enabled by DeepMind and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) through their AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. So researchers worldwide can use the predictive powers of DeepMind in their research. 
Deep Mind is to be commended for this altruistic behaviour which will greatly widen the impact of its work.
As mentioned, the new AlphaFold machine learning system was used in the follow-up Nature paper to predict the 3D structures at scale for almost 99% of all 20,000 human proteins that are now in the database.
As well as the human proteome, the database also currently contains ~350,000 protein structures including most of the proteins present from 20 model organisms –  including those from organisms commonly used in biomedical research, such as the bacterium E.coli, fruit fly, mouse, zebrafish and disease pathogens such as the malaria parasite and the tuberculosis bacterium.
In the second Nature article on AlphaFold2 published last month, the authors summarised both the overall performance of the new methodology and also the limits – as applied to 98.5% of the human proteins with full amino acid chain prediction. 
In comparison to experimental determination over many decades that has provided structural coverage of only 17% of the total amino residues present in human protein sequences, AlphaFold now provides a dataset at scale that covers 58% of amino acid residues with a confident prediction – and within this dataset there is a subset for which 36% of all residues are predicted with very high confidence.
At the individual protein level, AlphaFold2 gives a confident prediction for at least three quarters of the amino acid sequence in the case of 44% of human proteins. 
The authors say they have obtained high-quality structural predictions for human proteins ‘across a broad range of gene ontology (GO) terms, including pharmaceutically relevant classes such as enzymes and membranes’.
In the second Nature paper, the authors provide three interesting, illustrative examples of de novo predictions for the 3D structures of human proteins lacking significant templates, namely the transmembrane enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, another enzyme diacylgycerol O-acetyltransferase 2, and the transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum protein wolframin for which mutations are linked to the rare genetic condition, Wolfram Syndrome. The three structures suggest biological hypotheses that can now be followed up – and this will be true for the predicted structures of very large numbers of other proteins.
There are however many regions across human proteins for which 3D structure cannot be predicted with confidence. Moreover, it is not surprising that the first author of the first of the two recent AlphaFold2 Nature publications John Jumper has commented: ‘It seems that in many cases where AlphaFold struggles it is because the protein itself is “disordered,” with no inherent structure in isolation.’ 
This is a significant limitation given that disordered regions comprise between 37 and 50% of human proteins – but it is noted that it is useful in itself to be able to predict which are the intrinsically disordered regions. In fact, predicting these regions computationally is the subject of a research community challenge in its own right.
It should be stressed that although prediction of full-length protein structure is always desirable, the ability to predict accurately the 3D shape of individual domains within proteins can be very valuable.
Also to be highlighted is the speed of the protein predictions. The first author of the second of the two recent AlphaFold Nature publications, Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, has said that it took AlphaFold2 only around 48 hours to obtain the 350,000 protein predictions – an astonishing speed, especially compared with the typically laborious pace of experimental structure determination.
Overall the results provided show that excellent and exciting progress has been made in protein prediction using AlphaFold2 – while also revealing the scope for substantial further improvement.
The benefits are likely to be far reaching, both now and into the future. 
The co-founder and CEO of DeepMind – and also last author on the two Nature papers –  Demis Hassabis told Fortune magazine that the publication of AlphaFold’s structure predictions was his company’s ‘biggest contribution to science to date [and] an example of the benefits AI can bring to society’. See more comments from Hassabis in his recent blog post.
Fortune also quoted very positive views from Elizabeth Blackburn (University of California San Francisco), Paul Nurse (Francis Crick Institute) and Ewan Birney (EMBL-EBI). These biomedical research leaders and many others have praised AlphaFold’s accurate and large-scale protein prediction capability, with many seeing it as the biggest breakthrough since the determination of the human genome sequence around 20 years ago – and arguably similar in scale and impact.
A Nature editorial last month reported a consensus view that ‘it’s too early to predict exactly what impact the application of AI in the life sciences will have, except that any impact will be transformative.’


What is the likely impact on drug discovery?

There is no doubt that AlphaFold’s AI-powered protein prediction technology will greatly benefit fundamental research (understanding the structure and function of life), the biotechnology industry (engineering proteins as molecular machines and foods) and of course – as has been much promoted if not hyped in the coverage – the discovery of new drugs.
Most of the new drugs that we discover today for cancer and other diseases exert their effects by targeting particular proteins in the body. Ideally, we wish to design small-molecule drugs to bind very precisely to a tiny region of the overall target protein so as to alter its function. Medicinal chemists will always prefer to have an accurate 3D protein structure so they can apply structure-based drug design – thereby helping them to achieve as ‘perfect fit’ as possible alongside multiple other optimised properties.
And the 3D protein structure is important even before the drug discovery phase begins – by helping the drug discovery team to assess the druggability of the target protein – the extent to which it has pockets or grooves that allow small-molecule compounds to bind.
 This allows researchers to understand which targets are relatively straightforward to drug and which ones will represent a major challenge. Such information can be extremely useful in prioritising which protein targets to pursue and the approach to be taken.
Here at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, we developed the canSAR knowledgebase which integrates massive multidisciplinary data to enable objective target assessment and prioritisation and already incorporates AI and machine learning techniques to predict druggability. We not only use canSAR in our own drug discovery research at the ICR, but we also made it freely available for use by researchers worldwide. As mentioned earlier, we have recently celebrated canSAR’s 10th anniversary.
There was certainly a buzz among my drug discovery colleagues at the ICR as we read the news last November about the AlphaFold2 breakthrough and discussed the potential impact on drug discovery. Our Head of Data Science, Professor Bissan Al-Lazikani who created canSAR, was in fact – early in her career – part of the team that won CASP4 in 2000. 
Bissan has written in the Spectator magazine about what she feels this discovery could mean for her field – concluding: ‘If we can effectively harness Deepmind’s technology, we will gain a much better understanding of all the proteins and mutations that cause cancers. It will help us to accurately design and discover better, safer drugs that could successfully treat or cure countless people.’
In the canSAR team that I am part of, we are currently evaluating for ourselves the impact of AlphaFold2 and incorporating the predicted structure models into the knowledgebase, starting with the human proteins.
But how much does knowledge or accurate prediction of protein structure speed up drug discovery – from target selection to clinical candidate and approved drug? 
I have been personally involved in multiple drug discovery projects at the ICR in which exploiting the 3D structure of the target protein has played a major role. These include the targets Hsp90 in collaboration with Professor Laurence Pearl and AKT/PKB with Professor David Barford. In their different ways, both projects benefited very much from the availability of the protein structure and both resulted in drugs entering clinical trial.
There is no doubt that the ability to predict accurate 3D protein structures is generally very valuable to drug discovery – and also, by the way, in the design of chemical probes to evaluate the role of the target in biology and disease pathology. Indeed the availability of a protein structure can in some cases make or break a drug discovery project – especially where a fragment-based approach is needed.
The AlphaFold team says that it is already collaborating with organisations such as Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) and other partners.
However, the response of some drug discovery professionals to the AlphaFold2 success has been more muted than some of the other commentary. This is exemplified by the views of the medicinal chemist and drug discovery blogger Derek Lowe – both last year and after the Nature publications last month.
While recognising the scientific advance, Derek points out to those uninitiated in the arts of drug discovery that: 1) predicted structures may be not be accurate enough and thus experimentally defined structures may still be needed; and 2) although actual or accurately predicted structures can accelerate the very early phase (let’s say saving an initial year or two) they do not greatly shorten the overall, say, 10 to 15 years that are needed from target selection (following validation) all the way to drug approval for widespread use.
What would represent an even bigger overall acceleration of drug discovery, as Derek rightly suggests, are solving tough problems such as ‘better prediction of useful drug targets, more translatable disease-predictive cell and animal models, and earlier assays that are more predictive of human toxicology.’ Also I would say the speeding up of clinical trials and the regulatory approval stages.
Personally, I think that (in addition to the major benefits in fundamental research) AlphaFold will have big impact on drug discovery – but there is no doubt that after the early stages where AlphaFold will have maximal effect, a lot remains to be done to discover and develop a drug where an accurate 3D protein structure has little to contribute. 
However, as my colleagues and I have discussed, the application of big data and AI approaches more generally (ie beyond AlphaFold and protein structure determination) is clearly beginning to show benefit across the drug discovery and clinical continuum, with great potential to have further impact.
Has the Levinthal Paradox been resolved?
The answer to this is a definite no.
At least for now, what has been achieved by AlphaFold is not an answer to the question of the mechanisms by which proteins actually achieve the correct 3D fold, but rather only so far the ability to predict way more accurately than before the end result of protein folding. 
The ultimate resolution of the Levinthal Paradox will require the physics and chemistry of the mechanisms by which proteins achieve their correct fold to be worked out. It’s possible, however, that this might be approached by ‘deconvoluting’ the AI system used by AlphaFold.
What is still left to be done?
Going beyond the 20,000 human proteins and more than 350,000 proteins overall for which AlphaFold2 has provided predicted 3D structures, DeepMind’s ambition is to increase this number to 130 million – approximately 50% of all known proteins – by the end of the year. That would be astonishingly rapid. And presumably the remaining extant proteome as well. 
Beyond that and continuing to enhance the accuracy of protein structure prediction, what further challenges lie ahead for AlphaFold and other AI-driven approaches?
The use of AlphaFold2’s deep learning and neural networks approach to predict the following will be extremely important:

Structures of intrinsically disordered regions
Conformational changes and protein dynamics
Effects of post-translational protein modifications
Structures of multi-protein complexes

DeepMind and also others will continue to refine the deep learning methodology. For example, inspired by the CASP14 performance of AlphaFold2, last month a team of academics published their results showing their use of a ‘three-track neural network’ to obtain structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14.
 Published just before the AlphaFold2 Nature papers came out, the approach – named RoseTTAFold – has performed well in predicting blind structures of 69 proteins and shows potential to predict complexes of unknown structure with more than three chains.
Final comments

Image: Protein crystals for X-ray crystallography.
It is important to recognise, as DeepMind scientists have done, the contribution of decades of work since the 1950s and 60s by structural biology researchers using wet lab methods (X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and now cryo-EM) to produce the body of high-quality, experimental protein structures and their deposition, curation and public availability via the Protein Data Bank (PDB) ‘as an enduring public good to promote basic and applied research and education across the sciences’.
Also to be highlighted I think is the role of the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) which has accelerated the output and open sharing – prior to formal publication – of protein structures and other reagents, ‘focusing explicitly on less well-studied areas of the human genome’.
These efforts have been critical enablers of AlphaFold’s subsequent success.
It’s important to emphasise that structural biologists will not be made redundant by AlphaFold2. They will be continue to be essential for fundamental and drug discovery research, including validating AI-predicted structures and pushing the boundaries of understanding how 3D structures enable the basic processes of life and disease.
And structural biologists will now incorporate AI methods to accelerate experimental protein structure determination, as in the case of the recent use of cryo-EM combined with deep learning-based structure prediction from AlphaFold2 to produce an atomic model for full-length SARS-CoV-2 Nsp2 protein – with implications for a functional role in RNA binding and potential application for drug design.
Overall, I believe that AlphaFold2 is a major advance along the technological journey of predicting the 3D structure of life’s proteins and that it will have a profound impact in accelerating our overall understanding of the fundamental structure-function basis of life and disease. 
And it will contribute to a continued acceleration of the application of AI to drug discovery and biotechnology.
The journey continues.

Update - August 2022
In partnership with EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), AlphaFold announced just a few days ago (28 July 2022) that they are releasing the predicted structures for ‘nearly all catalogued proteins known to science’. 
The release will dramatically expand the AlphaFold database by more than 200 times – from almost 1 million structures to more than 200 million structures.

The power of AI lies in its potential to improve lives, but this potential can only be realized if AI represents the entire population. Increasing diversity in AI development is crucial to delivering equitable outcomes.Have you read?5 ways to improve gender equality in the workplace8 female CEOs on bridging the gender gap in techWhy AI is failing the next generation of womenBias in AI is a real concern and it’s generating more attention. Gartner predicts that in 2022, 85% of AI projects will deliver erroneous outcomes owing to bias in data, algorithms or the teams responsible for managing them. One of the more effective ways to address bias in AI is to engage diverse teams throughout the process. Diversity means including a variety of perspectives from different ethnicities, genders, ages, skills and experiences in the teams developing AI. Such diversity can enable AI teams to develop more products that can have a positive impact on a wider audience of users.Women are very much underrepresented in AI and in the tech industry more broadly. A 2020 World Economic Forum report on gender parity suggests women account for only 26% of data and AI positions in the workforce. We need to get more women into AI.Share of male and female workers across professional clusters Image: World Economic ForumIncreasing gender diversityTo help promote gender diversity, there are some basic steps companies and the larger community can take: 1. Support STEM educationOne of the reasons there are not more women in AI has its roots in childhood, long before young women enter the workforce. Social and cultural influences – like the false stereotype that girls are not as in tune with maths and science as boys – have often discouraged girls from pursuing STEM-related paths in the past. By the time they reach college, they’ve selected other options and it becomes difficult to switch gears. The few women in STEM classes generally receive limited resources about the different options available to them in AI. In order to engage girls early, Girl Scouts across the nation have been participating in extracurricular STEM education programmes aimed at increasing interest, confidence and competence in STEM. The organization has pledged to add 2.5 million young women to the STEM workforce by 2025 and has collaborated with a number of industry leader to help prepare these women to be future STEM leaders. 2. Showcase female AI trailblazersHaving visible female scientists and AI leaders in business and society is an effective way to highlight opportunities for women in AI and counter negative cultural stereotypes about females not belonging in STEM. Every time we talk about AI – whether it’s in panel discussions, at events or on social media – it’s important to have an equal number of women participating. A new generation of female scientists can be inspired and talented women will be attracted to a workforce that exhibits gender inclusivity.3. Mentor women for leadership rolesMentorship is critical for those women who do eventually make it to a career in AI. In the past, mentorship has not come from organization-led programmes, but from other places like associations or academia. These women and men have helped their mentees set expectations, identify opportunities and overcome barriers. Where mentorship programmes do exist in companies they’re often only available to leadership, but that’s starting to change. Now AI-supported apps are being used to connect entry and mid-level workers with mentors no matter their location. After using one such app, one company’s mentees indicated they had 218% more clarity toward their career path and felt 178% more equipped to achieve their goals within the company after just six months.4. Create equal opportunities Implicit biases in many companies’ recruiting processes pose another barrier to women from entering and advancing in AI. These biases take the forms of gendered language in job titles and descriptions and a lack of diversity in the hiring process. In addition, there is a lack of clarity and direction about the range of roles and industries in which women can work in AI. For example, a degree in AI isn’t always needed.The time has come to hire and promote women to at least 50% of the high-growth AI positions and to help position them for success. Breaking down the barriers women face in the workplace can help companies achieve a more inclusive culture. Without them, AI algorithms won’t function as well out of the gate.The number of female students awarded a STEM degree or certificate in the US has risen over the most recent period Image: Statista5. Ensure a gender-equal reward systemEqual pay for equal work is fair and helps not just to recruit women, but to retain them. Unfortunately, many women who have been in tech roles for nearly a decade have considered leaving because of inadequate compensation and an inability to advance professionally. Organizations should be accountable and transparent in disclosing gender gaps within their AI workforce as well as how they plan to address those gaps. Such plans should be data-based to provide an accurate gauge of progress.Eliminating pay gaps in AI roles can make the field more viable in retaining women. Nearly 60 years after the US Equal Pay Act passed, men still earn about 20% more than women. Fortunately the tide is slowly turning. Several high-profile US companies, including technology giants and national hospitality leaders, have reached full parity in pay for women and minorities.A bright future for women in AIMany organizations and workforces are just beginning their AI journeys and are realizing the value gender diversity can offer in AI. Organizations that place more women in their AI teams not only help increase gender equality in the industry; they can deliver more value to their own business and customers. While there is still much work to be done, change is on the horizon and the future is bright for women in AI.Don't miss any update on Education, Gender and WorkSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Equity, Diversity and InclusionEmerging TechnologiesShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

What Is Formative AI? Exploring the Future of Artificial Intelligence
By Jenna Phipps

August 13, 2021 


Enterprise Storage Forum content and product recommendations are editorially independent. We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies improve automation and efficiency in data centers and storage infrastructures. Some AI-influenced networks and systems still require heavy human interaction, but recent advances in intelligence have increased the amount of work that artificial systems and machines can perform, as well as their accuracy. One of these innovations is formative artificial intelligence.
Up until now, artificial intelligence technology has largely used learned reasoning to automate tasks (like telling a storage node to increase capacity), detect potential threats or anomalies in systems and alert human administrators, or other jobs that it can be trained to do. Formative AI goes far beyond that by allowing computer systems to create digital content, rather than just refine existing processes. This new approach is so revolutionary that some experts are questioning Formative AI’s effect on the job market — even its effect on judicial systems.

AI in Storage and Data Centers

What Is Formative AI?
Formative AI is an emerging artificial intelligence technology that focuses on the ability of AI to generate and process accurate digital content. It first gained widespread attention when Gartner mentioned it in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies 2020 report. According to recent research, formative AI “dynamically adapts” to changes in systems and data.
Arguably, artificial intelligence is supposed to dynamically change depending on the input of data and the given situation; in this context, formative AI doesn’t sound like anything new. But both AI and machine learning require immense amounts of data input in order to analyze and develop an understanding of that data and how to utilize it. This learning process takes time. Formative AI makes much quicker adjustments based on rapid changes in systems, software, or infrastructure.
Formative AI poses possibilities for data centers and storage infrastructures, as well as networks, threat intelligence systems, and software development. Though it’s in its infancy, formative AI suggests greater intelligence and initiative from computing systems, which ideally will provide more automation and accuracy.
Formative AI doesn’t just have implications for the high-performance computing world. It promises to make content creation and technological designs easier. These possible applications include vehicle and machinery designs, graphic art, written text, or engineering diagrams—anything that a computer could realistically look at samples of and then design its own. Formative AI systems could even design realistic-looking human faces.

This premise is exciting for enterprises that want to fiercely compete in their industry by improving designs, whether those designs are digital (a mobile app, for instance) or physical (like a new part for a car). It also poses concerns, in an already uncomfortable job market, for employees who fear finding themselves ousted from their positions by some well-trained servers and software. 
Types of Formative AI
Formative AI encompasses augmented design and development, big data processing, and ontologies and graphs. However, here we’re covering two of the major fields of artificial intelligence in formative systems. They’ve received the computing community’s attention as possible uses for these artificial technologies become more widespread, relevant to many industries (not just tech).
Generative AI
Generative AI is content generation performed by artificially intelligent systems. This can include:

Photo editing (adding color or making updates where needed)
Visual art (such as prints) based on existing pieces
Video editing
Audio generation, including realistic vocal production and music composition
Text content and caption generation.

Generative AI is particularly promising for business fields such as content marketing and design — companies that require large, regular amounts of copy and visual marketing content will benefit from its automated design. It can also generate realistic-looking human faces, which don’t belong to any one person but resemble a photograph of a live human being. We’ll come back to this later.
One hard-to-picture advantage of generative artificial intelligence is its lack of human perception. Human understanding and bias sometimes places often-unrecognized limits on design: people just don’t always imagine what’s possible. But a generative computer system, which has none of those prior experiences, just uses volumes of data to craft potential designs. Generative AI opens the design world to ideas that people ordinarily might not imagine.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
A generative adversarial network is a type of machine learning that was originally developed by pitting two neural networks against each other in a game. One neural network is a generative network (similar to the AI discussed above) and the other is a discriminative network. The generator creates synthetic pieces of content, perhaps an image, and the discriminator must identify which content shown to it is generated or real. A discriminatory model receives input variables and must place them in the correct location, while a generative model creates an example.
The benefit of GANs is twofold: developing in networks the ability to generate realistic content (generative) and the ability to distinguish fake, or machine-created content. Each neural network sharpens the other; one improves in creating artificial work, while the other improves in telling the difference. The discriminatory network is important because formative AI, while useful, can be a source of fraud as well as legitimate business content creation.
Uses for Formative AI
New concept though it may be, some major corporations are already implementing or supporting formative AI technologies. These include IBM and NVIDIA. NVIDIA is using generative adversarial networks to train machines to perform predictive analytics from a synthetic set of data; it has also created an AI model that uses a limited pool of data to create synthetic artwork. IBM is researching how generative AI models can increase the discovery phase of drug design through virtual molecule creation.
Synthesis AI, a company that produces synthetic data and trains machines on it, has developed computer vision technology using generative AI. The company’s intent is to shift from heavy human supervised learning to a greater reliance on machines, which can identify images using generative AI and computer vision much more quickly. Camera applications can benefit from GANs, too: these networks learn to identify faces more accurately, which could improve surveillance techniques.
Potential Drawbacks and Dangers of Formative AI
Because generative networks can create realistic content, there is a risk that synthetic images, for example, can be used for fraud. Generative technology could eventually create synthetic video and photo content that falsifies real people. The use of deep learning to falsify people’s words or actions is called a deepfake. Security companies are already pointing out that this false content is a concern.
This isn’t a comprehensive overview of deepfakes or generative AI, but it raises some ethical issues:

A well-placed, falsified video or photo could ruin someone’s reputation. It could also be used politically, perhaps to influence voters.
AI has developed so quickly that lawmakers have had little time to keep up, so there aren’t yet many existing legal precedents for handling deepfakes when they come up.
Generative adversarial networks are designed to both create realistic content and locate synthetic content, so there’s a possibility for AI to be pitted against itself and detect false photos or images, too.

Fear of fraudulent content isn’t the working world’s only concern about AI, though. They’re afraid that eventually, artificial systems will remove their jobs. The era of artificial intelligence is not the first time a technological shift has drastically changed work habits: the Industrial Revolution caused myriad working-class adults, as well as children, to leave their home trades and work long, set factory shifts.
For at least the foreseeable future, generative technologies won’t change the job market that drastically. There are a couple of reasons:

Technology takes time to develop. The term “formative AI” was just officially coined by Gartner in mid-2020. Generative technologies are still in their relative infancy. Even once they make their way into every corner of industry, people will still be responsible for designing and learning generative design software and running those applications.
Though generative design and formative AI pose impressive potential benefits, no one knows how reliable they will be, especially in their infancy. If a generative computer system designs something that doesn’t work, there isn’t much anyone can do about it, other than start the process over.

Though it’s wise to consider the possible long-term effects of artificial intelligence on jobs as your career develops, formative and generative AI won’t usurp most positions just yet.
Artificial intelligence poses more legal issues than fraud, too. As it’s been implemented so quickly over the past decade or so, lawmakers struggle to keep up. Courts, then, have the challenge of applying existing laws to AI technologies, and manufacturers of intelligent computer systems can be held responsible for any broken regulations, according to Berkeley Law. However, generative systems, which will have greater autonomy in creating designs and will potentially have less relationship to humans, might be a bit more difficult to hold to judicial standards. 
AI in Storage and Data Centers
AI offers a variety of benefits for data centers and storage infrastructures. In addition to the automation of basic administrative and monitoring tasks, which removes burdens from IT professionals, intelligent systems can:

Shift storage volumes or workloads to locations where they can run most effectively
Detect problems, such as outages or network slowdowns, more quickly.
Create reports automatically when such problems arise.
Help with threat intelligence, alerting IT administration when strange trends arise.
Perform sensor data analytics once sensor data is uploaded to the cloud from remote locations.
Update and patch software.
Dynamically provision servers when they’re needed on short notice.

AI that both adds metadata to data and analyzes existing metadata is particularly important for object storage. In stores and lakes that hold large volumes of unstructured data, artificial intelligence can more efficiently sort or search identifying information about that data. AI and object storage are an important partnership; large organizations need object storage for both its scalability and its lower costs, and they’ll need intelligent automated systems to manage object-stored data.
Data and AI have a somewhat symbiotic relationship in modern data centers and big data applications: in most cases, intelligent systems and machine learning platforms require large volumes of data initially to be trained. But data science also needs AI and machine learning to extract the most relevant insights and implement them to improve storage and infrastructure. AI, predictive analytics, automation, and big data all go hand in hand.
Data lakes and object storage will be essential to the growth of generative design and formative AI technologies. They store massive amounts of structured and unstructured data, including large multimedia files, that machines need to learn how to create models and designs. In the rapidly-advancing development of formative artificial intelligence, data storage will play a crucial role.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  It can be difficult for financial institutions to keep up with the rapid changes in the digital marketing and advertising landscape. There are numerous factors which are susceptible to change, and they all have an effect on how useful certain marketing strategies are. As the internet and advertising evolve, some companies may find it important to consider an automated solution to driving efficiency in marketing. In this article, we cover two examples of AI-powered marketing applications. Each vendor that offers these applications provides evidence of success with their digital platform, and so we can infer that at least some financial institutions benefited from the adoption of these systems. The solutions we cover are: IBM Cognos Analytics: Formerly IBM Watson Analytics, this is IBM’s AI business intelligence platform. It is purportedly capable of helping financial institutions analyze advertising data to find the most successful marketing campaigns. AI-powered Analytics for Card-Linked Marketing: Cardlytics’ AI platform that can utilize transactional data from credit and debit cards to drive efficiency in targeted digital ads. The first AI marketing application we cover is IBM’s Cognos Analytics platform. IBM Cognos Analytics (Formerly Watson Analytics) Many AI applications for marketing agencies and internal marketing teams are advertised as business intelligence solutions. They focus on the ability to analyze large amounts of data at once and share the insights from that data across multiple user endpoints.  Additionally, offerings from larger companies may include the ability to take in data of various types and from various sources. A financial institution would simply need to run this type of analytics application using their advertising data, and they would be able to gain an understanding of which of their advertisements work the best. Another way this type of application could drive efficiency is in advertising expense reporting. Analysts require reports using the most recent data in order to gain an understanding of how well marketing campaigns are engaging customers.  If these reports take a considerable amount of time to produce, business leaders will be waiting even longer for their insights from the analysts. Automating this process can help financial institutions make the most important decisions faster.  We spoke to Sasha Caskey, CTO of Kasisto, about this on our podcast, AI in Banking. When asked about where he believes AI is actually driving value in banking and financial tasks, Caskey said: One of the places where AI has been the most impactful …  broadly and specifically around banking is really in taking over some of those mundane repetitive tasks that people have to do. … it’s able to shave off a layer of work that people have to do by essentially boiling down the problem to a set of numbers that people can look at make an informed decision about. This approach of freeing up human employees to make the kind of informed decisions marketing leaders need to daily could be an early driver of efficiency when adopting an AI solution. IBM is a vendor that offers this type of analytics application to clients in the financial industry and marketing agencies that work with banking and financial clients. Its software, Cognos Analytics, is an AI platform capable of data mining and predictive modeling. This means it is likely built with predictive analytics and a machine learning algorithm trained on advertising and engagement data. Below is a video that explains some capabilities available on the Cognos Analytics platform. The capabilities covered in this video include: Adding attributes to names of customers for more granular analysis Creating dashboards for readable visualizations of important insights Creating expense reports for review by management and human resources teams  IBM lists a case study on their website in which they claim to have helped IMM Marketing Agency utilize their clients’ numerous datasets in order to more accurately target their digital advertisements.  IMM purportedly buys thousands of internet advertisements every day, and so making sure they are properly targeted to the right demographics is a high priority.  Digital marketing teams may find difficulty in continually optimizing targeted advertisements because online customer behavior can be hard to keep track of and predict. This requires near-constant monitoring of responses to the advertisements and adapting their marketing styles for the next iteration.  IBM’s analytics solutions purportedly helped accomplish this by analyzing large amounts of data at a time and delivering records of conversion rates, impressions, and click-through rates for each digital advertisement.  This means analysts were able to gain a detailed understanding of the engagement rates of previous advertisements quickly before running their own more granular experiments. According to the case study, IMM was able to start savings tens of thousands of dollars simply by how fast they could now determine if a given advertisement approach was succeeding. IMM also claims they can use IBM’s analytics platform to bring up incremental sales and add more value in the ads their clients spend money on.  Additionally, marketing reports that purportedly once took 12 hours a day became available within 45 minutes. This would allow IMM’s analysts to focus more on finding the best next step from these insights rather than having to produce the reports themselves. AI-powered Analytics for Card-Linked Marketing Credit card companies and other financial institutions can use spending behavior and other customer information for data science and machine learning projects for marketing and promotional offers.  One way they could accomplish this is to use historical credit and debit card data to better individualize targeted deals from marketing companies. Customers would then receive targeted ads for products they are more likely to purchase. One could broadly describe this technique as “card-linked marketing.”Cardlytics is a vendor that sells this type of AI application to credit card companies and financial institutions. Their software uses customer segments called “purchasegraphics” to match customers with deals they are more likely to take. Purchasegraphics are customer segments, or “demographics,” based on spending data including when the customers spend money and on which products.The company also claims their AI solutions are built to prioritize the privacy of customers’ sensitive information while maintaining accurate targeted ads. There are many factors that can affect which deals are matched with which customer or their associated purchase graphic. These include age, gender, time of year, geolocational data, the types of products purchased, and if these products follow previous purchase behavior.  These demographics are later analyzed for their shopping and financial habits which help the software create new segments of customers that are similar based on what they spend money on.All of these factors are important to enabling card-linked marketing as targeted ads can perturb some customers especially while they are handling their funds.  If customers feel too bombarded with ads that don’t relate to their needs or desires, they may feel less comfortable with using the app or other platform the client financial institution is using. For example, this could contribute to banking customers losing loyalty to their current bank and opening accounts elsewhere. Customer segmentation based on spending behavior can allow banks and credit card companies to focus on the most important criteria within customer data that point to effective targeted ads. This method enables more granular customer matching which can also utilize spending data from credit and debit card swipes.  Each transaction creates a data trail about where the customer spent money, at which merchant, and possibly the names of the products purchased. This may allow a machine learning algorithm to better match customers with offers based on their most recent spending behavior. A financial institution will not need to build any hard rules for their software to recognize differences in individuals when analyzing demographic signifiers. This is because a machine learning model for these applications would not necessarily need prior training to discern that some items are family products such as baby food and diapers.  This is the same for products marketed toward a specific gender such as soaps and razors. The software can come to these conclusions through the implications of their spending habits. However, many people shop for others that they live with. This is why a machine learning model does not make hard determinations about gender, and instead moves individual customers toward an implicit gender.  It is apparent that Carldytics aims to never share personal information from a banking customer with the retailers from which they are getting their marketing information from. Cardlytics’ platform sends performance reports from the client bank’s database to the company’s front-facing marketing team. This team then communicates that information with the retailers.  The retailers most likely use this data to create new marketing strategies, which they can submit back to Cardlytics and be matched to the best customer segment.Cardlytics lists a press release on their website which refers to a case study Celent conducted regarding Bank of America’s “BankAmeriDeals” marketing program. The case study purportedly states that Bank of America became a user of the Cardlytics platform which uses spending data from about 70% of American households. The study also indicated how retailers can reliably dedicate a portion of their marketing budgets on card-linked marketing initiatives and see significant ROI. This could mean that companies looking to target their digitally literate customers in a profitable way may want to look further into use cases for these types of AI applications.   Header Image Credit: Altran Related Posts Big Data in Finance - Current Applications and TrendsInternational Data Corporation (IDC) reported in their  Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Spending Guide… AI in SupTech (Supervisory Technology) - Current Finance ApplicationsWe have identified three areas in finance where companies are applying AI to solve real… AI for Sentiment Analysis in Finance - Current Applications and PossibilitiesSome financial institutions have begun investing in departments that focus on artificial intelligence and machine… AI for Cybersecurity in Finance - Current ApplicationsIn 2017, Equifax’s systems were compromised by hackers, and the data of over 143 million… AI in Building Automation - Current ApplicationsIn our previous report, we covered the current use cases for AI in construction and… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  AI-Enabled Financial Report Automation for Finance LeadersCo-created by YSEOP and Emerj.

Like many states, Wisconsin struggled to process torrents of unemployment insurance claims precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but officials said Thursday they finally cleared a mammoth backlog with the use of AI technology from Google Cloud.
Amy Pechacek, who heads the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, told StateScoop she contracted the work just several weeks after Gov. Tony Evers nominated her last September. A former deputy secretary at the Wisconsin Department of Corrections with experience in crisis management in two Wisconsin county governments, Pechacek said she was immediately struck by the severity of the agency’s operational shortcomings as she sized up a 770,000-claim backlog.
“We are using a 50-year-old mainframe COBOL system,” Pechacek said. “It is literally the black screen with the green blinky cursor where you have to press F5 to navigate. I couldn’t even believe it. I fell off my chair.”
‘It’s insane’

To zero out the backlog, Pechacek said officials handed off historical data to Google so it could train a machine-learning model. The company used it to analyze the state’s backlog and applied “confidence scores” to each application, indicating how likely it was that a given application should be approved or forwarded to human agents for possible rejection.
Beyond operating an aged system powered by an outmoded programming language, Pechacek said, the agency’s operations were also slowed by an absence of any secure form of digital communication with the public. If the workforce agency needed additional documents for a claim, the applicant had two options: regular mail or fax. And as the state paid out billions in benefits, she said, mail poured into “a huge mailroom” for processing, with hundreds of state workers manually entering information into computers.
“You could just see how inefficient this was,” Pechacek said. “This just adds delays, delays, delays. And I don’t know about you, but I haven’t seen a fax machine in 20 years. It’s insane.”
She added that those with questions about their applications can call and talk to someone, but the hours are limited — the call center has to shut down before the mainframe begins batch processing claims at 6 p.m. each day.
But Google helped the state with that, too, developing an online portal allowing the agency to accept photos and documents — basic functionality in 2021 that Pechacek admitted seems ridiculous to celebrate, but that constitutes “a victory” nonetheless.

No more ‘jargon and legalese’
The upgrades also included a rewrite of the state’s application, formerly a confusing 100-question document that Pechacek said she herself completed to see what it was like and failed to answer some of the questions correctly.
“It was full of jargon and legalese and acronyms that were undefined,” she said. “They were counterintuitive, illogical and it was understandable why people were answering the way they were because they were just written very poorly, so we just went through and rewrote the whole thing.”
Google analyzed which questions were tripping people up most frequently so when officials rewrote the questions — in clear, plain language, Pechacek said — they knew where to focus their efforts.
Pechacek said she hired Google after seeing it perform similar for work for Arizona, and said the speed — just a few weeks — with which they deployed solutions for Wisconsin was “fantastic.”

Processing claims quickly has been a balancing act for states as they’ve sought to serve legitimate applicants as quickly as possible while also screening out fraud, which spiked during the pandemic. And Google helped Wisconsin screen for fraud, too, Pechacek said, in several ways.
Applicants are required to authenticate their identities through LexisNexis, which puts the user through questions about their credit history. And Google’s technology screens application data — including IP addresses from abroad or whether the same bank account is used on more than one application — so officials can investigate any claims that look fishy.
While Google’s work relieved Wisconsin of its heavy claims backlog, the legacy mainframe system with its “blinky cursor” remains. Evers signed legislation in January authorizing the workforce department to find a vendor for a modern replacement, and Pechacek said applications for that procurement closed last week. Officials have estimated that project could cost as much as $100 million, but Pechacek said the bright side is that the department is planning for an iterative migration to a cloud-based system that’s followed by yearly reviews of the platform. 
“This is going to be part of our manual review so that Wisconsin never finds itself again with 50-year-old technology because modernization is just something that we are just in a constant state of moving forward,” she said.

Artificial intelligence will be key in that effort by analyzing data and assisting commanders in the decision-making process.The announcement, released by the command’s Artificial Intelligence Integration Center, said the service is “particularly” interested in AI research of autonomous ground and air platforms, “which must operate in open, urban and cluttered environments.” The document specifically asks for research into technologies that allow for robots or autonomous systems to move in urban, contested environments, as well as technologies that reduce the electromagnetic profile of the systems. It also wants to know more about AI that can sense obscure targets and understand terrain obstacles.The document identifies several needs pertaining to data analysis over the next five years. The Army is interested in human-machine interfacing research and needs additional research in ways it can predict an adversary’s intent and behavior on the battlefield. In the same category, the Army wants to be able to fuse data from disparate sources and have analytical capabilities to “exploit” classified and unclassified sources to make “enhanced” intelligence products.The Army also wants to be able to combine human insight with machine analysis and develop improved ways of “efficiently” conveying analytics results to humans.“The Army is interested in AI/ML research in areas which can reduce the cognitive burden on humans and improve overall performance through human-machine teaming,” the announcement read.Similarly, the Army needs more research over the next five years into how to better display data to humans. Data must be presented clearly to users — through charts or graphs, for example — so they can understand what the information means.“The Army is interested in research that enables improved situational awareness and the visualization and navigation of large data sets to enhance operational activities and training and readiness,” the announcement read. Along that same vein, the service is also seeking novel ways of visualizing sensor data and large data sets with multiple sources.The service also wants more research into AI for sensing on the battlefield, including detecting people, equipment and weapons, even when obscured. It wants to sense these targets based on “physical, behavioral, cyber or other signatures.” Additionally, the Army wants AI-enabled sensors and processors that can detect chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive threats.Network and communications security is another area in which the Army wants more research. The service is seeking more research into autonomous network defense and AI-based approaches to offensive cyber capabilities. It also wants novel cyber protection technologies and methods.Additionally, to prepare for potential GPS-denied environments of the future, the Army is interested in research into algorithms and techniques to fuse sources of position, navigation and timing to provide “robust” capabilities.The Internet of Things, or the massive network of devices connected to the internet, presents more artificial intelligence needs for the Army. According to the solicitation, the service is interested in AI research into “new approaches to enable secure, resilient, and automatically managed IoT networks in highly complex, mixed cooperative/adversarial, information-centric environments.”“The Army needs to better integrate a wide range of capabilities and equipment and capitalize on commercial developments in industrial and human IoT,” the solicitation said.About  Andrew EversdenAndrew Eversden covers all things defense technology for C4ISRNET.
