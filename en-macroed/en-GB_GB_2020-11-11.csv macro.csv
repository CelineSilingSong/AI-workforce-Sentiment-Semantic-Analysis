In some cases, this might mean entirely removing traditional aspects of the hiring process.

Introduced in the nineties, applicant tracking systems (ATS), were created to help HR professionals organize the surge of applications that resulted from the growing use of the internet. Over the last several decades, ATS became increasingly advanced, using algorithms to sift through thousands of resumes based on various data. The promise was efficiency and blind hiring, but the algorithms have proven to perpetuate structural inequities in hiring.

Algorithms work by being fed data and then making choices based on that data. If a company’s data set is already skewed towards a specific demographic, like “Harvard graduates who worked at Goldman Sachs,” the algorithm will just perpetuate that. A good example of this is when Amazon realized its AI algorithm preferred male candidates in 2015. Amazon discovered that the algorithm penalized resumes with the word women and was biased against candidates that went to certain women’s colleges.

A new crop of tech companies believes that AI can solve the problem. Founded in 2013, Pymetrics describes itself as a “human-centered AI platform with the vision to realize everyone’s potential with fair and accurate talent matching.”

Pymetrics hiring software doesn’t assess a candidate’s skill set based on past performance. Applicants play a round of games based on neuroscience research exercises that reveal behaviors and skills and then match these skills to different jobs. For companies, these matches give access to a larger, diverse pool of qualified candidates that an ATS might have filtered out. For candidates, the matches expand their job search and potentially make them aware of roles they wouldn’t have originally considered.

“The whole idea behind Pymetrics is that instead of using a resume, you are looking at people’s cognitive, social, and emotional aptitudes [through a combination of neuroscience-based tests and machine learning to match job seekers with openings]. It’s also much more future-facing and potential-oriented, rather than backward-facing and sort of only talking about your past experiences. It’s a much more holistic, hopeful view of someone than, Oh, this is what you’ve done, and this is all you can do,” explained Pymetric CEO Frida Poli in a Quartz at Work interview. Pymetrics says its custom algorithms are rigorously tested for bias.

The concept of blind hiring is also the premise of startup Blendoor, a Tinder-style app for jobs that removes candidates’ gender, race, photos, and names. “[Blendoor] enables companies to hire based on merit, not molds. We are using performance data to train our algorithms rather than historical data sets.” said the company’s founder Stephanie Lampkin in an interview with All Raise.

These companies claim their tools are already working. Pymetrics, which already boasts clients such as the Boston Consulting Group, Accenture, Linkedin, and Unilever, says one of its clients evened out the gender and ethnicity split for applicants. Blendoor says it doubled the number of women it hires and substantially increased minority hires for a client. There is not year rigorous experimental evidence on the effect of these programs.

Gamification and blind hiring present possible effective solutions. But diversity, inclusion, and equity practitioners stress that they only address symptoms of a root issue and are not a panacea to address racial bias in hiring.

“Culture eats strategy for breakfast”, explains Kyanna Wheeler, a racial and equity strategist for the city of Seattle. “Even if a company does manage to improve its racial diversity, is its company culture able to sustain this strategy?” Instead, Wheeler says leaders should work to build an anti-racist company that rethinks the way the company operates. Companies need to dismantle the invisible cultural structures that drive them. “What you really need is a cultural shift. If your company values John Smith, and keeps hiring John Smiths, you have to unpack why this pattern exists.” This approach will take more work and requires accountability, she says.

The platforms themselves might even perpetuate cultural assumptions about talent. Blind hiring removes identity but still bases past work experience as a metric for future success. “We’ve been socialized to believe certain metrics have equal value. Real change means questioning assumptions”, Wheeler says.

There’s also a danger for AI in hiring to be too reductive. Gamification cannot convey context and lived experiences. “If you’re testing for risk, a poor person might be risk-averse but still innovative. Poor communities are known for innovation, they’ve perfected how to do more with less”, says Kirk Mead, Principal at the Carrington Consulting Group, a consultancy specializing in organizational development.

Also, these softwares don’t do anything about helping diverse job seekers find the right companies. After all, a diverse workforce starts with a diverse pool of candidates to pull from. “Algorithms can’t fix pathology. These solutions present a necessary component to solving racial bias but not a sufficient one,” says Mead. “We still have to address the core question of access and opportunity.”

[+] and Technology have proposed the combined discipline of ""Physical AI"" as a means for developing lifelike autonomous robots.AFP via Getty Images
Researchers at Imperial College London have proposed ""physical artificial intelligence"" as a new multidisciplinary area of research that could be vital to producing lifelike intelligent robots in the future.


Writing in the Nature Machine Intelligence journal, the team argue that teaching materials science, mechanical engineering, computer science, biology and chemistry as a combined discipline would help students and researchers develop lifelike artificially intelligent robots.

This combined discipline of ""physical AI"" could effectively be the missing link in the attempt to create artificially intelligent robots that look and behave like humans, the Imperial College London team suggests. They argue that research into how to build lifelike robot bodies has failed to keep up with advances in computational artificial intelligence, and that the study and practice of physical artificial intelligence could rectify this imbalance.

PROMOTED
""The development of robot 'bodies' has significantly lagged behind the development of robot 'brains'. Unlike digital AI, which has been intensively explored in the last few decades, breathing physical intelligence into them has remained comparatively unexplored,"" says Professor Mirko Kovac, of Imperial College London and the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa).

Physical Artificial Intelligence For Remote Tasks
The proposal of Physical AI comes in the context of a growing societal need to perform everyday tasks remotely and automatically, particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and widespread social distancing.

""Today’s robots are not mature and robust enough to perform everyday tasks, such as manipulating objects or moving in unpredictable and complex environments, and are not sufficiently safe to interact with humans and natural outdoor environments,"" the researchers write.

In particular, the team urges a greater focus on the development of novel materials and structures for building robots’ bodies, as well as on the co-development of functional body morphologies and intelligent control and sensor systems. Such work could then be combined with existing research into computer-based artificial intelligence, potentially producing autonomous robots that could interact with their surrounding environments in a more ‘natural’ manner.

If developed, lifelike autonomous robots could potentially help humans at work and in daily living, performing tasks that would otherwise be dangerous, onerous or tedious. They could, for example, assist in health care and social care, helping to plug the global shortage of healthcare workers.
Defining Physical AI
In order to reach such a goal, the researchers propose introducing a systematic educational approach for teaching students and researchers how to create robot bodies and brains as coordinated, unified wholes. They argue that this approach must be centred around physical AI, which they define as ""the theory and practice of creating physical systems capable of performing tasks that are typically associated with intelligent organisms.""
Five main disciplines are essential for creating physical AI, according to the researchers. These are materials science, mechanical engineering, computer science, biology and chemistry.
“The notion of AI is often confined to computers, smartphones and data intensive computation. We are proposing to think of AI in a broader sense and co-develop physical morphologies, learning systems, embedded sensors, fluid logic and integrated actuation,"" says Mirko Kovac.
Collaboration between researchers in different disciplines will also be necessary if physical AI and lifelike robots are to be developed. This is something Imperial College London and Empa are already doing, with their joint Materials and Technology Centre of Robotics connecting Empa’s material science expertise with Imperial’s Aerial Robotics Laboratory.
The Quest For Lifelike Robots
“Creating lifelike robots has thus far been an impossible task, but it could be made possible by including Physical AI in the higher education system. Developing skills and research in Physical AI could bring us closer than ever to redefining human-robot and robot-environment interaction,"" explains co-lead author Dr Aslan Miriyev, also of Empa and Imperial College London.
Both he and Mirko Kovac intend to implement physical AI methodology into their research and teaching activities. However, they aren’t the only people researching how to make autonomous robots that move like humans or other animals.
Most notoriously, Boston Dynamics–a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology–has developed a range of life-mimicking robots in its 28-year existence. This includes Atlas, a bipedal anthropomorphic robot that can perform rudimentary gymnastics. It also includes Spot, a ‘dog’ that can open doors and flip light switches, and that was recently used in Singapore to encourage social distancing.
Other companies are operating in similar areas to Boston Dynamics. US-based Agility Robotics launched its own bipedal anthropomorphic robot, Digit, at the beginning of this year, with Ford purchasing two units in order to research last-mile package delivery. Even Disney has been getting in on the act, with it releasing a video at the end of October of a ""humanoid animatronic bust"" (i.e. an artificial human head) capable of looking at objects and people in its vicinity.
There is, then, plenty of pioneering research happening right now into the production of lifelike robots. But with the team at Imperial College London and Empa defining the new discipline of ""Physical AI,"" such research is likely to be given more impetus and a greater level of systematic organisation.

Smart speakers, deepfake videos, personalised advertising –artificial intelligence is everywhere. Alexander Ilic, head of the new AI research centre at ETH Zurich, wants to make sure AI is there to help humans, not replace them.  
swissinfo.ch: AI increasingly influences our lives. How important is it for society? 
Alexander Ilic: Machines are more and more capable of doing things we thought only humans could do. At the moment, several new technologies are coming together and speeding up progress. ETH Zurich has been strong in AI research for several decades. What we need now is to organise a dialogue with society and business, and we need to do it responsibly. 
swissinfo.ch: Have we reached a turning point? 
A.I.: There are often technological advances that fuel each other. Mobile phones, for example, have changed our society forever. Some people say that in 20 years’ time, AI will be part of our lives like electricity has been since its invention. It will be hard to imagine what life used to be like without it. 



                New AI Research Centre             

 


The new centreExternal link was launched in October with a core team of 29 professorships from seven departments. “We aim to have 100 professorships in the near future,“ director Alexander Illic told a press conference. 
He said AI courses were increasingly popular at ETH. Students from different fields attend these courses, so uniting the different departments around AI makes sense. 
The AI research centre aims to connect Europe’s leading AI hotspots and build bridges between fields of expertise, so that trustworthy, widely accessible and inclusive AI systems can be developed for society. 
The centre is on the ETH compound, but is due to move to a more spacious location in Oerlikon near Zurich in 2022. 


swissinfo.ch: There are already many institutes doing AI research, so was it necessary for ETH to create this centre?   
A.I.: The special thing about our centre is that our work is interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary. It is not only about applying existing AI methods to complex social problems, such as climate change. Some problems require redefining the fundamentals of AI, and that is what we want to do. 
swissinfo.ch: Can you elaborate on that? 
A.I.: The areas of application where we want to bring about change and the fundamentals of AI should influence each other. In other words, the application changes the AI, and by changing the AI new fields of application arise. We want it to work both ways. In order to do this, we have set up this centre where various departments that used to be separate entities come together for dialogue. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic we have not been able to meet as often as we would have liked. The centre is to become a central hub for ETH’s internal communication but also for external dialogue. Here, all departments and areas of operation come together and form a focal point for cooperation with the industry. The centre will also become an incubator for start-ups and support them in their development.  







                Alexander Ilic, Managing Director of the new “ETH AI Center”, has gained experience with artificial intelligence in theory and practice as an academic and entrepreneur.            

            ETH Zürich / Nicola Pitaro        


swissinfo.ch: While consumers are swamped with digital information and apps, it is hard for them to grasp the technology behind it and its purpose. How do you deal with this tension? 
A.I.: We want to show in dialogue with the public what AI can achieve. There are many tangible examples, such as what is happening in medicine and digital health which is easy to understand and brings many positive changes. We want to show that artificial intelligence supports people, it does not replace them.
swissinfo.ch: Can you give an example of how you communicate with the public? 
A.I.: We are planning a series of events on these issues. We want to show applications that already exist and also how they impact society. We have made it our mission to be a pioneer of trustworthy and inclusive AI. This means involving different population groups equally and respecting people’s individual rights. It’s also important to us that this core technology should be widely accessible. In a nutshell, trustworthy, inclusive and widely accessible. AI should not be only for large companies, it should also be available to small and medium-sized firms. 
swissinfo.ch: You want to carry the digital transformation to society through human beings. Do you expect resistance from people? 
A.I.: When something changes, there is always a certain amount of uncertainty and scepticism. It is important to understand that technological progress will change our society. We want to help shape this change and show that we at ETH Zurich are doing this in a responsible way. For example, we have a professor of ethics on our steering committee who makes sure our work is in line with the basic principles. When it comes to AI, it is particularly important to emphasize ethical work practices, which is best done by using examples.

            Read more: How do you build trust in new technologies?        


swissinfo.ch: Which ethical questions will be dealt with at the new centre? 
A.I.: The first question is whether we need new ethical fundamentals for AI, or not. Generally, most scientists in other departments of ETH Zurich already work following ethical principles. However, the questions around AI are a bit more complex, for example concerning algorithms. Are these algorithms fair? How can we judge that? Are they inclusive? These questions need a lot of clarification. There are currently scores of different guidelines. We need to be involved in the dialogue and provide clarity. We want to enter into dialogue with different groups, not only to discuss the issue but also to take a position. 
swissinfo.ch: One such ethical question would be who should get access to certain AI technologies, such as military applications for example. To what extent will the centre address such questions and advise companies on how to assess and understand what their technologies are used for?
A.I.: Our main message is that technology is not simply neutral. The person who designs something new carries a certain responsibility. Hence, it is important to us that we help shape this dialogue and let our European values influence the development of AI applications. 
swissinfo.ch: How will you deal with such ethical questions and dilemmas in the future? 
A.I.: We want to set a good example, stand up for our values and culture and allow them to shape the development of our projects. This is a very effective method as we train people who live these values and take them with them when they go out into the world.

[a]China has previously released a number of AI-related policy documents, including the State Council Guidelines on Promoting the Healthy and Orderly Development of the Internet of Things (2013), Made in China 2025, Robotics Industry Development Plan (2016-2020), and the State Council Guidelines on Promoting the “Internet+” Action (2015).
[b] Compulsory education in China covers nine-year schooling in primary and junior secondary schools.
[c] Recently, it has taken key initiatives towards incorporating AI. For example, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship signed an agreement with IBM in September 2019 to train faculty members from Industrial Training Institutes in the basics of AI skills under the Train-the-Trainer programme.
[d] H-index is a measure to evaluate an author’s scholarly output and performance. It compares publications to citations; “there are h papers that have each been cited at least h times”.
[e] The rest come from research institutions, enterprises and other entities.
[f]For an extensive search that goes beyond the generic phrase of AI and inclusive of many AI-related keywords/categories, see Tsinghua University’s ‘China AI Development Report 2018,’ which shows that that China leads in the 1997-2017 timespan in AI paper output.
[g]The search included “People’s Republic of China or China” in the country/region.
[h] For “academic promotions, job offers and allocation of research funding.” (Sharma, 2020).
[i]This does not rule out funding by other national and international agencies.
[j]Web of Science defines HCPs as papers that received enough citations in a specific period “to place them in the top 1% of their academic fields based on a highly cited threshold for the field and publication year.”
[k]Turkey, ahead of India, is in the transcontinental region.
[l]The 2019 Global AI Talent Report derived this data from the analysis of 21 international conferences.
[m]The other countries are: the US, France, Israel, Sweden, China, Spain, UK, Canada, Singapore, Netherlands and Italy.
[n] Anonymity has been maintained to protect the participants’ identity, per the UBC Behavioural Research Ethics guidelines.
[o] Seven professionals—IT and computer engineers—from northern India were interviewed. The interview questions pertained to their academic experiences studying in India and their recommendations for higher-education reforms. Responses of three participants were relevant for the AI segment of the project, as covered in this paper. The anonymity of the participants has been maintained to protect their identity, per the UBC Behavioural Research Ethics guidelines.

Coded Bias follows MIT researcher Joy Buolamwini as she investigates and combats the racial disparities of facial recognition for people of color, in both impact and accuracy. As it follows Buolamwini from MIT to her testimony on Capitol Hill, the film looks at the ubiquitous, but overlooked impact of algorithms on our daily lives, from policing to housing to education and shopping. Days after the film’s premiere, WIRED spoke with Kantayya about the documentary, sci-fi, and Big Tech's grasping control of our lives. An edited transcript follows.WIRED: People hear phrases like machine learning, artificial intelligence, recommender systems, and it's overwhelming. How did you get interested in this field, and how did you acclimate yourself to it, given that two or three years ago, when you started, there was a lot less digestible scholarship?Shalini Kantayya: I stumbled upon the work of Joy Buolamwini through a TED talk and read Cathy O'Neil's book Weapons of Math Destruction, and just fell down a rabbit hole of the dark side of artificial intelligence.Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AII couldn't talk to people for two years at parties because I was so worried people would ask me about what I was working on. I think the working title at the time was Racist Robots, and it was really hard to explain. As someone who doesn't have advanced degrees in data science, I had this fear of improperly explaining ideas like algorithms or artificial intelligence or machine learning. But I think what enabled me to get over my fear was just asking a lot of questions. And I came to see that artificial intelligence is going to transform every sector of society and touch every civil right we enjoy.I read this incredible body of research by women who help translate the subject matter. All of them are incredibly astute, some of the smartest people I've ever met. I think there are seven PhDs in the film. They have advanced degrees, but they also are women or people of color or LGBTQ or had some experience of being marginalized that allowed them to have this very unique perspective on technology. It allows them to see technology from the perspective of those for whom it could fail.Talk about the decision to make it a female-led film. It’s very rare to see such a technical film led by women as subjects, experts, as centering the film and not being singled out.AdvertisementWhen I first started making the film, I actually didn't plan to make the film so predominantly led by women. But my research just kept leading me back to all these incredibly brilliant and badass women.""My research just kept leading me back to all these incredibly brilliant and badass women.""What I came to learn is that the people who are leading the data, the scientists and mathematicians and journalists and activists who are leading the fight for ethics and more humane uses of artificial intelligence, are actually women, people of color, and LGBTQ.And so what I came to see is that there was this canon inside of tech that was not being heard. The role of women and feminism as a force for change within Silicon Valley has been long underestimated.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDIn the making of this film, I learned that there's always been this connection between artists and science fiction writers and technological developers. Because artificial intelligence has been developed by people who are mostly white, mostly male, mostly from elite educational backgrounds, there's been this startling lack of imagination in the technologies of the future.And I think that the cast of this film just made me see that there are other ways that artificial intelligence can work than this kind of surveillance capitalism model that we have come to see as the only way.What were some of the biggest roadblocks to finishing the film? What can you tell me about the process in bringing it all together?I feel like there was no road map for me. There were no other films that I know of that are about bias and artificial intelligence in this particular way.The Secret to Machine Learning? Human TeachersBy Tom SimoniteAnd so for me, I was really looking at this scholarship for breadcrumbs.

How did you get interested in this field, and how did you acclimate yourself to it, given that two or three years ago, when you started, there was a lot less digestible scholarship?
Shalini Kantayya: I stumbled upon the work of Joy Buolamwini through a TED talk and read Cathy O'Neil's book Weapons of Math Destruction, and just fell down a rabbit hole of the dark side of artificial intelligence.
I couldn't talk to people for two years at parties because I was so worried people would ask me about what I was working on. I think the working title at the time was Racist Robots, and it was really hard to explain. As someone who doesn't have advanced degrees in data science, I had this fear of improperly explaining ideas like algorithms or artificial intelligence or machine learning. But I think what enabled me to get over my fear was just asking a lot of questions. And I came to see that artificial intelligence is going to transform every sector of society and touch every civil right we enjoy.
I read this incredible body of research by women who help translate the subject matter. All of them are incredibly astute, some of the smartest people I've ever met. I think there are seven PhDs in the film. They have advanced degrees, but they also are women or people of color or LGBTQ or had some experience of being marginalized that allowed them to have this very unique perspective on technology. It allows them to see technology from the perspective of those for whom it could fail.
Talk about the decision to make it a female-led film. It’s very rare to see such a technical film led by women as subjects, experts, as centering the film and not being singled out.
When I first started making the film, I actually didn't plan to make the film so predominantly led by women. But my research just kept leading me back to all these incredibly brilliant and badass women.
What I came to learn is that the people who are leading the data, the scientists and mathematicians and journalists and activists who are leading the fight for ethics and more humane uses of artificial intelligence, are actually women, people of color, and LGBTQ.
And so what I came to see is that there was this canon inside of tech that was not being heard. The role of women and feminism as a force for change within Silicon Valley has been long underestimated.
In the making of this film, I learned that there's always been this connection between artists and science fiction writers and technological developers. Because artificial intelligence has been developed by people who are mostly white, mostly male, mostly from elite educational backgrounds, there's been this startling lack of imagination in the technologies of the future.
And I think that the cast of this film just made me see that there are other ways that artificial intelligence can work than this kind of surveillance capitalism model that we have come to see as the only way.
What were some of the biggest roadblocks to finishing the film? What can you tell me about the process in bringing it all together?
I feel like there was no road map for me. There were no other films that I know of that are about bias and artificial intelligence in this particular way.
And so for me, I was really looking at this scholarship for breadcrumbs. And then it was a task to try to find the stories of people who had been harmed by algorithmic bias but fought back. And that was a challenge, because so many times these systems are so opaque to us that sometimes we don't even know when we've been denied an opportunity because of an algorithm.
And so I am trying to meld these stories together. I think it would have been much easier to make a film about just facial recognition. Facial recognition is the easiest to understand, because it's so visceral. But I think it was important to show the pervasiveness of these algorithms that are making decisions that are shifting human destinies.
It’s interesting how the film talks about emerging technologies and different algorithms. It’s very different from films like The Great Hack or The Social Dilemma. Those really zoom in on specific companies like Google or Facebook, but Coded Bias doesn’t lay the blame on individual companies.

I'm of the belief that people don't care about issues. They care about people. And Joy has such integrity as a scientist and can challenge power in many ways.
We often talk about the fear of not knowing. Knowledge is power. So she has that power, but then she also is connecting it to the marginalized.
I think it was only when she went to Capitol Hill to testify that I knew I had the structure of a film. I just knew that there was a character up there. There was a story. There was a person who went on a journey. And so the backbone is that character-driven story.

Right. I make documentaries in part because you get to make a hero out of everyday people. It gets to shine a light on the fact that everyday people are heroes.
I have this incredible gratitude for the stories of Daniel and for Tranae, who didn't even know what biometric data was and not only fought back, but changed legislation.

As technologies such as 3D printing move the discipline forward in remaking the built environment, AI and generative design are having an impact on architecture from a planning and design perspective, where the profession is largely digital and computational. We spoke with Lilli Smith, Senior Product Manager AEC Generative Design at Autodesk, a practitioner in the field of architecture for more than 20 years — the last 18 of which have been making the software that architects use to design their creations.In architecture, art, and other creative fields, generative design is a methodology that automates the creation of design options that may balance a variety of competing goals. The latest wave of generative design is driven by artificial intelligence. “This is often the case in architectural design problems,” Smith says. “There’s not a single objective that you’re trying to go after — there’s no one answer. But, there’s a lot of different objectives that come into making an architectural project. So, for example, in an urban design workflow, having a nice amount of open space and good views from your property might be important. But return on investment and value generated through more rentable area[s] might also be important.”Figure 01: Generative design is a methodology that automates the creation of design options that may balance a variety of competing goals.[Photo: by Markus Spiske on Unsplash]Generative design can help automate the creation of options, which satisfy a variety of goals that the designer wants to encode into the system. Generative design can also be an exploratory tool to open up a designer’s thinking — not necessarily solving the problem or providing one right answer.“Using algorithms to guide the creation of these design options, the computer will give you … the best options that it can, given the goals and the size of the exploration also that you have specified,” says Smith. “Then you can have a discussion with your stakeholders about which goals may actually be more important or which designs … the stakeholder may favor for other reasons. It’s a great way to have conversations with people.”“When there are several inputs to the design, it becomes really hard for the human mind to keep track of all the combinations of those inputs,” says Smith. “The computer can actually surprise you with combinations of different inputs that you might not have thought about before …”The AI can quickly produce a high volume of concepts attuned to the requirements of the project. That concept generation, or what we might have used to think of as “brainstorming”, at scale, by the machine is affordable and more comprehensive than what a human could do in the same budget of time and money. This is particularly important in the context of architecture where, as Smith illustrates, the requirements are complex, extensive, and can often be competing. “So, the computer isn’t really coming up with anything on its own,” says Smith. “[It’s] just having an automated way to produce all of these combinations that humans aren’t good at, but computers are really good at. And then being able to rank and sort them, or search through them, given the different metrics that you’ve also included, can sometimes even yield surprising and delightful results that you didn’t expect.”A Brief History of Generative DesignEven though we think of terms and applications like “generative” as cutting edge, programmatic artists have been using this creative method for over 50 years. “Generative design is really not new,” says Smith. “There’s a long history of generative art.” In the 1960s, the pioneering Hungarian computer artist Vera Molnár worked in the early programming language Fortran to generate images examining theme, variation, automated generation, and display of options in her work. Digital artist Manfred Mohr, another pioneer of algorithmic art, generated variations of 3D geometry in the 1960s and 1970s. And, in their 1972 article, “Shape Grammars and the Generative Specification of Painting and Sculpture”, design technologists George Stiny and James Gips created a manual encoding of design systems, describing a production system for generating shapes. “It’s really a direct line of thinking for a lot of what goes on in parametric design and also underpinnings of tools like CityEngine, which is a tool by Esri for urban planning based on GIS data, and other tools, as well,” says Smith. “There are papers in the 1970s that demonstrate how people were really thinking about, in architecture and specifically in hospital floor plans, how to lay out those floor plans algorithmically,” says Smith. “So, these ideas have been around for a long time in architecture. They’ve also been around in engineering.”In a more recent example of AI-driven generative approaches, NASA used programmatic design to create configurations for its satellite antennas. Jason Lohn, the leader of this project at NASA Ames Research Center, described the algorithmic approach to design in a feature article published by the agency in 2006:“The AI software examined millions of potential antenna designs before settling on a final one,” said Lohn. The software did this much faster than any human being could do so under the same circumstances, according to Lohn. “Through a process patterned after Darwin’s ‘survival of the fittest,’ the strongest designs survive and the less capable do not.”“We told the computer program what performance the antenna should have, and the computer simulated evolution, keeping the best antenna designs that approached what we asked for. Eventually, it zeroed in on something that met the desired specifications for the mission,” Lohn said.“They searched through tens of thousands of these different antennas,” says Smith. “And they were able to come up with a design that was never something that they would have come up with in their own minds [through] their own traditional design process. But the final antenna design performed more than 90% more efficiently over the traditional antenna.” In the NASA example, we can see how AI can inform and enhance creative decisions by introducing superior design options that humans may not even initially consider, with surprisingly effective results. The design output is better because both human and machine are doing what they do best.Figure 02: NASA used programmatic design to create configurations for its satellite antennas.[Photo: by NASA on Unsplash]Computational Design Approaches in PracticeInspired in part by generative design’s storied history, Autodesk research has long been interested in using generative workflows. “A couple of years ago, Autodesk bought an architectural firm called The Living out of New York City,” says Smith. “[An] amazing collection of talented designers who also have computational brains. They are really good coders and very good designers. And, they’ve worked on a number of projects involving generative design pursuits.”“They worked with Airbus on a partition. [It’s] one component of a plan which might not seem super important. But, there’s a lot of different functionality that has to go into the thinking about that panel. They have to be able to remove certain sections of it to accommodate emergency stretchers going into the plane,” says Smith, “… and of course rigorous safety standards and crash testing standards.”“They were able to use this process of studying flexible models and looking at how a material could be taken out, but you still have the structural integrity of this panel. And also use 3D printing technology to get the total weight of each partition down by about 45% or about 30 kilograms,” says Smith. “And this might seem minor, in the context of a whole plane that’s really big and fully weighted. But, they do estimate that these weight savings across the current generation of these A320 series of planes could result in the savings of almost half a million metric tons of CO2 every year.”In order to test their applications of and theories about generative design, Autodesk used the method in the design of their new Autodesk Toronto facility — referred to as their new center for emerging technologies. “They wanted to use generative techniques in order to design the new office space. So, they started out by collecting a bunch of data to guide the design and help them to create goals for what was their ideal office,” says Smith. “So they ask people questions like: ‘Who would you like to sit by?’, ‘How much distraction can you take in your day?’, ‘Do you like a lot of daylight near your desk or do you need a darker environment because you’re using screens and you don’t like a lot of glare’”. After conducting extensive internal research, the team developed six goals that they used to evaluate their designs. “They surveyed existing employees and then they boiled all that data down to these six goals that were about adjacency, distraction, things like that,” says Smith. The team created a flexible model. “They had an idea about how this design was going to work and had an idea about how it could flex and vary,” says Smith. They wanted to study … the various implications of where they put groups of desks and where they put groups of amenities, meaning conference rooms, phone booths, more private spaces. So, they developed flexible models and ways to measure the success of those designs and use the computer to help guide them to solutions that satisfied those goals.”Figure 03: AI can help architects develop flexible models for designing an ideal office space, and help guide them to solutions that satisfy those goals.[Photo: by Nastuh Abootalebi on Unsplash]AI and the Future of Architecture“A lot of people that we talk to see the possibility of the computer augmenting their design efforts,” says Smith. “They see that humans are still going to be critical in these design efforts because they’re going to be setting up the problems, deciding what kinds of problems to solve, using machines to help them to do a better job.”“I think we’ve got a long way to go before the machines are writing all the software or doing design for us. Maybe it will happen someday but I think we have a long way to go before the bots take over,” says Smith. Our computer overlords remain a long way off. The machines are going to be helping us to make things, not removing us from the equation. They will remove the more physical, manual, mundane, and tedious parts. They will not be doing the core problem solving, particularly up front in the research and requirements but even, for the time being, in the core solution articulation once a generative approach has determined the correct basic direction.“I think generative design is a different way of thinking for designers. It’s different to think about designing a system for design instead of several one-off designs…. It’s different to think about how you can make a whole design system that’s going to flex for you,” says Smith. “It also requires computational design skills, so that you can use the computer to augment your powers. We’ve tried to make it easier for architects and engineers by making these visual scripting environments where you can write code by just putting together these different nodes or different functionality. And we also work on developing nodes that people can share. And also developing a community of people who want to share code with each other.”Enabling creators via a visual interface that precludes the need to learn programming or otherwise tangle with unsophisticated UI is important to unlocking the potential of artificial intelligence in a creative context. The approach of offering visual environments of use, instead of expecting non-programmers to use programming to best use next generation tools, is a common theme when it comes to emerging technologies like AI. Contrary to the popular buzz around the importance of everyone learning programming, the reality is that companies that create the tools for creatives are proactively trying to make these tools so they can be fully exploited by the non-programmers among us. Indeed, while today there is a good argument for many creatives to learn some degree of programming to best leverage the early and nascent tools at our disposal, those are skills that might build our long-term holistic knowledge base, but will only be practically applicable in our work for a shorter time horizon, during this transition period when computational creativity is in the early days.Using AI-assisted automated methods to better design buildings may very well be a future imperative. “By the year 2050, there are going to be 10 billion people on earth. And, if you do the math, we’re going to need to build about 13,000 buildings a day to accommodate all those people,” says Smith. “In order to build all these buildings without totally destroying the earth, we’re going to have to develop better methods to design and construct [them]… Generative design is one tool in this effort. I think we’re going to have to drastically change a lot of how we’re getting things done to accommodate all of these people on earth.”Creative Next is a podcast exploring the impact of AI-driven automation on the lives of creative workers, people like writers, researchers, artists, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs.

AI and the Battle for the Future of Photo Editing





Nov 12, 2020





DL Cade







































 For photographers, AI photo editing is no longer a fringe topic for ML researchers or a gimmick employed by smartphone apps. With the impending release of Skylum’s Luminar AI and Adobe calling the latest build of Photoshop “the world’s most advanced AI application for creatives,” it’s time for the community to reckon with an important question: What does this mean for photography, photo editing, and creativity at large? One of the hottest hot takes in the industry right now is that AI photo editing is going to be very bad for photographers and retouchers of all stripes. Whether it’s Luminar AI, Adobe’s Sensei AI-powered tools, or the NVIDIA technology behind Photoshop’s new portrait editing features, most photographers seem wary of this technology and its potential impacts of creativity. Naysayers paint a grim picture of over-edited portraits and homogenous landscapes that are indistinguishable from one another–each of them edited using the same sky replacement tool, the same skin smoothing, the same fake fog, and the same “intelligent” dodge and burn tools. Like calligraphy or traditional printmaking, they envision a future where “manual” photo editing is an artisanal skill practiced by a dedicated few.

Some argue that lowering the barrier to entry into the world of photo editing will act as a “gateway drug” that will empower young artists to discover and expand their creative chops. But what about the people on the front lines? How do the companies behind this tech feel about the “AI revolution” that they are bringing about? And what about professional retouchers and educators whose jobs depend on (and might be replaced by) this technology? I wanted to find out, and so I reached out to Adobe, Skylum, Pratik Naik of Solstice Retouch, and Aaron Nace of Phlearn and asked each the same somewhat-loaded question:


Do you believe that the advent of increasingly capable AI-powered photo editing tools is going to be a net positive on the photography and retouching industries? Why or why not? Feel free to elaborate. I’ve re-printed their responses in full below, in the hopes of injecting a bit of nuance and perspective into this conversation. As with most things in life, there is no black and white answer, but understanding the shades of gray might help a few of us prepare to live and work (and maybe even thrive) in the AI-powered future of photo editing. Because as each of our responders pointed out in one way or another: unlike Thanos, this really is inevitable.  Alex Tsepko, CEO at Skylum To cut to the chase, I think AI is definitely a positive thing that’s happening to the photo industry right now. People are using photography to build their brand, sell their services, goods, tell their friends and family a story. To do this well, they need to be able edit photos well; spending the minimum amount of time in the process.  Creators don’t want and most importantly don’t have to waste time on routine work. Instead, they use smart technologies to speed up the process of creating the photographs they need to tell their stories to the world via print, social media, or anything in between. At Skylum, we believe all technology should serve a meaningful purpose and, ideally, a noble one. To that end, we thought by adding the power of artificial intelligence to Luminar AI, we could offer new ways of doing things.




When editing photos, people spend 74% of their time on repetitive, routine tasks, which we call grunt work. Because of the boring nature of this grunt work, people come to think of photo editing as more difficult and less satisfying. We believe that AI can automate much of this grunt work and free people to reinvest that time in their personal lives or in further developing their creativity. When a professional opens a photo to edit, the end result is already well-formed, if not completely alive in her mind… this is not always the case with amateurs or hobbyists. ​ Lacking the knowledge of the professional, amateurs and hobbyists start clicking buttons and dragging sliders hoping to find their way to a great result. Too often, they fail. Looking at this problem, we wondered if artificial intelligence might serve as a guide; inspiring amateurs and hobbyists to find and develop their own style. ​ To solve these problems, Luminar AI uses artificial intelligence to evaluate the user’s photos and suggest several style options. Here, it is important to understand the software robot (AI) does not replace human creativity. In fact, human creativity, in the form of very talented professional photographers and retouchers, trains our AI to understand what a good image is and then guides it through a series of options to get their images there … quickly. Thus, a creator has the immediate benefit of a creative inspiration, prompted by the AI, and does not find themselves stuck when experience is lacking or, in the case of professionals, the ideas are not flowing.  Maria Yap, Vice President of Digital Imaging at Adobe [It is] absolutely [a positive]. I firmly believe that AI, when done right, helps amplify human creativity and enhances creative expression. For photographers and photo retouching professionals, AI-powered features across Photoshop and Lightroom eliminate manual and repetitive tasks, reduce complex workflows, and even enable adjustments to images in ways that were previously not possible with existing tools.  To address real-world needs and pain points, we work closely with professional photographers in developing our Sensei AI-powered features, and have seen that most photographers are quick to incorporate these powerful tools into their day-to-day workflows. Photoshop is the world’s most advanced AI application for creatives, and we’re just getting started.




  Pratik Naik of Solstice Retouch This heavily debated topic is at the center of discussion today in our industry. No matter the genre, we’re all going to benefit from tools that work for everything from landscapes, portraits, and anything in between. I personally am optimistic and embrace developments in tech that give us options for creativity. With our communities, I get to see how creatives work with our tools in order to further accomplish their vision. I know that there are also many out there that may consider it cheating to have these assisted tools modify a photo that goes well beyond what was there in reality. We could sit here all day and discuss whether something is a photograph or not. However, we can’t deny that these tools will help people get to their end goal quicker and more accurately, no matter what definition they use to define the final image. On retouching portraits in specific, if tools enable us to get done faster, we’ll have the ability to get through more images. Based on how one manages time and rates, it could actually end up producing a positive impact in making more money. Because these tools are a part of the workflow chain, they still require user input to guide them in order to get to where each person wants. For example, if you gave the same image to ten retouchers, the end result will vary greatly, so taste and direction are still required. This is where experience in working will still take precedence and the tools themselves will not level the playing field entirely. No matter what comes in the future, it can only provide additional opportunities for us to not only explore but implement these tools in our work to produce better results at a faster pace. Those who have a harder time adapting will always struggle, but I see promise with these tools if people can incorporate them into their workflow and businesses strategically.   Aaron Nace of Phlearn Technology continues to evolve at a startling pace, and we have seen huge shifts in the photography industry in the past – for instance, the advent of the digital camera. Art and technology have always been intrinsically linked, and with each iteration of technology, new art forms are developed. 




Whether these changes in AI are positive or negative depends on the subjective point of view of individuals, but one thing is clear – It is up to us to continue to evolve or get left behind. My perspective is that I don’t see it as a positive or a negative, it is just a change. If you are unwilling to adjust with the change, you may see it as a negative, if you embrace it, then it can be a positive. Personally, I plan on embracing changes in technology and moving forward.  Final Thoughts One of the most surprising things about the answers we got, especially the ones from Naik and Nace, is how generally optimistic they were. At worst, the sentiment is that these tools are coming whether you like them or not so you may as well find a way to work with them—”evolve or get left behind.” No one’s denying the impact that automating large parts of the photo editing process will have on the art of retouching and photo editing. Google Maps came along, and now nobody learns how to read a physical map; automatic cars are so common in the US that hardly anybody learns how to drive stick; Spell Check isn’t helping anybody become a better speller. It would be naïve to imply that AI photo editing tools–the powerful, accurate, realistic ones–won’t have a similar impact on photo editing, encouraging some people to outsource more and more of their workflow to the algorithms. But as Naik and Nace rightly point out, it would be equally naïve to buy into the idea that AI spells the “end of creativity as we know it.” Good art demands subtlety and surprise, and the latter is, by definition, impossible to automate.  This debate is a great distraction–sort of like obsessing over the latest lens that’s 2% sharper than the last, or touting the unique benefits of Brand A over Brands B and C. If you’re looking for something to debate in the comments or yet another company/technology/website/*fill in the blank* that’s coming for photographers’ jobs, AI is low-hanging fruit. But just as no combination of specs has ever birthed an artist… no amount of automation could ever truly snuff one out.

Nov 11, 2020, 9:28 AM ESTShare this story0 Comments / 0 New Photo by Grzegorz Galazka / Mondadori Portfolio via Getty ImagesPope Francis has asked believers around the world to pray that robots and artificial intelligence “always serve mankind.” The message is one of the pope’s monthly prayer intentions — regular missives shared on YouTube that are intended to help Catholics “deepen their daily prayer” by focusing on particular topics or events. In August, the pope urged prayer for “the maritime world”; in April, the topic was “freedom for addiction.” Now, in November, it’s AI and robots. Although the message sounds similar to warnings issued by tech notables like Elon Musk (the Tesla CEO famously compared work on artificial intelligence to “summoning the demon”), the pope’s focus is more prosaic. He doesn’t seem to be worrying about the sort of exotic doomsday scenario where a superintelligent AI turns the world into paperclips, but more about how the tech could exacerbate existing inequalities here and now. (We should note also that the call to prayer came out earlier this month, but we only saw it recently via the Import AI newsletter because of the... events that have taken up so much of everyone’s time, energy, and general mental acuity in recent weeks.)In his message, the pope said AI was “at the heart of the epochal change we are experiencing” and that robotics had the power to change the world for the better. But this would only be the case if these forces are harnessed correctly, he said. “Indeed, if technological progress increases inequalities, it is not true progress. Future advances should be orientated towards respecting the dignity of the person.” Perhaps surprisingly, this isn’t new territory for the pope. Earlier this year, the Vatican, along with Microsoft and IBM, endorsed the “Rome Call for AI Ethics” — a policy document containing six general principles that guide the deployment of artificial intelligence. These include transparency, inclusion, impartiality, and reliability, all sensible attributes when it comes to deploying algorithms. Although the pope didn’t touch on any particular examples in his video, it’s easy to think of ways that AI is entrenching or increasing divisions in society. Examples include biased facial recognition systems that lead to false arrests and algorithmically allotted exam results that replicate existing inequalities between students. In other words: regardless of whether you think prayer is the appropriate course of action, the pope certainly has a point.
