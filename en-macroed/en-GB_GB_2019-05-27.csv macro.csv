One of the most spectacular facts of the last two centuries of economic history is the exponential growth in GDP per capita in most of the world. Figure 1 shows the rise (and the difference) in living standards for five countries since 1000 AD.





This economic progress, unprecedented in human history, would be impossible without major breakthroughs in technology. The economic historian Joel Mokyr has argued that the Enlightenment in Britain brought new ways to transfer scientific discoveries into practical tools for engineers and artisans. The steam engine, electricity, sanitation are examples of technological discoveries that propelled the engine of economic growth, increasing standards of living across the planet.
At the outset of the Industrial Revolution, the Luddite movement rose out of fear of labor displacement in the British textile sector. Famously, the Luddite protesters destroyed the very machines they were using at work, in order to preserve their role as active members of society. Their reasoning was that if automation could double, triple, or quadruple a worker's output, the economy would need half, a third, a quarter of the current workforce. The Luddite movement was eventually suppressed by military force in 1816, but history has proven them partly correct.
Humans do work shorter hours today than in the 19th century, as shown in Figure 3.

Many Silicon Valley executives like the Tesla CEO Elon Musk believe that we are on the verge of a new technological revolution that will see Artificial Intelligence (AI) automating a majority of tasks that are currently performed by humans. Just as horses were displaced by motor vehicles, truck drivers may soon be replaced by self-driving vehicles.






Factories producing components for personal computers and tablets are also becoming highly automated. The BBC reports (May 25, 2016) that FoxConn has replaced 60,000 of its workers with robots. A January 2016 Oxford University study claims that 47% of US jobs could be lost to automation, along with 69% of jobs in India, 77% in China, and 57% worldwide. Machine learning enables robots to make decisions based on a vast amount of data on (sometimes very difficult) decision-making by highly-skilled humans.
Should we then fear that the forthcoming AI Revolution will force humanity to completely rethink the current organization of our lives?
One of the most important economic thinkers of all time, John Maynard Keynes, wrote in his 1930 essay ""The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren"" that by the 21st century we could fulfill our needs and wants with a 15 hours workweek and devote the rest of our lives to non-monetary pursuits. Fast-forward to 2014, when the late physicist Stephen Hawking told the BBC that ""artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.""

Should we see AI as liberating or as a destructive force?
Economists have debated the effect of technology and automation on jobs for a long time. The first set of questions regards labor displacement and whether there is any future for work at all. The second set of questions has to do with how automation impacts income and wealth inequality. On the one hand, if the ownership of robots is concentrated in the hands of a few—let's call them the 1%—and a majority of jobs disappears for the 99%, it will exacerbate inequality, which is already on the rise (see Figure 4). On the other hand, technological change is also creating polarization in the labor market among the 99%. According to the MIT economist David Autor, between 1989 and 2007 job creation has occurred mostly in low-paying and high-paying jobs, while middle-class jobs were affected by job destruction on net.
It is true that automation displaces workers in some sectors, but workers reallocate to other sectors over time. Historical examples in advanced economies like the US are the transition from rural agriculture to urban manufacturing during the first half of the 20th century, and from manufacturing to services in more recent times.
The net effect on jobs does not seem to lend support to Hawking and Musk's gloomy predictions. This is even more true if one considers another beneficial effect of technological change: everyday objects like dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, washers, and dryers, reduced the burden of housekeeping and freed up time for women to seek employment. Indeed, the labor force participation rate was 67% in 2000, compared to 59% in 1948. The increases in labor productivity brought about by technological change spill over into higher wages for workers: in a 2015 report, Economic Policy Institute economists Josh Bivens and Larry Mishel have documented that the average hourly compensation for the typical American worker in 2014 grew by about 110% relative to 1948.

This is not to say that technological change has no costs for society. The transition from agriculture to manufacturing took time, and in the short run produced economic anxiety, unemployment, and poverty among former agricultural workers. The same applies to the transition to a service economy, although there are some troubling peculiarities about the latter process. The transition to manufacturing was associated with higher wages and employment protection through union membership. The transition to services not so much: low-skill service workers tend to be paid less than workers of similar skills in manufacturing, and service workers are in general not unionized: consequently, they do not take advantage of the benefits of collective bargaining in terms of wages.






Another cause of concern is that automation and technological change is characterized by increasing returns: doubling the scale of production enables production at more than twice the output at the initial scale. Increasing returns lower the cost of production as the scale of a firm expands, which leads to firm concentration toward few, large firms with lots of market power. And it is not by chance that the most visible hi-tech industries, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are all basically monopolies.
The decline of manufacturing employment and the increasing concentration of the US corporate sector are two reasons why average wages have not kept up with the increase in labor productivity over the last 40 years. An average 2015 worker is almost 2.4 times more productive than an average 1948 worker, but her wage is only 110% higher. Wages were growing on par with labor productivity up to the 1970s; starting in the 1980s, productivity has been growing at a much faster pace. The process of job polarization has fed into this pattern, determining rising employment in low-paying sectors and high-paying sectors, at the expense of good middle-class jobs.
Although it is possible that AI is completely different from the technological advances of the past, we should be skeptical that automation will mean the end of work. Jobs—or even specific tasks—will be displaced, but workers will relocate to different jobs or take up different tasks. For low- and medium-skill workers, it is likely that the relocation will occur in jobs of lower quality, meaning either lower pay, or fewer benefits, or a combination of both. Workers who possess skills that are complementary to new technologies, on the other hand, will benefit from the advent of automation by reaping most of the productivity increases in the form of higher wages. And the very few CEOs of successful tech companies will see their incomes skyrocket.
Hence, citizens and policymakers concerned with the rise of automation should focus on its effects on inequality. During the 1980s economists have embraced supply-side views that inequality is beneficial for growth, but recent academic research has shown that the opposite is true. The work by economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucman has suggested that high marginal tax rates on top incomes—that is, tax rates levied on every dollar earned above a certain, typically very high threshold—would go a long way in reducing inequality without distorting the individual incentives to work hard. Indeed, the US economy grew fastest between 1950 and 1970, when the top marginal tax rate was well above 70%. The corresponding tax revenues could be used to provide unemployment compensation or foster the provision of public goods such as education and training for workers to relocate when their jobs are automated.

Artificial Intelligence In The Workplace: How AI Is Transforming Your Employee Experience

Soon, even those of us who don’t happen to work for technology companies (although as every company moves towards becoming a tech company, that will be increasingly few of us) will find AI-enabled machines increasingly present as we go about our day-to-day activities.
From how we are recruited and on-boarded to how we go about on-the-job training, personal development and eventually passing on our skills and experience to those who follow in our footsteps, AI technology will play an increasingly prominent role.
PROMOTED
Here’s an overview of some of the recent advances made in businesses that are currently on the cutting-edge of the AI revolution, and are likely to be increasingly adopted by others seeking to capitalize on the arrival of smart machines.
Recruitment and onboarding
Before we even set foot in a new workplace, it could soon be a fact that AI-enabled machines have played their part in ensuring we’re the right person for the job.
AI pre-screening of candidates before inviting the most suitable in for interviews is an increasingly common practice at large companies which make thousands of hires each year, and sometimes attract millions of applicants.
Pymetricsprovides tools which use a series of ""games"" based on principles of neuroscience to assess candidates before they are asked in for an interview. It works by assessing cognitive and emotional features of the candidate, while specifically avoiding demographic biases based on their gender, socioeconomic status, or race. This is done by matching candidates' performance against that of existing employees who have succeeded in the roles that are being recruited for. If it finds that they may not be a particularly good fit for that role, it might recognize another role they would be suitable for and recommend they instead apply for that one.
Another company providing these services is Montage, which claims that 100 of the Fortune 500 companies have used their AI-driven interviewing tool. It enables businesses to carry out on-demand text interviewing, automated scheduling, and reduce the impact of unconscious biases on the recruitment process.  
When it comes to onboarding, AI-enabled chatbots are the current tool of choice, for helping new hires settle into their roles and get to grips with the various facets of the organizations they’ve joined.
Multinational consumer goods manufacturer Unilever uses a chatbot called Unabot, that employs natural language processing(NLP) to answer employees' questions in plain, human language. Advice is available on everything from where they can catch a shuttle bus to the office in the morning, to how to deal with HR and payroll issues.  
On-the-job training
Of course, learning doesn’t end once you’ve settled into your role, and AI technology will also play a part in ongoing training for most employees in the future.
It will also assist with the transfer of skills from one generation to the next – as employees move on to other companies or retire, it can help to ensure that they can leave behind the valuable experience they’ve gained for others to benefit from, as well as take it with them.
Engineering giant Honeywellhas developed tools which utilize augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) along with AI, to capture the experience of work and extract “lessons” from it which can be passed on to newer hires.
Employees wear AR headsets while carrying out their daily tasks. These capture a record of everything the engineer does, using image recognition technology, which can be played back, allowing trainees or new hires to experience the role through VR.
Information from the video imagery is also being used to build AR tools which provide real-time feedback while engineers carry out their job – alerting them to dangers or reminding them to carry out routine tasks when they are in a particular place or looking at a particular object.  
Augmented workforce
One of the reasons that the subject of AI in the workplace makes some people uncomfortable is because it is often thought of as something that will replace humans and lead to job losses.
However, when it comes to AI integration today, the keyword is very much ""augmentation"" – the idea that AI machines will help us do our jobs more efficiently, rather than replace us. A key idea is that they will take over the mundane aspects of our role, leaving us free to do what humans do best – tasks which require creativity and human-to-human interaction.  
Just as employees have become familiar with tools like email and messaging apps, tools such as those provided by PeopleDocor Betterworkswill play an increasingly large part in the day-to-day workplace experience.
These are tools which can monitor workflows and processes and make intelligent suggestions about how things could be done more effectively or efficiently. Often this is referred to as robotic process automation (RPA).
These tools will learn to carry out repetitive tasks such as arranging meetings or managing a diary. They will also recognize when employees are having difficulty or spending too long on particular problems, and be ready to step in to either assist or if the job is beyond something a bot is capable of doing itself, suggest where human help can be found.
Surveillance in the workplace
Of course, there’s a potential dark side to this encroachment of AI into the workplace that’s likely to leave some employees feeling distinctly uncomfortable.
According to a Gartner survey, more than 50% of companies with a turnover above $750 million use digital data-gathering tools to monitor employee activities and performance. This includes analyzing the content of emails to determine employee satisfaction and engagement levels. Some companies are known to be using tracking devices to monitor the frequency of bathroom breaks, as well as audio analytics to determine stress levels in voices when staff speak to each other in the office.
Technology even exists to enable employers to track their staff sleeping and exercise habits. Video game publisher Blizzard Activision recently unveiled plansto offer incentives to staff who let them track their health through Fitbit devices and other specialized apps. The idea is to use aggregated, anonymized data to identify areas where the health of the workforce as a whole can be improved. However, it’s clear to see that being monitored in this way might not sit particularly well with everyone.
Workplace analytics specialists Humanyzeuse staff email and instant messaging data, along with microphone-equipped name badges, to gather data on employee interactions. While some may consider this potentially intrusive, the company says that this can help to protect employees from bullying or sexual harassment in the workplace.
Workplace Robots
Physical robots capable of autonomous movement are becoming commonplace in manufacturing and warehousing installations, and are likely to be a feature of many other workplaces in the near future.
Mobility experts Segwayhave created a delivery robot which can navigate through workplace corridors to make deliveries directly to the desk. Meanwhile, security robots such as those being developed by Gamma 2could soon be a common site, ensuring commercial properties are safe from trespassers.
Racing for a space in the office car park could also become a thing of the past if solutions developed by providers such as ParkPlusbecome commonplace. Their robotic parking assistants may not match our traditional idea of how a robot should look, but consist of automated “shuttle units” capable of moving vehicles into parking bays which would be too small for humans to manually park in – meaning more vehicles can fit into a smaller space.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/05/29/artificial-intelligence-in-the-workplace-how-ai-is-transforming-your-employee-experience/,Enterprise & Cloud,Artificial Intelligence In The Workplace: How AI Is Transforming Your Employee Experience,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has previously taken a number of roles at not-for-profit organisations and has a memoir, For the Record, due out later this year.Cameron said he was “delighted” to take the job working on “transforming the future of customer service and interpersonal communications”.The advisory board features an array of high-profile figures including John Browne, former chief executive of BP and François Fillon, the former prime minister of France. Afiniti was set up by the US-Pakistani entrepreneur Zia Chishti and specialises in the use of AI in call centres.Cameron resigned as prime minister after the remain campaign lost the Brexit referendum. Since then he has become president of Alzheimer’s Research UK, chair of the National Citizen Service’s board of patrons and chair of the LSE-Oxford commission on state fragility.Cameron said on Friday: “The government I led took a wide range of steps to ensure the UK was successful in the new tech industries … As part of this work, I was excited to see the rapid development in artificial intelligence and the huge potential AI has to address some of the challenges that societies face today … I am therefore delighted to have been asked to chair Afiniti’s advisory board, helping support their work to transform the future of customer service and interpersonal communications.”Chishti, the chair and chief executive of Afiniti, said the company was “delighted” at Cameron’s appointment. “David’s deep personal commitment to this issue makes him perfectly placed to lead our advisory board and support Afiniti in our next stage of growth.”Cameron is also involved in a new UK-China investment fund, although this has so far failed to complete its first financial fundraising. His memoir is due to be published this autumn after the rights were sold to the publisher William Collins for £800,000 three years ago. The launch will be a year later than planned.Explore more on these topicsDavid CameronArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this contentMost viewedTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsMy sausage-like fingers are not sexy.

The AI laboratory, based in Accra, will be used to develop solutions to help improve healthcare, agriculture and education.Overcoming obstaclesGoogle's head of AI Accra Moustapha Cisse is from Senegal.After completing an undergraduate degree in maths and physics in Senegal, he taught himself AI and then went to study in Paris, before joining Facebook.There are very few AI researchers from Africa, and Mr Cisse has faced great obstacles in achieving his ambitions. ""Despite the support, many of us still have trouble making it to conferences. I have had papers accepted at meetings but been unable to attend because Western countries such as Australia denied me a visa, even though I was already settled and working professionally in Europe,"" he wrote in his blog. ""We need more efforts to overcome these barriers and to ensure that the benefits of AI arrive globally.""He has long been concerned that AI is a missed opportunity for improving African lives, and that the AI industry is missing out on talent from African nations, because they do not have access to the right education.Getty ImagesThere are concerns young people in Africa are unable to join the global IT industry as they do not have access to the education they needToday people often have to travel out of the continent in order to gain the IT skills they need, before returning to Africa to try to build new businesses. To solve this problem, Mr Cisse has long advocated for better AI education across the continent, and he wants African governments to see AI as a key priority and support efforts to use AI for the good of humanity. ""AI has a lot to offer to Africa and Africa has a lot to offer to AI as well,"" he told the BBC.""AI can help accelerate discoveries in various sciences, and it can help in areas where our human expertise is not enough.""Enhancing IT in AfricaOne key area Mr Cisse believes AI can be a big help in Africa is in improving healthcare by automating diagnosis of diseases. He also thinks that using AI to automate translations would make it much easier for African nations to communicate and do business, since there are 2,000 languages being spoken on a daily basis on the continent.But in order to advance AI developments, Africa needs a robust IT industry.In Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, the African Institute for Mathematical Scientists (AIMS) is running a one-year Masters degree programme in partnership with Facebook and Google to create the next generation of tech leaders.GoogleThe Google Africa AI research centre in Accra, GhanaThe degree is the first Masters programme of its kind on the continent. Talented scientists and innovators drawn from various African countries are being trained in machine learning, a type of AI. ""When we have young Africans working on this topic, we can imagine that they will easily be addressing some global challenges that our continent is facing,"" AIMS Rwanda president Dr Sam Yala told the BBC.""When they are trained, some of them will work at universities and it's a way our students can pass their skills on to others.""The village that built its own wi-fi networkThe smart buses transforming KigaliThe entrepreneur behind Ghana's future inventors",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48139212,,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3893/production/_107138441_moustapha-cisse.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human gamers know just how hard it is to win a new spin on the classic computer game Quake: In a mazelike arena, they must work with other players to capture floating flags—all while dodging deadly gunfire. Now, for the first time, artificial intelligence (AI) has mastered teamwork in a complex first-person video game, coordinating its actions with both human and computer teammates to consistently beat opponents. ""The scale of the experiments is remarkable,"" says Michael Littman, an AI expert at Brown University. Getting AI agents to work together is incredibly tough, he says. Although AI can drive cars and easily defeat the world's greatest chess and Go players one on one, researchers have struggled to get it to master teamwork. The practice may seem intuitive to us, but predicting how others will behave—a crucial component of working on a team—adds a whole new level of complexity and uncertainty for AI to deal with.

In the new study, researchers got AI bots to teach each other to work as a team. Their classroom was a simplified version of 1999 first-person shooter, Quake III Arena. The game involves two teams that navigate around a 3D map to retrieve a flag from their opponent's base and return it to theirs. The team with the most captures after 5 minutes wins. Players also fire a laser to tag enemies, sending them back to their home base. To train the AI to work as a team, the scientists created 30 different bots and pitted them against each other in a series of matches on randomly generated maps. The bots trained using brain-inspired algorithms called neural networks, which learn from data by altering the strength of connections between artificial neurons. The only data the bots had to learn from was the first-person visual perspective of their character and game points, awarded for things like picking up flags or tagging opponents.      Initially the bots acted randomly. But when their actions scored points, the connections that led to the behavior were strengthened through a process called reinforcement learning. The training program also culled the bots that tended to lose and replaced them with mutated copies of top performers inspired by the way genetic variation and natural selection help animals evolve.Advertisement After 450,000 games, the researchers arrived at the best bot, which they named For The Win (FTW). They then tested it in various matches with a mirror FTW, an FTW bot missing a crucial learning element, the game's in-built bots, and humans. Teams of FTW bots consistently outperformed all other groups, though humans paired with FTW bots were able to beat them 5% of the time, they report today in Science. The FTW bots learned to play seamlessly with humans and machines, and they even developed classic cooperative strategies, says study co-leader Max Jaderberg, an AI researcher at Google-owned DeepMind in London. Those strategies included following teammates in order to outnumber opponents in later firefights and loitering near the enemy base when their teammate has the flag to immediately grab it when it reappears. In one test, the bots invented a completely novel strategy, exploiting a bug that let teammates give each other a speed boost by shooting them in the back. ""What was amazing during the development of this project was seeing the emergence of some of these high-level behaviors,"" Jaderberg says. ""These are things we can relate to as human players."" The approach is still a long way from working in the real world, Jaderberg adds. But the advance is good for more than computer games. If AI can learn to work in teams, it could make everything from self-driving cars that avoid crashes by coordinating with each other to robotic surgical assistants that help out doctors during procedures. Still, Littman warns against extrapolating too much from a relatively simple computer simulation. ""It could be that the details of this particular game require only a very narrow slice of what we think of as teamwork,"" he says. And that, he says, means there's no guarantee the same approach would teach AI to work as a team on other tasks.

While discussions over the safety of its development keep escalating, developers expand abilities and capacity of artificial intellect. Today Artificial Intelligence went far beyond science fiction idea. It became a necessity. Being widely used for processing and analyzing huge volumes of data, AI helps to handle the work that cannot be done manually anymore because of its significantly increased volumes and intensity.For instance, AI is applied in analytics to build predictions that can help people create strong strategies and look for more effective solutions. FinTech applies AI in investment platforms to do market research and predict where to invest funds for bigger profits. The traveling industry uses AI to deliver personalized suggestions or launch chatbots, plus enhance the overall user experience. These examples show that AI and ML are used process loads of data to offer better user experience, more personal and accurate one.How AI and ML Form Technologies of the FutureToday, with the expansion of volumes and complexity of data, AI and ML are used for its processing and analysis. To be fair, the human brain can analyze large amounts of data, but this ability is limited by the volume of data it can absorb at any moment. Artificial intelligence is free from this limitation. More accurate predictions and insights delivered by AI improve business efficiency, lower production cost and increase productivity. No wonder that many industries apply AI and ML to improve performance and propel the product development.According to Deloitte research, AI-fueled companies are the latest trend in the technological transformation aimed at improvement of productivity. That is also proved by their prediction that within the next 24 months the number of companies that will use AI in their products and processes to achieve greater efficiency and strategic goals will likely increase. To put it short, AI helps doing better work with fewer efforts.Given the listed advantages of AI usage, more and more companies are eager to use it. However, AI is a two-way street — being used for optimization of the analytic process it is not the easiest technology to develop. Due to huge volumes of data to be analyzed, the AI product has to be able to handle the high-loaded process effectively and does not take too much time for that. To make it work properly, the appropriate language has to be chosen for its development. The one that will not be too complex in terms of syntax, will be able to handle sophisticated processes and is easy to support.Python as the best programming language for AI and MLAs AI and ML are being applied across various channels and industries, big corporations invest in these fields, and the demand for experts in ML and AI grows accordingly. Jean Francois Puget, from IBM’s machine learning department, expressed his opinion that Python is the most popular language for AI and ML and based it on a trend search results on indeed.com.According to the graph from Francois Puget, Python is the major code language for AI and ML.We have conducted some research on Python’s strong sides and found out why you should opt in for Python when bringing your AI and ML projects to life.You May Also Like:Machine Learning and Data Analytics in the Travel IndustryOne of the most famous travellers of all times, Christopher Columbus, made only 4 journeys during all his life. One of…djangostars.com6 Examples of AI in Financial ServicesJust as many other technological advancements, Artificial Intelligence came to our lives from the pages of fairy tales…djangostars.com1. A great library ecosystemA great choice of libraries is one of the main reasons Python is the most popular programming language used for AI. A library is a module or a group of modules published by different sources like PyPi which include a pre-written piece of code that allows users to reach some functionality or perform different actions. Python libraries provide base level items so developers don’t have to code them from the very beginning every time.ML requires continuous data processing, and Python’s libraries let you access, handle and transform data. These are some of the most widespread libraries you can use for ML and AI:Scikit-learn for handling basic ML algorithms like clustering, linear and logistic regressions, regression, classification, and others.Pandas for high-level data structures and analysis. It allows merging and filtering of data, as well as gathering it from other external sources like Excel, for instance.Keras for deep learning. It allows fast calculations and prototyping, as it uses the GPU in addition to the CPU of the computer.TensorFlow for working with deep learning by setting up, training, and utilizing artificial neural networks with massive datasets.Matplotlib for creating 2D plots, histograms, charts, and other forms of visualization.NLTK for working with computational linguistics, natural language recognition, and processing.Scikit-image for image processing.PyBrain for neural networks, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.Caffe for deep learning that allows switching between the CPU and the GPU and processing 60+ mln images a day using a single NVIDIA K40 GPU.StatsModels for statistical algorithms and data exploration.In the PyPI repository, you can discover and compare more Python libraries.2. A low entry barrierWorking in the ML and AI industry means dealing with a bunch of data that you need to process in the most convenient and effective way. The low entry barrier allows more data scientists to quickly pick up Python and start using it for AI development without wasting too much effort into learning the language.Python programming language resembles the everyday English language, and that makes the process of learning easier. Its simple syntax allows you to comfortably work with complex systems, ensuring сlear relations between the system elements.For instance, this code is written in an attempt to find out if an input number is prime.Here’s the view of the code:test_number = 407 # our example is not a prime number# prime numbers are greater than 1if test_number > 1:# check for factorsnumber_list = range(2, test_number)for number in number_list:number_of_parts = test_number // numberprint(f""{test_number} is not a prime number"")print(f""{number} times {number_of_parts} is {test_number}"")breakelse:print(f""{test_number} is a prime number"")else:print(f""{test_number} is not a prime number"")And as you may see in the last row, the result of this code is that the test number is not a prime one. To put it bluntly, an English-speaking person could easily understand the meaning of the code, as it uses simple English words.In addition to this, there’s a lot of documentation available, and Python’s community is always there to help out and give advice.3. FlexibilityPython for machine learning is a great choice, as this language is very flexible:It offers an option to choose either to use OOPs or scripting.There’s also no need to recompile the source code, developers can implement any changes and quickly see the results.Programmers can combine Python and other languages to reach their goals.Moreover, flexibility allows developers to choose the programming styles which they are fully comfortable with or even combine these styles to solve different types of problems in the most efficient way.The imperative style consists of commands that describe how a computer should perform these commands. With this style, you define the sequence of computations which happen as a change of the program state.The functional style is also called declarative because it declares what operations should be performed. It doesn’t consider the program state, compared to the imperative style, it declares statements in the form of mathematical equations.The object-oriented style is based on two concepts: class and object, where similar objects form classes. This style is not fully supported by Python, as it can’t fully perform encapsulation, but developers can still use this style to a finite degree.The procedural style is the most common among beginners, as it proceeds tasks in a step-by-step format. It’s often used for sequencing, iteration, modularization, and selection.The flexibility factor decreases the possibility of errors, as programmers have a chance to take the situation under control and work in a comfortable environment.4. Platform independencePython is not only comfortable to use and easy to learn but also very versatile. What we mean is that Python for machine learning development can run on any platform including Windows, MacOS, Linux, Unix, and twenty-one others. To transfer the process from one platform to another, developers need to implement several small-scale changes and modify some lines of code to create an executable form of code for the chosen platform. Developers can use packages like PyInstaller to prepare their code for running on different platforms.Again, this saves time and money for tests on various platforms and makes the overall process more simple and convenient.5. ReadabilityPython is very easy to read so every Python developer can understand the code of their peers and change, copy or share it. There’s no confusion, errors or conflicting paradigms, and this leads to more a efficient exchange of algorithms, ideas, and tools between AI and ML professionals.There are also tools like IPython available, which is an interactive shell that provides extra features like testing, debugging, tab-completion, and others, and facilitates the work process.6. Good visualization optionsWe’ve already mentioned that Python offers a variety of libraries, and some of them are great visualization tools. However, for AI developers, it’s important to highlight that in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and machine learning, it’s vital to be able to represent data in a human-readable format.Libraries like Matplotlib allow data scientists to build charts, histograms, and plots for better data comprehension, effective presentation, and visualization. Different application programming interfaces also simplify the visualization process and make it easier to create clear reports.7. Community supportIt’s always very helpful when there’s strong community support built around the programming language. Python is an open-source language which means that there’s a bunch of resources open for programmers starting from beginners and ending with pros.A lot of Python documentation is available online as well as in Python communities and forums, where programmers and machine learning developers discuss errors, solve problems, and help each other out.Python programming language is absolutely free as is the variety of useful libraries and tools.8. Growing popularityAs a result of the advantages discussed above, Python is becoming more and more popular among data scientists. According to StackOverflow, the popularity of Python is predicted to grow until 2020, at least.This means it’s easier to search for developers and replace team players if required. Also, the cost of their work maybe not as high as when using a less popular programming language.Python use cases for AI and MLPython offers many features that are helpful for AI and ML in particular, and that makes it the best language for these purposes. No wonder that various industries use Python for predictions and other machine learning tasks.Let’s take a closer look at some examples in:Travel;Fintech;Transportation;Healthcare.TravelFor example, the travel industry giant Skyscanner used a Python unsupervised ML algorithm to predict the behavior of new airplane routes. They compared thousands of origins and destinations, evaluating each one of them with 30 different criteria to define the demand of passengers. Their results are displayed on a dashboard, where you can choose any origin city to see the groups of destinations numbered from 0 to 9 and their characteristics.Such an example of AI implementation in the traveling industry is extremely helpful for suggesting destinations to the users, assisting the creation of marketing budgets, as well as setting an initial price for new routes.FintechAI used in financial services helps to solve problems connected with risk management, fraud prevention, personalized banking, automation, and other tools which help to provide a high-quality financial service to the users. It’s predicted that AI in fintech could reduce operating costs by 22% by 2030, resulting in an impressive $1 trillion.Some successful examples of online banking software built on Python are Venmo, Affirm or Robinhood. These services not only allow users to make and control their payments and purchases but they also create a social network inside the software, so people can stay connected.When it comes to cryptocurrency, Python is used to build solutions like Anaconda to effectively analyze the market, make predictions and visualize data.TransportationUber developed an ML platform Michelangelo PyML using Python. They use it for online and offline predictions solving day-to-day tasks. The Michelangelo PyML is the extension of the initial Michelangelo product which was scalable but not flexible enough. Now, users can validate models with PyML and then replicate them in Michelangelo for full efficiency and scalability.HealthcareAI is reshaping the healthcare industry by helping to predict and scan diseases, detect injuries, and help people maintain good health even on a day-to-day basis with easy-to-use mobile applications.There are many great AI based projects in the industry. For example, Fathom is a natural language processing system which is made to analyze electronic health records, and their mission is “to automate medical coding.” Their leaders have come from companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook or the universities of Stanford and Harvard.AiCure is another startup focused on making sure that patients take the right medications at the right time. For that purpose, they use technologies like face recognition, pill recognition, and action recognition. The application is also able to analyze the patient’s state and understand if the treatment is working. They use IMA which is an interactive medical assistant that can gather clinically significant data which then can be analyzed by the software.Growing popularity leads to the growing demand for Python programmers inside the data science community, and it’s a wise choice to choose a language that’s in high demand, as, in the future, it will allow even more functionality.Python for machine learning: useful open source projectsThe open-source nature of Python allows any AI development company to share their achievements with the community. If you’ve made up your mind and decided to learn Python, or want to use this language for your AI projects, here’s a list of useful opensource projects for you to begin with:OpenCog FoundationOpenCog is “building better minds together” by putting effort into creating the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with human capacities. It was founded in 2011, and, now, it’s used at the SingularityNET project, as well as at the Hanson Robotics delivering intelligence to the Sofia and other robots.Institute for Artificial IntelligenceThe Institute of Artificial Intelligence is a part of the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of Bremen. It conducts research on AI and holds different workshops and events which help move the AI technologies forward, involving more young people into the sphere and educating them, while also supporting existing AI-powered projects and companies.ZulipIt’s the “world’s most productive team chat” that allows the processing of thousands of real-time messages a day. Fortune 500 companies and other large and open source projects use Zulip, which offers clear organization, asynchronous communication, and other great advantages that are useful for teams.MagentaMagenta is a Python library and a research project, the biggest goal of which is to make music and art using AI. It works on image, songs, drawings generation and lets artists explore new ways of creating.MailPileMailPile is an innovative email client that focuses on safe and private communication. It’s a project that tries to answer a question: “How can I protect my privacy online?” It’s fast, has no ads and comes with a powerful search function as well as privacy and encryption.Summing it upAI and ML are fast-growing and universal technologies that let scientists resolve real-life dilemmas and come up with clever solutions.

In the war between machines and mankind, the machines have gained the upper hand.
It’s bad enough that computers can now beat us at chess, Jeopardy, and Go. Artificial intelligence-driven algorithms are now tackling jobs once considered the exclusive province of living, breathing bipeds. That includes doctors, lawyers, teachers, and, yes, IT professionals.
McKinsey estimates that roughly half of all work activities could be automated using today’s technology, and that up to 30 percent of global workers could be displaced by 2030. The jobs of millions more will be changed forever by AI.

Are you at risk of being replaced by an algorithm? And if so, what can you do about it?
Here’s what you need to know about our glorious robotic future.











 
 
 
Take this job and code it
As in virtually every industry, the IT jobs that will be automated first involve repetitive and often manual work that doesn’t require a lot of human discretion, notes Keith Strier, global and America’s advisory leader for AI at consulting giant EY.
“If you’re a sysadmin, or tier one tech support, or even in cybersecurity but your primary job is to look for certain signals and indicators, your jobs are up for grabs,” he says.
According to researchers at Oxford University and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, database administrators have a 39 percent chance of having their jobs automated. If you’re an IT operations tech, that number rises to 78 percent.











 
 
 
Those numbers will also vary depending on where you live, says Dr. Hyejin Youn, assistant professor of management and organizations at Kellogg. The smaller the city, the more likely your job will be taken over by a machine.

“These job titles won’t become extinct,” explains Youn. “There will still be a need for humans in the occupation, but the tasks will change, and the number of people doing it will be much smaller.”
Because IT is continually asked to do more every year, usually without a huge boost in budget, Strier says IT departments are more likely to reassign employees to more advanced tasks and use automation to fill the gaps.











 
 
 
“It’s less about letting people go, and more about reduced hiring,” he says. “Doubling capacity without doubling headcount seems to be an increasingly popular way of looking at the savings automation creates.”
But what’s changing is the types of tasks that can automated, notes Forrest Brazeal, senior cloud architect for Trek10, a cloud consultancy. In a widely shared essay titled “The Creeping IT Apocalypse,” Brazeal wrote about the quiet decimation of low- and mid-level IT jobs brought about by the growth of cloud services and AI.
While the loss of jobs through automation has been a byproduct of technology advancement since the industrial revolution, Brazeal says this time is different.











 
 
 
“This is a sea change,” he says in a phone interview. “Entire disciplines will be going away. There will be much less call for Windows sysadmins, DBAs, and network engineers. That’s what a lot of people are missing, and it’s what I mean when I talk about the ‘creeping apocalypse.'”
Alexa, write me an application
One of the higher-level jobs that AI will soon take on is writing code. In fact, the quest to automate programming is already well underway.
In 2017, Google’s AutoML research project demonstrated that it could generate machine-learning software that’s sometimes more accurate than similar programs written by humans. It’s now available as a cloud-based service that allows developers with limited machine learning experience to train ML models.











 
 
 
Last year, computer scientists at Rice University unveiled BAYOU, an AI application that uses “Neural Sketch Learning” to generate code. After studying 100 million lines of Java on GitHub, the DARPA-funded tool is able to recognize high-level patterns in programs and recreate similar ones on demand. Enter a few keywords to tell BAYOU the kind of program you want to create, and it will spit out Java code to fit the bill.
AWS’s App Sync and Amplify “low-code/no-code” development automation services are another example of this, says Brazeal.
“The idea is to take most of the work out of creating a traditional back end, so you can spin it up and have it happen automatically with just a few lines of config,” he says.











 
 
 
Once that’s in place, he adds, you’ve eliminated an entire class of software developers. And the writing for many of the rest is clearly on the wall.
“We’re starting to see the beginning of ‘conversational programming’ — the ability to build services by saying, ‘Alexa, take these components and put them together to give me an application,'” he says. “We’re not there yet, but it’s something to keep an eye on.”
People first?
When executives talk about automation, they invariably say that relieving IT employees of boring and repetitive tasks frees them to take on more strategic roles and responsibilities. But when you ask what those new roles will look like, and how employees will make that transition, you tend to get a blank stare.











 
 
 
The fact is, few organizations have even thought about it, says Strier.
“The majority of these projects are being championed by a mid-level executive who’s been told to reduce overhead or improve customer service or some other goal,” he says. “They’ve not been empowered to worry about the future of their workforce. To them, that’s an HR issue. They truly believe automation will free up their workforce to do more important things, but no one does the work to figure out what that is.”
Strier says he has one client, a large telecommunications firm, that has thought through the implications of how automation will change what its employees do. That firm was forced to address these issues because it was heavily unionized.











 
 
 
“That enabled them to say to the unions, ‘Look, we’ve identified job classifications that will be more deeply impacted over the next three years. We can give notice to those employees and offer them an opportunity to think about retraining,'” he says. “That’s better than getting a letter on Monday saying, ‘We’re shutting down your department.'”
Implementing this kind of broad organizational change is not a trivial task, says Stanton Jones, director of research for ISG, a technology and research advisory firm.
“The vision many enterprises have is that they’re going to take that 30 percent of people’s tasks and repurpose them for something more important,” says Jones. “But doing that for hundreds or thousands of people is really hard work. I’m not saying it can’t be done — a small number of companies are really rethinking how their organizations can be run — but it requires they put people ahead of their cost savings and productivity goals. That’s pretty rare.”











 
 
 
Augmented, not replaced
It’s an article of faith that as jobs continue to be made obsolete by automation, new roles will emerge to replace them. And so it goes with AI, which will both dramatically change today’s jobs and create new ones that do not yet exist, notes Erik Brown, a senior director in West Monroe Partners’ technology practice.
“In a few years it will be hard to find a job that’s not augmented by AI,” he says. “Think about financial services and fraud detection, or risk exposure in investments. AI will be used by utility companies to predict how weather will impact energy demand, and by insurance companies to process claims. And there will be a lot of jobs in education, teaching people how to use their business knowledge to train algorithms.”
Likewise, Brown adds, network engineering jobs could evolve into roles that use AI to manage data centers more efficiently, as Google did with the DeepMind algorithms it developed to defeat a human champion at the Chinese game of Go.











 
 
 
One of the biggest sources of new jobs will be embedding AI into hardware such as robots or autonomous vehicles, says Strier.
“Integration of that software and hardware is very complex, and it won’t happen on its own,” he says. “So while you might have used AI to write some of the software, ultimately humans will need to do the integration, modeling, and testing of these complex hardware/software configurations.”
Newly emerging roles such as ITops data scientists, AIOps architects, and automation path designers will be created as a result of AI-driven automation, says Will Cappelli, CTO for EMEA at Moogsoft.











 
 
 
“The human side of IT will have to shift from observation to analysis, which is why professionals in these future positions will need skills involving mathematics and an end-to-end understanding of how modern IT systems behave,” he adds.
At the executive level, companies riding the AI wave are looking to hire data-savvy executives who combine business skills and analytics expertise, says Scott Snyder, a partner with Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search and consulting firm. 
“We place a lot of leadership positions like chief AI officer and chief data officer,” says Snyder. “We’re always looking for people with data-intensive backgrounds who can graft those skills with institutional or functional knowledge, such as HR, legal, or supply chain.”
Brave new jobs
AI is also likely to generate a raft of other jobs that are just barely visible on the horizon, says Amber Bouchard, director of talent acquisition for Maven Wave, a digital transformation consulting firm.











 
 
 
One of those roles could be “citizen data scientist,” she says. Such an employee would analyze data and extract insights, but without the need for an advanced degree in statistics — like a business analyst on steroids.
Another new role would be “neutral AI assurance expert,” a master coder who can detect potentially biased algorithms in complex machine-learning models. And once the impacts of AI start to become felt, companies may also want a chief ethics officer to oversee the moral implications of machine learning and AI in the workplace.
“Organizations will need a person who can partner with HR, senior management, and C-level executives to oversee the implementations of these new technologies,” Bouchard says. “Someone will have to erect virtual walls and help organizations navigate the waters of technological advancement.”
She adds that there will remain tens of millions of jobs that can’t be easily automated.
“There are many jobs that are susceptible to automation,” Bouchard says. “There are just as many jobs, especially within firms like ours, that require the judgment, social skills and hard-to-automate human capabilities that AI cannot take away.”
Robot wranglers
In the meantime, IT pros worried about being replaced by robots should think seriously about diversifying their skill sets and consider becoming full-stack engineers, says ISG’s Jones.
“People who can manage everything from the web server through middleware, the operating system, and even down to the virtual machine layer are in huge demand,” says Jones. “Organizations cannot find those people fast enough. But if you’re stuck on a single set of technologies, that’s going to be problematic.”
Jobs that consist of “undifferentiated heavy lifting” are always the first to go, adds Brazeal. The more generic the tasks you perform each day, the more likely you’ll be replaced by code. Developing expertise in areas that add bottom-line value to the company are the best ways to ensure job security.
And while you won’t need to become an AI expert, deep familiarity with the available AI solutions will become increasingly necessary.
“The skill sets the tech department will need to remain relevant won’t be building AI systems,” says Strier. “They’ll need to be experts on the different solutions in the field, the strategic use of this technology, and how to integrate third-party AI services into their operations.”
In other words, he adds, tech pros won’t necessarily need to know how to build a facial recognition algorithm, but they will need to know how to pick the right one for their company.
That’s something robots can’t do… yet.

Live00:0003:5903:59 Music made by machines? Inside the latest revolution in music03:59Cantor is not alone. Composers he has worked with are eager to use new technology as a tool for pushing their work into new areas. And it's not just in classical music. With several new musical programs emerging that encourage musicians to compose with AI, tech enthusiast and former American Idol contestant Taryn Southern released the first pop album to be co-written and co-produced with artificial intelligence.Turning patterns into musicAI is essentially a pattern-recognition system. Feed it enough data, and it will find patterns within that information that it can use to make decisions. In the case of the Schubert symphony, the decisions were about which musical notes should be placed where.And there are other examples of AI's creativity, from other disciplines.Artists like the Munich-based Mario Klingemann have used AI to recognize patterns across thousands of 14th to 17th century European oil portraits to create an ever-changing single work, highlighting a “greatest hits” medley of images. (The work sold at auction in March for more than $50,000.)Similarly, software from Open AI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company, can write a portion of a news story and then have AI write the rest. (The results are so convincing that Open AI, fearful of building a fake-news machine that any propaganda outlet or hostile nation could use to spread disinformation, released only a limited version of the software to the public.)RelatedTechnologyTechnologyAI can predict when someone will die with unsettling accuracyFor Cantor and Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that built the software used to complete the Schubert symphony, the question was which dataset to use to train the software. All of Western music? All classical music?In the end, Cantor and engineers from Huawei fed as much of Schubert’s catalog as they could find — roughly 2,000 pieces of piano music — into the software inside the company's new Mate 20 phone. The goal was to teach the AI to think like Schubert and to compose new passages, including what Cantor calls the “heart and soul of any piece of music”: the melody.
“I was impressed that a computer could generate musical ideas, so everything that it sent me back I found to be kind of incredible,"" Cantor says. ""It’s like having a collaborator that has an endless stream of ideas, that never gets tired, that never runs out of ideas, that never has a bad attitude and never needs to take a break.”Once the AI suggested a series of new melodies, Cantor used his professional expertise to choose one. Then he elaborated on the software's notes, adding instruments and harmonies to flesh out the AI's contribution into a full movement.Can algorithms replace composers?Economists, behavioral scientists and other experts have long argued that AI could one day automate entire industries, from delivery driving to dry cleaning. Critics of AI have concluded, however, that even the most sophisticated AI software can’t replace our most quintessentially human capacity: the ability to find inspiration in the world around us and use our innate creativity to make art.But even the most beautiful music is, ultimately, just code. Algorithms can be taught to write code, and when an algorithm has seen enough of the musical code it's being asked to emulate, it can compose music that sounds, well, human.Does this mean artificial intelligence can now take the place of a skilled composer? Cantor demurs, calling AI “just another tool in the toolbox” when he’s composing and saying he exploits all sorts of technology during the creative process. “The guitar is a piece of technology that you would collaborate with,"" he says. ""None of these things can make music on their own. When put in the hands of a capable human, they can really augment the human potential. And AI is not different.”But what happens when AI is used to create entire compositions?Southern, the Los Angeles-based pop artist, says the technology — which she says makes the process of composing more like shopping for a melody — is perfect for someone like her: a music lover who grew up writing code but who lacks formal training in either discipline.“Music was always a fun hobby for me, but I always felt like I didn’t actually have the skill set to make it as a musician,” Southern said. “But understanding the language of data and how music can translate into data made so much sense to me.”Pop artist and former American Idol contestant Taryn Southern sits down with NBC News Tech Correspondent Jacob Ward to chat about her album, co-produced and co-written with artificial intelligence.Chiara SottileFor her new album, ""I Am AI,"" Southern composed songs using the artificial intelligence platform Amper. But it's just one of several similar programs musicians can use to compose songs, including Google’s Magenta, Sony's Flow Machines and Jukedeck. Each of these programs makes it possible for a musician to pick the key of music, specific instruments, the beats per minute of the rhythm as well as the point where the music builds to a climax. Then the artificial intelligence offers up a range of options that the musician can choose from — picking one, combining several or altering their initial input for an alternative result.Difficult questionsThe creators of Amper, who imagined that it would be used to replace musicians typically hired to compose and record promotional music, fed it a variety of genres. Choose “documentary,” “futuristic” and “hopeful,” and up comes a spare, glitchy track with an upbeat bass line. Choose “trap bombastic,” and you can imagine the result rattling the windows of your car.RecommendedScience NewsScience NewsPerseid meteor shower, one of the most dramatic of the year, is underwaySpaceSpaceScientists have confirmed a cave on the moon that could be used to shelter future explorersThe music created by Amper and similar programs is essentially indistinguishable from what you can hear on any radio station, and it raises difficult questions. For example, if we use pattern-recognition software to create only music that is similar to what we’ve enjoyed in the past, will we wind up trapped in a feedback loop? How will musicians find new inspiration if they are only sampling what’s already been done? Will music lovers of future generations wind up listening only to variations on compositions from the past?Southern says that, for better or for worse, the need to produce nearly endless amounts of new work will drive the market for music-composition AI software. “There is a tremendous amount of pressure for any content creator to be constantly producing faster, better and stronger,” she says.And if the result sounds as good as anything composed by a human, is that necessarily a bad thing? “These tools will actually just fortify creativity,” she says. “And ultimately, it’s not really about, ‘Is the computer being creative?’ It’s about, ‘Does the person who’s listening to the music or looking at the art think it’s being creative?’”Want more stories about technology?Watch Mona Lisa come to life in startling 'deepfake' videosAI can predict when someone will die with unsettling accuracyScientists turn brain signals into speech with help from AISIGN UP FOR THE MACH NEWSLETTER AND FOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.",https://www.today.com/video/music-made-by-machines-inside-the-latest-revolution-in-music-60356165824,,Music made by machines?

Or is a thought process constrained by what us humans define it as?In 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo system trounced the world’s reigning champion, Lee Sedol at Go – an ancient Chinese game – by using its creative intelligence to devise a winning strategy. Although AlphaGo has been described as years ahead of its time, AI is rapidly sweeping into our everyday lives and its advancement has begun to transform and aid creative processes, as well as challenge what we believe to be ‘creative thinking’.Trending NowMoistCr1TiKaL Answers The Web's Most Searched QuestionsIn one game against Sedol, the Google system's 37th move was one no human would think to make. ""It's not a human move. I've never seen a human play this move,"" one fellow Go champion said, before adding that it was ""beautiful"".Using its ability to learn human creativity from vast datasets and quickly produce solutions to tough problems, AI is creating a new landscape of creative opportunity. “As humans we are very good at making sophisticated decisions to select the best fit by taking into account convoluted considerations,” says Daghan Cam and Michail Desyllas, Founders of Ai Build, who use AI and robotic technologies for additive manufacturing. “However, we are not very good at producing large arrays of possible solutions to choose from. We lose our ability to take these decisions efficiently and consistently as the number of possible solutions increases.”AdvertisementAI is a solution to this issue and is enabling designers such as Cam and Desyllas to construct better designs by accelerating their thought processes and increasing their creative options. By using AI to automate the production process, Ai Build reduces material usage, labour and costs whilst creating complex designs that were once impossible to devise and build. In one instance it used concrete in irregular shaped molds to reduce the amount of material needed.Creative AI is being used as more than a workmanlike tool, however. It is also influencing the music industry, giving musicians the ability to better understand their creative process and even themselves. Beatboxer Reeps One, also known as Harry Yeff, is the first voice artist to perform a ‘battle’ with an AI opponent. Via a deep-learning programme, a machine was programmed to categorizes Yeff’s sounds, but also create its own music.After taking part in chess tournaments and using AI to improve his game, Yeff was initially fascinated with developing what he calls a ‘pet self’ – one which challenges you and leads you towards a new innovation. “I loved the idea of how an opponent can interrupt you and force you to become more,” Yeff explains. “AI is not an ‘other’ – a hijacked sci-fi representation; it's a tool, and it's something that we’re already engaging with every day.” AI can allow musicians such as Yeff to better understand and develop their creative abilities and, similar to Sedol’s competition with AlphaGo, raise their game.Most PopularCultureThe Real Reason Will Smith Broke Twitch’s Biggest Streaming RecordBy Adam BumasGearThe Top New Features Coming to Apple’s iOS 18 and iPadOS 18By Julian ChokkattuPoliticsJ.D.

As far back as 2015, people were confusing computer-generated music with classic pieces from the composer J.S. Bach.Similarly to Ai Build and Yeff, visual artist Anna Ridler is using AI as a tool to shape her creative strategy. In Ridler’s latest project ‘Tulips,’ she took photographs of flowers and produced an algorithm that created thousands of notional tulip varieties with unique characteristics. Although Ridler’s project illustrates the creative possibilities of AI used in visual art, Ridler says recommendation algorithms are changing the industry by influencing artists and curators to create work which society is more likely to engage with.“A lot of curation of art and design is now being driven by data and what people seem to like,” she says. “Netflix has probably had more of an impact on film making than any deep fake technology.” In an auction at the end of October 2018, an AI-generated portrait of a fictitious man sold for £341,000.In addition to giving creatives more options, insight into their work, and the awareness of audience engagement, AI is influencing creativity by being programmed to complete mundane tasks so that practitioners can focus on more creative ones. This is widely illustrated in the gaming industry, where AI helps automate game development tasks such as testing programs.Yet, AI used in creative practice today is self-controlled, meaning that it works within a controlled environment and is programmed to do what its creators tell it. “Creative people still want a lot of control over what AI is allowed to do,” says Mike Cook, an AI researcher at Queen Mary University of London and programmer of ‘Games by Angelina’ — an AI that builds its own games.“That's not a bad thing, and it's still letting AI enhance our work in incredible ways, but I think the next step – accepting AI into our work as a contributor – it will be a huge shift in the way people create.” In the future, Cook thinks that AI might take on a fully creative and personal role in playing and designing games. For example, in future versions of Minecraft, an AI might be programmed to have an active relationship with the player and help them achieve their goals. DeepMind has already proved it can play the infinitely complex StarCraft better than humans.Most PopularCultureThe Real Reason Will Smith Broke Twitch’s Biggest Streaming RecordBy Adam BumasGearThe Top New Features Coming to Apple’s iOS 18 and iPadOS 18By Julian ChokkattuPoliticsJ.D.

When more than a year ago ‘deepfake’, algorithm-generated porn movies, which combined actor bodies with faces of famous actors or other celebrities, became big news, the technological process that made this possible was still not fully developed.  You still had to use existing moving images in the process, to come up with convincing ‘fakes.’
Now, news coming from Samsung A.I. labs located in Moscow, suggests that this process has grown leaps and bounds since then. According to a paper that institution published, they were able to convincingly turn Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa into a living person that moves, talks, etc. with just the use of a single still picture.
Samsung’s researchers performed the same process on the images of Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein. By a process that is called “puppeteering”, they ‘mapped’ the moving facial features of other people onto their images. As the researchers explained the process can be done with just one image but the effect and realism can be even better recreated with the use of more images.See alsoLatest Buzz·3 min readWestward Ho!

As British Telegraph points out, in this age of fake news the effect  that could have on political manipulation is immense, particularly since there was already an instance in which a convincing fake video was created when a speech by former US President Barack Obama was ‘mapped’ onto Russian President  Vladimir Putin, making it look like he was actually making that speech.

Information prepared by data labelers in Africa, the construction workers of the digital world, create an important part of Silicon Valley’s efforts in AI. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and Yahoo use Samasource, a U.S. firm that creates AI training data and information around images, by using some of the poorest tech laborers in Kenya. Since AI is nothing without human labeling, will tech companies continue to walk the fine line of off-shoring what is slated to be the most dynamic part of the global economy?

The Breakdown You Need to Know
Data labeling is a necessary part of machine learning and there's an obvious motivation for these companies to use workers in parts of the world where wages are rock bottom. Not to mention the market for AI data preparation was $500M in 2018 and is expected to hit $1.2B by the end of 2023, according to Cognilytica.
Samasource provides what it calls a living wage to Kenyan AI data labelers of around $13-$16 a day, and CultureBanx notes that the average worker in the country makes about $3 a day, but it’s still chump change for big tech companies. They would be hard pressed to find U.S. data labeling experts to do boring, repetitive, never ending work at that price point. Low wage jobs like these don’t just exist in Africa, they are also in Southeast Asia.
PROMOTED
Microsoft’s Mary Gary told Axios these workers play a significant role and that economists don't have a handle on how to price the market. “We've been pricing this labor as a durable good, but it's the collective intelligence that's the value proposition"" Gary said.

Farming Out Big Data
The main reason big tech companies farm out these jobs is because data preparation and engineering tasks represent over 80% of the time consumed in most AI and machine learning projects. Since time is money, they don’t want to pay people a lot of it for repetitive labeling.
Even Intel’s head of data science notes it’s common practice to outsource these positions, “A healthy company with proper data science leadership will already make a distinction between data scientists and data engineers or data labelers, and will often hire vendors to do data annotation work.”
Still wondering what data labeling is? When artificial intelligence works as intended many tech companies shout its praises, but beyond the looking glass is a large AI low-wage labor force building its foundation. They upload images and then identify just about everything from people, animals, buildings, cars, signs and even the sky. By doing this across millions of images, AI systems can begin to recognize these objects in the real world.
The human in the AI loop isn’t going away anytime soon for data labeling and AI quality control. It’s also going to be a while before the technology these African workers are helping to create will be used in communities where they live. Many of these laborers often live below the poverty line, and continue to fuel a new type of blue-collar industry around curating the data that powers AI.

On Tuesday, May 28, MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) hosted a special TEDx event featuring an all-female line-up of MIT scientists and researchers who discussed cutting-edge ideas in science and technology.
TEDxMIT speakers included roboticists, engineers, astronomers, and policy experts, including former White House chief technology officer Megan Smith ’86 SM ’88 and MIT Institute Professor Emerita Barbara Liskov, winner of the A.M. Turing Award, often considered the “Nobel Prize for computing.”
From Professor Nergis Mavalvala’s work on gravitational waves to Associate Provost Krystyn Van Vliet’s efforts to improve cell therapy, the afternoon was filled with energizing and historic success stories of women in STEM.
In an early talk, MIT Associate Professor Julie Shah touched on the much-discussed narrative of artificial intelligence and job displacement, and how that relates to her own work creating systems that she described as “being intentional about augmenting human capabilities.”She spoke about her efforts developing robots to help reduce the cognitive burden of overwhelmed workers, like the nurses on labor wards who have to make hundreds of split-second decisions for scheduling deliveries and C-sections.
“We can create a future where we don’t have robots who replace humans, but that help us accomplish what neither group can do alone,” said Shah.
CSAIL Director Daniela Rus, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science, spoke of how computer scientists can inspire the next generation of programmers by emphasizing the many possibilities that coding opens up.
“I like to say that those of us who know how to ... breathe life into things through programming have superpowers,” said Rus.
Throughout the day scientists showed off technologies that could fundamentally transform many industries, from Professor Dava Newman’s prototype Mars spacesuit to Associate Professor Vivienne Sze’s low-power processors for machine learning.
Judy Brewer, director of the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Accessibility Initiative, discussed the ways in which the web has made the world a more connected place for those with disabilities — and yet, how important it is for the people who design digital technologies to be better about making them accessible.
“When the web became available, I could go and travel anywhere,” Brewer said. “There’s a general history of excluding people with disabilities, and then we go and design tech that perpetuates that exclusion. In my vision of the future everything is accessible, including the digital world.”
Liskov captivated the audience with her tales of the early days of computer programming. She was asked to learn Fortran on her first day of work in 1961 — having never written a line of code before.
“I didn’t have any training,” she said. “But then again, nobody did.”
In 1971 Liskov joined MIT, where she created the programming language CLU, which established the notion of “abstract data types” and laid the groundwork for languages like Java and C#. Many coders now take so-called “object-oriented programming” (OOP) for granted: She wryly reflected on how, after she won the Turing Award, one internet commenter looked at her contributions to data abstraction and pointed out that “everybody knows that, anyway.”
“It was a statement to how much the world has changed,” she said with a smile. “When I was doing that work decades earlier, nobody knew anything about [OOP].”
Other researchers built off of Liskov’s remarks in discussing the birth of big data and machine learning. Professor Ronitt Rubinfeld spoke about how computer scientists’ work in sublinear time algorithms has allowed them to better make sense of large amounts of data, while Hamsa Balakrishnan spoke about the ways in which algorithms can help systems engineers make air travel more efficient.
The event’s overarching theme was highlighting examples of female role models in fields where they’ve often been overlooked. Paula Hammond, head of MIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering, touted the fact that more than half of undergraduates in her department this year were women. Rus urged the women in the audience, many of whom were MIT students, to think about what role they might want to play in continuing to advance science in the coming years.
“To paraphrase our hometown hero, President John F. Kennedy, we need to prepare [women] to see both what technology can do for them — and what they can do for technology,” Rus said.
Rus led the planning of the TEDxMIT event alongside MIT research affiliate John Werner and student directors Stephanie Fu and Rucha Kelkar, both first-years.

Call for independent watchdog to monitor NZ government use of artificial intelligence

New Zealand is a leader in government use of artificial intelligence (AI). It is part of a global network of countries that use predictive algorithms in government decision making, for anything from the optimal scheduling of public hospital beds to whether an offender should be released from prison, based on their likelihood of reoffending, or the efficient processing of simple insurance claims.
But the official use of AI algorithms in government has been in the spotlight in recent years. On the plus side, AI can enhance the accuracy, efficiency and fairness of day-to-day decision making. But concerns have also been expressed regarding transparency, meaningful human control, data protection and bias.
In a report released today, we recommend New Zealand establish a new independent regulator to monitor and address the risks associated with these digital technologies.
AI and transparency
There are three important issues regarding transparency.
One relates to the inspectability of algorithms. Some aspects of New Zealand government practice are reassuring. Unlike some countries that use commercial AI products, New Zealand has tended to build government AI tools in-house. This means that we know how the tools work.
But intelligibility is another issue. Knowing how an AI system works doesn’t guarantee the decisions it reaches will be understood by the people affected. The best performing AI systems are often extremely complex.




To make explanations intelligible, additional technology is required. A decision-making system can be supplemented with an “explanation system”. These are additional algorithms “bolted on” to the main algorithm we seek to understand. Their job is to construct simpler models of how the underlying algorithms work – simple enough to be understandable to people. We believe explanation systems will be increasingly important as AI technology advances.
A final type of transparency relates to public access to information about the AI systems used in government. The public should know what AI systems their government uses as well as how well they perform. Systems should be regularly evaluated and summary results made available to the public in a systematic format.


New Zealand’s law and transparency
Our report takes a detailed look at how well New Zealand law currently handles these transparency issues.
New Zealand doesn’t have laws specifically tailored towards algorithms, but some are relevant in this context. For instance, New Zealand’s Official Information Act (OIA) provides a right to reasons for decisions by official agencies, and this is likely to apply to algorithmic decisions just as much as human ones. This is in notable contrast to Australia, which doesn’t impose a general duty on public officials to provide reasons for their decisions.
But even the OIA would come up short where decisions are made or supported by opaque decision systems. That is why we recommend that predictive algorithms used by government, whether developed commercially or in-house, must feature in a public register, must be publicly inspectable, and (if necessary) must be supplemented with explanation systems.
Human control and data protection
Another issue relates to human control. Some of the concerns around algorithmic decision-making are best addressed by making sure there is a “human in the loop,” with a human having final sign off on any important decision. However, we don’t think this is likely to be an adequate solution in the most important cases.
A persistent theme of research in industrial psychology is that humans become overly trusting and uncritical of automated systems, especially when those systems are reliable most of the time. Just adding a human “in the loop” will not always produce better outcomes. Indeed in certain contexts, human collaboration will offer false reassurance, rendering AI-assisted decisions less accurate.
With respect to data protection, we flag the problem of “inferred data”. This is data inferred about people rather than supplied by them directly (just as when Amazon infers that you might like a certain book on the basis of books it knows you have purchased). Among other recommendations, our report calls for New Zealand to consider the legal status of inferred data, and whether it should be treated the same way as primary data.
Bias and discrimination
A final area of concern is bias. Computer systems might look unbiased, but if they are relying on “dirty data” from previous decisions, they could have the effect of “baking in” discriminatory assumptions and practices. New Zealand’s anti-discrimination laws are likely to apply to algorithmic decisions, but making sure discrimination doesn’t creep back in will require ongoing monitoring.
The report also notes that while “individual rights” — for example, against discrimination — are important, we can’t entirely rely on them to guard against all of these risks. For one thing, affected people will often be those with the least economic or political power. So while they may have the “right” not to be discriminated against, it will be cold comfort to them if they have no way of enforcing it.
There is also the danger that they won’t be able to see the whole picture, to know whether an algorithm’s decisions are affecting different sections of the community differently. To enable a broader discussion about bias, public evaluation of AI tools should arguably include results for specific sub-populations, as well as for the whole population.
A new independent body will be essential if New Zealand wants to harness the benefits of algorithmic tools while avoiding or minimising their risks to the public.

Tempted to cheat on a written exam? Artificial intelligence is 90% certain to nab you

Combining big data with artificial intelligence has allowed University of Copenhagen researchers to determine whether you wrote your assignment or whether a ghostwriter penned it for you—with nearly 90 percent accuracy.





Several studies have shown that cheating on assignments is widespread and becoming increasingly prevalent among high school students. At the University of Copenhagen's Department of Computer Science, efforts to detect cheating on assignments through writing analysis by way of artificial intelligence have been underway for a few years. Now, based on analyses of 130,000 written Danish assignments, scientists can, with nearly 90 percent accuracy, detect whether a student has written an assignment on their own or if a ghostwriter composed it.
Danish high schools currently use the Lectio platform to check if a student has handed in plagiarized work with passages copied directly from a previously submitted assignment. High schools have a harder time discovering if a student has enlisted someone else to write the assignment for them, something that happens to a more or less systematized degree via online services. The case of the SRP, a major written assignment in the final year of Danish high school, is particularly telling. Because the assignment counts for double, students have gone as far as tendering out their writing assignments on the Danish classified website, Den Blå Avis.
""The problem today is that if someone is hired to write an assignment, Lectio won't spot it. Our program identifies discrepancies in writing styles by comparing recently submitted writing against a student's previously submitted work. Among other variables, the program looks at: word length, sentence structure and how words are used. For instance, whether 'for example' is written as 'ex."" or 'e.g.,"""" explains Ph.D. student Stephan Lorenzen of the Department of Computer Science. He, along with the rest of the DIKU-DABAI research group, recently presented their findings at a major European AI conference.






Prior to setting the trap, an ethical debate
The program, Ghostwriter, is built around machine learning and neural networks—branches of artificial intelligence that are particularly useful for recognizing patterns in images and texts. MaCom, the company that provides Lectio to Danish high schools, has made a dataset of 130,000 written assignments from 10,000 high school students available to Ghostwriter project researchers at the Department of Computer Science. For now, it is still a research project.
Stephan Lorenzen doesn't think that it is unrealistic for the program to find its way into high schools in the not too distant future, as schools must constantly stay apace with technological developments to address authorship verification. ""I think that it is realistic to expect that high schools will begin using it at some point. But before they do, there needs to be an ethical discussion of how the technology ought to be applied. Any result delivered by the program should never stand on its own, but serve to support and substantiate a suspicion of cheating,"" believes Lorenzen.
Police and fake news
Ghostwriter's technological foundation can be applied elsewhere in society. For example, the program could be used in police work to supplement forged document analysis, a task carried out by forensic document examiners and others.
""It would be fun to collaborate with the police, who currently deploy forensic document examiners to look for qualitative similarities and differences between the texts they are comparing. We can look at large amounts of data and find patterns. I imagine that this combination would benefit police work,"" says Lorenzen, who emphasizes that ethical discussions are needed here as well.
The artificial intelligence used by researchers at the Department of Computer Science to detect cheating on assignments has a wide range of applications. It has already been used to analyze Twitter tweets to determine whether they were composed by actual users or penned by paid imposters or robots.
Facts:

The ghostwriter program uses what is known as a Siamese neural network to distinguish the writing styles of two texts. The network is trained on large amounts of data to learn from representations of writing styles, which are then compared.
When a student submits an assignment, the network compares it against their previous assignments. For each previous assignment, the network provides a percentage score for writing style similarity against the new assignment.
In the end, a weighted average of these scores is calculated using a calculation that also takes other factors, such as delivery time, into account. This final score is presented as a percentage and indicates the similarity between the new assignment and the student's writing style.
The research group behind the result is the Danish Center for Big Data Analytics-driven Innovation (DIKU-DABAI). The group is headed by Professor Stephen Alstrup.

Nicholas Thompson, editor in chief of WIRED, moderated the 90-minute conversation in the packed Memorial Auditorium, filled to its 1705-seat capacity.The purpose was to discuss how AI will affect our future.Harari, a history professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and two-time winner of the Polonsky Prize for Creativity and Originality, is the author of international best sellers “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind” and “Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow.”Li is a renowned AI researcher, engineer and computer science professor. One of the most prolific academics in Artificial Intelligence today, her work in deep learning and computer vision is used by companies and research groups around the world. She is most known for her role creating ImageNet, a 14- million-image hand-annotated data set used extensively in computer vision applications.They touched on some of the most important topics about AI and technology, including whether we can still believe in human agency; what democracy looks like in the age of AI; and whether AI will ultimately hack or enhance humanity.Rather than drive us to stagnant speaking points, Li and Harari challenged us to contemplate many important questions characterizing consequences of Artificial Intelligence technology on individuals, including freedom and choice, and the impact of AI on the legal, economic and political systems of our world.These four relevant questions attempt to help untangle the AI’s impact on the individual:Rethinking Free Will: If you can’t trust the customer, if you can’t trust the voter, if you can’t trust your feelings, who do you trust? — Yuval Noah HarariLove and the Limits of AI: Is love hackable? — Fei-Fei LiOutsourcing Self-Awareness to AI: What does it mean to live in a world in which you learn about something so important about yourself from an algorithm? — Yuval Noah HarariHumans at the Center of AI: Can we reframe the education, the research and the dialog of AI and technology in general in a human-centered way? — Fei-Fei LiLike many who saw it, I came away from the talk with a sense of urgency. These are poignant questions that AI practitioners, policymakers and the public should be thinking about. All are a consequential part of the AI debate.But we need to act quickly. “The engineers won’t wait. And even if the engineers are willing to wait, the investors behind the engineers won’t wait. So, it means that we don’t have a lot of time,” Harari warned.Agreed.Rethinking Free Will“If you can’t trust the customer, if you can’t trust the voter, if you can’t trust your feelings, who do you trust?” — Yuval Noah HarariThe discussion jumped into the deep, difficult topic of free will and agency, skipping superficialities completely.An argument questioning the validity of free will seems at first brush like an extraneous, theoretical endeavor — something quite outside the scope of the engineering discipline. Indeed, many of the challenges discussed circle back to topics debated by philosophers for millennia.Only this time, there’s an entirely new angle: technology has advanced to the point where many of our closely held beliefs are being challenged, as Harari notes, “not by philosophical ideas, but by practical technologies.”Harari has criticized the central notions of free will and individual agency for most of a decade.He’s not alone. Numerous neuropsychological experiments have been waging a new assault on free will, thanks to advancements in the technology available to measure neural activity.This has lead many top neuroscientists to doubt the freedom of our decision-making.“We are just processing information within a cartography of our mind that gives rise mechanistically to our behaviour. So the decisions that we think we are consciously deciding on and making, actually it’s all just an illusion that can be reduced to what our brain is telling us to do.” — Hannah Crichlow, prominent Princeton neuroscientist and author of The Science of FateBut while the science is still maturing, the consequences of our free will being manipulated — Harari called this “Hacking Humans” — pose a great risk within our society.An organization may endeavour “to create an algorithm that understands me better than I understand myself, and can therefore manipulate me, enhance me, or replace me.”It will be our challenge to decide not only what these manipulations, enhancements or replacements should be, but also who should be making the decisions about them in the first place.We might wonder how we want to make choices about the possibilities for human enhancement.“Who decides what is a good enhancement and what is a bad enhancement? So how do you decide what to enhance if, and this is a very deep ethical and philosophical question — again that philosophers have been debating for thousands of years — [we don’t have an answer to the question] ‘what is good?’ What are the good qualities we need to enhance?” Harari asked.It is natural for many of us to “fall back on the traditional humanist ideas” that prioritize personal choice and freedom. However, he cautioned: “None of this works when there is a technology to hack humans on a large scale.”If the very idea of human agency and free will is under debate it becomes very difficult to determine how to decide what technology should be allowed to do. This affects every area of our lives too — what we choose to do, what we might buy, where we might go, and how we might vote. It remains unclear who should be making decisions about technology’s scope at all.This ambiguity leaves us face to face with a significant issue, thanks to the co-development of technology in biotechnology (B), computing power (C) and data analytics (D). These three items, according to Harari, can already be used to Hack Humans (HH).For the math-minded among us he summarizes it as B * C * D = HH.With modern technology, Hacking Humans may become a very real possibility.“This is the moment to open the dialogue, to open the research in those issues,” Li added.If manipulation is present, how are the systems of government, commerce, and personal liberty still legitimate?Love and the Limits of AI“Is love hackable?” — Fei-Fei LiIf humans can be “hacked” and our behaviour and beliefs manipulated, what is the limit of this subtle control?We may accept that we can be manipulated in small endeavors — Who doesn’t have a sudden craving for a cinnamon bun when walking into a bakery where they have just been made? — but surely there must be limits to the ways in which our behaviour can be controlled.At this point, no one seems to know for sure what these limits of manipulation may be.However, the tactics of manipulation certainly are known. Criminals and con artists using them have been in equal measures venerated for their boldness and reviled for their predacity through the media, and their stories told in cinema, literature and television.Collectively, we disbelieve our own personal susceptibility to manipulation. Rather, we assume those who have been manipulated are the stupid few. “The easiest people to manipulate are the people who believe in free will, because they think they cannot be manipulated,” concluded Harari.Weaponizing love as a potential for manipulation is not only possible, but well-documented. This theme is consistent with the long history of romance scams; many of us have heard of the “long distance lover who needs a sudden influx of money for some minor emergency.” Romance scams are the most “successful” of all types costing Americans $143 million last year.Columbia Psychologist Maria Konnikova and author of The Confidence Game, reminds us that manipulation “is accomplished, first and foremost, through emotion.” This leaves us in a vulnerable state since “feeling, at least in the moment, takes over from thinking.”After all, the manipulation system — Artificial Intelligence or not — doesn’t have to experience love in return to manipulate the human capacity for connection and intimacy with another. “To manipulate love is not the same thing as to actually feel it,” Harari explained.Without diminishing the importance of human love, the biological and neurochemical component has been well-studied.Given the ever greater amount of information each of us is providing, the deeper understanding we are gaining about our own biology, combined with the lower costs to analyze large amounts of data, the possibility for even costlier scams of this type cannot be ignored. These scams play on the very real and very human emotions of loneliness, isolation, and desire for a connection to another.We are all susceptible to this kind of manipulation. “We want to believe in what they’re telling us,” Konnikova reminds us.Few have a definitive view on the limits of what might be possible with the advances in data science and technology. Li is optimistic. “I do want to make sure that we recognize that we’re very, very, very far from that. This technology is still very nascent.” However, the stakes are getting higher and higher, and if that is the case at present, how long will it remain so?As Li commented: “I think you really bring out the urgency and the importance and the scale of this potential crisis. But I think, in the face of that, we need to act.”Outsourcing Self-Awareness to AI“What does it mean to live in a world in which you learn about something so important about yourself from an algorithm?” — Yuval Noah HarariFor millennia humans have been outsourcing some of the things that our brains do. Writing allows us to keep precise records instead of relying on our memory. Navigation moved from mythology and star charts to maps and GPS.But with AI we have a radical opportunity: What if self-awareness is one of the things humans will outsource to technology?Harari recounted a personal story about his own journey of self-discovery, confessing that he was unaware that he was gay until he was in his twenties. This revelation prompted a thought-provoking moment that showed how much we all struggle to see our own blind spots. “I only realized that I was gay when I was 21. And I look back at the time and I was I don’t know 15, 17 and it should have been so obvious.”Harari continued: “Now in AI, even a very stupid AI today, will not miss it.”This opens up a very interesting new possibility: Might algorithms know things about us that we don’t yet know?In the history of AI, this has been a tempting thought for decades.“I’m putting my money on a bet that says we build robots for the same reasons we do other kinds of science and art, for the immense satisfaction of knowing something significant about ourselves that we didn’t know before, of having our suspicions and guesses about ourselves confirmed or laid waste — simply put, of seeing ourselves in a new way.” — Pamela McCorduck, celebrated AI historian and author of Machines Who ThinkEven today, using the data we provide, it may be possible to diagnose a myriad of different conditions, from depression to cancer, earlier and meaningfully impact our lives.Beyond our physical and mental health, it is provocative to wonder what else large-scale analysis might unlock as a result of the data we now provide. After all, there are facets of the human experience that are immutable despite culture, generation, and station.As the analysis methods become more advanced and the available data increases, what experiences might we learn that we share with our friends, our neighbors, folks who live across the globe whose life hardly resembles our own?Two challenges, however, remain.There is a danger in giving an algorithm, even a very smart one, the authority to give us information about ourselves. Especially so if it makes it difficult to question and validate.“Once you dress something up as an algorithm or as a bit of artificial intelligence it can take on this air of authority that makes it really hard to argue with.” — Hannah Fry, esteemed UCL Mathematician and author of Hello World.If an algorithm predicts that we have cancer, we can get tested, but if it tells us something much more ambiguous, say if we are popular (or not) we may be inclined to take it as true because we have no way to validate it. This in turn might lead us to make different decisions thanks to a misplaced trust in a potentially faulty algorithm.Fry notes that we might believe what algorithms are saying to such an extent that it overrules our personal judgment.She relates the story of a carload of tourists “who tried to drive through water to get to a destination they were really interested in visiting. They did not overrule the navigation and had to be rescued.”Who will be there to rescue us if our very self-perception has been forced askew?Furthermore, using data to connect with experiences of others and to ourselves is a separate issue to having algorithms know deeply personal things about us that may be shared with other actors instead of us.“What happens if the algorithm doesn’t share the information with you, but it shares the information with advertisers? Or with governments?” wondered Harari.Even now, our information on social media is used to serve us “relevant” ads, and we are only beginning to find out who is paying for us to see them.“This is a good example, because this is already happening,” said Harari.AI has been used to predict if we will quit our job or break up with our significant other. Both are deeply personal decisions that many of us would be reluctant to want personal friends, much less impersonal organizations, to know.Li is skeptical that an algorithm might be able to surpass our own introspection this way. “I’m not so sure!” she said, giving us hope that we may be able to thoughtfully tackle some of these challenges while there’s still time.“Any technology humanity has created starting with fire is a double-edged sword. So it can bring improvements to life, to work, and to society, but it can bring perils, and AI has these perils,” she reminded us.Humans at the Center of AI“Can we reframe the education, the research and the dialog of AI and technology in general in a human-centered way?” — Fei-Fei LiWith the discussion weaving through so many pertinent disciplines, Li offered us a deft, albeit open ended, proposal to begin to tackle the many issues we face: to reframe Artificial Intelligence in a human-centered way.Li has begun the change at Stanford University with a great aim, and one that provides a functional template for all organizations, regardless of size and of source.She has established the Stanford Human-Centered AI (HAI) Institute which will bring together individuals from many different areas for a new collaborative dialogue.The Institute has three tenets:To be deliberate about what we would like AI to be;To encourage multidisciplinary study; andTo focus on enhancement and augmentation of humanity.“We’re not necessarily going to find a solution today, but can we involve the humanists, the philosophers, the historians, the political scientists, the economists, the ethicists, the legal scholars, the neuroscientists, the psychologists, and many more other disciplines into the study and development of AI in the next chapter,” said Li about the Institute.This recommendation stems from the challenges researchers and practitioners face in gaining and keeping public trust, providing a positive user experience, and replacing the fearmongering in AI with well-thought-out policy recommendation.Defining clear goals within the Artificial Intelligence community is a major step towards a hub we can all rally around, and the crossover between various disciplines is gaining increasing traction.“This is precisely why this is the moment that we believe the new chapter of AI needs to be written by cross-pollinating efforts from humanists, social scientists, to business leaders, to civil society, to governments, to come at the same table to have that multilateral and cooperative conversation,” Li stressed.But we’ve come to a crossroads.Indeed, many of the ethical questions that we face today are the results of decisions that have been made by engineers: the ethos of “move fast and break things” has ultimately resulted in things really breaking.Working in tech can blind its creators from the effects of the technologies that they build. There are myriad unintentional outcomes: large online retailers crowding out small business and changing the composition of our cities, to name just one.How can we balance our desire for innovation with the risks that come with it? When companies succeed without the slowdown that comes with being deliberate and thoughtful about their AI offerings, should we take measures to curb their growth?Li is optimistic about the inclusion of ethics into the software discipline.“Human-centered AI needs to be written by the next generation of technologists who have taken classes like [Stanford Political Science Professor] Rob [Reich]’s class [Computers, Ethics and Public Policy], to think about the ethical implications, the human well-being.”However straightforward this goal might be, many in the AI community might wonder whether it might also be the most challenging.“We cannot possibly do this alone as technologists,” Li warned.How do we convince the heavily technical folks working in Artificial Intelligence, individuals who may not want to concern themselves with nebulous subjects like societal effects of their work, that they should care about these things? And further, should that be the expectation? Do we require an ethical dimension to every role throughout the industry?Li is not so sure.“Some of us shouldn’t even be doing this. It’s the ethicists, philosophers who should participate and work with us on these issues.”Although very few forward-looking people working in the industry would dismiss its importance, the paradigm shift it requires should not be minimized. There has historically been a great deal of disdain within the tech community for any non-technical or tech-adjacent subject. Will the AI community respect the importance of these new perspectives or will we roll our eyes at anyone who doesn’t understand backpropagation?Even Li quipped, when asked whether Harari’s work is on her syllabus, “Not on mine, sorry. I teach hardcore deep learning. His book doesn’t have equations.”The conversation was well-timed to ask important new questions about the ways in which Artificial Intelligence may affect us as individuals in the coming decades. To mitigate the potential of “Hacking Humans” without a good understanding of the limits of the possibility of manipulation, Harari urged us to focus on self-awareness:“It’s the oldest advice in all the books in philosophies is know yourself. We’ve heard it from Socrates, from Confucius, from Buddha: get to know yourself. But there is a difference, which is that now you have competition…You’re competing against these giant corporations and governments. If they get to know you better than you know yourself, the game is over.”But a collaboration is needed, as suggested by Li. This work is starting to take shape within numerous organizations around the world.The conversation between Harari and Li marks the beginning of a new type of work in AI.“We opened the dialog between the humanist and the technologist and I want to see more of that,” she said.So do I.About the Author:Briana Brownell is a data scientist turned tech entrepreneur, futurist and innovator.
