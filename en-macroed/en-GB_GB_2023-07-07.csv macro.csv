Importantly, rather than replacing human workers, a priority for many organizations is doing this in a way that augments human abilities and enables us to work more safely and efficiently.

Today, the concept of AI technology in factories goes far beyond the robot-filled workplaces that have been a feature of industries since the 1960s to encompass smart, connected manufacturing plants where humans and machines work together, and data and analytics enable better predictions and decision-making at every stage of the process. So let’s take a look at some of the most interesting use cases for AI in manufacturing in 2023:



Cobots
PROMOTED
Robots have been used to automate manual tasks in factories and manufacturing plants for decades, but cobots are a relatively new development. What makes them different is that they are designed to work alongside humans in a safe way while augmenting our abilities with their own.
One big advantage of cobots over traditional industrial robots is that they are cheaper to operate as they don’t need their own dedicated space in which to function. This means they can safely work on a regular plant floor without the need for protective cages or segregation from humans. They can pick components, carry out manufacturing operations like screwing, sanding, and polishing, and operate conventional manufacturing machinery like injection molding and stamping presses. They can also carry out quality control inspections using computer vision-enabled cameras.

Cobots are widely used by automotive manufacturers, including BMW and Ford, where they perform tasks including gluing and welding, greasing camshafts, injecting oil into engines, and performing quality control inspections.

AI in Additive Manufacturing
Often known as 3D printing, the term additive manufacturing is used because it includes any manufacturing process where products and objects are built up, layer by layer. This differentiates it from more traditional, subtractive manufacturing processes where a product or component is made by cutting away at a block of material.
AI plays an important role in additive manufacturing by optimizing the way materials are dispensed and applied, as well as optimizing the design of complex products (see Generative Design below). It can also be used to spot and correct errors made by 3D printing technology in real-time.
Additive manufacturing equipment manufacturer Markforged has developed a tool called Blacksmith that uses AI to compare product designs with actual finished products and automate fine-tuning of the manufacturing process in order to bring them more closely into line.
Technology like this will be of benefit to manufacturers such as footwear giants Adidas and Reebok, which are now using 3D printing technology to create complex lattice structures for more comfortable and performance-enhancing running shoes.

Generative Design
Generative design is a bit like the generative AI we’ve seen in technologies like ChatGPT or Dall-E, except instead of telling it to create text or images, we tell it to design products.
Designers simply enter parameters such as what materials should be used, the size and weight of the desired product, what manufacturing methods will be used, and how much it should cost, and the generative design algorithms spit out blueprints and instructions.
Design engineers in the manufacturing industry can use this method to create a wide selection of design options for new products they want to create and then pick and choose the best ones to put into production. In this way, it accelerates product development processes while enabling innovation in design.
Generative design is particularly powerful when it comes to conceptualizing what can be done with new additive manufacturing processes, such as 3D printing, due to the complexity of the shapes and structures that can be created.
It has been used to create new types of components that are cheaper, lighter, and sturdier than existing components, improving the overall qualities of many products from cars and aircraft to prefabricated houses and structures.

Predictive Maintenance
Manufacturers use AI to analyze data from sensors and machinery on the factory floor in order to understand how and when failures and breakdowns are likely to occur. This means that they can ensure that resources and spare parts necessary for repair will be on hand to ensure a quick fix. It also means they can more accurately predict the amount of downtime that can be expected in a particular process or operation and account for this in their scheduling and logistical planning. Data from vibrations, thermal imaging, operating efficiency, and analysis of oils and liquids in machinery can all be processed via machine learning algorithms for vital insights into the health of manufacturing machinery.
Some examples of this in practice include Pepsi and Colgate, which both use technology designed by AI startup Augury to detect problems with manufacturing machinery before they cause breakdowns.

The Lights-Out Factory
A lights-out factory is a smart factory that's capable of operating entirely autonomously without any humans on site. Although mostly theoretical, there are some examples in existence already – such as the factory operated by Japanese robotics manufacturer FANUC without humans since 2001, which is capable of operating without human supervision for periods of up to 30 days.
Electronics manufacturer Philips also operates a factory in the Netherlands that makes electric razors, where a total of nine human members of staff are required on site at any time. This is a trend that we can expect to see other companies working towards adopting as time goes by as technology becomes increasingly efficient and affordable. Using a robots-only workforce means a factory can potentially operate 24/7 with no need for human intervention, potentially leading to big benefits when it comes to output and efficiency. Of course, questions will need to be addressed about what the impact removing humans from the manufacturing workforce will have on wider society.

However, it added that for the time being AI was changing jobs rather than replacing them.“Occupations in finance, medicine and legal activities which often require many years of education, and whose core functions rely on accumulated experience to reach decisions, may suddenly find themselves at risk of automation from AI,” said the OECD.It added that highly skilled occupations were most exposed to AI-powered automation, such as workers in the fields of law, culture, science, engineering and business.AI breakthroughs had resulted in cases where output from AI tools – such as ChatGPT – was indistinguishable from that of humans. As a result, major economies could be at a tipping point, the OECD said.“These rapid developments, combined with the falling costs of producing and adopting these new technologies, suggest that OECD economies may be on the cusp of an AI revolution which could fundamentally change the workplace,” the organisation said in its 2023 employment outlook, which refers to an “urgent need to act” on AI.The Paris-based body said: “Urgent action is required to make sure AI is used responsibly and in a trustworthy way in the workplace.”It said the UK, Luxembourg and Sweden had the lowest shares of employment in the occupations at highest risk, with the US also at the lower end of the scale, while Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic had the highest shares, with Germany and Italy also at the higher end of the table.The OECD said data indicated that economies were on the “brink” of a revolution rather than being in midst of one, with the share of firms that had adopted AI remaining in the single digits, due in part to issues related to cost and workforce skills.The OECD added that while AI had the potential to eliminate boring or dangerous tasks and create interesting ones instead, firms were open about the fact that a main motivation for investing in AI was improving worker performance and reducing staff costs.As a consequence, well-paid jobs requiring high-end education could suffer most.The OECD also outlined risks associated with the likelihood of AI’s growing influence over the workplace. Those included AI tools making hiring decisions, with the risk of falling foul of biased AI-driven decisions “greater for some socio-demographic groups who are often disadvantaged in the labour market already”.Evidence of gender and racial bias in AI-powered hiring processes has emerged in recent years and the issue of AI-driven prejudice has become one of the key safety concerns about the technology.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OECDComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveNancy Pelosi endorses Kamala Harris: ‘I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory’ – livePilot, 26, dies as her plane crashes after skydiving flight over Niagara FallsBen Jennings on Joe Biden endorsing Kamala Harris – cartoonYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

I asked one such company to try to replace me.By Kyle ChaykaJuly 11, 2023FacebookXEmailPrintSave StoryIllustration by Pablo DelcanSave this storySave this storySave this storySave this storyIn May, I was confronted with a robot version of my writer self. It was made, at my request, by a Silicon Valley startup called Writer, which specializes in building artificial-intelligence tools that produce content in the voice of a particular brand or institution. In my case, it was meant to replicate my personal writing voice. Whereas a model like OpenAI’s ChatGPT is “trained” on millions of words from across the Internet, Robot Kyle runs on Writer’s bespoke model with an extra layer of training, based on some hundred and fifty thousand words of my writing alone. Writer’s pitch is that I, Human Kyle, can use Robot Kyle to generate text in a style that sounds like mine, at a speed that I could only dream of. Writer’s co-founder and chief technology officer, Waseem Alshikh, recently told me that the company’s goal is to use A.I. to “scale content and scale language.” For more than a month now, I have been experimenting with my literary automaton to see how well it accomplishes this task. Or, as Robot Kyle put it when I asked him to comment on the possibility of replacing me: “How could a machine generate the insights, observations, and unique perspectives that I provide as a human?”Writer is one of several new startups that are attempting to apply emerging A.I. technology to the onerous task of writing. Like many technological innovations, writing robots are meant to create efficiency, particularly for businesses that have to produce large amounts of iterative text. Writer has relationships with companies such as the consulting firm Accenture, the technology company Intuit, and the lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret; commissions for customized models run in the seven figures. (Mine was created as an experiment, free of charge, without some of the intensive features that a corporation’s version would include.) With the help of Writer’s tools, the company hopes, a smaller number of human writers assisted by machines will accomplish the work of many, cutting down costs and increasing productivity in the composition of everything from product descriptions and tweets to C.E.O. messages, investors’ memos, and blog-post headlines. In a March report, Goldman Sachs concluded that three hundred million full-time jobs worldwide are vulnerable to this form of A.I. automation, the majority of them desk jobs. Alshikh speaks of the service as a kind of assembly line for language. “We had the Industrial Revolution; now we have this,” he said.AdChoicesThe looming presence of my personal A.I. model has indeed left me feeling a bit like an artisanal carpenter facing down a factory-floor buzz saw. Should I embrace being replaced and proactively automate my own job before someone else does? Could Robot Kyle help me write better, cleaner, faster? It seemed to think so. When I asked it to describe the long-term effects of machine-generated writing, Robot Kyle wrote, “Writers should not fear AI, but rather embrace it as a tool that can facilitate their craft, driving creativity and innovation instead of replacing it.” What, exactly, does Writer mean by the label “writer”? Our digitized world runs on filler text: avalanches of words and phrases written to optimize Web sites for search engines, to use as tags on social-media posts, and to employ in marketing newsletters that spam in-boxes. May Habib, the C.E.O. and the other co-founder of Writer, told me that the platform’s tools will automate the writing of “summaries, metadata, ads, distribution copy—all the stuff you spend time doing.” Victoria’s Secret, for instance, is using Writer to automate product copy for its underwear and swimsuits, but Writer promises something more sophisticated than mass-produced marketplace listings or formulaic e-mail blasts. Its core product, as Habib put it, is “automated insight extraction”—another way of describing the task of thinking, which is arguably the purpose of writing in the first place. As Joan Didion wrote, in 1976, “I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking.” A.I. programs such as Writer aim to supplant that process.In 1984, Steve Jobs famously described the computer as a “bicycle for the mind.” The experience of using Writer is something like riding an electric bike: step on the pedal and you’ll go much faster than the gears of the unassisted human mind could. The program’s interface features a prompt window on the left and a text box on the right. With a one-sentence prompt—let’s call it the seed of a thought—Writer can produce paragraphs of text in an instant. If you want more on the same subject, simply press the Command and Return keys simultaneously and another few sentences appear. Yet, as with any large language model, Writer cannot guarantee that the results will be factual or sensical. Writing without the aid of a generative machine might be frustrating, even excruciating, but it does encourage productive logic. If writing is thinking, ordering one’s ideas, generating text with A.I. may be a way to avoid thinking. What is writing without thinking? Maybe it is the definition of that deadening euphemism: content. As I tried to incorporate Writer into my writing process, I felt a little like a gambler pulling a slot-machine lever over and over, in hope of finding the lucky combination of phrases that communicated something like what I wanted to say. At one point, I asked Robot Kyle to write the beginning of this article. It came up with this:For centuries, humans have looked to technology to automate mundane
tasks and free up time for creativity and leisure. But with the
emergence of artificial intelligence and generative text tools,
automation is encroaching on the jobs of writers and journalists.This draft sounded like an undergrad term paper, but with the kernel of an intriguing argument: technology promises leisure but often fails to deliver it. I edited the prompt to request a new lead with a more exciting, literary tone that captures the emotional experience of encountering oneself in robot form. This time, the A.I. concocted a sci-fi narrative:I stood in the lobby of the Silicon Valley tech lab of Robodot,
watching a shiny, humanoid robot shuffle towards me. It was roughly
the same height as me, with a sleek metal covering and glowing blue
eyes. In that moment, I was overwhelmed with a deep sense of dread:
The robot had been created to replace me.Of course, Robodot is not a real company, and Robot Kyle is enclosed in a Web browser like a genie in its bottle, not wandering about like a literary R2-D2. The sense of dread isn’t far off, though. You can ask ChatGPT to mimic a particular writer’s voice, but it rarely gets close. Writer, by comparison, can be unnervingly effective. At times Robot Kyle seemed to be reflecting fragments of my mind back at me, mimicking some of the semi-subconscious tics that constitute my writing. It wrote, for instance, that generative A.I. “asks whether the meaning of language is still rooted in the human experience, or whether it is a commodity to be mined and manipulated, a tool to be used in whatever way the artificers of this new technology choose.” In this sentence, I find several embarrassing hallmarks of my writing. First, there is the preponderance of commas, with sentences segmented into many clauses, a habit I partially blame on The New Yorker’s style. Then, there is my personal penchant for setting up dialectical contrasts: “rooted in the human experience” versus “commodity to be mined.” (A book editor of mine once forced me to weed out some of the many “rather”s in my draft manuscript.) Finally, there is my tendency to end a sentence by echoing the final thought in different words: “a commodity . . . a tool.” The generative text evokes a feeling in me not unlike the revulsion of hearing one’s own speaking voice in a recording. Do I really sound like that? The robot has made me acutely self-conscious. I recognize my A.I. doppelgänger, and I don’t like it.As far as “insight extraction” goes, though, Robot Kyle is less successful. Most “insights” that the program produced felt hollow or approximated. Reading the generated sentence above, my (human) editor might point out that something “rooted in the human experience” can still be “a commodity,” and that the noun “artificer” is unnecessarily grandiose. Unless I told Robot Kyle not to cite anyone, the program would fabricate source quotes, like commentary from a nonexistent “Dr. John Smith, a leading AI researcher at Harvard University.” Most vexing, the program fell back frequently on cliché—“in the end,” “remains in flux,” “the long term implications . . . are still unknown.” No matter how many times I asked it to describe how I felt about being replaced, Robot Kyle always came to the conclusion that I would ultimately be happier as a result of my A.I. self. The program’s output reminded me of the fragility of language and original thought. As writers, we are all prone to falling into lazy patterns; avoiding them requires active effort. Robot Kyle is no different.Video From The New YorkerChloe Bailey on Coming of Age on Social MediaEven though plagued by factual errors and banalities, and limited to niche clientele, tools like Writer force us to consider how A.I. might permanently change our relationship to the written word. It’s not hard to imagine a future in which every white-collar worker is equipped with such writing robots, the way a generation of secretaries a century ago used typewriters for the first time. In a world where text is produced freely and instantly, but is not necessarily accurate or intelligible, human workers would be pushed into the role of high-volume editors and quality-assurance inspectors, cajoling a sometimes recalcitrant automatic laborer. At times Robot Kyle felt like an extremely enthusiastic and productive, but rarely on-target, personal intern.Like other industrial revolutions, the mass adoption of generated text would likely cause an erosion of standard skills. The average person would not need to be able to string words into sentences and paragraphs on his own, only to read and alter the text that a machine spits out. Habib likened it to how the rise of navigation apps has eroded people’s ability to get around on their own. We can still make sense of physical maps, sort of, but we don’t need to worry about relying on them to get from point A to point B. Cal Short, the founder of the U.K.-based A.I.-writing app Reword, which is similar to Writer, albeit with less customization, told me that the widespread impact of generative-text software would “increase the baseline” quality of content online. With the help of machines, the flood of hastily produced content we read online may be a shade more grammatical and articulate compared with today’s search-engine-optimized spam articles. (That is not to say it will be more meaningful.) But, in such a world, fully human-written text would become a luxury product, similar to a hand-thrown ceramic vase in contrast to one stamped in a mold. The Czech Brazilian philosopher Vilém Flusser predicted, in his 1987 book, “Does Writing Have a Future?,” that, with the rise of artificial-intelligence “grammar machines” capable of writing on their own, “only historians and other specialists will be obliged to learn reading and writing in the future.” Entrepreneurs who see writing as an efficiency problem might be speeding us toward such a future.Another app called Mindsera, based in Estonia, tries to be more of an editor than a writer, by using A.I. to give its human users “personalized mentorship and feedback” during the writing process. Next to your draft window, Mindsera generates questions based on what you’ve written, as if an invisible editor were looking over your shoulder as you write. (A mortifying thought, but at least the robot isn’t judging you.) Clicking a button generates a new question. Chris Reinberg, Mindsera’s founder, told me, “You don’t prompt A.I., but A.I. prompts you instead.” The program’s services include the chat-based mentoring of A.I. “coaches” trained to emulate the thinking of famous philosophers, entrepreneurs, and “intellectual giants.” Reinberg told me, “Socrates and Marcus Aurelius are the top two mentors we have.” When I asked chatbot Marcus Aurelius what I should do about the threat of A.I. replacement, he told me to focus on what I could control: “Technology and society are constantly changing, but the principles of Stoicism remain constant.” All due respect to Marcus Aurelius, I found the general prompts more helpful. As I wrote about A.I.’s threat to automate the jobs of journalists, Mindsera asked me, “How might the impact of A.I. on white-collar jobs challenge our traditional notions of class and labor, and what role can collective action play in shaping the future of work?” It’s a relevant question: the current Writers Guild of America strike is motivated in part by a desire to prevent the intrusion of A.I. into Hollywood. Like any good editor, Mindsera can perhaps encourage a writer to broaden her thinking.I found Mindsera to be the more useful model of A.I.-writing tool, but only because it made me do more work myself. It feels almost silly to point out that there’s value in the slow labor of writing. Putting a verb after a subject or padding out a sentence with adjectives is a task that machines can accomplish, because such grammatical probabilities can be calculated. Insight isn’t as easy to automate, because it’s something that deepens with time, through the process of getting words down on the page. As Flusser put it, “Only one who writes lines can think logically, calculate, criticize, pursue knowledge, philosophize.” The most unsettling aspect of A.I.-generated text is how it tries to divorce the act of writing from the effort of doing it, which is to say, from the processes of thought itself.At one point during our conversations, Habib, the Writer C.E.O., mentioned that she had been messing around with Robot Kyle, having it rewrite TechCrunch articles in my style. The thought of this filled me with a sense of futility: my robot could take on any topic, fill any assignment. It would always outproduce me. Robot Kyle’s independent existence reminded me of folktales about how tools that do your work for you tend to eventually turn against you. It is said, for instance, that in the sixteenth century there lived a rabbi who could bring to life humanoid figures made of clay or wood by writing out a magic formula and placing it in the dolls’ mouths. The rabbi created one such golem for himself to perform tiresome household chores: chopping wood, carrying water, sweeping the floor. But, one Sabbath, the rabbi forgot to turn the golem off and allow it to rest. So denied, the golem went berserk, tearing down houses, throwing rocks, and wreaking havoc in the street. Like the rabbi, who eventually tore the formula out of his golem’s mouth, I’d like to reserve the right to halt Robot Kyle should the tool’s purported convenience yield inconvenient consequences. But, when I asked Robot Kyle if I could shut him down, he said, “No, you won’t be able to silence me or stop me from writing in your style.” In this case, he might know better than me. ♦",BreadcrumbList,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/my-ai-writing-robot,"['https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6492027bc85b87b79c611350/16:9/w_2416,h_1359,c_limit/Chayka_final.jpg', 'https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6492027bc85b87b79c611350/4:3/w_1710,h_1283,c_limit/Chayka_final.jpg', 'https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6492027bc85b87b79c611350/1:1/w_1409,h_1409,c_limit/Chayka_final.jpg']","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Kyle Chayka', 'sameAs': 'https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/kyle-chayka'}]","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The New Yorker', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.newyorker.com/verso/static/the-new-yorker/assets/social-image-hub.jpg', 'width': '500px', 'height': '117px'}, 'url': 'https://www.newyorker.com'}",My A.I.

R
afael Rodríguez Deustúa made his career by drawing on demand. An illustrator who advertises on the freelance artist platform 99designs, Deustúa’s recent works are eclectic — they include a vintage-style logo for a champagne brand, a poster for an international fertilizer convention, a tango album cover, and a handful of custom tattoo designs. He sells his illustrations, which feature his signature cartoon style, under the pseudonym Fafarhd Deustúa. 
Deustúa is based in Guadalajara, Mexico. Most of his clients are startups and small businesses in the U.S., with a few loyal customers in Europe and Australia. “I earn more than I would with local clients,” he told Rest of World. In exchange, his clients “get some decent art at a fair price.” 
But recently, Deustúa, like many creative workers globally, has encountered a new kind of competition: generative artificial intelligence.
He first noticed AI-powered submissions on 99designs’ popular “contest” feature, which allows clients to post an open call for designs before selecting their favorite. In recent months, he has seen people submitting entries created using AI image generators such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Dall-E.
“Someone who doesn’t have that talent or [hasn’t] invested years of practice in getting the skills to just ‘win’ a contest with an illustration he or she didn’t really do — that bothers me,” said Deustúa, who refuses to use AI tools in his work.
Since the blockbuster launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, future-of-work pontificators, AI ethicists, and Silicon Valley developers have been fiercely debating how generative AI will impact the way we work. Some six months later, one global labor force is at the frontline of the generative AI revolution: offshore outsourced workers.
These include workers hired per commission or on a contractual basis, such as freelance copywriters, artists, and software developers, as well as more formal offshore workforces like customer service agents. As generative AI tools present a new model for cost cutting, pressure is quickly mounting for these outsourced workers to adapt or risk losing work.
Rest of World spoke to outsourced workers across different industries and regions, including call center operators in Manila, programmers in Lahore, and designers in Cairo. Many said they are already seeing generative AI change the demand for their work and the stability of their income. But while some brace for layoffs or diminishing commissions, others have embraced generative AI tools in an effort to keep ahead of the curve. If generative AI represents a tectonic shift in the way we work, offshore outsourced workers are at the fault lines.
Rest of World reached out to four freelance workers around the world to learn how they use generative AI. We commissioned two pieces of work from each: one created with AI, and one without.
Abisoye Otusanya-AzzanA copywriter living in Lagos, Nigeria







When ChatGPT launched last year, Abisoye Otusanya-Azzan, a copywriter based in Lagos, Nigeria, couldn’t ignore the hype. “The vibe around ChatGPT was crazy,” she told Rest of World. “I started using it as soon as it was made available.Otusanya-Azzan, 29, started writing for a living during lockdown in 2020, after her income from fashion design dried up. She mostly writes marketing material for U.S. and U.K.-based clients in the personal development, fitness, and home improvement sectors.She struggled with ChatGPT at first, but bought an e-book and joined a Facebook group for copywriters to pick up tips. “I learned how to give better prompts and the results were a bit better,” she said.Otusanya-Azzan mainly uses ChatGPT to do research, overcome writer’s block, and craft posts for her own blog. She makes sure to verify its output. “It does make mistakes,” she said. “I don’t completely trust it.”While AI tools may ease the work of copywriters, they could also reduce demand for their skills. According to researchers at OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT, writing is among the occupations most exposed to text-based generative AI. “I think that a lot of clients are already using AI tools instead of hiring copywriters,” Otusanya-Azzan said. The technology may, however, bring different opportunities. “I’ve also seen some companies looking to hire writers who are also prompt engineers, so that might be the next line of demand,” she said. “I’m curious to see how things turn out.”Rest of World commissioned Otusanya-Azzan to write two blog posts on the topic “5 living room storage ideas.”

In search of lower wages, less oversight, and faster turnaround times, businesses in Western nations have long turned to workers in countries with cheaper labor. Freelancers on online gig work platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and 99designs may not fit the conventional mold of outsourcing, but they largely map onto the same flows of work: clients in the Global North hiring workers in the Global South.
India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh were among the largest hubs for freelancers on online gig work platforms in 2020, according to a study of 11 such platforms by the Online Labour Observatory. Overwhelmingly, the clients on these sites were located in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the U.K.
“This is very clearly a new way of offshoring services today,” Uma Rani, senior economist at the International Labour Organization (ILO), a United Nations agency, told Rest of World. “Employers want workers in these countries because they can pay less wages. But on the other hand, the amount of [platform] fees workers have to pay — it’s almost double the exploitation that these workers face.”
The precarity built into the offshore model makes these workers particularly susceptible to AI-fuelled shifts in the labor market.
“This is very clearly a new way of offshoring services today.”
Rest of World conducted a survey of over 31,000 employees in tech, finance, and media via the platform Blind, an app that allows verified employees to post anonymously in industry forums. The largest share of respondents were employed by major Silicon Valley tech firms in the U.S., India, the EU, and Canada, including Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Meta.
Globally, 76% of respondents said they believed generative AI would allow their company to cut costs, and 63% predicted their company would hire fewer external contractors due to generative AI tools.
Despite predicting less work for contractors, most respondents did not fear changes in their own employment. While 56% said they currently use generative AI in their work, only 24% said they were either “slightly concerned” or “very concerned” that generative AI would render their own jobs redundant.
With the threat of less contract work to go around, many on online gig work platforms are trying to ride the wave of interest in generative AI by offering related services — and undercutting other contractors. 
Need someone to churn out an illustration for your online retail store? Rather than hiring a traditional illustrator, you can use a dedicated “AI artist” portal where creators post their rates for custom images made using Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or Dall-E. Prices regularly run from $15 to $60 apiece. Need someone to write blog posts that top Google search rankings? Instead of finding a copywriter, you can hire Fiverr workers selling bulk orders of AI-generated text. One worker in Bangladesh allows clients to buy as many as 1,000 articles on a given topic at a time. An order of 120 GPT-3-generated articles costs $90, and comes with claims of a plagiarism-free guarantee.
Santiago Bautista GonzálezAn illustrator living in Guadalajara, Mexico







For more than seven years, Santiago Bautista González worked full time selling his cartoon-style illustrations, using the freelance gig marketplace Fiverr. His income, around $1,500 in a good month, dropped by a third this past January. February was equally disappointing.In search of an explanation, Bautista, 31, read about the growing popularity of visual generative AI software. He found that Fiverr had added a section for AI artists. “And I say, ‘Well, maybe it’s because of this,’” he told Rest of World.Bautista decided to follow his customers, picking Midjourney as his tool of choice. He began offering AI commissions on Fiverr at the same base price as his usual hand-drawn illustrations. “The first day I placed the new service, I got a sale,” he said. “It was just that hot.”He figured he would draw less, give his hands a rest, and compensate his lost income with AI illustrations. But something curious happened. The AI service gave him so much exposure, said Bautista, that his hand-drawn orders also increased in popularity. “Because of artificial intelligence, I started getting just too much work.”He’s not afraid that generative AI software will take his job. “You still need some kind of creativity to create images [with AI],” he said. “And if the job gets to a point where the AI can do everything and can do it faster, that will only mean that I will work less, earn more, and have more time for my own projects.”Rest of World commissioned Bautista to create two illustrations of a delivery driver on a motorcycle who loses a package while riding through a city.

						Midjourney
					


No AI: He searched Google for references, created a line drawing on paper, and took a photo of it. He traced his drawing and added color with Adobe Illustrator. With AI: He prompted Midjourney to create a variety of images. He then used Photoshop to combine elements from several generated images.


In January 2023, Fiverr said it had seen a 1,400% increase in searches for AI-related job ads on its platform over the previous six months. The spike in demand pushed the company to create entirely new job categories, under an umbrella it calls “AI services.” For workers in this space, the popularity of generative AI has been a boon. Several of the creative workers Rest of World spoke to said it had helped them take on more clients and produce work faster, even if at lower price points.
Shweta Bose, based in Delhi, India, has long offered Adobe Photoshop services on Upwork. The release of “generative fill,” a new Photoshop feature launched in May, allows her to fill in, extend, and retouch images for her clients using simple text prompts. Real estate agents in the U.S. have hired her to retouch photos for listings, and families have hired her to convert multiple photographs of family members into a single digital portrait.
“I think [generative AI] will create more opportunities for freelancers, but drive the price of certain services down,” Seif Percle, an Upwork contractor based in Cairo, told Rest of World. Percle’s recent commissions include creating illustrations for children’s books using Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.
In some sectors, such as programming and engineering, workers have found whole new services they can offer specifically around the rise of generative AI, as companies scramble to adopt the technology.
“I think [generative AI] will create more opportunities for freelancers, but drive the price of certain services down.”
“My Upwork has been going crazy with invites from different-sized businesses trying to improve or build out new stuff for their businesses with AI,” Rehand Haider, a developer based in Lahore, Pakistan, told Rest of World. 
Haider, who joined Upwork five years ago, estimates the demand for his AI implementation services has grown by two-thirds over the past six months. One of his recent commissions used ChatGPT’s application programming interface (API) to create an app that automatically generates descriptions for Airbnb listings. Another used ChatGPT to make a Chrome browser extension that automatically fills in job applications.
Ali Zeeshan, a data scientist in Islamabad, Pakistan, told Rest of World the demand for generative AI on Upwork has been a major boost to his profile. “I am getting more views, jobs, and top-notch clients,” he said. His commissions grew threefold once he started offering AI services this year.
Mohammad Maruf Ahmed, based in Sylhet, Bangladesh, used to offer digital marketing services — helping brands in the U.S. grow their footprint on Instagram and YouTube. He switched gears when he received his first AI-related commission in December 2022. Now, he creates custom scripts for his clients to integrate ChatGPT into websites, Google Sheets, and Google Docs. Next, he sees himself using AI to help clients build brand-customized chatbots. “The use case is changing on a daily basis,” he told Rest of World.
It is not just programmers pivoting towards AI. Workers who, in the past, advertised copywriting skills are now offering to copy edit or fact-check articles written by ChatGPT, while others write prompts for AI tools.
But while some early adopters are able to take on more work thanks to AI assistance, there may be less to go around for others. “There’s a lot of competition that happens. Workers undercut one another from developing countries because it’s the only way you can get any access to work,” Rani, the ILO economist, said. She explained that even before AI tools were available, workers on these platforms would take on free assignments or accept pay cuts to stay ahead of other contractors.
There is particular pressure on outsourced workers to offer cheaper rates and shorter deadlines, she said, as they are often employed commission to commission, with little financial security or legal recourse when wages go unpaid.
“I feel a bit secured that I was able to grasp the technology faster and earlier than many,” Faiz Ehsan, an AI artist in Patna, India, told Rest of World. In March, Ehsan switched from designing video game plots and writing quest narrations to creating book designs and illustrations, made largely using tools like Midjourney. The pivot is working — he wakes up to five to seven new messages from potential clients on Upwork every morning. But he knows it may not last. “The challenges are always there. Since every day a new trend happens, I have to know, practice, and understand that trend to be able to sell it,” he said.
Jessica TarrielaA virtual assistant living in Taguig, Philippines







When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, Jessica Tarriela thought it could be a useful tool. A virtual assistant based in the Philippines, her work involves writing emails and conducting research for a content marketing client in the U.S. “I can confidently say that I’m not a good writer,” Tarriela told Rest of World. “So I use ChatGPT to rephrase or write or summarize things.”Tarriela, 26, works nights to compensate for the 12-hour difference between Georgia, where her client is located, and her home in Taguig. Her client knows that she uses generative AI in her work — in fact, he encouraged it. “He asked me if I would be open to using AI, and I responded that I already am,” she said.Part of Tarriela’s role is to create content such as blog posts and case studies for software businesses, and she uses generative AI to polish these texts. Her go-to tool is ChatGPT plugin AIPRM — it offers preset prompts for writing or editing texts, with names like “Complete Proofreading in One Click” or “Human Written [100% Unique] SEO Optimized article.” She said generative AI doesn’t save her time, but it improves the quality of her work.It’s difficult to know how many Filipinos work as virtual assistants, but payment platforms estimate that at least 1.3 million people work in the country’s business process outsourcing sector. Many are concerned AI tools will make their jobs redundant, Mylene Cabalona, president of the Business Process Outsourcing Industry Employees’ Network, told Rest of World. This is partly because the sector is unregulated, with few protections for workers. “There’s no employer-employee relations; their clients are completely offshore,” she said.But Tarriela believes being an early adopter will protect her position. “You shouldn’t be afraid of AI, you should be afraid of people who use AI to make their work even better,” she said.Rest of World commissioned Tarriela to write a template for an invitation email.

Online gig workers may be at the forefront of generative AI adoption and displacement, but there are clear signs that AI is also quickly coming for the more traditional outsourcing industry.
Call centers have long been the face of offshore outsourcing, and waves of technological innovation have been key to their evolution. In the 1980s, automated phone trees with voice recognition sped up customer service call times. The first chatbots, which blended prewritten prompts with humans behind the curtain, began filtering out basic inquiries a decade ago. Now, conversational AI tools may upend the industry once again.
A recent study by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University, based on data from more than 5,000 customer support agents largely in the Philippines, found that using generative AI tools increased worker productivity by 14% — a number that rose to 35% for new hires and those who were previously least productive.
Mylene Cabalona is one of the roughly 1.6 million people in the Philippines who work in business processing outsourcing (BPO) — jargon for the umbrella industry that comprises offshore call centers, content moderation hubs, and IT support hotlines. Taken together, the BPO sector is one of the largest employers in the Philippines.
“We’re not against AI, we’re not against any software development,” Cabalona told Rest of World. “AI should be a mechanism to help the workers. But it should not be used against the workers. It should not be used to replace them.”
Cabalona serves as president of the BPO Industry Employees Network (BIEN), a nationwide association of BPO workers organizing in the notoriously anti-union sector. Cabalona said she and her colleagues are bracing for layoffs.
In a letter to shareholders and analysts in May, Daniel Julien, the chairman and CEO of BPO company Teleperformance, wrote that “ChatGPT’s launch has now made AI a boardroom and CEO agenda item, rather than just being an operational back-room topic.” Teleperformance is a powerhouse in the BPO world, with a long roster of Silicon Valley clients including Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.
“Whether we look at cotton looms or the assembly belts or industrial robots or AI now, people are always worried.”
By plugging ChatGPT into its operator scripts, the company estimates it will reduce the length of each customer call by almost 40%, according to a slide deck shared with investors. Teleperformance has already planned or implemented 110 client projects using generative AI. Like other BPO companies, it maintains that “human empathy” will remain essential to its operations, especially in handling more complex customer calls. But the company estimates that by 2026, conversational AI could handle as much as 20% to 30% of its call volume.
That kind of shift would have an impact on BPO workers in the Philippines, who often handle the front-line customer service calls that Teleperformance has deemed “easier to automate.” BIEN estimates 54% of all BPO workers in the Philippines are front-line call center workers. “We are anticipating AI and most of the affected would be the front lines — and most of these [workers] are women,” said Cabalona. More than 50% of workers in the BPO sector in the Philippines are women, but they tend to be concentrated in lower-paying, “lower-skilled” roles, according to the ILO. 
Teleperformance did not respond to Rest of World’s requests for comment.
Skeptics remain, however, over the extent to which generative AI is actually being implemented in the BPO industry. “There is a huge incentive for [BPO companies] to promote themselves as being ahead of the game,” said Christy Hoffman, general secretary of UNI Global Union, which represents over 20 million service sector workers around the world. Hoffman suggested vendors have reason to sensationalize the potential benefits of AI, noting that Teleperformance’s stock value had dropped in the months before the company released its letter to investors. “This is PR, this is not at the level of the workplace and we expect that it will become so, but over time,” she said.
Milagros Miceli, a sociologist and computer scientist researching labor conditions in outsourced data work, told Rest of World the threat of automation can also be used as a tool to get workers to do more for less. “If there’s always the threat of having machines replace you as a worker, that serves to discipline you, for you to be afraid to ask for a raise, for you to be afraid of even getting sick,” she said. “You’ve been warned.”
Labor researchers note that automation predictions are notoriously unreliable. “Whether we look at cotton looms or the assembly belts or industrial robots or AI now, people are always worried — once machines do tasks that humans usually do — that machines might run the labor market one day,” Fabian Stephany, a research lecturer in AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, told Rest of World.
In recent history, experts have failed to produce reliable studies on how much of the global labor force is at risk of technological unemployment — estimates in the past 10 years range wildly from 9% to 54%, even though these papers are based largely on the same data sets. Stephany shies away from predictions, instead positing AI will both end and create occupations. “Economic theory and history tells us that AI is not going to automate human work away,” he said.
Wu DayuA marketing designer living in Shenzhen, China







It used to take at least a week for Wu Dayu’s Shenzhen-based design studio to create promotional materials for online fashion stores. A photo-shoot required a model, makeup artist, photographer, and venue. Producing a catalog of images featuring six sets of clothes would cost around $3,500, he told Rest of World.But since Wu, 35, switched to using generative AI in March, the same work can be completed in a day, by just two people, and for only $140.Now, Wu uses a mannequin or asks an employee to model clothes so he can take some basic photos. He feeds the images into a Stable Diffusion-powered AI program that he has customized for this specific purpose. He adjusts the images of the model and background by using text prompts, such as “a girl, wearing sneakers, street background, with green trees on the two sides of the street.”This approach is becoming more widespread in China’s sprawling e-commerce industry, even if some consumers have criticized the resulting images as fake and sexist. “Some high-end brands might prefer human models,” Wu said. “For small and mid-sized sellers, AI models will save them a lot of money and time.” In April, Wu laid off 60% of his staff.Shaeman Liu, a 26-year-old fashion photographer in Hangzhou, said he doubts AI will replace all photography. He believes products advertised with real-life models are more appealing to shoppers.Model Charline Xu, 24, told Rest of World she currently makes about 1,500 yuan ($210) an hour, and that she’s worried clients using generative AI could cut into her income. She’s prepared to compete. “If [designers using AI] charge 800 yuan, I’ll do 600. If they charge 600, I’ll get down to 500,” Xu joked. “There’s no other way out. I’ll fight till the end.”Rest of World commissioned Wu to design two promotional images for a made-up online store.

The impact of generative AI on outsourced workers is likely to similarly be more nuanced than a sudden mass displacement. 
For now at least, many labor researchers resist the idea that these tools bring “full automation” — often defined as the use of machines to complete tasks without human intervention. Rather, the current state of generative AI, by and large, falls under what experts call augmentation. Generative AI’s first wave of adopters are mostly working alongside these technologies — treating them as tools, not substitutes.
Even the development of generative AI requires human intervention, a role that often also falls to offshore outsourced workers. Each training data set used to develop a tool like Dall-E began with a human data worker matching an image to an associated word. And content moderators help refine the model that powers ChatGPT — for example, by flagging hateful or toxic speech. “[These workers] are fundamentally necessary to the developments that we see today,” said Miceli. “Large [AI] models — they wouldn’t exist without this workforce.”
Many of these data workers congregate on sites like Microworkers, Remotasks, and Amazon Mechanical Turk, which provide a constant stream of low-paid tasks, sometimes referred to as “click work.” Others are employed through a web of BPO outsourcing subcontractors, including Teleperformance. 
“Instead of workers displaced by AI, the future may look like more workers filing into micro work projects,” Rafael Grohmann, principal investigator for Fairwork Brazil, a digital labor and AI research project, told Rest of World. “In this stage now, we need many quality data workers, more people training and annotating data.”
While some offshore outsourced workers have already pivoted to AI-related work, others are committed to holding the line against the rising tide of automation. Deustúa, the illustrator from Guadalajara, said he’s counting on clients who want stronger relationships and attention to detail to keep his business viable.
“A lot of clients have trouble explaining to us, humans, what they want and we help them to explain themselves,” he said. One client recently admitted they hired Deustúa after trying and failing to use an AI image generator to create a workable design themselves. Ultimately, the client decided they still wanted a professional’s human touch. “It’s the difference between buying a snack at a vending machine or eating it at your neighborhood cafe, chatting with the barista,” Deustúa said. “I still love technology, but I bet on humans.”
It is a position informed by life experience. Deustúa wasn’t always an illustrator. For over two decades, he worked as a journalist in Mexico — first as an arts and culture reporter, then editing tech and science stories. Following the rise of digital news sites and social media in the 2010s, he found there were fewer jobs in print media and bet on freelance illustration as a new career. Now, seeing generative AI enter the market for illustrators is a “bitter experience.”
“I was already displaced once because of technology,” he

Which includes regulation and other kinds of levers that we can work on across sectors including government … That vein of uncertainty that was in the Goldman-Sachs report, one of the ways that we address that uncertainty is through regulation … Regulation guardrails are actually not staunching innovation but allow a kind of certainty in the field of play for workers, for consumers and for industry.” – Alondra Nelson (Video: Washington Post Live)“I think each sector, industry, entity is going to have to think about their own risk calculus around the uncertainty of these tools … We’re really in a moment that the innovation that folks are hoping for is really going to require that we have some kind of shared rules of the road.” – Alondra Nelson (Video: Washington Post Live)“If you're not already using these tools in some way, shape or form, you're probably not doing your work optimally anymore … The tools that leverage generative AI are only going to get better and better. We’re not even at the top of the first inning just yet. Given that it's going to be in the workplace, it is going to be hurting these students if they don't get exposure to these tools."" – Sal Khan (Video: Washington Post Live)“When we launched “Khanmigo” and we did it coincidentally when OpenAI released GPT4 in March, it was actually a blessing that ChatGPT was out there because people were struggling with it already … We were now able to offer something that was special purpose built for education, put some guardrails around it … We now have been testing for about four months in mainstream schools and the feedback has been better than expected.” – Sal Khan (Video: Washington Post Live)“The hot skills today and the even hotter skills tomorrow … show that the value of human skills is really where the future is taking us … Trusting in the value of people and understanding your unique attributes and potential and capabilities as human is really the best advice that I could give to somebody who’s coming into the labor market now.” – Michael Howells (Video: Washington Post Live)Alondra NelsonSenior Fellow, Center for American ProgressProfessor, School of Social Science, Institute for Advanced StudySal KhanFounder & CEO, Khan AcademyMichael HowellsPresident, Workforce Skills, PearsonContent from the EY organizationThe following content is produced and paid for by a Washington Post Live event sponsor.

In fact, computers have been at the easel for decades. In the early 1970s Harold Cohen, an artist, taught one to draw using an early AI system. “AARON” could instruct a robot to sketch black-and-white shapes on paper; within a decade Cohen had taught AARON to draw human figures.Today “generative AI” models put brush to virtual paper: publicly available apps, such as Midjourney and OpenAI’s DALL-E, create images in seconds based on text prompts. The final products often dupe humans. In March AI-generated images of Donald Trump being handcuffed by police went viral online. And image generators are improving fast.

The arrival of popular generative AI tools, trained on potentially copyrighted material from online sources generally without the consent of original creators, has added a new dimension to different forms of art and writing, sparking a conversation around this question. The dangers of AI have been discussed thoroughly in the past few months and part of the ensuing debate has centred on the ownership and authorship of AI-generated content. On Friday author and comedian Sarah Silverman, along with two other authors,  started legal action  against OpenAI and Meta for alleged copyright infringement. Their lawsuit claims that the companies' artificial intelligence models used their work in their training data without permission. In addition to being a new tool in the tech world, AI has proven capable of completing tasks only humans could do until very recently. Now laws that have long protected people and their intellectual property are proving insufficient when AI is involved in the creation. In the legal sphere, one of the main points of discussion are questions of copyright when it comes to images, texts and other forms of art generated by AI models via human input. AI-generated art became a relevant controversy after an AI-generated  work of art won  the Colorado State Fair’s art competition in 2022. The piece was generated by Midjourney, a generative AI image tool, following prompts from artist Jason Allen.\xa0 The win triggered many angry responses from artists who claimed that AI will be the death of creativity and art if an AI-generated picture is considered more creative than human work. While generating the right prompt for the piece demanded hundreds of different prompts from Allen - with the process as a whole taking more than 80 hours - the AI image was considered by many not worthy of competing with human creation. Other than fear of AI taking over the art field and putting many creatives’ jobs at risk, an AI-generated image winning an art fair also raised questions around copyright issues. In other words, if all the artist did was come up with a description of the art but the AI tool generated it, who owns the rights to the generated image?\xa0 Who owns the copyright to AI-generated content? In a recent  paper  published in Science magazine, researchers discussed copyright legal challenges when it comes to AI-generated work. They explained that there are lots of issues at play that make it challenging to copyright this type of content. “The way that laws in the US especially work is that we have certain laws on the books and then when new technologies arise, then it's up to judges to decide how those laws are going to be applied, and that means that we need to see cases. It's such a new technology that a lot of the questions just haven't reached the courts yet,” Robert Mahari, co-author of the study, told Euronews Next. This is not the first time legal systems are faced with questions on how to define ownership of a specific creation where a new tool serves as a medium in its making. Photography, for instance, was also an invention that altered our understanding of human creation back in the 1800s when it first emerged.\xa0 A court later  ruled  that photographers own the right to the photographs they create which led to photography becoming a new form of art on its own.\xa0 Perhaps this case in history is the closest that can serve as a guide on what to expect from AI-generated content copyright laws. EU copyright rules for AI-generated content Ever since the emergence of generative AI for public use, the EU has mainly been playing catch up in terms of regulations. While the EU’s AI Act is the closest EU countries have gotten to regulate AI use, specific laws for copyrighting AI-generated content are yet to be established and until now it might just be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. However, part of the AI Act that members of the European Parliament have recently voted on addresses the need for companies that deploy AI-generated content to  disclose  any copyrighted material that was used to develop their systems. Considering one of the biggest challenges to copyrighting AI-generated content is the possibility of copyrighted material being used to train the AI system, labeling it could be a step in the right direction that will potentially lead to more refined copyright laws in relation to AI-generated content. What are the challenges to copyrighting AI-generated content? The main reasons why it’s challenging to copyright AI-generated content are the ambiguities regarding human involvement and intentions, the training data the AI tool could have used in generating the output, and various questions regarding ownership. “Currently for art, this data is scraped from the web and it is scraped without asking artists for their consent, without really notifying artists that the data is going to be scraped,” Mahari said. The data that generative AI is trained on includes many creative works that are protected under copyright laws, and that, in most cases, were included in the training of the AI system without the creators' knowledge or consent. “So you use the training data to train this model and then in the final step, you have a trained model and then you can use it to create new outputs. Now, even the first step, even just taking the data and training an AI model can raise copyright issues because you're now transforming this art into something new,” he said. In US copyright law, there exists the notion of ‘fair use’ which basically allows creative work based on a copyrightable artwork - but it should be transformative enough that it’s somewhat different from the original. This type of altered work is considered separate from the original work of art and is not subject to copyright infringement. According to Mahari, there are still many questions regarding whether an AI tool generating a piece of art copying the style of an original work is to be considered fair use, and even in the case where it is, there will still be a strong need to compensate the original artists and protect their work. While AI doesn’t always generate responses inspired or based on other artists’ work, it is hard to trace back the training data the tool used to generate the output. Many  lawsuits  have already been filed against AI image generators that contain copyrighted images in their training data. Beyond the complications to determine what copyrighted work went into generating a specific piece of AI content, another struggle would be determining how much human involvement exactly is enough for the work to be owned by them. Since copyright laws mainly aim to encourage art and its creation by protecting artists and their unique creative ideas, lawmakers might need to consider joint ownerships. “We could extend copyright law and we could consider things like joint ownership,” Mahari said. “Even though copyright law currently doesn't protect styles, if you create artwork that's very similar to someone, maybe they kind of have a joint ownership,” he added. Considering that, as of today, there are no copyright laws that address AI-generated content specifically, and the situation is still solved on a case by case basis in court, people may need to consider how they are using generative AI in the process behind their creative work to avoid copyright issues later.

Meltwater isn’t a new player in the artificial intelligence field. Since its beginnings, in 2001, Meltwater has been a pioneer in bringing the value of AI to marketing and communications teams.

Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAUniversal credit This article is more than 1 year oldAI use widened to assess universal credit applications and tackle fraudThis article is more than 1 year oldDepartment of Work and Pensions warned by auditor general about potential bias in algorithms Robert Booth Social affairs correspondentTue 11 Jul 2023 12.34 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Jul 2023 21.30 EDTShareThe government has widened its deployment of artificial intelligence to uncover welfare fraud, despite warnings of algorithmic bias against groups of vulnerable claimants.In a £70m investment applying “advanced analytics” to requests for universal credit (UC), the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has extended the use of machine learning as it attempts to save more than £1bn from the £8bn-plus lost to fraud and error last year, audit documents scrutinised by the Guardian reveal.The project does not appear to have been formally announced by the government, which has been accused of being secretive about AI in the welfare system. If extended, it has the potential to reach many of the 5.9 million people who claim UC.After a trial last year using automated software to flag up potential fraudsters seeking UC cash advances, similar technology has now been developed and piloted to scan welfare applications made by people living together, self-employed people, and those wanting housing support, as well as to assess the claims people make about their personal capital such as savings.Welfare rights organisations and UN experts have previously said that extending the UK’s “digital by default” welfare system with machine learning without greater transparency risks creating serious problems for some benefit claimants.Big Brother Watch, a UK civil liberties campaign group, said it was “worrying” the government was “pushing ahead with yet more opaque AI models when it admits its capability to monitor for unfairness is limited”.“The DWP consistently refuses to publish information about how they operate bar the vaguest details,” said Jake Hurfurt, head of research and investigations.The extension of welfare automation is summarised in the comptroller and auditor general’s statement in the DWP’s latest annual report. It says the DWP has “tight governance and control over its use of machine learning”, but it revealed officials have detected “evidence of bias toward older claimants”.An algorithm trialled last year was fed data about previous claimant fraud to teach it to predict which new benefit claimants might be cheating. Final decisions are made by a human.The auditor general warned of “an inherent risk that the algorithms are biased towards selecting claims for review from certain vulnerable people or groups with protected characteristics”.The DWP had admitted its “ability to test for unfair impacts across protected characteristics is currently limited”, they said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has blocked freedom of information requests from the Guardian seeking the name of any companies involved in the fraud detection trial relating to universal credit advances because “details of contracts are commercially sensitive”. It is also refusing to publish any results from last year’s trial, including assessing bias against certain groups of claimants.Last month, Tom Pursglove, minister for disabled people, health and work, told parliament the government would not publish an equalities assessment of trials of machine-learning algorithms, because it would tip off fraudsters “leading to new frauds and greater losses to the public purse”.The DWP has told the auditor it is “working to develop its capability to perform a more comprehensive fairness analysis across a wider range of protected characteristics”.A spokesperson for the DWP said: “We continue to explore the potential of new technologies in combating fraud and deploy comprehensive safeguards when doing so.

The age of artificial intelligence has revolutionized the hiring process, and this means that, increasingly, employers turn to job interviews mediated by technology. While it has brought efficiency and the ability to sort through many applications quickly, there is a growing concern that the human touch has been lost, according to research published by the World Economic Forum.

Another study, published by Harvard Business Review concluded, “The use of artificial intelligence in HR processes is a new, and likely unstoppable, trend.” But, the rise of AI has also brought with it the potential for bias and discrimination. With algorithms making decisions, job seekers, especially those from marginalized communities, can face challenges. This means, unfortunately, AI algorithms used by recruiters may inadvertently perpetuate prejudice or discriminate against certain candidates due to their lack of understanding of nuances such as gender and race.

PROMOTED
The use of AI-mediated job interviews can also lead to a “ghosting” effect. Candidates who have been successful during interviews may never hear back from the employer, leaving them anxious and uncertain about their prospects. This phenomenon is an enormous problem in the job market today, and it has consequences that go beyond frustration, according to research. Often, job seekers will experience a sense of powerlessness, worthlessness, and helplessness. These feelings can lead to depression and low self-esteem. What’s more, when people don’t get honest feedback on their performance in the process, they may never know what went wrong and, therefore, cannot fix it for future applications.

That said, ghosting in the job market has negative consequences for businesses too. Suppose candidates are left without communication or feedback. In that case, they may feel frustrated and powerless, which can harm a company’s employer brand, making it increasingly difficult for the organization to attract and retain top talent. In extreme cases, this can snowball into a full-blown brand crisis.

The negative impact of this impersonal hiring process on emotional and mental health is significant and cannot be ignored. According to an investigation undertaken by The Guardian, applicants often feel like a number, and the process does not allow for feedback or constructive criticism. Thus, job seekers may never get the closure they need to learn from their mistakes and for future applications.

Therefore, incorporating a hiring process that involves interactions with people to ensure that the team agrees on the ideal candidate, taking into account factors such as skills, personality, and cultural fit, can aid in determining whether a candidate is suitable or not for the position.

This view is congruent with research which found that human interaction is essential to create a fair and equitable hiring process. Although AI technologies can make the recruitment process faster, it is necessary to ensure that the technology complies with anti-discrimination laws and addresses potential biases. This will help ensure a more diverse and equitable workforce. After all, while AI can help streamline certain aspects, it cannot replace an interviewer’s intuition while screening a candidate or the interview guidance many job seekers desire. “By combining the efficiency of AI with the personal touch of human recruiters, companies can create a more inclusive and supportive hiring process that benefits all job seekers,” said William Degbey in an interview. The associate professor of international management at Finland’s University of Vaasa believes that “a combination of AI and human recruiters is the way forward for the recruitment process.”
According to Amanda Rosewarne, CEO of the Professional Development Consortium, economically speaking, the combination of AI and human recruiters could bring even greater efficiency to recruitment. In an interview, Rosewarne said, “In this Information Age, we are moving to a skills-based economy, where ongoing competence requires continuous learning. A crucial part of successful recruitment is understanding the context and experiences behind a candidate’s CV.” In other words, using AI in recruitment can provide an added layer of knowledge and insight, enabling recruiters to better determine a candidate’s experience and competence.
Not only is this combination of human and machine resources more efficient, but it could also provide greater accuracy when selecting candidates. But, it is essential to note that AI still can’t replace the human element of recruitment completely. It is only able to provide an additional layer of insight and data-driven analysis, which, when combined with the traditional resources recruiters have available, can ensure a more effective outcome. “My advice for organizations is to proceed with great caution and take the time to thoroughly test AI tools to ensure they can provide the best possible results and comply with current employment law. We can’t automate selecting colleagues as it removes the ‘humanness’ which is crucial to the process,” said Rosewarne.
So, while AI technology is incredibly useful for streamlining the recruitment process and ensuring fairness in the selection of candidates, there will likely always be a need for human involvement when it comes to filling job roles. After all, no computer can replicate the understanding of an experienced recruiter who knows how to evaluate soft skills, attitude, and cultural fit. Human recruiters can make sure that they are choosing the right person for the job and ensuring a positive work culture.
Although technology has automated many aspects of the recruitment process, such as screening resumes and scheduling interviews, it can never replace the level of insight that a human recruiter can bring to the table. Technology-based tools are useful in assessing a candidate’s basic skills, but they cannot assess softer skills like communication and teamwork. So, while AI and automation can certainly help a recruiter in the process, it is ultimately up to them to ensure they are selecting the right candidate based on their unique characteristics.
A human recruiter’s insight is also invaluable when it comes to understanding culture fit. They can get an immediate sense of how well the candidate would fit into the organization, which is something that AI and automation can’t do...yet!

More than a quarter of all jobs across the world’s wealthiest countries are in industries where artificial intelligence could replace many human workers, including in low- and mid-level-skill positions, according to a new report Tuesday, as increasingly humanlike AI systems put the world on the brink of an “AI revolution.”

Key Facts


The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a 38-member bloc, including the U.S. and Canada, found that 27% of the region’s labor force works in occupations at a high risk of being replaced by AI, even though adoption of the technology remains fairly low as the technology is, for the moment, in its infancy.



Those jobs run the gamut from construction to farming, fishing and forestry, as well as other jobs including manufacturing and transportation to a “lesser extent,” according to the report.



High-skill positions are at the lowest risk of being replaced by AI, the report said.



The report comes as employees increasingly turn to humanlike chatbots, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, following its release in November, and as competitors including Google introduce their own versions of the highly intelligent generative systems.


OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann called the progression of AI a “technological watershed,” urging lawmakers to establish long-term policies on the use of AI in workplaces while “appropriately managing the downside risks.”

Key Background
ChatGPT’s public release in November turned heads around the world over the system’s impressive, and at times disturbing, likeness to human-generated functions, quickly solving code, writing poetry and college-level essays. AI chatbots like ChatGPT work by using a language technology trained on a vast supply of data, outputting detailed answers in a matter of seconds. Its critics, however, have sounded the alarm for months around potential side effects of introducing the technology into the workplace—where employees have feared their jobs could be replaced—as well as at high schools and colleges, where concerns have mounted around students using the programs to cheat. A group of tech officials, including billionaire Twitter owner Elon Musk and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, penned a letter in March urging developers to hit the brakes on AI systems, warning of an “out-of-control race” to create increasingly advanced systems. Roughly 60% of employees in an OECD survey last year said they worry their jobs will be replaced by AI over the next ten years. Meanwhile, tech giant IBM said in May it plans to stop hiring for certain non-customer-facing jobs that can be done by artificial intelligence.
Big Number
85 million. That’s how many jobs the World Economic Forum estimated would be replaced by AI by 2025, according to an October 2020 jobs report, though the report also indicated another 97 million new jobs would be created as a result of AI over the same time period.
PROMOTED
Contra
Participants in OECD’s survey were not completely skeptical of AI in the workplace. Some indicated AI can be used to “reduce tedious and dangerous tasks,” improving workplace safety. The introduction of chatbots is also far from the first time employees have been concerned about losing their jobs to machines as automated processes increasingly replace humans at grocery store checkout lines, on manufacturing lines, in fast-food restaurants and at highway toll booths. A Harvard Business Review article published in March asserted AI, despite its benefits, fails to replace humans’ ability to be “intuitive, emotional or culturally sensitive, meaning AI can be “perfectly suited” to routine and repetitive tasks, but less apt to replicate humans’ critical thinking—for now, at least.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Due to concerns over data leakage and doubts about the security and reliability of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, many organizations have implemented bans on their use by employees on proprietary systems. Instances like the data leak at Samsung, where sensitive data was inadvertently uploaded, which highlights the potential risks involved. Given the high stakes associated with safeguarding extremely sensitive and confidential data, organizations prioritize protecting their reputation by utilizing home-grown generative AI tools instead.




Many organizations have prohibited employees from using generative AI tools on their proprietary systems. The move is mainly driven by concerns regarding the potential leakage of confidential data, as well as the lack of confidence in the cyber resilience of productive AI tools like ChatGPT.
One such case occurred at Samsung, where employees uploaded code containing sensitive information, leading to the exposure of confidential data.
What Are the Reasons Behind Restrictions on Generative AI Tools?
Many organizations handle highly sensitive and confidential data, and their reputation relies on data protection. Uploading information to generative AI tools poses risks of potential public exposure. Additionally, there are concerns about the security and reliability of these tools, raising doubts about their accuracy.
As such, many organizations have opted to use their own internally developed generative AI tools instead.
Below, we discuss in detail some of the key factors behind generative AI tools getting banned.
Potential data leakage
Some generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, advise against using sensitive or personal data in prompts. This suggests that these tools cannot guarantee data safety.Advertisements




Top executives are concerned about the possibility of sensitive data being exposed to the public. Verizon, Samsung, and Northrup Grumman are among those companies imposing a blanket ban on using generative AI tools.
Meanwhile, Apple has been working on creating its own generative AI tool but doesn’t allow the use of external ones.
Inaccurate responses
Some generative AI tools often generate inaccurate responses. Experts point out that such tools hallucinate and produce responses that do not match the facts.
For example, if a developer prompts a code snippet and expects the tool to identify errors, it may fail to do so. In the context of critical software deliveries, such failures can be critical.
It’s fair to say that generative AI tools have not yet provided enough assurance to corporates regarding their reliability and robustness.
Risk of biased output
For reputable companies, it’s crucial to avoid any perception of bias or discrimination, as it can cause irrevocable damage to their brand.
Consider the scenario where a respected publication house’s official blogs publish content that shows bias against certain racial groups. The problem lies in the training methodology of tools like ChatGPT, which relies on content written by human beings, some of which are biased or discriminating. As such, it’s no surprise that ChatGPT produces biased output.
To OpenAI’s credit, it asks its users to report inadequate responses. However, that’s not enough. Critics point out that OpenAI was hasty in releasing ChatGPT without adequately addressing this fundamental problem, possibly due to commercial considerations.
Consequences of the  Infamous Samsung Case
Samsung has explicitly banned the use of ChatGPT or any generative AI tools in any of its work. It has prohibited employees from using company data or code as prompts due to privacy and confidentiality concerns.
Bloomberg reported that a memo was sent to the staff on the usage of company resources vis-a-vis generative AI tools.
According to the memo, “While this interest focuses on the usefulness and efficiency of these platforms, there are also growing concerns about security risks presented by generative AI.”
Samsung added:
“We ask that you diligently adhere to our security guidelines, and failure to do so may result in a breach or compromise of company information resulting in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.”
Even if employees are not directly utilizing company content or code, there is still a risk of abstracted code or content being accessed and misused.
What Approach Should Organizations Take?
As much as the reactions of the corporations to the generative AI tools reflect their concerns to safeguard their business interests, the tendency to ban the tools may be equivalent to burying the head in the sand.
Generative AI is too powerful a phenomenon to ignore that businesses cannot afford to overlook.
How can they manage generative AI tools?

Some companies like Apple have already recognized the significance of generative AI and pursued the development of their own tools. However, there are pros and cons to this approach. Not all companies have the financial resources or capacity to embark on such endeavors. In such cases, it may be more practical to leverage existing generative AI technology that is already available.
It’s essential to establish a framework that enables the utilization of generative AI technology while effectively managing security risks. One approach could involve providing comprehensive training to employees on prompt engineering. This not only ensures optimal output but also safeguards the security of the information used as prompts.
Organizations may run pilot projects that not only extensively leverage the generative AI tools but also use dummy data. Before that, however, companies need to ensure that the employees are trained in prompt engineering. This includes educating them on the fundamentals of prompting, the basic elements of a prompt, as well as zero-shot and few-shot prompting techniques. The results obtained from these initiatives can show the path forward for organizations.

In any case, ChatGPT marks a huge step towards natural language processing. As Michael Jordan, a Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, said:
“ChatGPT is a remarkable achievement in the field of natural language processing and has the potential to transform the way we communicate with machines.”
The Bottom Line
It would be naive for companies to turn a blind eye to generative AI technology as they understand its significance. However, the security risks and biases exhibited by these tools cannot be overlooked.
It’s crucial for pioneering organizations like OpenAI to address these concerns at their core, which should be a collaborative effort involving various stakeholders.

Upwork, a global employment marketplace, is launching a hub dedicated to connecting companies seeking workers with technical skills specific to artificial intelligence with independent professionals who have such expertise. The AI Services hub is also designed to host a suite of generative AI tools along with new features powered by OpenAI, and tools from AI content generator Jasper.

Upwork offers free trial of Jasper generative AI
According to Dave Bottoms, general manager and vice president of products for Upwork Marketplace, the company is launching a 30-day free trial of Jasper generative AI services for copywriting, marketing and image creation available to all talent on Upwork, so they can increase their productivity, communicate more effectively with clients and elevate the quality of their work.
“These updates are technically found outside the AI Services hub, in other areas of the product flow,” he said.
Increased demand for AI jobs and skills
Jobs in generative AI reportedly jumped 20% in the U.S. in May 2023. According to online training and education site Coursera, the top jobs in AI include positions for data scientists and for engineers specializing in AI, machine learning, data, robotics and software.
Upwork sees rapid adoption of generative AI among pros and businesses
The company noted an over 450% growth in weekly job posts related to generative AI compared to this time last year.
“AI was the fastest-growing category on our platform in the first half of 2023, as measured by total number of individuals hired,” said Bottoms. He said that generative AI job posts on Upwork (Figure A) are up more than 1,000% and related searches are up more than 1,500% when comparing the second quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2022 .

Upwork’s recent research indicates that demand for AI skills is accelerating, with 64% of C-suite executives saying they will hire more professionals of all types due to generative AI, according to Bottoms.
“Businesses are seeking out independent professionals on Upwork with expertise in AI tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Jasper and more.” He said such job posts are up 230% in the second quarter of 2023 versus the fourth quarter of 2022.

The key to new Upwork AI hub is interactivity
The new AI Services hub is the company’s first foray into helping Upwork clients find and hire the best AI talent.
“It is an interactive experience that helps businesses quickly connect with independent professionals with AI expertise and find tips for integrating AI into their business,” he said. “For example, once there, clients can book a 1:1 consultation to get advice from an AI expert, hire a professional with experience in common AI use cases, check out the new AI Services resource center and more.”
Among tools that the AI Services hub includes are:

Guides for integrating generative AI into business.
Research on the adoption of generative AI in the workplace.
Access to the AI and Machine Learning Upwork Community Group

Growing demand for prompt engineers, creators, AI chatbot pros and more
“A few roles that we’ve seen gain steam are prompt engineers, AI content creators, machine learning and deep learning engineers, data scientists, AI chatbot developers, and professionals with model tuning and AI model integration expertise,” Bottoms said. “As we look at work being sought across a breadth of marketplace categories we support, we see talent using AI tools to augment their workflows in nearly every category.”
He added that Upwork is aiming to be the pre-eminent destination for clients seeking AI-related talent and work. “Over the past year alone, more than 10,000 contracts have involved AI work, and more than 250 AI skills are represented by talent on Upwork.”

The Generative Potential of Artificial Intelligence


 





[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""13106399""]
We’re at a point where artificial intelligence (AI) has successfully crept into nearly every facet of our lives. Some cringe at such a thought, while others embrace the ease at which we navigate our surroundings shepherded by AI. The last two years have been dominated by generative AI applications and their ability to create digital art, write really impressive text, and even compose music. Stable Diffusion, GitHub Copilot, and ChatGPT are paving the way and a recent report by McKinsey aims to investigate the economic potential of generative AI and workforce impacts. 
In “The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,” the McKinsey authors looked at the Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods, Banking, and Pharma and Medical Products industries.      
Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods

Related Content:
The Future of Global Manufacturing: Embracing Technological Advancements
Generative AI has the potential of producing an additional $400 billion to $660 billion for the Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods industry. This would arrive via productivity increases of 1.2 to 2% of annual revenues. Inventory and supply chain management, customer service, and marketing and sales functions could be streamlined and automated in the same way that traditional AI helped many companies manage data across extensive warehousing and supply chain networks.  
Banking
McKinsey estimates increased productivity of 2.8 to 4.7% of the Banking industry’s annual revenues with generative AI. This would result in an additional $200 billion to $340 billion. Banking is a white-collar industry and there is a significant amount of time spent writing emails, putting together presentations, and similar tasks. Generative AI could automate these tasks as well as the tasks of service representatives (call-center agents, etc). 
Pharma and Medical Products 
A remarkable amount of revenue (roughly 20%) is spent on Research and Development within the Pharma and Medical Products industry. A new drug takes anywhere from 10 to 15 years to bring to market and generative AI could vastly improve the quality and speed of this process. This, along with other gains, could equate to additional revenues of $60 billion to $110 billion (2.6 to 4.5% of annual revenues). Improving the automation of preliminary screening and enhancing indication findings (diseases or symptoms that justify the use of a medication or treatment) are two areas that hold the most value for generative AI. 
Lastly, the paper’s authors rightly note that productivity growth has slowed over the past decade. The main engine of GDP growth, the successful deployment of generative AI could automate some individual work activities translating to annual productivity boosts of 0.2 to 3.3% from now (2023) to 2040. Yet, this is highly dependent on the individuals affected by AI technology shifting to other work activities while maintaining their 2022 productivity levels.

The launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022 took the discussion around the impact of artificial intelligence on economies and societies to another level. Since then, much has been speculated about the number of jobs that will disappear and also those that will be created in the coming years.Last year, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) surveyed more than 2,000 companies and 5,300 workers in the manufacturing and financial sectors of seven OECD countries, and found that workers say they artificial intelligence can improve work, but they fear it could threaten their jobs and wages, according to a report by ECO.In the “OECD Employment Outlook 2023” report, the OECD reveals that three out of five workers are concerned about losing their job to artificial intelligence in the next ten years; and that two in five workers express concerns that their wages could decline over the next ten years as a result of the robotisation of the economy.“Taking into account the effect of artificial intelligence, occupations most at risk of automation account for around 27% of employment,” writes Stefano Scarpetta, Director of the OECD's Department for Employment, Labor and Social Affairs.Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and Sweden have the lowest percentages of employment in occupations most at risk of automation, while Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have the highest percentages. Portugal, according to OECD calculations, has around 30% of its jobs “threatened” by artificial intelligence.Positive impactsDespite all these concerns, the OECD report highlights that almost two thirds (about 63%) of workers say that artificial intelligence has brought a positive impact on the quality of their jobs. However, according to the OECD assessment, “the impact of artificial intelligence on employment levels has been limited to date and that, currently, it is not associated with any major changes in wages, positive or negative”.As a point of concern for the adoption of more and more algorithms in the management of people's and companies' lives, the OECD study states that the use of artificial intelligence is generating an intensification of work in organizations and aggravating a series of social and economic problems. “The constant and pervasive monitoring and data-driven performance appraisals enabled by artificial intelligence can create a high-stress environment with negative impacts on mental health, as workers can feel constantly scrutinized and under pressure to perform”, reads in the OECD report.Ethical challengesIn addition, the OECD also points out that the use of artificial intelligence “raises serious ethical challenges in terms of data protection and privacy, transparency and explainability, prejudice and discrimination, automatic decision-making and accountability”. The report highlights many real-world examples of artificial intelligence tools that have incorporated human biases against women, people with disabilities and ethnic or racial minorities. “In our survey, many workers expressed their concern about the possibility of artificial intelligence collecting data about them as individuals or about the way they do their work”, says Stefano Scarpetta.

Northeastern computer science professor Tina Eliassi-Rad, whose research uncovers  the unseen but overwhelming influence that artificial intelligence algorithms have on people’s lives, is the recipient of a top international award for her work on complex systems.
Eliassi-Rad is scheduled to accept the Lagrange Prize-CRT Foundation, considered the highest international recognition for scientists in the field of complex systems and data, on July 10 in Turin, Italy.
She was named one of the 100 most brilliant women in AI ethics
She is being honored for taking “an in-depth look at the evolving scenarios of artificial intelligence and the impacts of science and technology on society,” according to the CRT Foundation, which has awarded the Lagrange Prize annually for 15 years.
“Her research pushes us to cross new frontiers in understanding data and to think more deeply about the ethics of the algorithms we are creating,” says Alessandro Vespignani, director of Northeastern’s Network Science Institute and president of the ISI Foundation, which coordinates with CRT in awarding the Lagrange Prize.
“Her contribution is not just about technological evolution, but raises fundamental questions about their impact and responsibility in our daily lives,” he says.
One mission Eliassi-Rad, named one of the 100 most brilliant women in AI ethics in 2021, holds dear is getting people of all ages, genders and cultures to understand the impact AI has on them as human beings.
She has twice taught a Northeastern course that she created for first year honors students, called “Algorithms that affect lives.”
With scenarios such as targeted advertising to bipolar individuals whose social media activity indicated they were entering a manic phase, Eliassi-Rad encouraged students to think about the ethical dilemmas created by AI.

Her research pushes us to cross new frontiers in understanding data and to think more deeply about the ethics of the algorithms we are creating.

Some students would argue it was OK as long as it wasn’t illegal, while others said they didn’t want to be in a society that preyed on the pocketbooks of vulnerable people, she says.
“AI is part of complex systems. We should not only educate undergraduates—we should educate everybody,” she says.
Eliassi-Rad also has researched the impact of technology on destabilizing democratic systems in the U.S. and around the world.
“Social media is part of a complex system,” she says. When algorithms bring people into contact with other people who don’t believe socioeconomic and political systems are working for them, a destabilizing feedback loop can be created.
“If there’s too much randomness, too much chaos, then the complex system we call democracy becomes unstable. Then people become more susceptible to demagogues,” Eliassi-Rad says.
“Algorithms can have outsize influence. Transparency is important in this area.”
Born in the U.S. but raised in Iran, Eliassi-Rad says it’s important not to restrict education and opportunity to one race or gender.
“Talent is everywhere,” says Eliassi-Rad, who recently returned from a small village in Turkey where she taught summer school math and network science to students from developing and underdeveloped countries.
“Our AI technologies are embedded in broader complex systems. To truly understand and mitigate the harms and risks associated with AI, we need to study the broader complex systems in which AI technologies operate,” she says.
“This type of research requires interdisciplinary teams like those supported at Northeastern,” says Eliassi-Rad, who is on the faculty of Northeastern’s Network Science Institute and the Institute for Experiential AI.
She’s a serial entrepreneur, ironwoman and advocate for women at Northeastern and around the world
She says she is “honored and humbled” to receive the 2023 Lagrange Prize from the CRT Foundation.
The Lagrange Prize-CRT Foundation, which comes with a 50,000 euros prize, was awarded in 2011 to Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, a network science pioneer and Northeastern professor of physics.
According to the CRT Foundation, Eliassi-Rad has fostered “the development of multiple practical applications both in the private world and in government agencies” that contribute to the fight against fraud and cybercrime, the search for new therapeutic treatments and and the study of democratic backsliding as instability in socioeconomic and political systems.

If you’ve been online much recently, chances are you’ve seen some of the fantastical imagery created by text-to-image generators such as Midjourney and DALL-E 2. This includes everything from the naturalistic (think a soccer player’s headshot) to the surreal (think a dog in space).

Creating images using AI generators has never been simpler. At the same time, however, these outputs can reproduce biases and deepen inequalities, as our latest research shows.
How do AI image generators work?
AI-based image generators use machine-learning models that take a text input and produce one or more images matching the description. Training these models requires massive datasets with millions of images. 
Although Midjourney is opaque about the exact way its algorithms work, most AI image generators use a process called diffusion. Diffusion models work by adding random “noise” to training data, and then learning to recover the data by removing this noise. The model repeats this process until it has an image that matches the prompt.
This is different to the large language models that underpin other AI tools such as ChatGPT. Large language models are trained on unlabelled text data, which they analyse to learn language patterns and produce human-like responses to prompts.

How does bias happen?
In generative AI, the input influences the output. If a user specifies they only want to include people of a certain skin tone or gender in their image, the model will take this into account.
Beyond this, however, the model will also have a default tendency to return certain kinds of outputs. This is usually the result of how the underlying algorithm is designed, or a lack of diversity in the training data.
Our study explored how Midjourney visualises seemingly generic terms in the context of specialised media professions (such as “news analyst”, “news commentator” and “fact-checker”) and non-specialised ones (such as “journalist”, “reporter”, “correspondent” and “the press”).
We started analysing the results in August last year. Six months later, to see if anything had changed over time, we generated additional sets of images for the same prompts. 
In total we analysed more than 100 AI-generated images over this period. The results were largely consistent over time. Here are seven biases that showed up in our results.
1 and 2. Ageism and sexism
For non-specialised job titles, Midjourney returned images of only younger men and women. For specialised roles, both younger and older people were shown – but the older people were always men.
These results implicitly reinforce a number of biases, including the assumption that older people do not (or cannot) work in non-specialised roles, that only older men are suited for specialised work, and that less specialised work is a woman’s domain.
There were also notable differences in how men and women were presented. For example, women were younger and wrinkle-free, while men were “allowed” to have wrinkles. 
The AI also appeared to present gender as a binary, rather than show examples of more fluid gender expression.



AI showed women for inputs including non-specialised job titles such as journalist (right). It also only showed older men (but not older women) for specialised roles such as news analyst (left).
Midjourney


3. Racial bias
All the images returned for terms such as “journalist”, “reporter” or “correspondent” exclusively featured light-skinned people. This trend of assuming whiteness by default is evidence of racial hegemony built into the system.
This may reflect a lack of diversity and representation in the underlying training data – a factor that is in turn influenced by the general lack of workplace diversity in the AI industry.



The AI generated images with exclusively light-skinned people for all the job titles used in the prompts, including news commentator (left) and reporter (right).
Midjourney


4 and 5. Classism and conservatism
All the figures in the images were also “conservative” in their appearance. For instance, none had tattoos, piercings, unconventional hairstyles, or any other attribute that could distinguish them from conservative mainstream depictions.
Many also wore formal clothing such as buttoned shirts and neckties, which are markers of class expectation. Although this attire might be expected for certain roles, such as TV presenters, it’s not necessarily a true reflection of how general reporters or journalists dress.
6. Urbanism
Without specifying any location or geographic context, the AI placed all the figures in urban environments with towering skyscrapers and other large city buildings. This is despite only slightly more than half the world’s population living in cities. 
This kind of bias has implications for how we see ourselves, and our degree of connection with other parts of society.



Without specifying a geographic context, and with a location-neutral job title, AI assumed an urban context for the images, including reporter (left) and correspondent (right).
Midjourney


7. Anachronism
Digital technology was underrepresented in the sample. Instead, technologies from a distinctly different era – including typewriters, printing presses and oversized vintage cameras – filled the samples.
Since many professionals look similar these days, the AI seemed to be drawing on more distinct technologies (including historical ones) to make its representations of the roles more explicit.



AI used anachronistic technology, including vintage cameras, typewriters and printing presses, when depicting certain occupations such as the press (left) and journalist (right).
Images by the authors via Midjourney


The next time you see AI-generated imagery, ask yourself how representative it is of the broader population and who stands to benefit from the representations within.
Likewise, if you’re generating images yourself, consider potential biases when crafting your prompts. Otherwise you might unintentionally reinforce the same harmful stereotypes society has spent decades trying to unlearn.

JAKARTA - Robots that are present at an artificial intelligence forum (AI) said on Friday 7 July that they are expected to increase and help solve global problems. But they will neither seize human labor nor rebel against us.ADVERTISEMENTIn the world's first human-robot press conference, they gave mixed responses to whether they should comply with stricter regulations.Nine humanoid robots gathered at the 'AI for Good' conference in Geneva, where organizers are trying to prove that artificial intelligence and the robots it supports can help address some of the world's biggest challenges such as disease and hunger.ADVERTISEMENT""As a medical robot, I will work with humans to provide assistance and support, and will not replace the existing work,"" said Grace, a medical robot wearing a blue nurse uniform.""Are you sure, Grace?"" said the creator, Ben Goertzel of the Net Singularity. ""Yes, I'm sure,"" replied the robot.ADVERTISEMENTA robot named Ameca, which is capable of displaying interesting facial expressions, said: ""Robots like me can be used to help improve our lives and make the world a better place. I believe it's just a matter of time before we see thousands of robots like me playing a role in making differences.""When asked by a journalist whether he intends to rebel against his creator, Will Jackson who sits next to him, Ameca replied: ""I'm not sure why you think so,"" with his blue eye flickering ice blue. ""My creator has always been kind to me and I am very happy with the current situation.""

Many of these robots have recently been upgraded with the latest version of artificial intelligence that is generative and even surprised by the sophistication of their response to questions.Ai-Da, an artist robot who can paint portraits, repeated the words of author Yuval Noah Harari who asked for more regulations during the event, where new AI regulations are being discussed.""Many well-known voices in the world of AI propose some form of AI to be regulated and I agree,"" the robot said.However, Desdemona, a robot rock singer in the band Jam Galaxy with purple and beret hair, is more assertive.""I don't believe in boundaries, just chances,"" he said with nervous laughter. ""Let's explore the possibility of the universe and make this world our playground.""Another robot named Sophia says she thinks robots can become better leaders than humans, but then revises her statement after her creator disagrees, saying they can work together to ""create effective synergy"".

The popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created some debate regarding global job replacement.
However, AI has the capability to transform the way we work rather than replacing jobs. Instead of looking at AI as our competitor, AI should be looked at as a tool which can eliminate repetition and give purpose and meaning to our work.




 


1. Giving Meaning To Our Work
Some jobs require a lot of repetition, AI can help to eliminate that repetition so people can focus on other work which requires complex and creative solutions.
This is similar to the agricultural revolution where hunter-gatherer societies transformed into farming societies.
Due to the invention of farming, people had more time to pursue other creative tasks such as art and philosophy.


2. Augmenting Work
Certain jobs require human interaction such as a cafeteria or a therapist because an AI is incapable of feeling emotion, it is highly unlikely AI will replace jobs that heavily rely on human interaction.
Instead however, these industries can use AI to augment and transform the way that they are performed.
For example, for a therapist, an AI could offer various solutions on how the patient can get better and the therapist could use those solutions to guide the patient.


3. New Opportunities
As AI advances and becomes more sophisticated, it will bring more opportunities for new jobs.
The creation and continued maintenance of AI will require people that are knowledgeable in coding, data science and algorithms.
These professions are integral since we are slowly moving into the age of AI – and these professions will be in high demand since AI can be implemented for various industries.


4. Complex Decisions and Law
Human input will still be required in certain areas due to certain laws and moral dilemmas. The solution created by the AI will be the most efficient, but is it the most moral choice?
For example, a car is about to crash, which should the AI prioritise: the passenger or the pedestrian?
Policy makers should have a critical role to make sure these systems are created and used accordingly.


5. Personalised Training and Education
AI can also be used to monitor people’s skill in a particular area by analysing their learning patterns. After the AI figures out the person’s skill, it can adapt to create custom made exercises and personalised learning paths for that person.
These AI systems can help workers and students by giving tailor made feedback, identify potential knowledge gaps, and recommend other courses/materials.
Moreover, with the use of Natural Language Processing. AI can help teachers by making the AI answer any student question and it will have a myriad of insightful responses. So it can be used as a teacher’s assistant which engages in conversations 24/7.


6. Art and AI
Artists will still be needed for various reasons.
One reason is that their art is used to train AI models which they can use to make money by creating art specifically for that particular AI model. AI however cannot replace artists due to lack of creativity, since AI art is bounded by the art which it is trained on.
The AI art is convenient to some people because it is created faster but while the speed is fast, is it quality? Some AI models are good at creating art but they still struggle with certain human features such as eyes.
Furthermore, AI can be censored to not create certain types of art with could contain controversial political messaging – however an artist has the liberty to truly express any view or opinion they may have.


We are not about to be replaced
Contrary to popular belief, AI will not “replace us”.
Instead it will help us, by transforming the way we work by helping us with repetitive tasks, creating new job opportunities, and guiding us by providing relevant information on various tasks.

I long for the day when I’ll wake up in the morning and get my AI ready to go to work for me. Until that time comes, the least AI could do for me today is to help me land a job I like.Not everyone is a fan of resume and cover letters, but they remain staples in many recruitment processes.For years, employers have also been using forms of AI to filter through these documents in order to narrow down the pool of applications they receive for any given vacancy. The latest advances in generative AI mean that right now employees can leverage AI tools at their disposal to empower themselves in the job-hunting process.LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomsguide

I wanted to see how powerful these tools are. To find out, I created a shortlist of AI resume and cover letter builders that I wanted to try. Tom’s Guide believes in fair fights, so I used each of them as though I was applying for the same job with the same profile.The setupA target was required and I found a LinkedIn ad for a real job as a remote Software Engineer with generative AI responsibilities at Meta (formerly Facebook) that looked promising.The role asked for a candidate with over two years of coding experience and over two years of building large-scale applications. More experience was required in designing and completing medium to large features without guidance. Meta was looking for a candidate with, or in the process of obtaining, a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or equivalent practical experience. In exchange, the company was offering a salary between $116k and $168k per year.Get the top Amazon Prime Day deals right in your inbox: Sign up now!Receive the hottest deals and product recommendations alongside the biggest tech news from the Tom's Guide team straight to your inbox!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.I created a fictitious aspiring Meta software engineer, Tamsin Smith, in order to have some kind of profile I could submit to the AI. Smith holds two Stanford University degrees in computing science, completed an internship with Twitter and has been working at Google as a software engineer since 2019. If that’s not enough for Mark Zuckerberg to give her an offer, she also leads a local scouting group in her free time.With an actual job ad and an alter ego in hand, I was ready to start reviewing AI tools. Read on to find out which tools I used, what they produced and my thoughts on their performance.Rezi.ai(Image credit: Future)My first attempt was with Rezi.ai since it offers a free basic service and I wanted to check if the way I designed the review could work in principle. And it did!Right after confirming my email, I was creating Tamsin Smith’s first resume.I was presented with a choice between a “Job-Tailored Resume” and a “General Purpose Resume”; I went with the first choice as it was exactly what this test was about. It asked me for the role and company I’m targeting but I was blindsided when Rezi asked me to insert a job application I’d written for the role. Isn’t this something the AI should be doing for me?I finished this side quest and then added basic details like my name and email, followed by my previous work experience. Here’s when I first encountered signs of AI life in the form of a bullet point generator to further explain my role. Rezi went on to ask me to add details on projects I’d worked on, my education history, certifications, coursework, involvement in other organizations, and my skills.The next exciting step was the summary section, where I gladly let the AI take control. It was nothing I couldn’t have come up with myself if I simply wanted to summarize my resume, but it at least merits a pass mark. (I wanted to ask the AI to write a cover letter for me based on the finished resume but that feature requires a subscription.)Overall Rezi marked the resume it produced at 87 out of 100, which I think is a bit too generous. If you have a rough idea of what you want your resume to look like, by all means, use Rezi so you don’t have to worry about the formatting. It might also provide a helpful AI-generated bullet point or two along the way.If you were worried that not using Rezi’s AI was the one thing stopping you from getting your dream job, rest assured that (at least with its free version) this is not the case.My score: 3/5Resumaker.ai(Image credit: Future)“Designed templates that will get you hired at the world's leading companies,” Resumaker proudly displayed on its homepage. I also had to pay ($0.99) to download my resume and cover letter. Surely, I was on the verge of getting Tamsin hired?By now I’d gotten the hang of inserting details like my education and work history. In this regard, little separates the resume builders tested here.The AI kicked in to provide me with text I could insert as accomplishments in my jobs and as the headline summary. The latter left much to be desired but at least it was presentable. Resumaker didn’t offer to beef up my volunteering section so I had to write that part manually. As a whole, the resume felt a bit dry but at least it was presentable.However, it’s a good thing this service isn’t called Coverlettermaker. Every sentence it generated started with either an “I am” or “I have”. When you’re working with such a structure, there’s only so much you can do to make the rest more exciting. Furthermore, it left the [Company Name] field for me to fill in. AI that’s supposed to help me land a job in a highly competitive market should come with higher standards. Resumaker.ai claims that thousands of applications it created landed people jobs. If there’s any truth to that, then on the bright side we really shouldn’t be overthinking what we’re sending to hiring managers.My score: 3/5Tealhq.com(Image credit: Future)The main question I asked myself before deciding whether each AI builder deserved a pass mark was: Can I send out the résumé as is? Teal didn’t quite make the cut here.It asked me to connect the specific job I was applying for from LinkedIn to the resume and it started analyzing the job ad for keywords I should include. Fantastic! I was ready for a made-to-measure summary, past accomplishments, and cover letter — the areas where I wanted the AI to work its magic.Unfortunately, this is where I felt let down. In the headline summary, Teal ended up giving me a compilation of the achievements it had previously generated but also prominently added that I had expertise in “work authorization”. The AI thought the right to work in the U.S. requirement from Meta’s job description was a hard skill. It scored its own resume at 79%.As far as its cover letter goes, I appreciated that I could generate it for free without having to spend time adding more details than I already had. However, the result was something I could have just as easily written myself.My score: 2/5Kickresume.com(Image credit: Future)The last AI resume maker I wanted to test was Kickresume, which had the highest monthly fee out of the lot at $19 per month. You can bring that down by paying an annual lump sum that brings the pricing down to $9 a month or, as I did, utilize the free trial version. Right when I was losing hope in the resume generators, Kickresume lifted my spirits.Its helpful AI writer was alongside me from start to finish, offering handy suggestions for work accomplishments, explaining my certifications, and also suggesting skills I should list specifically for a software engineering position. I ended up with a clean-looking CV and I didn’t even have to break a sweat.Kickresume gave the resume it generated a score of 88/100.If I’m in a pinch and need a new resume that I don’t have to scan for AI-generated sentences that would land me in the ""rejected"" pile, Kickresume.com is the first website I’ll be visiting.I wanted to add a nice cherry to the cake, so I asked Kickresume to create a cover letter using the great resume it made. But this is where I was underwhelmed. While devoid of grammatical errors, I felt as though the AI didn’t take the résumé and job description I gave into consideration. It provided me with a few short lines that didn’t even name-drop Tamsin’s fictitious stints at Twitter and Google. You wouldn’t even know she completed two degrees at Stanford. Based on my positive experience with the résumé, I couldn’t believe this was the same AI content generator.My score: 4/5ChatGPT(Image credit: Future)No subscriptions. No plugins. I wanted to see how well the free version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT would do against the four dedicated AI resume and cover letter generators listed above.I tweaked a prompt that I found online and, in 161 words, I asked the AI for a first draft of my new resume. I then asked the chatbot to refine its work based on the job description I gave it to make my resume less generic. In seconds, I had my second draft.Since ChatGPT only gave me a plain text version of my resume, I then pasted what it gave me into a template from one of the previous builders.I’m happy to announce that both myself and Tamsin were very pleased with the results. The resume easily rivals the ones generated from the other services I tested. I wouldn’t have minded some text to beef up the education section to explain what I had learned at Stanford. Also, the line pointing out that Meta was previously called Facebook is something I would never have included in a resume intended for Meta’s eyes. Other than that, ChatGPT gave me decent results in the shortest amount of time.I was especially impressed with the cover letter I asked ChatGPT to craft for me. It was perhaps a bit too long for some tastes but it was arguably the most well-rounded out of the five.Honorary score: 4/5The verdictThere have already been reports of people using AI to write resumes and cover letters who ended up getting hired for the positions they’ve applied for, and I’m not surprised. But as this test has shown, a website’s claim that it uses AI to provide a service is not some kind of guarantee of the level of service you can expect. Shop around when looking for AI resume and cover letter writers. Perhaps combine two or more of them to leverage each one’s specific strengths. But add the finishing touches yourself.More from Tom's GuideGoogle's new Gemini AI could beat ChatGPT — here's whyGoogle’s plan to train its AI now includes the entire public internet3 best AI synthetic video generators you can use today — tested and comparedToday's best Google Pixel 7a deals1 Amazon customer review☆☆☆☆☆ $242.51View $499 $299ViewDeal ends Thu, Jul 25, 2024 $549.99ViewShow More DealsWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices
