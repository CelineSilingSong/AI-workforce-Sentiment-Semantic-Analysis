Some notable individuals such as legendary physicist Stephen Hawking and Tesla and SpaceX leader and innovator Elon Musk suggest AI could potentially be very dangerous; Musk at one point was comparing AI to the dangers of the dictator of North Korea. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also believes there’s reason to be cautious, but that the good can outweigh the bad if managed properly. Since recent developments have made super-intelligent machines possible much sooner than initially thought, the time is now to determine what dangers artificial intelligence poses.

What is applied and general artificial intelligence?
At the core, artificial intelligence is about building machines that can think and act intelligently and includes tools such as Google's search algorithms or the machines that make self-driving cars possible. While most current applications are used to impact humankind positively, any powerful tool can be wielded for harmful purposes when it falls into the wrong hands. Today, we have achieved applied AI—AI that performs a narrow task such as facial recognition, natural language processing or internet searches. Ultimately, experts in the field are working towards artificial general intelligence, where systems can handle any task that intelligent humans could perform, and most likely beat us at each of them.
PROMOTED
In a comment, Elon Musk wrote: ""The pace of progress in artificial intelligence (I'm not referring to narrow AI) is incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast—it is growing at a pace close to exponential. The risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five-year timeframe. 10 years at most.”






There are indeed plenty of AI applications that make our everyday lives more convenient and efficient. It's the AI applications that play a critical role in ensuring safety that Musk, Hawking, and others were concerned about when they proclaimed their hesitation about the technology. For example, if AI is responsible for ensuring the operation of our power grid and our worst fears are realized, and the system goes rogue or gets hacked by an enemy, it could result in massive harm.
How can artificial intelligence be dangerous?
While we haven’t achieved super-intelligent machines yet, the legal, political, societal, financial and regulatory issues are so complex and wide-reaching that it’s necessary to take a look at them now so we are prepared to safely operate among them when the time comes. Outside of preparing for a future with super-intelligent machines now, artificial intelligence can already pose dangers in its current form. Let’s take a look at some key AI-related risks.

Autonomous weapons
AI programmed to do something dangerous, as is the case with autonomous weapons programmed to kill, is one way AI can pose risks. It might even be plausible to expect that the nuclear arms race will be replaced with a global autonomous weapons race. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin said: “Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind. It comes with enormous opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.”
Aside from being concerned that autonomous weapons might gain a “mind of their own,” a more imminent concern is the dangers autonomous weapons might have with an individual or government that doesn’t value human life. Once deployed, they will likely be difficult to dismantle or combat.
Social manipulation
Social media through its autonomous-powered algorithms is very effective at target marketing. They know who we are, what we like and are incredibly good at surmising what we think. Investigations are still underway to determine the fault of Cambridge Analytica and others associated with the firm who used the data from 50 million Facebook users to try to sway the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the U.K.'s Brexit referendum, but if the accusations are correct, it illustrates AI's power for social manipulation. By spreading propaganda to individuals identified through algorithms and personal data, AI can target them and spread whatever information they like, in whatever format they will find most convincing—fact or fiction.
Invasion of privacy and social grading
It is now possible to track and analyze an individual's every move online as well as when they are going about their daily business. Cameras are nearly everywhere, and facial recognition algorithms know who you are. In fact, this is the type of information that is going to power China's social credit system that is expected to give every one of its 1.4 billion citizens a personal score based on how they behave—things such as do they jaywalk, do they smoke in non-smoking areas and how much time they spend playing video games. When Big Brother is watching you and then making decisions based on that intel, it’s not only an invasion of privacy it can quickly turn to social oppression.
Misalignment between our goals and the machine’s
Part of what humans value in AI-powered machines is their efficiency and effectiveness. But, if we aren’t clear with the goals we set for AI machines, it could be dangerous if a machine isn’t armed with the same goals we have. For example, a command to “Get me to the airport as quickly as possible” might have dire consequences. Without specifying that the rules of the road must be respected because we value human life, a machine could quite effectively accomplish its goal of getting you to the airport as quickly as possible and do literally what you asked, but leave behind a trail of accidents.
Discrimination
Since machines can collect, track and analyze so much about you, it’s very possible for those machines to use that information against you. It’s not hard to imagine an insurance company telling you you’re not insurable based on the number of times you were caught on camera talking on your phone. An employer might withhold a job offer based on your “social credit score.”
Any powerful technology can be misused. Today, artificial intelligence is used for many good causes including to help us make better medical diagnoses, find new ways to cure cancer and make our cars safer. Unfortunately, as our AI capabilities expand we will also see it being used for dangerous or malicious purposes. Since AI technology is advancing so rapidly, it is vital for us to start to debate the best ways for AI to develop positively while minimizing its destructive potential.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here is our guide to understanding the minds of machines.Getty ImagesFor many, the true test lies in areas where humans excel – such as complex reasoning, creativity and understanding (Credit: Getty Images)Since the early days of computers, scientists have strived to create machines that can rival humans in their ability to think, reason and learn – in other words, artificial intelligence.While today’s AI systems still fall short of that goal, they are starting to perform as well as, and sometimes better than, their creators at certain tasks. Thanks to new techniques that allow machines to learn from enormous sets of data, AI has taken massive leaps forward.AI is starting to move out of research labs and into the real world. It is having an impact on our lives. There can be little doubt that we are entering the age of artificial intelligence.(Image credit: Getty Images)AlamyFacial recognition systems have been shown to misidentify black faces and often fail to see women's faces at all (Credit: Alamy)As AI enters the real world by assessing loan applications, informing courtroom decisions or helping to identify patients who should receive treatment, so too does one of its most fundamental flaws: bias.Algorithms are only as good as the code that governs them and the data used to teach them. Each can carry the watermark of our own preconceptions. Facial recognition software can misclassify black faces or fail to identify women, criminal profiling algorithms have ranked non-whites as higher risk and recruitment tools have scored women lower than men.But with these challenges, there has been mounting pressure on technology giants to fix them.(Image credit: Alamy)Getty ImagesChatbots are one of the most visual forms of AI in our lives (Credit: Getty Images)These talkative machines use the power of two branches of AI, natural language processing and natural language generation, to interact with human users. They appear on social media feeds, customer service pages and websites to provide conversation, advice and companionship – and they are transforming the way we interact with organisations including utilities companies, adult websites, pizza delivery firms, online stores, banks and even governments.(Image credit: Getty Images)0:26d is for… designDesigning new components for cars or aircraft is a slow, painstaking process, but artificial intelligence can generate millions of innovative new shapes and configurations in just a few hours. With a few simple instructions, the algorithm produced new highly efficient designs for a drone in the video above. Companies like General Motors and Airbus are among those using AI to help them design new components.

Researchers working with the UN have been building algorithms that can use data on energy generation, economic growth, population size and food production to predict where future migration crises may occur.Others, such as the Alan Turing Institute in the UK and the US’s Political Instability Task Force, have been building AI capable of predicting where future conflicts may occur. Using statistical data, military reports and analysing news reports for signs of rising tensions, their machines can estimate the likelihood of violence escalating in trouble spots.(Image credit: Getty Images)Getty ImagesChelsea Football Club is working with researchers to use artificial Intelligence to help players make better decisions on the football pitch (Credit: Getty Images)The result of a football match can hang on a single split-second decision made by a player. If the athlete had chosen to pass the ball rather than shoot at goal, for example, their team’s fortunes may have changed dramatically.Researchers working with one of the Premier League’s biggest clubs, Chelsea FC, are using AI to help analyse these crucial player decisions to predict what might have happened if they had done something different. They hope this will help the team learn how to make better decisions during a match, and perhaps even win more games.(Image credit: Getty Images)NvidiaThese people do not exist, but were dreamed up by a generative adversarial network that can create images entirely from scratch (Credit: Nvidia)None of these people exist. They may appear to have the well-honed features of celebrities, but in fact these faces have been dreamed up by a type of AI computer system known as a generative adversarial network, or Gan.As the name suggests, these are comprised of algorithms that work in opposition to each other. One is trained on a set of data – in this case celebrity photos – which it uses to produce its own versions. A second computer network then judges the work to see if it can spot differences between the computer-generated images and the originals. In response, the first network tweaks how it produces its celebrity photos in an attempt to fool the other network. The result is an ever more realistic set of images.(Image credit: Nvidia)0:27The magic of GansWhile early Gan-generated images were low resolution messes that regularly produced pictures of faces with too many eyes or melted-looking features, as this video illustrates, they can now able to 'grow' realistic photo-quality images over time. (Video credit: Nvidia)MITBy tweaking the surface texture, a turtle can be made to look like a gun to a machine vision system (Credit: MIT)While the capabilities of machines have taken a leap forward in recent years, they still get things wrong in hilarious, and sometimes concerning, ways. Take the AI Tetris-playing bot that decided the best way to avoid losing was to indefinitely pause the game.Others can be fooled in baffling ways. Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently demonstrated that popular machine vision algorithms used to identify objects in images and camera footage can be fooled into thinking a model of a sea turtle is a rifle, or a baseball is an espresso. They did this by subtly changing the texture of the objects so they look like one thing to our eyes – but like something else to the machines.“There is a concern that if real-world systems ­– the machine vision in a self-driving car, for example – were attacked in this way, it could cause real harm,” warns Anish Athalye, the researcher who led the study.(Image credit: MIT)Helena SarinArtists are using artificial intelligence to generate strange and unusual images (Credit Helena Sarin)One thing that has become clear as machine learning is used more frequently is that machines see the world very differently from us. While humans intuitively absorb knowledge about how the world works from birth, machines have to be specifically taught these rules. But freed from these constraints, they also produce some wild visions that are helping to inspire artists, musicians and filmmakers.Machine vision researcher and artist Helena Sarin feeds her own drawings to a Gan (see g is for...) which then produces strangely beautiful images like those shown here.Image credit: (Helena Sarin)Getty ImagesPredicting where traffic jams and accidents will occur with AI should help to keep roads clear of snarl ups (Credit: Getty Images)The ebb and flow of traffic on busy roads and cities is difficult to predict. It varies with human behaviour, road conditions, time of day and year, weather and accidents.But by analysing vast amounts of information quickly, AI is being tested to keep traffic flowing more smoothly by taking control of traffic signals, predicting accidents and forecasting potential snarl ups.(Image credit: Getty Images)Maeve/RavelryKnitting patterns generated by AI are pretty strange looking (Credit: Maeve/Ravelry)Trained on existing patterns, artificial intelligence is being used to create new fashion and textile designs. One imaginatively named experiment, called SkyKnit, has created bizarre tentacle-strewn knitting patterns with unique stitches that have gathered their own cult following.(Image Credit: Maeve/Ravelry)FacebookTwo chatbots created by Facebook communciated with each other in their own shorthand language (Credit: Facebook)Our ability to communicate with the spoken and written word is among the defining features of our species. A branch of machine learning that trains algorithms to understand and reproduce language is threatening that position.Natural language generation algorithms can now turn reams of sports statistics or financial data into succinct news stories. They are being used to produce marketing copy. Some have been trained to write their own fairytales, mimic Shakespeare and even compose poems. In most cases, the text they produce is nonsense, but in others it has become a strange art form in its own right.Perhaps more intriguing still is what happens when AIs talk to each other. In the case of two negotiating chatbots created by Facebook, they began to communicate in their own strange language.(Image credit: Facebook)Getty ImagesNeural networks are modelled on the structures in the human brain (Credit: Getty Images)While other approaches to developing AI exist, machine learning has largely powered much of the recent leaps and bounds in the field. It is designed to loosely mimic the way humans themselves gather knowledge – through learning. But while humans can pick up patterns or a skill from just a few examples, machines require vast amounts of data.Reams of information are fed to webs of code that form connections between different parts of the network as it identifies patterns, giving it the ability to interpret future data.n is for… neural networksTo create machines that can think like humans, computer scientists have understandably turned to nature to solve the problem, creating algorithms that mimic the structure of the brain. To do this, they are creating networks of algorithms designed to act like the neurons in the brain. Connections between these mathematical neurons form to create clusters as the machine learns.(Image credit: Getty Images)Getty ImagesThe signs of alzheimer's disease can be spotted in brain scans by artificial intelligence years before diagnosis (Credit: Getty Images)While spotting patterns that might otherwise elude human eyes is an area where machines excel, some of the most exciting areas of AI lie in their ability to predict the future too.A growing suite of AI-powered applications that can spot cancers or the early signs of eye disease are being used by doctors around the world, but recently researchers showed that AI can also predict whether someone might suffer conditions like Alzheimer’s disease years before they show any symptoms.(Image credit: Getty Images)Getty ImagesPolice are using AI to help them catch criminals (Credit: Getty Images)Police forces around the world are testing AI systems that could help them to catch more criminals faster. In the UK, for example, one force is trialling a facial recognition system that can identify a suspect from just a portion of their face, such as an ear. Another system developed in Spain scours crime scene photographs for signs of evidence that can link crimes.AI systems are also being used to help police and courts make decisions about whether a suspect should be held in custody or released on bail by predicting their risk of committing other offences.(Image credit: Getty Images)Getty ImagesEarthquake aftershocks can be accurately predicted using AI (Credit: Getty Images)Like other natural disasters, earthquakes are notoriously difficult to predict. But computers deploying deep learning – a form of machine learning – can predict the location of devastating aftershocks that often cause further death and destruction.(Image credit: Getty Images)Getty ImagesNatural language generation is allowing machines to produce real-sounding rap lyrics (Credit: Getty Images)A foul-mouthed, slang-slinging silicon lyricist, Deep-flow is a rhyme-busting AI that can spit out rap lyrics so fluently, it can be hard to distinguish from the real deal.(Image credit: Getty Images)Getty ImagesAI is already creeping into our homes in the form of voice-activated assistants and in our phones, but its potential goes far beyond simply answering questions. As more appliances and devices are connected to home networks, AI can be used to manage them. Smart thermostats powered by AI can tune your heating to your lifestyle, while sensors that analyse data from your home electricity metre can identify a distinct ‘fingerprint’ of each appliance that can be identified to help switch off power-hungry devices when not in use.Getty ImagesThe Turing test for machine intelligence was thought up by Alan Turing (Credit: Getty Images)Developed by computing pioneer Alan Turing, the Turing test is considered to be one of the key measures of artificial intelligence. Turing suggested that a way of testing a machine’s ‘intelligence’ would be its ability to fool a human into thinking it was human. In some areas, this has arguably been achieved, with chatbots that can convincingly converse with humans or write realistic looking online reviews. But some critics point out that the Turing Test doesn’t measure true intelligence – only the ability to mimic it.u is for… unsupervised learningEarly forms of machine learning used data such as images that had been painstakingly labelled to help algorithms identify the objects they contained. But more recently researchers have been using another approach. Unsupervised learning allows the algorithms to draw their own inferences by looking for patterns in the data they are given.(Image credit: Getty Images)Efficient Vineyard ProjectBy analysing grape quality and foliage levels on vines with machine vision, AI algorithms can help managers improve wine quality (Credit: Efficient Vineyard Project)Machine vision algorithms allow computers to recognise everything from faces to cats and galaxies in images or video footage.

Patrolling the skies overhead with drones, however, has allowed conservationists to use machine vision systems to spot poachers in infrared footage.

Lexus has created the first ever advert scripted entirely by artificial intelligence – a dramatic 60-second film that tells the story of a car that comes to life to mark the launch of its new ES executive saloon car.
Like Frankenstein’s Monster, the ad begins with a Lexus engineer admiring his creation. He looks on and sheds a tear as the car is taken away and threatened with destruction, taking to the open and stormy roads before being shackled and readied for an imminent crash test that is being broadcast live on TV while its owner watches in suspense.
It is the car’s automatic emergency braking system that saves the day, demonstrating one of the main technological features built into the ES model.
The production process, which Lexus says took no longer than a normal campaign (around six months from brief to output), involved developing the bespoke AI and training it with data including 15 years of award-winning luxury adverts, emotional intelligence about what connects most strongly with viewers and specially commissioned information about human intuition.

To avoid the risk of producing something that felt too familiar or too mass market in tone, additional data on the Lexus brand and the project guideline were inputted into the AI to keep the script original and on-brand.
Directed by Oscar winner Kevin Macdonald, whose work includes The Last King of Scotland and Whitney Houston biopic Whitney, the ad was built by technical partner Visual Voice in collaboration with Lexus’s creative agency The&Partnership, with support from IBM Watson.
Man vs machine
While there are “narrative leaps” that wouldn’t pass in the cinema, the film largely makes sense and Lexus says it didn’t have to change much. And the more Lexus uses AI, the quicker it believes the creative process will become.
Perhaps most disconcertingly, the ad resonates on a very human level, raising the possibility that while a computer might not be able to understand human emotions, it has the capacity to replicate them and create an emotional connection.
But Lexus’s brand general manager, Michael Tripp, says this doesn’t mean creative agencies are going to be made redundant in favour of machines.

Philosophically, could this cut out or change the creative aspect of this process? Yes.
Michael Tripp, Lexus

Speaking to Marketing Week at the ad’s premier yesterday (15 November), Tripp explains: “Our ambition under this umbrella is not to replace the human element but to augment it.  Philosophically, could this cut out or change the creative aspect of this process? Yes. But our strategy at Lexus is we believe in man plus machine.
“I could never ask you to go look at 15 years of award-winning films and give me that data but I can now get that and use it to inform our creative.”
Lexus already has a neurological sensor built into one of its cars that measures the temperature of somebody’s face and adjusts the temperature of the car accordingly. It is this kind of information Tripp believes will allow machines to create human emotions more accurately in future.

“I don’t think it’s an understanding of the emotion,” he says. “If we connected you to neurological sensors, or if we could take that information and put it into some kind of objective information then yes. The real question is moving from objectivity to subjectivity and this is where I’ve yet to see that’s possible.
“It wouldn’t be reading your emotion, it would be the fact your heart beat increased or maybe you perspire. And this becomes objective data which can then be used to learn, adjust and adapt.”
In terms of effectiveness, Tripp says Lexus is most interested in the organic response. “Anything that happens online or on social we typically see a return of 2% to 5%,” he says.
“For me, what we can use is organic and sentiment to see what people think before we start putting paid behind it. So we have a little bit of this luxury and that’s how we’ll measure it, as well as post testing.”
The film will be unveiled on Monday (19 November) across Europe in cinemas and on digital and social channels.

Why artificial intelligence won't replace doctors

        While AI has already shown promise in automating certain tasks, it doesn't seem likely that it will replace flesh-and-blood clinicians anytime soon.      







Jeff Lagasse, Editor










 

Artificial intelligence is coming to healthcare. In fact, in areas such as radiology and cancer detection, it's already here in places, and is poised to become ever more prevalent in the industry. Which naturally raises a question for nurses and physicians: Is AI coming for my job?
Well, probably not. At least according to experts we interviewed for our Focus on Artificial Intelligence.
That said, both AI and machine learning are in a prime position to alter clinical workflows and physician training. And with the market growing the way it is, implementation is inevitable. A recent Accenture report estimated that the AI health market will hit $6.6 billion by 2021. That's up from $600 million in 2014.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms tend to rely on large quantities of data to be effective, and that data needs human hands to collect it and human eyes to analyze it. And since AI in healthcare is currently utilized mainly to aggregate and organize data -- looking for trends and patterns and making recommendations -- a human component is very much needed.
So physicians and nurses don't have to worry. Probably. At least for now.
WHAT THE EXPERTS THINK
PeriGen CEO Matthew Sappern puts no stock in the theory that clinicians' jobs are in jeopardy. Instead, he looks at AI more as an empowerment tool.
""I think it does things that are really imperative that are not necessarily what nurses can do,"" he said. ""These tools are not so great where reasoning and empathy are required. You teach them to do something, and they will do it over and over and over again, period. They're good tools to provide perspective, but it's all about the provider or nurse who's making sense of that information.""
In many ways, said Sappern, AI can help nurses focus more on the actual job of nursing, and focus more on the abstract things that can truly impact patient care. And it has the potential to increase their confidence, as they can report back to the doctor with hard stats instead of vagaries. Used wisely and it can be a boon to fact-based clinical observation.
Jvion Chief Product Officer Dr. John Showalter was equally dismissive of claims that jobs are in jeopardy. The hype is scary, he said. The reality is not.
""There are great benefits that do amazing things for patients,"" said Showalter. ""When you come in and improve the scoring for falls, for example, and you understand what needs to be done to prevent falls, that's ready for prime time today.
""There absolutely places where AI is ready to go today, and then there's a whole bunch of AI hype that's really scary, so sorting out the AI that's ready to help patients and the hype can be really difficult for leadership.
Sappern and Showalter's opinions mirror the conclusions of an article appearing this year in The Conversation analyzing the potential effect of AI, or lack thereof, on high-skilled jobs.
USING AI AS A TOOL
In the analysis the author notes that innovations in various industrial revolutions have always created new jobs even as they've taken old jobs away; what makes the AI revolution different is that it has the potential to affect white-collar jobs.
No need for alarms to go off, though, at least not initially, since AI in healthcare would primarily affect lower-skilled office work, like data processing. Though highly trained professionals could also be affected, the switch so far seems to be happening in a way that shows AI to be a tool more so than a threat, as professionals can now learn how to benefit from its powerful predictive powers.
In some cases, the technology could be used to help fill the physician shortage that is even now gripping many parts of the country, and is expected to get worse.
Eldon Richards, chief technology officer at Recondo Technologies, said AI is now addressing a lot of repetitive tasks that a human might do today.
""If reviewing the ethics of a decision, or complex data or one-off decision, AI is not good at those today,"" said Richards. ""Ai is very far off when it comes to those capabilities. The mundane, routine things we do, like typing in a word processor, AI us simplifying those things for us, so now we're shifting our focus from these simple tasks to things that require a little more training. I certainly do not see unemployment going up.""
That sentiment is echoed by Mary Sun, AI researcher at First Derm and medical student at Mount Sinai Medical Center.
""People see it as a job replacement thing and I think that's a pretty flawed way to look at it,"" she said. ""In many other industries, like when I was in commercial tech, it's viewed much more as an augmentation, and piece of mind, and double checking and making sure that you're involving patterns that one doctor cannot possibly see.
	""As one doctor, you can't possibly see a million patients across your lifetime. But medicine, at least diagnosis, is all in the pattern recognition. So I think it's going to be very exciting when we find ways to augment our diagnoses and make them a lot more robust.""
Carlo Perez, CEO of Swift Medical, feels similarly, viewing AI as augmentative tool. While it may alter the role of a doctor somewhat, it won't replace them entirely.
""What we feel is the doctor will transition into someone who understands how to wield data science, who understands how to use these tools,"" said Perez. ""Hopefully someone will not need to truly understand AI, but will understand their relationship to it. Which is, 'I can utilize these tools, I understand these tools, and I understand how to utilize them in partnership to make better decisions.'""

[caption id=""attachment_25011"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] Women are currently underrepresented in fields experiencing job growth, such as engineering and information and communication technology (photo: Vgajic/iStock by Getty Images)[/caption]

The way we work is changing at an unprecedented rate. Digitalization, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are eliminating many jobs involving low and middle-skill routine tasks through automation.
Our new research finds the trend toward greater automation will be especially challenging for women.

More than ever, women will need to break the glass ceiling.

On average, women face an 11 percent risk of losing their jobs due to automation, compared to 9 percent of their male counterparts. So while many men are losing their jobs to automation, we estimate that 26 million women’s jobs in 30 countries are at high risk of being displaced by technology within the next 20 years. We find that women’s jobs have a 70 percent or higher probability of automation. This translates globally to 180 million women’s jobs.
We must understand the impact of these trends on women’s lives if we are to gain gender equity in the work place.
What policies can countries implement now to ensure that women contribute to the economy, while moving toward greater automation?
Women at higher risk 
Hard-won gains from policies to increase the number of women in the paid workforce and to increase women’s pay to equal men’s may be quickly eroded if women work predominantly in sectors and occupations that are at high risk of being automated.

Women who are 40 and older, and those in clerical, service, and sales positions are disproportionately at risk.
Nearly 50 percent of women with a high school education, or less, are at high risk of their jobs being automated, compared to 40 percent of men. The risk for women with a bachelor’s degree or higher is 1 percent.



The chart below shows how the automation of jobs effects people in different countries. Men and women in the United Kingdom and the United States face about the same amount of risk for job automation. In Japan and Israel, women’s jobs are more vulnerable to automation than men’s. Women’s jobs in Finland are less vulnerable to automation than men’s.

Opportunities and challenges 
Women are currently underrepresented in fields experiencing job growth, such as engineering and information and communications technology. In tech, women are 15 percent less likely than men to be managers and professionals, and 19 percent are more likely to be clerks and service workers performing more routine tasks, which leaves women at a high risk of displacement by technology.
More than ever, women will need to break the glass ceiling. Our analysis shows that differences in routineness of job tasks exacerbate gender inequality in returns to labor. Even after taking into account such factors as differences in skill, experience and choice of occupation, nearly 5 percent of the wage gap between women and men is because women perform more routine job tasks. In the US this means women forfeit $26,000 in income over the course of their working life.
There are some bright spots. In advanced and emerging economies, which are experiencing rapid aging, jobs are likely to grow in traditionally female-dominated sectors such as health, and social services―jobs requiring cognitive and interpersonal skills and thus less prone to automation. Coping with aging populations will require both more human workers and greater use of artificial intelligence, robotics, and other advanced technologies to complement and boost productivity of workers in healthcare services.
Policies that work
Governments need to enact policies that foster gender equality and empowerment in the changing landscape of work:

Provide women with the right skills. Early investment in women in STEM fields, like the program Girls Who Code in the US, along with peer mentoring, can help break down gender stereotypes and increase women in scientific fields. Tax deductions for training those already in the workforce, like in the Netherlands, and portable individual learning accounts, like in France, could help remove barriers to lifelong learning.
Close gender gaps in leadership positions. Providing affordable childcare and replacing family taxation with individual taxation, like in Canada and Italy, can play an important role in boosting women’s career progression. Countries can set relevant recruitment and retention targets for organizations, as well as promotion quotas, like in Norway, and establish mentorship and training programs to promote women into managerial positions.
Bridge the digital gender divide. Governments have a role to play through public investment in capital infrastructure and ensuring equal access to finance and connectivity, like in Finland.
Ease transitions for workers. Countries can support workers as they change jobs because of automation with training and benefits that are linked to individuals rather than jobs, like the individual training accounts in France and Singapore. Social protection systems will need to adapt to the new forms of work. To address deteriorating income security associated with rapid technological change, some countries may consider expansion of non-contributory pensions and adoption of basic income guarantees may be warranted.

Automation has made it even more urgent to step up efforts to level the playing field between men and women, so that all have equal opportunities to contribute to, and benefit from, the new more technology-enabled world.

 Dhireesha Kudithipudi, a professor of computer engineering, is part of a growing group of RIT researchers working in artificial intelligence. 


Some of RIT’s professors are teaching very different kinds of students. Their classrooms are labs, and the students are high-tech computers being taught to think.
There is a growing group of RIT researchers working in a field broadly known as artificial intelligence, or AI. They are building increasingly complex algorithms—the rules that govern operating systems—so that machines can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, including making decisions.
As part of RIT’s Center for Human-Aware Artificial Intelligence, these faculty researchers believe their work, with multi-millions of dollars in funding from the National Science Foundation, National Security Administration, Air Force Research Labs and other prominent organizations, could lead to breakthroughs in everything from health care to energy management to cybersecurity.
“There is an exuberance in this field,” said Dhireesha Kudithipudi, one of the center founders and a professor of computer engineering. “And the work and research we are doing today is to improve human lives tomorrow.”
RIT is uniquely positioned to tackle this area because the university has the right combination of people with expertise in AI, as well as researchers in specialized fields, such as American Sign Language and imaging science.
Work at the center builds on national priorities for AI, where the economic impact is projected to increase global GDP by nearly $16 trillion by 2030, according to a 2017 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
“There is a huge opportunity for researchers in this domain, but the tricky part is that these researchers need to be truly interdisciplinary,” said Kudithipudi, director of the center, who is seeing some of those interdisciplinary connections being made.
AI is an umbrella term for multiple fields of computing technologies—deep learning, computer vision, neuromorphic computing, natural language processing, for example—strengths of the faculty researchers involved in the center. These strengths became the center’s four key areas: brain-inspired computing, machine learning and perception, automation and human-centered AI.
Projects will address society’s challenges in the areas of manufacturing, cybersecurity, sustainable systems and energy develop–ment, and improve medical care and technology. They will also address deeper questions such as how do humans and machines interact with each other and how do machines interpret intent.
“The benefits and future successes of AI will come from multiple disciplines and people who come together to develop new application domains,” Kudithipudi said.

For some, it will be humanity’s salvation, while for others, it could be our downfall. We are entering the age of artificial intelligence (AI).While AI is still some way from the sentient machines portrayed in science fiction, the creation of algorithms that can learn, understand language and mimic some aspects of the human mind have led to huge advances. Today AI is being used in hundreds of different industries.The machines we use on a daily basis are getting smarter, meaning that AI is no longer a futuristic technology but is increasingly integrated into every realm of our lives. From suggesting what books we might like to buy online to powering the virtual assistants that inhabit our phones and smart speakers, some of the applications are more visible than others. In truth, AI is touching our lives far more than many of us realise.Banks are using it to detect fraud and predict changes in the stock marketsInsurance companies are employing AI to help them produce policy quotes and assess claimsIt’s helping police forces to identify suspects from grainy CCTV imagesIn courtrooms it’s offering advice to judges about whether to grant bail conditions to criminal suspectsMachines with the capability to identify images are helping doctors spot disease.Algorithms that use machine learning – one of the leading branches of AI – are helping self-driving cars to navigate our complex roadsThey are helping linguists to decifer lost languagesAnd it is helping firms make decisions about who to hire and fireEven on flights, AI is being used by air traffic controllers to help to keep us safe both in the air and on the ground.Yet there are also deep ethical questions about how and when AI should be used. And whether the hype surrounding this technology outstrips what is really achievable.Over the next four months, BBC Future is going to explore the technologies and trends at the cutting-edge of AI, sorting the hype from where it has real-world promise. We will probe the profound implications of letting these silicon brains into our lives and how it will shape our relationships, our work and our societies.One of the early pioneers of computer science Alan Perlis once quipped that “a year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God,” out of frustration at the problems of producing computer networks that could mimic the human brain. Is the prospect of creating machines that could possibly hope to compete with our brains still out of reach? Or are they now able to do the things humans can only dream of?What is AI really capable of? How can it help us solve our problems?

The question is timely, as HCM platform-maker Kronos Inc. just rolled out an AI-powered tool aimed at the hourly workforce. To put it all in context, workers paid by the hour represented nearly 59% of employed Americans in 2017, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and that number has grown 15% since 1996. And a 2015 study from the Society of Human Resource Management found that hourly workers' turnover rate was 49% annually.







In one sense, the Kronos AI announcement seems to be business as usual. In 2018, a slew of AI and machine learning-based tools arrived in the HR space. But almost universally, those products have been designed to improve the HR workload or are used by salaried employees. If AI had anything to do with the hourly workforce, my cynical thought was that it was more likely to be taking their jobs than actually helping them out.

Kronos AI tries to tackle shift swaps
That's why it was time to look deeper at how AI could make a difference in areas like employee engagement, starting with the Kronos AI tool, Aimee, which is an acronym for Artificial Intelligence for Managers and Employees. Jayson Saba, senior director of product marketing at Kronos, is, not surprisingly, excited about what AI can offer.
""A workplace that uses artificial intelligence is actually a pretty cool place to be,"" he wrote in an email.
But it was practicality and not the coolness factor Kronos was pursuing with Aimee's first big use case in the Kronos Workforce Dimensions suite: shift swapping.
""When an employee needs to swap a shift, Aimee looks back at the last nine or more months of shift swaps and learn from that history,"" Saba explained. ""Who do you usually swap with? Who usually accepts those swaps? What days do you like to swap on? What days do other people not like to work? Aimee then makes a recommendation about which employees are most likely to want to swap.""
Kronos also recognized that not all hourly workers are created equal. A nurse might have a hospital email address and easy access to a computer, while a fast food employee might not. That's why the company teamed up with Workplace by Facebook and IBM's Watson supercomputer to offer chatbot-powered shift swapping on any mobile device, as well as coaching or training options, Saba said.
And, like several other competing products, Aimee offers predictive features that can help managers identify which employees might be most likely to leave.


Hourly scheduling is 'hellishly hard'
Putting Kronos AI to work with scheduling issues is largely a winning combination for HR analyst Katherine Jones, who gives Kronos points for tackling the hourly workforce.
""That's the most difficult part of the market,"" she said. ""What makes Kronos AI and the product suite more interesting to me is they're looking at difficult business problems and trying to use smart technology to figure it out."" Shift scheduling and swapping are ""hellishly hard"" problems to solve, she said, so it makes sense to use a technology like AI ""that doesn't get tired or overwhelmed with too much data.""
That all sounds good -- if you believe AI can really bring it all home. Brian Sommer, founder of analyst firm TechVentive, was not familiar with the new Kronos AI announcement, but he has looked hard at AI in HR and is skeptical -- at least at this point.



It's not like they're going to go on their breaks and get on a mobile phone for a coaching session.

""We're really, really in the early stages of AI and ML [machine learning] in this space,"" he said. Describing AI as a shiny toy most companies lack the expertise or staff to make work, Sommer doesn't buy the idea that AI can predict turnover, which is a particularly tough problem to solve when it comes to hourly workers.
""We're relying on the correlations where we've seen the pattern before,"" he said. ""An employee has used up all vacation time or starts having more erratic time clock activity or has cashed in stock options. The problem is there is no agreement among firms about what are the correct indicators and no two firms use the same indicators to calculate the [flight risk] score.""
Although Jones vehemently disagrees with this perspective -- ""It's the easiest thing ever to create an algorithm to predict flight risk"" -- she does think the debate is meaningless for most hourly workers. ""They'll change jobs right away if they can get [a small raise] somewhere else,"" she said.


Hourly worker priority: Steady schedule and pay
Trevor White, an analyst at Nucleus Research, goes even further. He thinks the Kronos AI platform is looking to solve a problem that simply does not exist.
""I'm not sure how much the stuff around coaching is really going to make a difference,"" he said.
Nucleus has interviewed hourly workers, he said, and found their priorities are a fixed schedule and a steady paycheck. Anything outside of that doesn't matter, he asserted.
""It's not like they're going to go on their breaks and get on a mobile phone for a coaching session.""
Hiring and employee retention are hard in every single segment of the market today, but for companies fuelled by hourly workers, the challenges are greater and the risks of failure are no doubt higher.
AI feels like a no-brainer for shift swaps and scheduling, but like some of the experts, I need more convincing about how coaching on the go can improve an hourly worker's loyalty or job satisfaction. And I'm still wondering how many hourly jobs AI-powered robots might eventually replace.

I used to be a grower, and over the years, I have met several master growers who could tell a lot about their crop with a single glance. I know growers who can smell spider mites or powdery mildew on their tomatoes. These incredible individuals have amazing abilities that they mastered over the years. Yet all of them are facing a big problem these days: We can’t be everywhere at once.Advertisement
Greenhouses are getting bigger, and we simply cannot walk the entire crop anymore. Even on bicycles and scooters, one can only visit a small fraction of the greenhouse.
We also invest in multiple sensors. From climate, light level, water pH, and temperature, we constantly measure conditions in our greenhouses. As new sensors become available to us, we gain new insight about our crops and can make better decisions. We use automation and robotics to streamline repetitive tasks that require consistency and speed.
While the influx of data from multiple sources can be empowering, it can also be overwhelming for growers who suddenly get too much information about their operation. In the same way that we can’t walk through several acres of plants every day, we can’t look at several terrabytes of data and make sense of them on a daily basis. We need actionable intelligence, and that is why we need artificial intelligence (AI) in greenhouses.

By now, you probably have already formed an opinion about AI. Some might think of AI and robots as evil tools that will lead us to our doomsday, and some might think of them as the silver bullet that can finally fix all our problems. I think both views are extreme and are propagated by a growing number of sensor companies who use AI terminology to describe their technologies. To properly embrace AI in our industry, we need to demystify it first.
Three Principles of Artificial Intelligence
1. Machine learning and robotics will be used to automate repetitive tasks, and this will result in loss of certain types of jobs. But this is not new. Fruit sorting machines took the job of many human sorters, but we still have people in packinghouses who do different jobs. We still need humans in the loop.
2. Machine learning and AI algorithms can be trained to do certain tasks faster and better than humans. Yet the training requires significant investment of time and resources. You need to make sure the signals on which you want to train the algorithms are strong and not mixed with a high level of noise. The choice of sensor and what you measure is important, but more so is the role of the human providing the labels to train the machine. If the quality of the labeled data is low, the predictive model cannot perform well.
3. To build AI, a significantly large amount of data must be collected. The question is, who will own this data? There are companies who provide free sensors, cameras, and services to growers just so they can collect and own the data. I agree that the data can inform high-level decisions and has value, but I also believe the grower should be the owner and should decide if, when, and with whom they want to share their data.
Having said that, I believe we need to share data related to symptoms of pests and diseases. This data should not contain any information about specific farms or locations. It should be like a guide for pests of greenhouses that contains color pictures of infested plants. We should create a digital library of crop stress symptoms and allow everyone to access it and contribute data to it.
When it comes to AI systems, the business intelligence and data related to methods of growing should be kept in the hands of the grower because the industry is competitive, but there is a benefit to sharing data about pests and diseases that affects all of us. The ownership of data and what to keep and what to share needs careful consideration.

With the automation it brings to almost every aspect of our life, we see it creeping into our mobile phones, our devices connected over IoT and websites, Artificial Intelligence has become a way of living.The major breakthroughs that our generation has witnessed are in the service industry where the Chat representatives have been replaced by chatbots. This is just the tip of the iceberg. The customer service industry is very excited to put the advantages of AI powered solutions to use. Not only is it reducing the human effort, but it is also bringing in more accuracy and precision in services fueled by an ecosystem driven by innovative mobile app developers. A lot of customer service representative’s job is repetitive, mundane and has a pattern which makes it easy for the AI scientists to develop algorithms that fit in the space well.Before we go to the actual use cases let us understand what segments of AI are fueling the automation in the service industry:MACHINE LEARNINGMachine learning is an aspect of AI that makes a computer learn, just like a human. A large amount of training data is fed to an algorithm which learns from this data and offers its predictive analysis just like humans. This adds to the capabilities of AI tools to answer the queries of clients as per the training data from where it learned all it knows. > Read more:- How AI will revolutionize the mobile app developmentNATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSINGBy Natural language processing, we understand that the voice or text input by the customer is understood at a deeper level by the algorithm. Understanding the human language even at an emotional level has also been achieved by the AI using NLP.Let us know to see the practical phases of customer service where we will interact with AI in near future:SOCIAL MEDIA MESSENGER BOTBusiness has moved to social media over the last 2-3 years. This gives customers and business a direct platform to interact. But if as a customer you think it is the actual representative talking to you, you are mistaken. The current state of social media bots is driven by AI. These real-time bots offer such a personalized response to each customer query that the revenues are skyrocketing with the adaption of AI. The cognitive capability is finding its way into all aspects of customer service across multiple business verticals.QUICK AND AUTOMATED RESPONSEAI has disrupted the customer service interface as it is offering 24/7 tireless service to the customers. Business is able to garner international traction due to this capability. As efficient as these programs have become with the support of GPU advancements, the accuracy and speed of replying to queries has massively advanced and is expected to get even better. The bots, today, can identify the customer issues from the chats and have access to the previous buying patterns of the customers. The mobile app developers offer the chatbots a capability to understand the text and voice by using intelligent algorithms. SAVING TRAINING EFFORTCost of business increases when they have to invest in the training of newly hired representatives. Using chatbots tremendously decreases the dollars spent on training and monitoring activities. It also lowers the recruitment costs as building, deploying and training the chatbot is a onetime activity. Although we will witness a steep downfall in the recruitment field of sales representatives who handle calls or replying to emails, we will see these representatives up-skilling and working at better positions. MULTIPLE SUPPORT CHANNELSLots of digital channels are being used for creating a business presence over a widespread digital world. As the number of channels is growing, the business is more in need of AI powered solutions that integrate the data coming in from different channels like social media, websites and offline buying to identify the buying patterns of the customers. It is bringing in the balance between the deployments of so many channels.> Also Read:- On-Demand mobile app development and the benefits it brings to any businessPREDICTIONS AND INSIGHTAmazon’s recommendation engine is a perfect tool that is promoting sales. What it does is that it makes sense out of the buyer data like the viewed products, buying products and more to identify the shopping pattern. It encourages sales by offering suggestions to buyers. The Machine learning algorithms are actually learning as the user buys and this is how it keeps up with the user’s choices and suggests relevant products only.SPEED OF SERVICEWho wants to wait in a queue to connect to a sales representative or a chat representative to get an answer to a single question? This was discouraging the buyers. With the chatbot, the websites especially e-commerce are offering zero wait time and quick resolution of queries. It offers a tremendous potential of enhanced customer services that is directly linked with the reputation of the brand.RELIABILITY AND PERSONALIZATIONAs AI algorithms are becoming more precise, the reliability and personalization are on the rise as the mobile app developer is focusing on the same. The customers have adapted to the way chatbots interact with them and are not bothered that they are talking to the AI powered algorithms. The intelligent bots are surmounting the standards of customer service as it eliminates the bias and any kind of language barriers.CONCLUSIONAI powered chatbots are bringing an element of intelligence to the future of customer service industry. As the technology is advancing, the innovation in the chatbots is also skyrocketing. The organizations are laying more focus on offering better support to its buyers using artificial intelligence algorithms. All this capability if render to an App by a mobile app developer by training the AI engine. A lot of research is going into finding the right balance between technology and human interaction skills. The deeper understanding is customer behavior is being done based on the data generated on social media, websites, Apps and more. This data is being used by the AI engineers to train the algorithms that can function as chatbots to offer intelligent customer support.The personalization AI brings in is not humanly possible. At the minimum costs, AI supported chatbots in every business segment are helping the business grow with speed and efficiency.At its innovative best, the AI developers are working to improvise the customer service industry in an entirely new light.",,

said Kaidi Cao, a graduate student at Stanford University in the US..&quot;While existing style transfer methods have focused mainly on appearance style, our technique achieves both geometric exaggeration and appearance stylisation involved in caricature drawing,&quot; said Cao, who conducted the work during his internship at Microsoft..The method enables users to automate caricatures of portraits and can be applied to tasks such as creating caricatured avatars for social media and designing cartoon characters..The technique also has potential applications in marketing, advertising and journalism..The researchers turned to a well-known technique in machine learning, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), for unpaired photo-to-caricature translation to generate caricatures that preserve the identity of the portrait..Called 'CariGANs', the computational framework precisely models geometric exaggeration in photos (shapes of faces, specific angles) and appearance stylization (look, feel, pencil strokes, shadowing) via two algorithms the researchers have labelled, CariGeoGAN and CariStyGAN..CariGeoGAN only models the geometry-to-geometry mapping from face photos to caricatures and CariStyGAN transfers the style appearance from caricatures to face photos without any deformation to the geometry of the original image..The two networks are separately trained for each task so that the learning procedure is more robust, notes the researchers..The CariGANs framework enables users to control the exaggeration degree in geometric and appearance style by dragging slides or giving an example caricature..Researchers conducted perceptual studies to evaluate their framework's ability to generate caricatures of portraits that are easily recognisable and not overly distorted in shape and appearance style..They demonstrated, through several examples, that existing methods resulted in unrecognisable caricature translation..Their method successfully generated clearer, more accurate caricature depictions of portrait photos, as if they were hand drawn by a professional artist..Currently, the focus of this work has centred on caricatures of people, primarily headshots or portraits..In future work, the researchers intend to explore beyond facial caricature generation into the full body or more complex scenes..They are also interested in designing improved human-computer interaction (HCI) systems that would give users more freedom and user control on the machine learning-generated results..Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest",https://media.assettype.com/TNIE/import/2018/11/20/original/abraham_lincoln.JPG?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true,2018-11-20T16:11:00Z

But even now 140,000 jobs are vacant in the IT segment due to underskilled graduates who aren’t ‘job ready’ flooding the market.Emerging technology like cybersecurity and the Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to add 1.4 million new IT jobs in India by 2027 according to ‘The 20 Most Significant IT Roles You Should Consider in India’ report by Cisco and the International Data Corporation. While employment opportunities may be aplenty 140,000 jobs lie vacant in artificial intelligence and big data analytics as of now according to a Nasscom report that came out in July. A 1.4 million increase in jobs would mean a 46% in growth in employment opportunities driven by digital transformation according to IANS. Leading the digital industry will the demand for professionals will skills in cloud solutions, followed by data analysis and big data. Supply-demand mismatchThe Cisco-led report highlights that demand for these roles will be all the more paramount since there’s a shortage of available IT professionals with the required skill sets. Since IT organisations may find these roles hard to fill, it’s possible they may choose to implement in-house programs to train their existing employees.Moreover, the availability of these jobs will determine how and where people work, especially taking into account India’s demographic dividend. Nasscom’s report in July highlighted that while there may be a demand of IT professionals, there’s a link between the low employability rate of India’s engineering graduates and the fact their skills are currently inadequate when it comes to actual application. Basically, IT graduates may have the degree but they’re nowhere near job ready.With the upcoming opportunities, it seems imperative that the $167 billion Indian IT industry needs to invest in re-skilling their employees in order to fully capitalise on new technologies. The list of ‘Most Significant IT Roles’ is the culmination of surveying the most ‘in-demand’ positions and the ones that will play the ‘most important’ roles in the coming future. The global survey examined 2 million IT job postings and came up with a list of 20 specific IT roles that it deems to be the most significant.See also:Potential for India’s workforce lies in digital transformation: ReportIT whirlwind has impacted mid-level employees the most — here’s howTamil Nadu is building a union of Tech professionals",https://www.businessinsider.in/thumb.cms?msid=66651916&width=1200&height=900,
