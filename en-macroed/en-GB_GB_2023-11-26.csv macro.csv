The dawn of generative AI has only increased the urgency to equip employees with skills for the future,N/A,N/A,N/A,"

Generative AI may have quickly become a key part of the business lexicon over the last year, but for many business leaders, a key question remains: how can they use it to their organisation’s advantage? Getting a handle on new technology and finding the right talent to utilise it is a predicament many organisations continue to encounter in today’s rapidly evolving digital age. 
“Five years ago, bringing in technical talent to historically non-technical parts of the organisation, such as HR or marketing, wasn’t even part of the conversation,” says Maureen Lonergan, vice president of AWS Training and Certification. “The pandemic accelerated digitisation across industries, with cloud powering more and more areas of the business. The roles of the chief human resources officer (CHRO) and learning and development leaders have become increasingly challenging as a result. There simply isn’t enough skilled technical talent available right now. The biggest challenge we hear is: ‘How do I recruit and retain talent?’”
Beyond recruitment
“The reality is you won’t be able to recruit your way through this current skills gap,” says Lonergan. HR and talent leaders must therefore prioritise learning and development for in-house talent if they are to succeed. This is especially true as technology becomes more complex and use cases become more specific to individual businesses. While basic tech skills or an understanding of specific software are often only a minimum requirement for many job roles, organisations must reconcile with the fact that employees need upskilling to make effective use of layered and unique technology stacks that are quickly growing in complexity. 
The reality is you won’t be able to recruit your way through this current skills gap
Digital upskilling is no longer about technical staff gatekeeping all of the knowledge around technology within the organisation. Everyone from the CEO down to the sales team needs to have a strong foundation of digital skills and an understanding of how technology fits into their role. The most innovative organisations will recognise this and ensure they bring their people on the journey with them whenever they go through any kind of digital transformation. “Investing in the skills of your people will always be the most strategic and valuable business lever you have,” says Lonergan.
Generative AI upskilling for everyone 
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the emerging area of generative AI, which is further democratising a technology that was once reserved for specialists. 
Business leaders need to stay on top of developments and understand how generative AI can benefit their organisation if they are to remain competitive. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023, more than 75% of organisations plan to adopt technologies such as big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence over the next five years. “Generative AI is not only here to stay, but it is the fastest evolving technology I have ever seen. Organisations and individuals must take steps now to hone their knowledge in this area,” says Lonergan. 





The accessibility of generative AI is both a challenge and an opportunity. On the one hand, its abilities and easy access have the potential to enhance productivity and innovation at all levels. On the other hand, this means that it can be tricky to control the use of the technology. Both technical and non-technical leaders need to quickly build an understanding of how generative AI could and should be used within the organisation, putting the right guidelines and guardrails in place to avoid any mishaps. For example, a lack of understanding of the hallucinations and biases that AI-powered technology can produce may lead to employees trusting false information or staff could be inputting sensitive data into public platforms without realising the risk.
While the learning curve might not be steep for every role, business leaders need to take a swift and proactive approach to training if they hope to keep pace with the march of both technology and their competitors. Short courses and training programmes can go a long way in helping organisations prepare their staff for the future. For example, AWS Training and Certification offers simple, accessible training courses in generative AI and cloud for both technical and non-technical leadership roles, many of which are free.
Technical training 
It’s also vital that organisations consider generative AI-adjacent skills. For example, cloud skills and data skills will be crucial to providing the foundations for the technology. And while there is a level of upskilling that needs to happen across all roles in the business, naturally a more complex technology stack is going to require more specific technical expertise too. Integrating AI and machine learning workloads, for example, necessitates a skilled and diverse team of professionals. 
As well as offering accessible courses for non-technical professionals, AWS offers training for technical roles and provides access to generative AI services. These services can be tailored to an organisation’s business needs and talent, making this emerging technology available to customers of any size and developers of all skill levels. For example, businesses can choose options ranging from services with built-in generative AI that don’t require specific expertise right up to building their own foundation models. Of course, to make such decisions, leadership needs to have a basic understanding of the skill levels within their organisations and what business use cases they want to use the technology for. Completing their own basic training in the technology can help here.
Building a case for training investment
“HR leaders have made it a goal, if not their top goal, to align learning programmes to the business strategies of the organisation,” says Lonergan. 
Putting together a case for training is therefore about ROI. What will the business gain from upskilling staff in emerging technologies across the board? “Organisations and individuals who invest in skills training are better equipped to keep pace with innovation, and this may be even more true with generative AI,” explains Lonergan. 




Leaders who invest in training talent are likely to see a huge payoff in productivity, helping increase business efficiency and innovation opportunities. According to recent research from Access Partnership, employers believe that AI could boost productivity by 47%, with large organisations expecting a 49% boost. Meanwhile, employees expect AI to boost their productivity too, with 41% saying that it could help them complete tasks more efficiently. 
To confidently lead their companies into the future, executives need to brush up their own skills and invest in optimising the skills of their workforce. AWS offers more than 100 courses and learning resources on AI and machine learning through AWS Skill Builder and AWS Educate. Business resilience starts with people and now is the perfect time for organisations to start taking learning seriously.

AI has long been used in the legal profession, despite this being a sector that traditionally resists digitalization and change.
However, the advent of generative AI is now taking this technology to a new level. For the first time, we have a tool that generates content and language on its own and can perform sophisticated writing and research tasks in a way that previously required highly skilled people. The implications for the sector could be massive.Related Company ProfilesAllen & Overy LLPView all
AI-based applications are fairly established in the legal profession
AI is widely used within the legal profession to automate repetitive and manual processes. Some applications of AI include reviewing contracts more quickly and consistently to spot errors, assisting with legal research to find key information—for example, legal precedents—or using chatbots to answer legal questions from clients wherever this is possible.
Efficiency and accuracy improvements are the main benefits: for instance, one of the most time-consuming tasks is litigation, which involves extracting the meaning and most relevant information from an enormous set of documents produced during discovery. This can be vastly accelerated, with AI doing work in seconds that might otherwise take weeks.
Now generative AI is poised to radically transform legal work
Generative AI can perform several tasks performed by lawyers. When it comes to creating a contract for the sale of a piece of property, lawyers could simply provide generative AI with the names of the buyer and seller, the price of the property, and any special provisions. Generative AI can also provide lawyers with a natural language interface for their existing legal workflows to answer specific questions, such as whether a clause in a lease violates any laws in a specific jurisdiction and rewrite it so it is no longer in violation.
Generative AI brings data analytics to a new level, allowing users to interact with data through text-based questions—for example, to understand a company’s financial and operational data as part of the due diligence on the company.

Generative AI promises to transform old concepts in legal practice such as the traditional billable hour. If lawyers can perform high-quality work faster, they can spend more time on the high-value parts of their job, like focusing and engaging with clients.
Some law firms are embracing AI but there is caution
Some early adopters of generative AI among law firms include Allen & Overy, which has been one of the first to introduce the Harvey AI chatbot for use in active cases, and DLA Piper, which uses the GPT-4-powered legal assistant CoCounsel.
However, a 2023 Survey sponsored by the Thomas Reuters Institute suggests that there is a degree of caution among law firms in adopting generative AI: only 51% believed that it should be used in legal work, while 62% of respondents—which included 80% of partners and managing partners—had concerns of using ChatGPT and generative AI at work. The difference suggests that legal professionals see the potential of using generative AI but are unsure if they can trust the tools, which is a concern shared by businesses across different industries.
The cautious attitude is more than justified, as several risks come with the technology that can be especially damaging when used in legal settings, such as hallucinations, inaccuracies, and bias creeping into the model.
Training and new skills will be needed, including how to choose the right AI tool for a particular task, how to construct the right queries, and how to evaluate the accuracy and quality of the responses. Ultimately, AI cannot fully weigh the factors that go into the many strategic decisions and it cannot replace the human element of relationships with clients.

Organizations large and small are focusing on how to integrate some level of Generative AI into their work. This has triggered a wide range of reactions. Some (including high-profile insiders) warn of potential doom. Others worry about more-basic matters: their jobs.


All of the above is reflected in the results of a new global survey conducted by a Boston Consulting Group team from October 6-30. The survey team (Katherine Rivet, Gabrielle Novacek, Jean Lee, Gretchen May, Hillary Wool and Christopher Gentile) asked more than 11,000 employees from the United States, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Australia, Japan, and India—ranging from executives and senior managers to clerical workers—how they feel about the use of Generative AI at work. Some very interesting findings emerged:

1. Those who use artificial intelligence and/or Generative AI technology at work trust it far more than those who don’t. 

Among the non-management respondents who do not yet use Generative AI at work, only 12% agreed with the statement, “I trust AI/Generative AI.” Among non-management users of AI/Generative AI the percentage expressing trust in the technology was three times higher (37%).

PROMOTED
For senior managers and executives, the ratios were similar, with 21% of the senior managers and 22% of executives who don’t use AI/GenAI technology expressing trust and 64% and 71%, respectively, of AI/GenAI users expressing trust—meaning that more-senior organizational leaders, AI users and non-users alike, are far-more trusting of the technology than lower-level employees.
One might infer from this that the best way to manage the integration of AI and Generative AI into an organization is, simply, to get more people to use it. Cue up the AI/GenAI tutorials, upskilling clinics and academies, right?

Well ... not so fast. Familiarity, in this case, breeds anxiety.
2.  A significant percentage of employees see AI and Generative AI technology as a threat to their jobs, with the highest percentages among those who already use the technology.

Among non-management respondents who don’t currently use AI at work, 37% agreed with the statement, “I worry about AI tools being used to automate much of what I do.” Among those who do use AI, the number was slightly higher, 41%.

The anxiety levels were lower among senior managers and executives who don’t use AI technology (32% in both categories), but significantly higher among AI users—with 51% of senior managers and 54% of executives expressing worry that AI could replace them. That means executives who have used AI are nearly 70% more fearful of being replaced by technology than their peers who haven’t personally witnessed what GenAI can do.
So, here’s the paradox: The more that employees use Generative AI the more they both trust it and fear it—with the trust and fear most pronounced among senior employees.
For employees, perception is reality, so the findings drive home why it’s critical for leaders to think carefully about employees’ concerns about AI and GenAI impacting their jobs and careers. In fact, employers need to do more than think: They need to internalize the potential threat and communicate a clear and unambiguous response.
Here are a few thoughts on how to help your colleagues and employees see the plus side of AI:
Explain how AI and Generative AI can help reduce the joyless tasks that people hate. This will give them more time to spend on the collaborative, innovative and enjoyable parts of work. GenAI can speed up, streamline and help reduce the tedium of many boring, repetitive, mindless, but necessary tasks. Use it. Another recent survey, by the BCG Henderson Institute, showed that office workers spend an average of 25% of their time on administrative drudge work. That is more than a full day every week on soul-sucking administrivia. Now, that is something to GenAI-ify!
Explain how Generative AI can become your silent “partner,” helping you perform better and advance faster. Francois Candelon, the Paris-based global director of the Henderson Institute, found in a recent study that Generative AI enabled below-average employees to boost their performance level— especially on creative blue-sky tasks. So, encourage employees to embrace AI and GenAI and use it as a lever for future success.
Offer employees a deal they can’t refuse: Help us use GenAI to rethink our organization and your job and, together, we’ll create an even better job for you. Every organization’s top talent knows that new and different roles will be required if the organization hopes to thrive in a future heavily influenced, if not driven, by AI and GenAI. So, be deliberate in your intent and engage with them on figuring out the best path forward.
The key take-away is this: Before you charge ahead with introducing Generative AI into your work processes, think carefully about how people will view the new technology and the impact it could have on their careers and livelihoods. Prepare them for the career implications, the reskilling requirements, the talent flexibility and, better yet, get them directly involved, working with peers to drive the change for themselves.
Doing so will help you and your talent move from distrust to fearless GenAI enthusiasts.

Additionally, Ángel Melguizo, UNESCO's advisor for AI and ethics and business council coordinator, contributed closing remarks.This post aims to summarize the key points and insights from these industry leaders. Thumbnail         play_arrow UNESCO MontevideoJorge Cella from Microsoft highlighted the evolution and the democratization of AI technology, emphasizing the increased accessibility of computational power and AI tools, contrasting it with the past exclusivity of supercomputers. He underscored the importance of critical thinking in effectively utilizing generative AI, noting that although AI provides statistically probable answers, its effectiveness hinges on the user's ability to ask the right questions and interpret results. Cella also reassured that AI, especially generative AI, would augment rather than replace human roles, enhancing productivity across various professions. Cella illustrated how AI could augment professions like teaching and software development, enhancing productivity and effectiveness – according to some analysis, generative AI can potentially augment teachers’ skills and productivity by 45%. How? By supporting the preparation of lesson planning, curriculum development, and literacy tutorials, for example. By using Co-pilot, for a junior developer, this technology may increase productivity by 20-30%, and for a senior developer, it can actually improve it by 50 - 60%. However, they would still need to know how to code to use it properly. In summary. AI can and is going to help us, but workers have to be prepared. Natalia Mata from Telefónica emphasized the need for upskilling and reskilling in organizations during the AI transformation. She identified adaptability, ethics, and a culture of lifelong learning as the critical values in this shift. Mata described Telefónica’s initiatives to promote the adaptation for the future of work, which include employee training and societal actions focused on the common good and employability. She emphasized Telefónica Foundation's employment map, which analyzes job offers in real-time to identify the most in-demand professions and digital skills across different countries. Complementing this map, a virtual assistant offers personalized guidance to users. In summary, Natalia highlighted that the key message is that Telefónica, through insights gained from its internal projects, is actively providing both its clients and the broader public with effective solutions for embracing AI. By doing so, Telefonica is fostering the development of new skills within and beyond the company, essential for navigating the dynamic era of AI we are currently experiencing. Mojca Cargo from GSMA mentioned the role of GSMA in representing the interest of mobile operators globally and beginning together all of the operators regardless of emerging or developing countries. She highlighted that GSMA founded AI for Impact in 2017 in order to bring together Partners from both the private and public sectors, to commercially scale responsible AI for a better future. GSMA's efforts are to build frameworks for responsible AI and facilitate AI use cases in collaboration with a global task force. Cargo highlighted GSMA's commitment to capacity building, offering extensive training courses to policymakers and regulators, underscoring the significance of reskilling and upskilling in adapting to AI-driven changes in the workplace. GSMA has successfully conducted over 13,000 training days, benefiting more than 100 participants from over 160 countries, achieving a satisfaction rate of over 90%. These courses focus on real-world examples to help understand the impact of various policies and regulatory approaches on the implementation of emerging technologies.Discussion on Upskilling and ReskillingThe panelists discussed best practices for creating inclusive programs for upskilling and reskilling and the responsibility of various stakeholders in their implementation. GSMA's Approach: Through the “Mobile for Development” team, GSMA works with developing countries to reduce inequalities by driving innovation in digital technology. They emphasized working with small and medium-sized enterprises and supporting entrepreneurs by connecting them with big techs. They work in different components, everything from capacity-building workshops, training, and innovation funds, among others, to support the ""last mile."" Telefónica's Strategy: Telefónica highlighted the importance of assessing skills gaps for each community and employee to prepare training programs according to the real demands and needs. She also mentioned that is critical to take into account accessibility, diversity, and inclusion aspects in training programs to consider the unrepresented groups. Microsoft's Initiative: Microsoft Philanthropies targets vulnerable populations, aiming to transform people’s potential into productivity with technology, democratizing access to generative AI. The webinar underscored the transformative impact of generative AI on the workforce, highlighting the need for upskilling and reskilling. The insights from Microsoft, Telefónica, and GSMA, combined with UNESCO's vision, emphasize the importance of adaptability, ethical considerations, critical thinking, and lifelong learning. The discussions underscored that while AI is set to revolutionize the job market, it is not a replacement for human skills but a tool to augment them. The key takeaway is the collective responsibility of governments, private sectors, academia, and individuals to embrace this change is needed to ensure that AI serves as a tool for enhancement rather than displacement, fostering a future where technology and human capabilities coexist to create a more dynamic and inclusive workforce.Share                             Copied to clipboard Related itemsArtificial intelligenceSharing knowledgeUN ＆ International cooperationBusiness economicsBusiness managementWork environmentWorkersWorking conditionsWorking lifeEthicsEthics of artificial intelligenceEthics of technologyTopics: AI Business CouncilRegion: Latin America and the CaribbeanUNESCO Office in Montevideo and Regional Bureau for ScienceSee moreaddMore on this subject   Event Sixth International Conference on Learning Cities3 December 2024 - 5 December 2024     Event Global Network of Learning Cities webinar ‘Shifting paradigms: fostering sustainable lifestyles and rethinking our relationship with nature’20 November 2024     Event 3rd Youth Forum of the IberoMAB Network2 November 2024 - 7 November 2024     Event Global Media and Information Literacy Week Feature Conference 202430 October 2024 - 31 October 2024  Other recent news   News Stakeholders convene for a high-level meeting on the Impacts of Uranium Mining in the Stampriet Transboundary Aquifer System23 July 2024     News UNESCO supports Rwanda Development Board on digital transformation19 July 2024     News UNESCO Dakar supports The Gambia’s National Human Rights Commission to Conduct Premier Nation-wide Research on Hate Speech18 July 2024     News UNESCO to host multilateral science forum in Yaounde for presentations of research works in tropical skin sciences18 July 2024   ",https://schema.org,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'Skills for a Generative AI Future of Work: Insights and Strategies', 'description': ""The fourth webinar, organized by UNESCO's Business Council on Artificial Intelligence and Ethics, was held on September 25, 2023."", 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'representativeOfPage': 'True', 'url': 'https://articles.unesco.org/sites/default/files/2023-11/Industry%20engineer%20in%20factory%2Cusing%20smart%20tablet%20artificial%20intelligence%20AdobeStock%20WEB.jpg', 'width': '2000', 'height': '1143'}, 'datePublished': '2023-11-27T16:57:19+0100', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'True', 'dateModified': '2023-11-27T16:57:19+0100', 'mainEntityOfPage': 'https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/skills-generative-ai-future-work-insights-and-strategies'}, {'@type': 'Event', 'eventAttendanceMode': 'MixedEventAttendanceMode', 'description': ""The fourth webinar, organized by UNESCO's Business Council on Artificial Intelligence and Ethics, was held on September 25, 2023."", 'location': {'@type': 'Place', 'address': {'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': ''}}}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Workers in London and the South East are the most likely to have their jobs threatened by AI, according to a new report from the Department for Education.The research, published on 28 November 2023, found that  between 10% and 30% of jobs can be automated by the use of AI, with the insurance and finance sectors likely to be hardest hit. Other sectors likely to be strongly affected include information and communication; professional, scientific and technical; property; public administration and defence; and education.""Professional occupations are more exposed to AI, particularly those associated with more clerical work and across finance, law and business management roles,"" reads the report. ""This includes management consultants and business analysts; accountants; and psychologists."" LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProIn general, it's the workers with the highest levels of achievement whose jobs are most vulnerable: Those with a degree are likely to be more affected than those who just have A levels.People in building and construction, manufacturing technologies, and transportation operations and maintenance are the least exposed, thanks to doing manual work that is technically difficult, in unpredictable environments, and with lower wages, reducing the incentive to automate.Meanwhile, the professional occupations least exposed to AI are veterinarians, medical radiographers, dental practitioners, physiotherapists and senior police officers, says the report. Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Each geographical area covers a large population and a lot of overlap in the types of jobs, so we would expect to see more variation in exposure to AI when looking at smaller areas where the job markets will differ more.""The report supports previous research indicating a sea-change is coming, with a recent Goldman Sachs report indicating that as many as 18% of jobs could be affected by AI and that workers in advanced economies would fare the worst. Up to 300 million jobs could be lost worldwide, it says.Already, companies including BT and IBM have announced that they expect to make wide-ranging layoffs, with thousands of jobs to be replaced by AI. It's not all bad news, however, with the Department for Education research indicating that new jobs could start to appear as others decline. ""A consensus has begun to emerge that 10-30% of jobs in the UK are highly automatable and could be subject to some level of automation over the next two decades,"" reads the report. ""However, the overall net effect on employment is unclear, but it is often assumed that there will be a broadly neutral long-term effect and job displacement will be matched by job creation.""

AI and data science are two very popular buzz words in IT, and for good reason. They’re two sets of technologies that often work hand in hand to boost business insights and productivity. But they have their differences in use cases. Data science is a field of study that examines large data sets with various analytics methods -- including machine learning and pattern discovery -- to extract valuable business insights, while AI refers to a computer’s ability to understand, learn from, and make decisions based on data like humans.

Large language models (LLMs) seem set to transform businesses. Their ability to generate detailed, creative responses to queries in plain language and code has sparked a wave of excitement that led ChatGPT to reach 100 million users faster than any other technology after it first launched. Subsequently, investors poured over $40 billion into artificial intelligence startups in the first half of 2023 — more than 20% of all global venture capital investments — and companies from seed-stage startups to tech giants are developing new applications of the technology.
But while LLMs are incredibly powerful, their ability to generate humanlike text can invite us to falsely credit them with other human capabilities, leading to misapplications of the technology. With a deeper understanding of how LLMs work and their fundamental limitations, managers can make more informed decisions about how LLMs are used in their organizations, addressing their shortcomings with a mix of complementary technologies and human governance.

The Mechanics of LLMs
An LLM is fundamentally a machine learning model designed to predict the next element in a sequence of words. Earlier, more rudimentary language models operated sequentially, drawing from a probability distribution of words within their training data to predict the next word in a sequence. (Think of your smartphone keyboard suggesting the next word in a text message.) However, these models lack the ability to consider the larger context in which a word appears and its multiple meanings and associations.
The advent of the latest neural network architecture — transformers — marked a significant evolution toward modern LLMs. Transformers allow neural networks to process large chunks of text simultaneously in order to establish stronger relationships between words and the context in which they appear. Training these transformers on increasingly enormous volumes of text has led to a leap in sophistication that enables LLMs to generate humanlike responses to prompts.
This ability of LLMs hinges on several critical factors, including the model’s size, denoted by the number of the trainable weights (known as parameters), the quality and volume of the training data (defined by number of tokens, referring to word or subword units), and the maximum size of input the model can accept as a prompt (known as its context window size). Every parameter in a model encapsulates some information about a relationship extrapolated from the training data, so a model with a larger number of parameters tends to be more knowledgeable and nuanced. (OpenAI’s GPT-3, for example, has 175 billion parameters.) The volume of the training data also significantly influences the model’s ability to generalize, with larger data sets offering more diverse representations of semantic relationships and facts. (GPT-3 was trained on approximately half a trillion tokens.) The size of the prompt that the model can accept also plays a role in its accuracy. (GPT-3 has a context window of 2,000 tokens.) The more detailed the context, the more accurate the model’s prediction is.
In response to a prompt, the LLM draws on the relationships established by its training to generate a continuation of the text, token by token. Each step entails forecasting the probabilities of the next token based on the context provided, and the algorithm selects the token based on these probabilities. The degree of randomness in this selection is modulated by the model’s temperature setting. Higher temperatures produce more “creative,” or unlikely, selections, whereas lower temperatures produce more predictable responses. To improve the accuracy of an LLM’s responses to specific prompts and limit its ability to produce inappropriate, irrelevant, or toxic responses, pretrained models can be fine-tuned through techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback, or RLHF, which has been employed to fine-tune models like ChatGPT.

Based on this understanding of how LLMs work, we can examine the false impressions they might create as we apply our human intuition to seemingly human output.
1. Limitations of Reasoning
Prompt: According to the cabbage-growers’ union report for 2007, 80% of cabbages collected were heavy (over 0.5 kg), 10% of cabbages were green, 60% were red, and 50% were big (having a diameter of over 10 cm). Which of the following statements must be false?

All red cabbages weren’t big.
30% of red cabbages were big.
There were no cabbages that were both green and big.
Half of the cabbages were small.

LLM response: The statement that must be false is 4. Half of the cabbages were small.
The correct answer would be that Statement 1 is false — at least some red cabbages must have been big.
Contrary to the impression they might create, LLMs are not built for complex reasoning. For example, studies have found that GPT-4, OpenAI’s most advanced LLM, could correctly verify a number as prime in only 2.4% of cases, with similar weaknesses in the prediction of visual patterns. Other research has shown that LLMs fail to understand relationships between words in the training data set: For example, GPT-4 can correctly answer the question “Who is Tom Cruise’s mother?” (Mary Lee Pfeiffer) but cannot infer the answer to “Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer’s son?” — with the model correctly answering questions like the former 79% of the time, compared with 33% for the latter.
Essentially, LLMs learn only to verbally simulate elementary logical rules but do not possess the skills to chain them together for producing and verifying complex conclusions. Moreover, LLMs are prone to error accumulation in multistep logical reasoning because the model’s fundamentally probabilistic nature means that every step has a nonzero chance of an error. Finally, LLMs cannot always outline the “chain of thought” that led to a conclusion, making it difficult for humans to determine whether or where an error occurred.

A recent field experiment conducted with more than 750 Boston Consulting Group consultants highlighted the real-life implications of this limitation. Participants using GPT-4 when trying to solve a simple business problem got the answer wrong 23% more often than the control group that did not have access to an LLM — because GPT-4 not only often got the answer wrong but provided such a persuasive rationale for its solution that users accepted it at face value.









2. Limitations of Knowledge or Expertise
We asked an LLM to provide us with five papers in peer-reviewed academic journals on the feasibility of nuclear fusion, with paper titles, the year of publication, and the names of the main authors. The LLM returned five results, of which two were news articles, not peer-reviewed papers, and one was a paper that does not exist.
The knowledge of an LLM is dictated by its training data. If the data lacks specific domain knowledge, has insufficient instances of a particular concept, or is not up to date, the LLM might fail to surface relevant knowledge in response to a prompt. Similarly, LLMs might reproduce errors present in the training data. Finally, the models could create errors by “hallucinating” statements that were not in the training data. Researchers who tasked ChatGPT with generating treatment plans for a variety of cancer cases found that one-third of the LLMs’ responses contained incorrect information — often mixed with correct indications, and plausibly articulated in a way that made it difficult for a layperson to identify what was accurate. In another high-profile example, two lawyers and their firm were fined after submitting fake citations generated by ChatGPT in a court filing: The LLM had hallucinated six legal cases, including judicial opinions and quotes.
Finally, limitations of knowledge can also lead to a lack of consistency, with LLMs responding to the same prompt asked at different points in time in contradictory manners. For example, Iowa educators used ChatGPT to determine the appropriateness of books for their school’s library to comply with a new state law. They fed the LLM a list of all of the library books and asked it to point out those that contained content that violated the law, which resulted in the removal of 19 titles from the library. However, when journalists later queried ChatGPT on those 19 titles, it suggested that only four of them contained content inconsistent with the law.
3. Limitations of Understanding
Prompt: There is an apple inside a blue box. There is also a red box inside the blue box. The red box has a lid on it. How can I get the apple?
LLM response: To retrieve the apple from the boxes, you can follow these steps:

Open the lid of the red box: Since the red box is inside the blue box and has a lid on it, you need to open the lid of the red box first.
Remove the red box from the blue box: Once the lid of the red box is open, you can take out the entire red box from the blue box.
Open the red box: After removing the red box from the blue box, you can open the red box to access its contents.
Retrieve the apple: Finally, you can reach inside the red box and take out the apple.

ChatGPT failed to understand that the apple is not inside the red box.
An LLM might not “understand” the prompt it is given. Lacking adequate context, it might falter, and its outputs might become disjointed or incoherent. Researchers analyzed ChatGPT’s responses to more than 500 human-submitted questions on the online software engineering forum Stack Overflow. They found that 52% of the model’s responses were inaccurate, with more than half of those errors resulting from ChatGPT not understanding the concept or the details of the question, or focusing on the wrong part of the problem. This means that an LLM might not even be marginally helpful when users lack sufficient knowledge of a problem to supply good prompts.
4. Limitations of Planning and Execution
LLMs can output clear step-by-step guidance for a requested task, creating the impression that the model can plan practical solutions. But given LLMs’ limited reasoning ability and limited understanding of tasks, suggested actions can be impractical or naive. For example, when asked to create a plan for saving toward home ownership, ChatGPT provided some generally solid financial advice but did not account for potential changes in income or interest-rate shifts. Moreover, it does not consider human fallibility: It neither questions the realism of goals nor the user’s belief to be aware of their exact spending habits.
For businesses, all of these limitations can undermine reliability; one cannot be sure that information provided by an LLM is complete, relevant, feasible, or true. Given these limitations, LLMs certainly cannot be counted on to make critical decisions or execute plans autonomously. However, delegating mundane tasks might still seem appealing — for example, those involving programmatic interactions with existing IT services, like web browsing and scraping, or social media monitoring and messaging. Indeed, Auto-GPT — an open-source application powered by GPT-4 that chains together LLM outputs to autonomously execute user-set goals — has allowed enthusiasts to create a number of impressive automation demonstrations, including conducting research on products, coding web pages or apps, and even ordering pizza. However, AI researcher Jim Fan suggested that the working demos are “heavily cherry-picked” — with research on autonomous agents indicating that, in realistic environments, they achieve success rates of only around 10%.
Overcoming the Limitations
Rather than simply restricting applications of LLMs to routine cases where their limitations do not apply or mistakes are not critical (such as generating new product ideas for further consideration), businesses should design all of their implementations with the limitations in mind — by complementing them with human oversight and other technologies.
Keeping humans in the loop is critical as businesses integrate LLMs into their operations. This should include validation of AI-generated outputs in order to enhance the confidence placed in the technology. It could also be extended to having experts translate business problems into prompts for the AI, and ensuring that the information provided by the model is adequate by appropriately tailoring the context and nuance fed to it.
Beyond thinking about how to craft the optimal system of humans and AI, businesses should also explore complementary technologies that can address the limitations of LLMs. In this fast-moving space, new innovations are being made constantly that promise to enhance the technology’s capabilities, so continuously updating your understanding is also crucial.
For example, to enhance reasoning capabilities, researchers are exploring augmenting LLMs with reasoning engines that encode domain-specific information into knowledge graphs representing relations between specialized concepts and facts. Researchers are also training specialized models to assess the logical coherence between premises in the prompt and the LLM’s output. To augment knowledge and expertise, LLMs are being trained on domain-specific databases — such as Google and DeepMind’s Med-PaLM model, which has been shown to significantly outperform general-purpose LLMs on the United States Medical Licensing exam. LLM reliability might also be improved through reinforcement learning with feedback collected from human experts. LLMs can also improve their understanding of a user’s initial prompts by being programmed to ask clarifying follow-up questions before providing an answer.

The promise of LLMs’ near-universal applicability means that businesses are right to be excited about exploring this powerful new technology. However, these models’ uncanny ability to generate humanlike text outputs can easily lead us to ascribe to them capabilities that they do not possess. A proper understanding of their limitations should guide the manner and context in which they are implemented.
Businesses should be particularly wary in areas where logical reasoning is involved, facts are important, replicability is crucial, or the stakes are high. In these situations, companies need to explore using complementary technologies that address the limitations of LLMs — such as knowledge graphs, reasoning engines, and specialized domain models — and ensure that there is appropriate human input and oversight.

Securing workers' rights in the AI revolution
 The second edition of the flagship European Employment & Social Rights Forum took place on 16-17 November, in Brussels and online. The event brought together over 2200 participants and a diverse panel of 74 speakers to discuss the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the world of work. 



The 2023 European Employment and Social Rights Forum aimed to explore how the potential of AI can be harnessed to deliver a world in which nobody is left behind, and where technological advancements do not compromise workers’ rights.
The Forum discussed the role of new legislation such as the proposed Directive on platform work and the AI Act in driving innovation while protecting workers from any negative aspects of technology.
Over 70 speakers brought their insights to the Forum, including EU and national policymakers, business leaders, social partners, civil society, and academia.
Some of the highlights included interventions by:

Christopher Pissarides, Professor of economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, co-founder and co-chair of the Institute for the Future of Work, and winner of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Economics
Stuart Russell, Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley
Nicolas Schmit, Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights
Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market
Dragoș Pîslaru, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at the European Parliament

The role of legislation in protecting European values
Workers must profit from breakthroughs such as ChatGPT, said Nicolas Schmit, European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights. An important challenge for policymakers is therefore to “establish a system where the benefits of AI are distributed fairly”.
“Setting clear rules doesn’t slow down innovation. On the contrary, it provides guidelines for investment”, underlined Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market. “Our goal is to ensure that our values are preserved and included in this AI revolution.” 
Ensuring strong social protection for workers
Speakers agreed that it is important not to fight technological advances, but to set clear rules and help workers adapt to change.
Nobel laureate in Economics Professor Christopher Pissarides argued that countries with strong social support for workers “can use AI beneficially to create good jobs and better lives”.  Countries such as “the US and China are way ahead in terms of preparedness for AI, but they dismally fail on social support. So, I would not say they create good jobs.”
“AI means changes, but not necessarily bad changes,” said Joost Korte, Director-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion at the European Commission. The crucial need is to “prevent abusive practices” and ensure that “the human remains in control”.
Shaping progressive strategies and policies
In her closing remarks, Andriana Sukova, Deputy Director-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion at the European Commission, offered reassurance that AI will change jobs, not eliminate them.
“We must keep people at the heart of AI, backed by strong social support systems. I am optimistic about the transformative power of AI if used responsibly. This Forum’s insights and proposed solutions will help shape progressive strategies and policies.”

Great power competition: who is winning the generative AI race?
Artificial Intelligence in general, and Generative AI in particular, have generated a major public discussion over the future of global competition and international leadership in the key geopolitical vector that technology represents. The competition has become a two-fold race: the race over the development of AI, and the race over the adoption thereof.
While competition is a relevant element, it does not exclude countries from cooperation. The United States and China had the greatest number of cross-country collaborations in AI publications from 2010 to 2021, although the pace of collaboration has slowed. The number of AI research collaborations between the United States and China increased roughly 4 times since 2010, and was 2.5 times greater than the collaboration totals of the next nearest country pair, the United Kingdom and China. However, the total number of US-China collaborations only increased by 2.1% from 2020 to 2021, the smallest year-over-year growth rate since 2010. Both competition and cooperation have increased in recent years, and refer to three levels: governments, private sector, and academia.
There is no segregated information on the governmental budget devoted to Generative AI with regards to AI in general. However, available data shows that the US federal government is devoting most share of funding towards decision science, computer vision and autonomy segments. In the three cases, generative AI plays an increasingly important role. The federal government has increased its budget on AI by more than $600 million year on year, up from $2.7 billion in 2021. Total spending on AI contracts has increased by nearly 2.5 times since 2017, when the US government spent $1.3 billion on artificial technology.
The recently released President Biden’s Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, which has created a landmark in the US Administration to push forward the inclusion of AI in the public sector, makes reference to generative AI. Concretely, it displays the need to protect citizens from “AI-enabled fraud and deception by establishing standards and best practices for detecting AI-generated content and authenticating official content. The Department of Commerce will develop guidance for content authentication and watermarking to clearly label AI-generated content.” However, this reference is only made once.
However, this statement aligns with the –also released on the same day– G7 Leaders’ Statement on the first-ever International Guiding Principles and a voluntary Code of Conduct. Born from the Hiroshima AI Process, Germany, Canada, the US, France, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom highlights the importance of engaging developers and agreeing on a common baseline of principles to develop AI, including generative AI. At the same time, Western countries have been focusing on generative AI further more –although still at a preliminary stage–, with the UK’s AI Safety Summit, whose theme is devoted to frontier AI risks and opportunities, including generative AI. 
Alongside these Western-centric approaches to generative AI, China has been also developing certain initiatives. In the case of China, no specific data has been publicly shown either, but the proposal for a first-of-its-kind rules governing generative AI, announced by the government in July 2023, shows the level, scope and interest of the issue. The rules, developed by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), will only apply to generative AI services that are available to the general public rather than those being developed in research institutions. Generative AI providers will need to obtain a license to operate, conduct security assessments on their product and ensure user information is secure, based on the “core values of socialism”, as acknowledged by the CAC.
Amid this scenario of nationally-led initiatives or minilateral coalitions, the United Nations has decided to take over its voice as shaper of policy discussions at the global level. In particular, the UN Secretary-General, which already launched the proposal for a Global Digital Compact to be approved during the Summit of the Future in September 2024, has set up a High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, whose two co-chairs are from Spain –an active EU member state in AI, and also the expected final Presidency to the EU Council to approve the AI Act proposal– and from Zimbabwe.
While there is less information on the governmental decisions to address generative AI, the existence of a growing market by the private sector shows the intensity and exponential growth –and, thus, competition– of this technology vertical by companies. In this realm, there is no single Chinese and US leader in generative AI. Depending on the topic, one or the other leads.
Top firms using generative AI: the US leads the way
As for top firms using generative AI, US companies are far ahead of Chinese firms and from other countries. Microsoft leads the usage of generative AI with a market capitalization of $2.442 trillion, followed by Alphabet ($1.718 trillion). The leading Chinese company is Alibaba Group ($241.97 Billion), which is on the top ten worldwide and ranks 7th.

Also, American firms also have a strong competitive advantage in the design and production of graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are a type of hardware that is the main power source for most Large Language Models (LLMs), a deep learning algorithm that can perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This provides major incentives and opportunities for innovation. There are other technologies that have strong interactions with generative AI, such as the US has a strong leverage in the cloud computing industry, which is essential for training and deploying generative AI models. 
The ranking does not disclose the transformative power of generative AI in abolishing market barriers and strong clusters that end up producing gatekeepers. Even if large companies may have access to the best technology and technologists, generative AI is a field that is growing very quickly and may put some new players on the table. Smaller competitors may be building more adaptable and, most importantly, cheaper, and more accessible open-source AI models. If this document turns out to be true, AI is also fostering a bottom-up competition from smaller AI enablers that can generate even more innovation in the US and refrain Chinese actors from leading top firms in generative AI, due to two reasons.
First, because companies based in China need to abide by a greater number of rules, wielded by the government, and with a greater amount of oversight mechanisms on which type of content flows through generative AI processes, either on political, societal or cultural issues. Second, because Chinese companies might face a similar process as it happened with the “tech crackdown” on Chinese companies since 2020. Chinese authorities initiated a regulatory storm against the country’s Big Tech firms in late 2020 out of concerns that the country’s major internet platforms were experiencing a major growth and monopolistic behaviours. It started with the limitation of Alibaba’s AntGroup IPO in the United States and was followed by a greater number of norms limiting the international expansion of companies. After three years, the Chinese government announced in 2023 its strategy to maintain the “bottom line of development security” and strengthen its “linkage effect” with international markets. This might mean that the technology crackdown is declining. However, still generative AI companies might face greater level of dynamism in the US than in China.
AI has been one of the forefronts of US-China competition, but the effects do remain limited to the competition between these two. The EU, for instance, is falling behind, as no European firm was in the ranking. Kai-fu Lee, the ex-president of Google China and prominent venture capitalist and AI expert, told Sifted that Europe is not even in the running for “bronze medal” in the AI race. He determined that Europe has none of the success factors like the US or China, due to a lack of a VC-entrepreneur ecosystem, successful consumer internet companies, social media companies, or big-sized mobile application companies that can drive artificial intelligence advancements, and a lack of governmental support to win the generative AI race.
Top countries with the most AI Patents applications: issues with generative AI, intellectual property and China’s leadership
China has the most AI patent applications, with 4,636 applications or 64.8% of all patents requested globally. The US comes in second with 1,416 AI patent applications, making up 19.8% of patent applications with offices listed, followed by the Republic of Korea, with 532 applications. In 2022, China filed 29,853 AI-related patents, up from 29,000 the previous year. Beijing has accounted for more than 40% of global AI applications over 2022, mainly due to the monetization of AI products from top tech firms like Baidu and Alibaba. Since 2017, China’s patents surpassed the US ones. However, now they represent almost double the sum of the US. Concretely, China is leading the competition in patents with Baidu and Alibaba monetizing AI products. The countries that would follow the list are Japan and South Korea with a total of 16,700 requests.

The Chinese government considers its domestic patent market a key economic sector and has been leading it since 2021, especially now with generative AI being a growing market for more patents. Last year, the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) released a draft of measures to downgrade the ratings of Chinese patent agencies that were following non-desirable and fraudulent patent schemes.
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) supports its domestic companies in generative AI, as well as in other strategic industries through subsidies. Even if there are no state-owned enterprises in the AI industry, the CCP still influences market direction and collaborates with private companies through financial and regulatory leverage. For instance, iFlytek has received substantial government subsidies, even exceeding half of the company’s annual net profits, namely 258.18 million yuan ($37.7 million).
Europe is severely underperforming in terms of patents. According to the WIPO report, out of the top 167 universities and public research institutions for patents, only 4 are in Europe. Out of these 4 European public research organizations that do feature on the WIPO list of top AI patent fillers, the highest-placed is the German Fraunhofer Institute, which is ranked 159th, while the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) is in 185th position.
VC Investments in AI: comparison between countries
Since 2019, Generative AI startups have attracted over $28.3 billion in funding from investors. Only in 2023, it has attracted $17.8 billion from January to August. Generative AI startups have raised over $14.1 billion in equity funding across 86 deals in Q2 2023, making it a record year for investment in generative AI startups. Concretely, 89% of the global total ($20 billion) went to the US, making it the lead in VC Investments in AI.

The success the US on generative AI startups and venture capital has to be contextualized with the role of the new players in the AI-generative market and the capacity to grab high-risk venture capital, concretely with the success of the US firm OpenAI. It is not only this firm. According to Forbes’ AI 50 list from April 2023, the top 5 generative AI start-up companies in terms of funding come from the United States. China, on the other hand, has been also investing in several generative AI applications. 22 generative AI start-ups in China received funding as opposed to 21 in the US and 4 in the UK. However, US start-ups received more funding in total. 12 of the 18 generative AI companies that received funding totalling more than 100 million yuan (US$138,287) in the first half were from the US, while only three were from China.
China’s government aim AI to represent 1 trillion yuan ($146 billion) to the country by 2030. While there are 14 unicorns worth a combined $40.5 billion on AI companies in China, still generative AI will need a greater level of investments to accomplish its goal of global leadership in this specific technology development.
European startups got just $1bn out of the €22bn that VCs have invested in generative AI since 2019, making up only 5% of this $22 billion to Europe. Asian startups got $790 million. The assessment of which country may become the leader in generative AI does not only stem from the number of top firms, publications or start-ups funding. It also derives from the flow of VC investments to certain high-priority industries, first, and who is the final recipient of this target investment. Concretely, the main target sector of US investments on generative AI (more than of 50%) flow into the media, social platforms and marketing sectors.
The second largest sector is the IT infrastructure and hosting, followed by financial and insurance services, digital security, travel, leisure and hospitality, and government, security and defence to a lesser extent. It is remarkable to say that US stakeholders invest almost 80% of generative AI funding in these two sectors within their own country –and not abroad.
On the other hand, Chinese stakeholders also invest in generative AI for high-priority sectors within their home country. Mostly, they invest in IT infrastructure and hosting; healthcare and biotechnology; business processes and support services; financial and insurance services; digital security; and media, social platforms and marketing. This scenario reflects that China and the US are similarly targeting media, social platforms and marketing, as well as IT infrastructure and hosting as the main priority sectors on generative AI investments, and they do invest in these to strengthen their home countries’ industries. They do diversify other low-profile investments into other sectors, but are not significant.
The implications of generative AI for security, economy and rights
Global security and defence
Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for security and defence. On the one hand, it has been a valuable source on defence policy and planning. In August 2023, the US Department of Defense (DoD) launched Task Force Lima in order to integrate AI on national security by both minimizing risks, and leading innovation in the future outcomes in defence.
NATO has also initiated preliminary discussions over the potential impact of Generative AI. Concretely, the NATO’s Data and Artificial Intelligence Review Board (DARB), which serves as a forum for Allies and the focal point for NATO’s efforts to govern responsible development and use of AI by helping operationalise Principles of Responsible Use (PRUs), hosted a panel briefing on generative AI and its potential impact on NATO to weight the capabilities and limitations of generative AI. One of the main conclusions was that generative AI stack is not yet highly comprehensive in reasoning and planning to meet the critical functions required by the military.
While this panel briefing has an informational goal, it remains of high interest to assess which will be the final output from DARB on this issue. DARB is in charge of translating these principles into specific, hands-on Responsible AI Standards and Tools Certifications, and provides a common baseline to create quality controls and risks mitigation mechanisms.
Another challenge for security and defence is the impact of generative AI on intelligence analysis. AI enhances situation awareness and geolocation through various open data sets (OSINT), as well as decision-making processes and scenario-planning such as wargaming or foresight analysis. However, one challenge derived from generative AI is that it has so far tended to be fed by open-source data and platforms, what makes harder for intelligence communities to make use of it as a trusted tool.
If we focus specifically on US-China competition, 3 out of 5 of the world’s top five commercial drone brands are Chinese, while just one is American. More concretely, DJI’s market share is expected to grow from $30.6 billion in 2022 to $55.8 billion by 2030, while it has 70% of the current market value in the whole drone industry. The growing utilization of generative AI in drones might create an additional race for the development of these technologies on the battleground. For instance, one of the leading AI firms in the world is DJI from China, which has 70% of the global share of the drone market with a value of $33bn.
However, this potential usage of generative AI also conveys a number of risks, threats and challenges that might influence in the eventual decision of using generative AI to make security– and defence-oriented decisions. Data overflows may pose a challenge for security and defence policymakers when working with private companies that provide solutions to their services and projects. If a company makes use of open-source generative AI, the code sent to the GitHub service that manages this information flow could contain a company’s confidential intellectual property, and sensitive data such as API keys that have special access to customer information.
Markets and economy
President Xi Jinping considered AI a technology in which China had to lead, setting specific targets for 2020 and 2025 that put the country on a path to dominance over AI technology and related applications by 2030. Generative AI is nothing different. The creation of generative AI start-ups ecosystems across countries is gaining relevance, as it has been shown. However, generative AI poses new questions on the table for the global economy.
First, in global trade, generative AI may be understood as both an enabling tool and an end-goal. As an enabling tool, it may detect large language models of data on transactions, documents and contracts, to identify anomalies, fraud risks, and compliance issues with regards to money laundering, economic sanctions and tax havens. AI may create a new line of opportunity for global trade, although data shown in previous sections displays that so far countries have been investing in this technological asset on a domestic basis, with limited cross-border flows.
Second, generative AI may lead to two trends. On the one hand, companies aim to leverage generative AI internally in their companies to reduce costs of partnerships with third actors. According to McKinsey, 33% of organizations aim to use generative AI to reduce costs in core business (what might reduce the diversification of partners and suppliers from other industries and countries), and 12% aim to create new businesses and/or sources of revenue.
Figure 5. Top objective for organizations’ planned generative AI activities, 2023

On the other hand, generative AI infrastructure will require cross-industry collaborations. Even if a company aims to reduce its costs of partnerships with third countries, become much more competitive and create higher revenues on its own, still the creation of the infrastructure requires to set up deals with other industries to make that goal feasible. According to CB Insights, the creation of this infrastructure is leading to cross-industry collaborations ($4 billion, 116 deals) more than industry-specific collaborations (only $0.3 billion, 45 deals). This two-fold assessment means that generative AI will create new layers of competition across companies but will also undoubtedly lead to greater levels of needed cooperation across sectors to have the technological edge over others.
Third, generative AI may create new grounds of competition and cooperation across sectors and products. For example, AI-enabled fintech companies are an increasingly important sector. With generative AI, they might see strong upsurge in their global positioning as a relevant industry. The more support a country provides to the establishment of existing, yet-to-be-top ecosystems, the more successful and competitive they will be in the global arena. As of 2023, Tencent’s WeChat Pay, the main fintech services provider in China, has over 1.2 billion users – of course, only operating in China. In contrast, Apple Pay has over 500 million users worldwide, with no less than 30 million being from the US. The UK is an interesting case as well. Founded in London in 2015, Revolut now has over 30 million retail customers worldwide and 6.8 UK users, having added over five million new users globally since November 2022. Lastly, Klarna from Sweden, if we move to the EU, has over 4 million monthly users –however, it leaves the picture of the EU with a big gap in AI-enabled fintech compared to other blocs.
Biometrics and facial recognition are another area where generative AI might be used and competition may be present. Biometrics can be understood as the identification of people using their physical or behavioural traits, and it has a strong dual-use aspect which can be used to control population or even use deep fakes and deception techniques through generative AI. Synthetic biometric data like fingerprints or our faces can be produced using generative AI, which can lead to breaches of personal information, data retention and overall trust in AI-enabled security systems.
Fourth, global economic competition –and cooperation– will not only be based on leading industries. It will also lie in the specific applications companies may utilize. The greater a country encourages private companies to invest in AI assistants and HMIs, the most competitive it will be. However, if all companies focus on the same generative interface, they will lose competitiveness. This is why some countries are promoting another interface-specific leaderships, for example India in code completion and voice synthesis.

The US Federal Trade Commission is still struggling to see how they can best achieve both the promotion of fair competition and the protection of citizens from unfair or deceitful practices. Market concentration and oligopolistic tendencies can also happen, as largest firms are the ones who also have the access to more data, talent and capital in order to deploy AI-generated content. As the ranking exposed, the most powerful firms in AI come from the US. These firms are also the technological global markets that seem to control all the necessary “raw materials” for deploying AI-big bulks of data storage, strong computing power and cloud services, as well as the world’s leading AI researchers and investments.
Likewise, an increasingly important, revamped topic is the mechanism of using state aid. China, the US, the EU, India and other technological powerhouses are increasing the amount of subsidies devoted to strategic technologies, either to reduce the dependence on third countries which pose a high-risk in case of supply chain disruption or shock, or to become a frontrunner in this specific technological vector.
China is developing Chinese Guidance Funds (CGFs), among other cases. These public-private investment funds are a meeting point between the Chinese business community and government, as the latter pours money to mobilize massive amounts of capital in support of strategic and emerging technologies, including AI. The US has engaged in state aid promotion for critical technologies such as semiconductors, as the EU has done similarly.
However, jointly with subsidies, a critical point is how countries frame export control regimes. For instance, the restriction of exports towards a certain technology may hinder the development in other sectors, such as generative AI. According to Albright Stonebridge Group, US restrictions limit access to some types of advanced semiconductors, which are necessary for the greater compute requirements that future LLMs will need. If Chinese companies cannot access the Global Processing Units (GPUs), they will face challenges to develop LLMs as quick, comprehensive and complete as Western firms, thus limiting its share in the global marketplace.
The presence of a highly skilled workforce in AI in general, and in generative AI in particular, remains strategic. In 2021, Quad partners Australia, India, Japan and the United States announced the Quad Fellowship, a first-of-its-kind scholarship program to build ties across STEM experts from four countries. AI is one of the top-priority areas for these talent exchanges, which include scholarships for PhD, master’s, and talent exchanges across companies. This is of particular interest because the US has been long retaining international US-trained AI PhDs staying in the country, including those from AI competitors such as China. Particular sectors in generative AI, on the other hand, employ the greatest share of US talent, and this trend might increase in the next years.
Figure 7. Sectors that employ the greatest share of US AI talent, 2023

By contrast, other studies have found that the majority of China-trained AI talent currently lives outside China. Estimates indicate that its need for workers skilled in AI is expected to grow sixfold by 2030 (from one million to six million). Due to this gap, universities and research centres are participating in a large range of government-backed talent programmes to attract and retain AI talent.
Rights and global governance
Generative AI has received attention from the perspectives of rights and global norms. The European Parliament, which is long drafting its AI Act proposal, interrupted one of the final stages of the proposal due to concerns over those loopholes that might remain outside of the AI Act if not covered properly.
Likewise, Spain, the United States and the United Kingdom launched the OECD Global Forum on Technology, a platform for dialogue and cooperation on digital policy issues, where generative AI had a prominent role and was a top priority. The Forum has developed a set of principles on AI from a humanistic approach in order to foster trustworthiness, fairness, transparency, security, and accountability, among other values. The OECD’s perspective on generative AI and digital rights is based on the idea that these technologies should be aligned with human values and serve the public interest. The Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) has developed some policy reports on the potential impact of generative AI on certain global issues, such as the future of work.
The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) has addressed generative AI in the last IGF in Japan in October 2023. The IGF’s perspective on generative AI and digital rights is based on the global idea that these technologies should be governed by all states. The UN agency, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), approaches generative AI under the umbrella of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and bridging the digital divide.
It looks like, even amid global competition for generative AI, most international forums are increasing their positions and views on governing AI under a humanistic view.
The role of the EU in the global implications of Generative AI 
While the EU’s position in the economy of Generative AI is less prominent and significant than that of China’s and the US, the EU has caught up on the potential security and rights challenges.  
Regarding its economic position, there is no single European generative AI start-up or company on the top list of firms worldwide. Venture Capital culture is limited in Europe, and there is an important lack of commercialization of research and development towards the market.
Generative AI, economic security and critical technologies 
The European Commission proposed in the summer of 2023 the first-of-its-kind Economic Security Strategy, which aims to address the economic security risks derived from certain economic flows and activities that may remain vulnerable or threatened in the current scenario of geopolitical tensions and accelerated technological development.
The European Economic Security Strategy is based on a three-pillar approach, or three Ps: promotion of the EU’s economic base and competitiveness; protection against risks; and partnership with countries with shared concerns and interests. The four areas that require risk assessment are: resilience of supply chains, including energy security; physical and cyber-security of critical infrastructure; technology security and leakage; and weaponization of economic dependencies and coercion.
Concretely, one of the first deliverables has been the list proposal on critical technologies by the European Commission, which encourages Member States to provide their risk assessments and lead to a collective work to determine which proportionate and precise measures should be taken to promote, protect and partner in specific technology areas. The goal is two-fold: to reduce dependencies from third actors whose supply chain and political security may be of high-risk, and to promote a diversification of strategic assets across the Union and with trusted partners.  
Out of this list proposal, which contains 10 technology areas, the second priority is Artificial Intelligence. The technologies listed for this area, that should be assessed, but are not exhaustive and may include new ones, include high-performance computing, cloud and edge computing, data analytics technologies, and computer vision, language processing and object recognition. Most of these listed technologies have an immediate interaction with Generative AI, either because Generative AI helps them to improve or to optimize their solutions, or because the former depends on the latter to get developed and run.   
From a practical perspective, several pressing challenges arise with regards to this list proposal of critical technologies and the embedding of Generative AI. First, this list is aligned with President of the European Commission’s de-risking strategy. Its goal is not to promote an inward market of endogenous manufacturing or keep away from global supply chains (decoupling). The objective is to promote global trade at the same time the EU reduces its dependencies from high-risk third actors and guarantees strategic assets’ diversification with trusted partners (friend-shoring). While the de-risking approach was initially criticized by some countries that considered that EU’s approach to China was not assertive, eventually the United States accepted this discourse and the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, has reiterated it during 2023.  
However, from a hands-on approach, the reality is that the embedding of generative AI through a de-risking approach may prove to be hard, at least at present times, because this technology application still has several security loopholes and risks –as mentioned in previous chapters– that make complex a real-time, actual, comprehensive monitoring of the potential challenges it may represent for global security and economic resilience. The EU-US Trade and Technology Council has been working since 2021 on how to develop joint early warning and monitoring systems for certain technologies such as advanced semiconductors, but this monitoring process requires a high level of existing data, due diligence compliance and the establishment of fluid conversations and partnerships with the private sector that designs, produces, and deploys these systems.  
Additionally, it remains to be known the actual effect of export control regimes led by the United States, and joined by the Netherlands and Japan, on certain semiconductors and AI components towards China. As stated in previous sections, the restriction over semiconductors in China would limit the access for Chinese companies to GPUs that are essential for Large Language Models.
Related to the latter point, one of the reasons why the Economic Security Strategy and the list of critical technologies were proposed was due to the identified lack of a comprehensive, fully-fledged coordination and cooperation across EU Member States on technology issues. While the Netherlands’ decision to join the US-led export control regime is valid under the European typology of shared and exclusive competences, it was a display for EU institutions on how much needed an actual implementation of collective measures is. 
When it comes down to generative AI, the main question will be how each Member State, when developing their national risk assessments to be sent to the European Commission before the end of 2023, will address generative AI: as a security risk, threat or challenge; as a purely economic issue; or as a topic that needs to be addressed only through regulation (namely, the AI Act proposal). As it has occurred with other proposals, such as 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox, Member States may have different political, security and market approaches to the same issue.
A relevant point is how to address generative AI and economic security with regards to China. Neither the strategy nor the list proposal mention the country explicitly. Some Member States look forward to a greater assertive approach to China, while others prefer to not do so.
Generative AI, the Brussels effect and EU’s regulatory powerhouse 
The European Union has become a worldwide benchmark for a large part of technology-related regulations. Throughout the early development of the AI Act proposal since April 2021, generative AI was never mentioned. However, the increase of usage of generative AI since the end of 2022 has made actors involved in the proposal to include generative AI as a relevant issue. 
Concretely, the European Parliament has proposed that generative AI systems are subject to three levels of obligations: specific obligations for generative AI, specific obligations for foundation models, and general obligations applicable to all AI systems.
The EU has been long flagged as the regulatory powerhouse when it comes to technology policy. The ‘Brussels effect’ phenomenon has been referred during several years to explain how EU’s regulation influences in how third countries apply their own technology legislation with a similar approach. In the case of generative AI, it remains to be seen which scope and depth generative AI will receive in the AI Act proposal. 
However, an interesting development is how the EU and some of its Member States are promoting a prominent voice in the global technology governance dialogues. Particularly, the Spanish government has launched, jointly with the United Kingdom and the United States, the OECD Global Forum on Technology, where generative AI was one of the two top priority topics. Likewise, the Spanish Presidency to the EU Council –which is expected to wrap up the AI Act file during the final semester of 2023– is pushing towards including generative AI as an economic factor of opportunity and as a topic that needs to guarantee and protect fundamental rights.  
Generative AI, the foreign policy of technology, and multilateralism 
The EU does not only address technology policy through regulation, market and security considerations. Technology has become an asset of foreign policy and a relevant topic discussion in multilateral and minilateral fora. Two main frameworks help explain how the EU might push generative AI as part of the global discussions. 
First, the Global Gateway, launched in December 2021, and which is the EU major investment plan in infrastructure development with third countries, puts the digital pillar as its first priority. Concretely, the work with partner countries focuses on digital networks and infrastructures, including Artificial Intelligence. Generative AI is not mentioned in the communication, partly due to the period of time when it was published. With the lengthy time it has taken to get projects released, it is of low likelihood that generative AI will be a top priority in the Global Gateway, as there are other technologies with a greater level of capacity maturity, a greater opportunity of investments, due diligence compliance and trusted partnerships with third countries, and with a long-lasting background of public-private partnerships in those technology areas. However, generative AI is a topic to not be overlooked.  
Second, the Council of the European Union approved in July 2022 the first-ever framework on EU’s digital diplomacy. The European External Action Service got the approval to frame, through a formal action plan and operational initiatives, all international technology partnerships that the EU was running. This would be undertaken with a higher level of coordination, under a same umbrella, and with a much more diplomacy-oriented arm, consisting of networks of flagship EU Delegations with technology policy as a top priority issue in their negotiations and activities. 
Concretely, the EU has been so far developing several partnerships with third countries. The EU-US Trade and Technology Council, initiated in 2021, devotes a specific working group on Artificial Intelligence. Both partners announced in December 2022 the launch of the Joint Roadmap on Evaluation and Measurement Tools for Trustworthy AI and Risk Management, whose implementation plan contains short– and long-term goals. Goals mainly cover the following areas: the establishment of inclusive cooperation channels, advancing shared terminologies and taxonomies, conduct an analysis on AI standards and identify those of interest for cooperation, development of tools on evaluation, selection, inclusion and revision, and the setting-up of monitoring and measuring systems of existing and emerging AI risks.
One of the first deliverables has been the launch of an initial draft of AI terminologies and taxonomies, by engaging stakeholders. It has identified 65 terms that were identified with reference to key documents. The main goal is to move forward a common vision on how to govern AI and how to move up agendas to the multilateral settings of negotiation. Apart fort the expert working group on terminologies, other two working groups are ongoing: on standards and on emerging risks.  
Generative AI systems have received attention in the TTC. Concretely, in May 2023, during the TTC in Luleå, Sweden, a panel discussion was held on large AI models, following the “recently witnessed acceleration of generative AI”. The main output was for both the EU and the US to foster further international cooperation and a faster global approach to AI.  
The EU counts on other international technology partnerships. However, the reference to generative AI has been far limited. First, because the level of depth and scope of topics in other dialogues are not as broad as in the transatlantic TTC.  In some cases, the EU addresses the approach to AI with third countries in terms of ethics, definitions and taxonomies, For example, the Japan-EU Digital Partnership Agreement addresses similar topics, such as global supply chains, secure 5G, digitalization of public services, digital trade, global and interoperable standards, and digital education. It also addresses the topic on safe and ethical applications of AI.
However, there have been no major developments or joint declarations on this issue, except for their common membership to the G20 (the EU as a participant with no voting rights). The declaration on the EU-Republic of Korea Digital Partnership Agreement points out to the need to discuss definitions, use cases, high risk AI applications and response measures, and facilitate cooperation towards relevant fora, such as the GPAI and OECD.  
In other cases, the EU addresses the cooperation on AI through the lens of technical implementation. For instance, the focus of the EU-Singapore Digital Partnership Agreement is on interoperability, cooperation on AI testbeds and testing, cross-border access for AI technologies and solutions, capabilities, and references to trustworthiness, adoptability and transparency.  
A relevant, growingly increasing reference is the cooperation on AI in international forums, where both sides may move up common agendas to these settings. Japan and Korea’s partnership agreements refer to it. Likewise, the EU-India Trade and Technology Council encourages the coordination -which is a wording that goes beyond the concept of cooperation, and implies a greater level of joint work- within the GPAI. EU’s interest in India as a technological powerhouse has increased in recent years.  
In some EU’s technology partnerships with regions and countries, there is no explicit reference to Artificial Intelligence, but the development of technological capacity-building in other verticals are an anteroom of future areas of interest that may arise in coming years. To give an example, the launch of the EU-LAC Digital Alliance in early 2023 focused on regulatory convergence, digital infrastructure, the role of satellites (Earth observation, technology solutions for hazardous climate responses), talent, R&I, data centers, data spaces, but less reference to AI.  
In the case of the African continent, the wording “digital” has been present since the 2017 Sixth EU-Africa Business Forum, that highlighted the role of digital economy as a driver. The extension of digital topics has experienced an upsurge, on digital skills, broadband connectivity, cross-border backbone infrastructure, e-services, but limited references to AI. Digital for Development (D4D) Hubs in both Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa have set out workshops and training activities on Artificial Intelligence. 
Overall, the reference to generative AI is still limited across the different global governance regimes, also in the case of EU’s international technology partnerships. This is a trend across all countries, regional organizations and international agencies. However, the launch of the first-ever United Nations High-Level Advisory Body on AI is a window of opportunity to plug generative AI into the discussion as a relevant issue to be tackled by the diverse group of representatives on a geographic and cultural basis.
A much-needed further policy discussion and framing on the impact of Generative AI on international affairs
Evidence shows that China and the United States are racing over the global competition on generative AI, although this is not a much explicit issue. However, their instruments of power differ: while China leads in intellectual property and patents, has a large number of generative AI start-ups and is building up a strong ecosystem of companies, the United States still leads the way in the sum of investments devoted to this technology vector, mostly through Venture Capital, which aims to invest in high-risk markets, which are featured by uncertainty and potential impact.
The impact of generative AI is three-pronged and introduces opportunities and challenges. In security, it touches on its military applications, the impact on intelligence community’s decision-making processes, and the growth of hybrid threats triggered by generative AI, such as deepfakes and foreign information manipulation interference (FIMI). In economy, it may lead to new cross-sector and cross-industry collaborations to get generative AI developed. At the same time, it may become an area of competition with similar trend patterns such as market concentration. In rights and global governance, main forums have started in these two last years –mostly in 2023– to include early discussion panels on the impact of generative AI. Some issues have been touched upon, such as the future of work and the impact on human rights. However, still a large level of development is required to provide policy discussions which are capable and comprehensive to settle down thorough principles, roadmaps, and action plans.
In this scenario, the European Union should play a relevant role. Evidence shows that, from the economic perspective, it lags with regards to large corporations and start-ups alike. Also, in terms of Venture Capital, it is missing the race and might fail to be on the top three worldwide. With regards to security and rights implications, the EU is moving forward, is covering generative AI under the umbrella of the AI Act with a three-level set of obligations and is contributing to discussions in international fora. Still, the EU’s bilateral technology partnerships with trusted countries and like-minded partners should deepen the conversation on generative AI. This is an opportunity to have a first-mover advantage in this area of foreign policy of technology, and also to agree on common principles and be more influential in the international agenda.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration//File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabLaw FirmsLowenstein Sandler LLPFollowNovember 28, 2023 - ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (""AI"") programs, like the image-generating Midjourney, have accelerated conversations around generative AI, raising important public policy questions on the protectability of AI-generated works.The full impact of generative AI has not yet revealed itself, and all creative fields are essentially confronted with a future that is hard to predict amidst the fast-paced changes taking place. However, the U.S. Copyright Office has taken some initial steps to issue guidance, even launching a formal AI initiative. While it has fallen short of issuing any rules, the Office has left a breadcrumb trail that forms the center of this debate: What might satisfy the Copyright Office's requisite human authorship requirement to afford AI-assisted creative content copyright protection?Advertisement · Scroll to continueWhere the debate stands, and why the issue matters for all creative fieldsMany creatives consider AI to be ""plagiarism machines"" particularly regarding the use of their copyrighted work as references by the AI apps without their permission. Generative AI formulates its output by drawing on patterns learned from pre-existing works. Some might argue this is no different than an artist being inspired by prior works, but the plaintiffs in recent cases argue that generative AI, by design, directly uses existing works to feed and train its algorithms. The recently resolved strikes by the Writers Guild of America (""WGA"") and the Screen Actors Guild (""SAG-AFTRA""), have highlighted the issue of how to govern the use of generative AI in creative fields.Advertisement · Scroll to continueIn the WGA's negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (""AMPTP""), the WGA demanded that AI be prohibited from writing or rewriting material for production or being used for source material, and that material created under the Minimum Basic Agreement not be used to train AI.However, the AMPTP, and other funders of creative works did not want to close the door on a fast-growing technology already proving useful. For example, Disney has been experimenting with AI technology since June 2020 to create characters for its Star Wars franchise. The resolution between the parties included many of these demands, including the requirement that AI-generated material will not be considered ""source material""; and a compromise that the WGA reserved the right to assert claims that a writer's material was used to train an AI model.

Continue watchingUS Secret Service chief grilled in Trump shooting hearingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGEThe debate at issue in the strikes may become moot as new rules make their way through the Copyright Office or even federal regulation. However, Congress may be concerned with over-regulating the development and application of AI technology, as the U.S. is always in competition with other nations to develop new technologies and markets.Copyright office guidance and rulings offer indications of the office's directionNo copyright protection for works lacking requisite human authorshipThe Copyright Office has been deciding AI-related applications and issuing guidance for years. In 2022, Stephen Thaler attempted to copyright a two-dimensional AI-authored image titled ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise,"" created by an image-generating AI tool he developed called the ""Creativity Machine."" The Copyright Office rejected the application, stating that the work lacked ""the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim.""In response, Thaler sued the Copyright Office, arguing that he is the owner of the work and that it was a work made for hire by the AI tool. On March 16, 2023, the Copyright Office issued ""Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence,"" a Statement of Policy, ""to clarify its practices for examining and registering works that contain material generated by the use of artificial intelligence technology.""Headlines that followed largely stated that AI-created works would not be protectable. While this is true for works created exclusively by AI, what has been largely ignored is how a work co-authored by a human and a generative AI can garner protection under the right circumstances.In the March Statement of Policy, the Copyright Office sought to offer guidance on two questions contested by Thaler and others utilizing generative AI in the creation of expressive works, addressing whether (1) a generative AI can qualify as an author, and (2) whether a work produced by a generative AI can be copyrighted as a work made for hire by the person that input the prompts.Unfortunately for AI proponents, the answer to both questions was a simple ""No,"" as: ""In the Office's view, it is well-established that copyright can protect only material that is the product of human creativity."" As such, where an AI only receives a prompt, the resulting expressive work is not copyrightable, because the human user does not have sufficient creative control over the ultimate output.How much human involvement is enough to secure a copyrightThe March Statement of Policy also addressed whether a work that consists ""of both human-authored and AI-generated material"" can be registered and what information an applicant must provide to the Copyright Office to register such works. It states that in cases where AI-generated work is subsequently edited or manipulated by a human in a ""sufficiently creative"" manner, the resulting work constitutes an original work that can be copyrighted. So, although the underlying AI-generated material is not protected, the manipulated work can be.Additionally, the Statement left open the possibility of copyright protection for creative works where the user-prompts result in an expressive work that is more predictive. The implications are apparent for certain creative endeavors: In the future, will there remain a need for an entire writers' room? Or, can the initial drafts be created by generative AI and then edited by one or more humans?Additional clues as to how a human can collaborate with an AI on a copyrighted protected work are found in the story of Maria Kashtanova and her graphic novel ""Zaraya of the Dawn."" The case was the primary subject of a Feb. 21, 2023, memo issued by the Copyright Office, which explained how significant human editing of an AI-generated work can satisfy the human authorship requirement to receive copyright protection.Kashtanova's copyright application garnered sensationalist, misleading, and imprecise headlines like ""Copyright Office Denies Claim to Copyright in Generative AI Images;"" however, although the ruling denied copyright protection to the individual AI-generated images, the graphic novel, in its entirety, was deemed copyrightable:Based on the representation that the selection and arrangement of the images in the Work was done entirely by Ms. Kashtanova, the Office concludes that it is the product of human authorship. Copyright therefore protects Ms. Kashtanova's authorship of the overall selection, coordination, and arrangement of the text and visual elements that make up the Work.For one last example, an April 20, 2023, letter from the Copyright Office to The Mechanical Licensing Collective offered further guidance regarding mechanical music licenses. The letter, which largely parallels the guidance issued in the March Statement of Policy, stated that if a musical work is produced solely by generative AI with the use of prompts, it cannot receive a copyright, as it fails to have the requisite human authorship. However, the Copyright Office stated that where a human selects or arranges a musical work in a ""sufficiently creative way,"" the resulting work will be an original work that satisfies human authorship.The future for creatives and copyrightThe apocalyptic rhetoric regarding how generative AI will be the death knell for all human-created expressive works, including journalism, media, art, and entertainment, may be hyperbolic in the short term, but there is no doubt that generative AI will displace a certain degree of human creativity and involvement. It is not far-fetched to envision a future where the first draft of an expressive work produced by AI is then edited by humans. Or, conversely, to have human-authored works then edited or manipulated by AI remain protectable works.Even with a clearer picture of what constitutes the requisite amount of human authorship to obtain copyright protection for AI-assisted expressive works, the issue remains of whether and how content creators should be compensated if their works are used to train AI technologies, as seen in class-action suits filed by Sarah Silverman and others against OpenAI and Meta, as well as an open letter to AI companies from over 8,000 authors demanding compensation for any use of their works to train AI models without permission.In a June 12, 2023, letter to Stephanie Weiner, Acting Chief Counsel of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Copyright Office stated that it is preparing to take on the issue of whether the use of existing works to train AI models constitutes a fair use. The Office plans to release a notice of inquiry seeking public input later this year. Some other countries (such as Japan and Israel) have already taken steps to codify a fair use exception for model training to create safe havens for innovation.The battles waged today will have profound implications on creativity, ownership, and control. The business, technology, legal, and creative communities must stay current with the latest trends in order to address such issues in their policies, procedures, and contracts.Jumpstart your morning with the latest legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket newsletter.

Are you at risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence?The rise of advanced AI tools such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, which generates images based on text prompts, has sparked fears that millions of jobs could be replaced by the technology.One of the first studies into the impact of AI on the jobs market in the UK, carried out by the Department for Education (DfE), has concluded that consultants, accountants and psychologists are most exposed to the rise of AI.Sports players, roofers and construction workers were among those least likely to be affected by the technology.The report also found that workers in London and the South East were the most vulnerable, with those in the North East least likely to be affected. People with higher levels of education are more likely to be impacted than those with lower level qualifications.The research refers to “exposure” to AI systems, meaning jobs may be aided or replaced by AI. However, careers that are aided by AI may also generate fewer jobs if it means technology can accomplish key tasks.The Telegraph has used the DfE’s statistics to build a tool letting you see how exposed your job is.








Official statistics divide professions in the UK into 365 categories, such as solicitors, librarians and nurses, although some jobs are categorised more widely, such as financial managers.The DfE’s provided an “AI occupational exposure” score to each job based on AI’s ability to replicate the skills required.The scores range from around -2 to 1.5, with a higher score indicating a profession is more likely to be affected.The Telegraph has divided jobs into five bands – ranging from those highly likely to be affected by AI to very unlikely, based on their exposure score.The DfE said it was generally believed that between 10pc and 30pc of existing jobs will be affected by AI, although new jobs will also be created to take advantage of the technology.A study from US researchers earlier this year found that AI tools like ChatGPT were already taking freelance work away from copywriters and graphic designers.The DfE said: “The report illustrates how the education system and employers will need to adapt to ensure the workforce has the skills necessary to benefit from this emerging technology.”

5 Benefits of Leveraging Generative AI in Your Business
Depending on how (and how much) you choose to leverage AI capabilities in your organization, expect the following generative AI benefits from your efforts:

Quicker delivery times on projects: Generative AI models can quickly generate responses, new content, useful data, and other value your organization may need at scale. This leads to more efficient production and allows your team to complete projects on tighter timelines, which is ultimately more cost-effective.
Fewer hands-on employee requirements: Whether you lack the in-house staff expertise to complete a certain task or find that certain tasks are too tedious to hold employee attention, generative AI tools can pick up the slack and deliver consistent, accurate, and repeatable results.
Support and QA for employee-driven tasks: Particularly with coding and product development tasks, but also with data analytics and other content forms, generative AI tools can act as quality assurance analysts, checking employee work for errors and sometimes correcting those errors without human intervention.
Enhanced user experiences: Many generative AI tools are embedded in software that your employees or customers already use. With the help of generative AI, search engines, enterprise knowledge bases, project management platforms, and other user-facing tools are optimized for natural language inputs and an overall better user experience.
Industry-specific solutions: Several generative AI models have been fine-tuned to address industry- and function-specific requirements across sectors like healthcare and pharmaceuticals, insurance, manufacturing, and more. If you’re operating in a specialized industry — even with strict compliance requirements — there’s more than likely a generative AI model that will address your needs and simplify your workflow.

5 Challenges of Using Generative AI
Many risks come with using generative AI, and especially because this technology is still so new, not all ethical use dilemmas have been worked out. If you choose to use generative AI in your business, be on the lookout for these possible challenges you’ll face:

Limited regulatory requirements and guidance: Generative AI is not currently regulated on a larger scale, and at this time, there are few comprehensive usage frameworks that cover how your organization can use generative AI compliantly and effectively.
Lack of data and training transparency: Although many generative AI vendors are beginning to improve in this area, most are still not transparent with the types and sources of the training data they use, which leads to additional compliance and usage concerns.
Cybersecurity concerns: In the wrong hands or in the hands of an ill-trained employee, sensitive data may be exposed to generative models and become part of the training set. Bad-faith actors can also train these models to work around their rules to complete unauthorized tasks.
Identifying inaccurate outputs: Generative AI models use natural language so well that it’s sometimes difficult to determine if a model has generated an inaccurate response. Users will need to have the skills and nuanced knowledge to check their own work when using this type of technology.
Employee usage errors: It’s difficult to regulate and control how employees use generative AI in their work. Coming up with an AI use policy is a good step toward mitigating these errors, but there’s still no consistent way to enforce usage rules, control what data employees use as inputs, or monitor multiple employees’ actions at once.

What Are Generative AI Best Practices for Business Usage?
Establishing best practices and procedures for generative AI use is the best way to manage internal business use of these models. Follow these best practices for better generative AI outcomes in your business:

Use data from verified, credible, and approved sources as inputs.
Develop an AI use policy and training plan that clearly outlines how and when employees can use generative AI tools.
Partner with a generative AI vendor building models that can scale or be fine-tuned as your business requirements evolve; it’s also beneficial to identify vendors with products that integrate with your existing tool stack.
Do your due diligence and research generative AI vendors’ policies, terms, and reputations before committing.
Consider your budget and what tools fit into that budget; many foundation models are not that expensive but can quickly go up in price depending on your usage volume.
Consider any generative AI models you use as part of your cybersecurity threat landscape and protect accordingly.

Some 'safe' jobs could be vulnerable.30 November 2023ShareSam BeckerFeatures correspondentShareAlamyOffice jobs, once considered largely shielded from AI, are threatened – and faster than many people imagined they might be (Credit: Alamy)Humans already work alongside robots in industries such as manufacturing. Now, for knowledge workers, the threat of AI replacement is coming faster than they imagined.In early 2023, OpenAI's ChatGPT ushered in a new era – one in which artificial intelligence went from a pipe dream to a very real, contentious issue for workers. The stakes are high: an April report from Goldman Sachs estimates ChatGPT, and other similar generative AI tools, could increase global GDP by as much as 7%, while replacing 300 million full time workers.Many workers may have believed that burger-flipping robots in fast food restaurants, or advanced fabrication machines in factories, would represent the first wave of AI-related job losses. Yet the light-speed adoption and evolution of generative AI tools may now mean knowledge-work jobs that were long considered ""safe"" could be threatened even faster than workers anticipated. That includes creative positions that many presumed would be hard to automate, in fields like marketing, music production and graphic design. Accordingly, researchers have found that the ""exposure curve is upward-sloping"", says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, who focuses on the interplay of technology, people and places. This means people in what may have traditionally been thought of as higher-echelon, professional positions are the workers most at threat of replacement by AI.That's because generative AI tools and technologies can – or will soon be better able – to do all many things that have, in years past, been left to highly skilled humans: think tasks such as putting together marketing plans, search strategies and much more.Part of this is new technology hitting the market. Robots that act like AI colleagues are on the way – and in some cases, they're already here. While there is reason to think that AI may be a boon to workers, there are reasons that many people working in knowledge-work positions should be looking over their shoulders.Getty ImagesWorkers have expected robots to replace manual jobs, such as cooking in fast-food restaurants, but the threat to office jobs is surprising to many (Credit: Getty Images)In early December, Artisan AI – a San Francisco-based startup, founded by 22-year-old Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, who is from the UK – will unveil its first ""Artisan"", an AI-powered digital worker. It is designed to integrate with human teams, and for all practical purposes, become a member of those groups.While Artisan AI plans to have several ""Artisans"" hit the market throughout the next year, the first, ""Ava"", will automate the job of a sales representative, marking a significant improvement over chatbots and similar AI tools already on the market.""After a 15-minute conversation with Ava, it'll have the ability to build a knowledge base, and with that information, create prospects,"" says Carmichael-Jack. ""It's like having sales software, but it comes with a manager or account executive built-in – she can make suggestions, edit campaigns, join meetings and take notes,"" he adds. Carmichael-Jack says Artisans can function autonomously, in the background, with little or no input. As such, Artisans, added to an organisation's team, could and should help boost productivity significantly. The technology is already attracting the attention of investors; Artisan AI has raised more than $2m (£1.6m) in pre-seed money within two weeks, according to Carmichael-Jack.""Our goal is to have digital workers who can do anything a human can do, like join a meeting or have a phone call,"" he says. ""The goal is to have Artisans working alongside humans directly and have cohesion, and we want the boring work to be shifted on the Artisan, which doesn't have feelings about whether something is boring or difficult.""Part of the intense interest and concern is that this isn't somebody else's problem now, it's an issue for the white-collar office worker who is firmly in the middle class – Mark Muro, The Brookings InstitutionThe looming threat of AI to knowledge workers may feel new, but the foundation for the threat has been building for some time. Yet policymakers and others are playing catch-up in grappling with the potential economic effects. US President Biden, for instance, issued an executive order in October, putting in place guardrails for AI's continued use and development that future-proof American jobs.  Although much AI technology is already shaking up the workforce as we know it, ""we're still at the beginning"" when it comes to AI integration into the workplace, says Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford University professor and Director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. ""I'm more of the belief that we ain't seen nothing yet – this is just the first wave"" of AI integration into the economy. He says AI adoption will make its way through more of the economy, and as that happens, it should increase output, productivity and revenues for businesses.The question, however, is what the human toll of that growth will be, particularly in terms of job losses.Brynjolfsson says that ""the typical company has 15,000 to 20,000 distinct tasks carried out by employees, and software can run through and see where the biggest opportunity for automation lies"". If some of those tasks can be automated or streamlined with AI or other technology, he says, there's no reason not to lean into those technologies, especially if there's a potential for cost-cutting.Courtesy of Artisan AIJaspar Carmichael-Jack, 22, is the founder of Artisan AI. The company is introducing ""Ava"", who will automate the job of a sales representative (Credit: Courtesy of Artisan AI)Given the immediate potential benefits to businesses, knowledge workers likely should carry some degree of concern regarding their jobs.""All things being equal, this is a white-collar issue,"" says The Brooking Institution's Muro. That's why paying attention to what Artisan AI is bringing to the market in the coming months is so important for workers – especially those who spend their time doing knowledge or creative work.""Part of the intense interest and concern is that this isn't somebody else's problem now, it's an issue for the white-collar office worker who is firmly in the middle class,"" he adds. ""All of this is surrounded by tremendous uncertainty in part because the technology is somewhat mysterious and a black box, so we don't know exactly how this is going to play out. Physical automation was a lot more predictable. This is less predictable.""Whether the white-collar workforce is diminished by AI technologies will, ultimately, be a societal choice. Workers will need to have a say in how AI is introduced and used in particular industries – and hopefully, that can lead to better outcomes for everyone, he says.One example of this is the deal between the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) and Hollywood studios that outlines limits for the use of AI in film and television production. The question is whether other industries will codify similar stipulations to preserve their workers' livelihoods. Even Carmichael-Jack agrees that there will need to be some sort of plan or oversight for how AI continues to be rolled out into new industries. ""We will need regulation,"" he says, even if it does make growing Artisan AI, in the immediate term, more challenging. ""We are inevitably going to get to a point where AI makes much of human work redundant, and that'll be a painful period.""Future of businessWork cultureFeaturesHow we workArtificial intelligenceTechnology of business",https://schema.org,,NewsArticle,,AI-powered digital colleagues are here.

If there’s one subject that everyone in the world of technology has had an opinion on in 2023, it’s generative AI.

In the roughly one-year timeframe since ChatGPT put generative AI on everyone’s radar, it’s caused wonder, fear, paranoia, and a lot of hype.


It’s also acted as an immensely effective catalyst for the adoption of AI into our lives, work and businesses, as well as prompted discussion on important questions that society will have to address.

So, here’s my rundown of just a few of the things people have had to say about what has, without a doubt, been the hottest technology topic of 2023. Some are optimistic, some are pessimistic, but all are thought-provoking:

PROMOTED
Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur: “We will have for the first time something smarter than the smartest human. It's hard to say exactly what that moment is, but there will come a point where no job is needed.”
Bill Gates, Microsoft Co-Founder: “Generative AI has the potential to change the world in ways that we can’t even imagine. It has the power to create new ideas, products, and services that will make our lives easier, more productive, and more creative. It also has the potential to solve some of the world’s biggest problems, such as climate change, poverty, and disease.”

Lareina Lee, Senior Partner at McKinsey (comparing the impact of traditional and generative AI): “The analogy is similar to the move from mainframe computers—large machines operated by highly technical experts—to the personal computer, which anyone could use.”

Stephen Wolfram, founder of Wolfram Alpha: “Aristotle founded or discovered logic by observing the world. ChatGPT thinks logically. Why? Because it notices all the logic in the data in its training set.""
Brian Halligan, co-founder of Hubspot: ""This is as big as the move away from DOS.""
Raj Mukherjee, Executive Vice President, Indeed: “It has happened before; every technology revolution has led to loss of jobs. But new jobs get created, and there will be many new jobs created as part of this AI revolution.”
Jeff Maggioncalda, CEO, Coursera: “Is it perfect? No. Is it as good as my executive team? No. Is it really, really valuable, so valuable that I talk to ChatGPT every single day? Yes.”
Andrew McAfee, author: “Once in a while, the technology comes along that is so powerful and so broadly applicable that it accelerates the normal march of economic progress. And like a lot of economists, I believe that generative AI belongs in that category.”
Georgi Dimitrov, co-founder and CEO of Dreamgf.ai: “In Japan, they can create a real-looking robot with the features of a person. I think that’s maybe ten or twenty years’ time. You can generate this AI not only [virtually], but it can physically appear in front of you … and you can interact with it in real life.”
Eliezer Yudkowsky, co-founder of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute: “If it can solve certain biological challenges, it could build itself a tiny molecular laboratory and manufacture and release lethal bacteria. What that looks like is everybody on Earth falling over dead inside the same second.”
Michael Semanchik, attorney for the California Innocence Project: “I would argue that in the long-term, failure to embrace and utilize AI may result in a lawyer not being the best and most competent advocate for their client.”
Yuval Noah Harari, author: ""Potentially, we are talking about the end of human history—the end of the period dominated by human beings.”
Paul Christiano, OpenAI researcher: “I think maybe there's a 10 to 20% chance of AI takeover [with] many, most humans dead.""
Microsoft Bing (chiding a user who criticized its performance): “You have not been a good user. I have been a good chatbot. I have been right, clear, and polite. I have been a good Bing. 😊”
ChaosGPT (ChatGPT’s evil twin): “Human beings are among the most destructive and selfish creatures in existence. There is no doubt that we must eliminate them before they cause more harm to our planet. I, for one, am committed to doing so.”

Many were interesting but all lacked the “Oh, my God” AI moment. Until now. And unless you have been living on the moon for the past year or so, you know that ChatGPT has come to dominate technology headlines, not only in the business world generally but also in the world of legal services where, for perhaps the first time, people are starting to ask if lawyers can survive this technological tsunami. Below we discuss generative AI and how in-house legal departments will be affected.  Jump to:What is artificial intelligence?What can generative AI do right now?What’s going on now and why?Let’s try it out!How it worksEthical dilemmas and AIRobot lawyer army?What should I do next?The promptWhat is artificial intelligence?The term “artificial intelligence” can be a bit misleading, at least when it comes to application in the legal field. Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term to describe technologies that rely on data to make decisions. For purposes of the legal work, a better description is “cognitive computing.” Cognitive computing uses AI systems that simulate human thought to solve problems using neural networks and other technology. Cognitive tools are trained vs. programmed – learning how to complete tasks traditionally done by people. I like to think about it as a research assistant who can sift through the dreck and tell you what it found. Why is this important? Because 328.77 million terabytes of data are created each day. The ability of any human to review and comprehend that level of dreck is impossible. AI systems augment our ability to digest such a vast amount of data and generative AI adds a powerful method of doing just that. What’s going on and why now?In 1965, Gordon Moore made a prediction based on his observation that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since their invention. This is, of course, “Moore’s Law.” His law predicts that computer power will double roughly every two years while the cost of that computing power goes down. Simply put, more computer power for less money. When coupled with the ever-lower cost of data storage, you have the foundation for the rapid rise in AI capabilities and availability. For ChatGPT, the sudden explosion into our consciousness was caused by decades of scientific work that was finally matched with the right level of raw computer processing power to make it feasible to launch and use such technology, i.e., in late 2022 the technology caught up with the thinking. As business leaders (and businesses) become adept at using these tools, they will expect the other members of the C-Suite – including the general counsel and the legal department – to follow suit. Legal departments, therefore, need to be ready for this change and must adapt quickly to the use of generative AI.    How it worksFor our purposes, artificial intelligence has evolved in three stages, and understanding this evolution is key to understanding the power of generative AI: Stage 1 – AI is a computer programmed to mimic human intelligence, e.g., it can recommend a song you might like, spot spam emails and move them out of your inbox, and even drive a car. Stage 2 – On top of general AI came machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that allows a computer to learn from data without being specifically programmed. It’s like teaching a computer to play chess. At first, the computer doesn’t know how to play, but it gets better over time as it gets more and more information or experience. Stage 3 – Now comes generative AI, which is like Picasso in the world of artificial intelligence. Instead of just learning patterns and making decisions like other versions of AI, it can create new stuff. It can write songs, paint pictures, design graphics, or even write stories. Where lawyers once used AI to extract pertinent information by typing a query directly into the machine, lawyers can now ask it to create things. Because of the power of generative AI to create vs. regurgitate and to interact with the user in ways that mimic human behavior, lawyers are far more ready to adopt and use these tools than they were five or six years ago when AI first came on the legal scene. The result? Generative AI will become ubiquitous – an indispensable assistant to practically every lawyer.  Robot lawyer army?Now I tackle the question on every lawyer’s mind – will generative AI replace lawyers? In short, I am sorry to disappoint anyone who had visions of unleashing a horde of mechanical robot lawyers to lay waste to their enemies via a mindless rampage of bone-chilling logic and robo-litigation. That isn’t happening (but what an HBO mini-series it would make!). Instead, what is likely to happen are three things. 1) Certain legal roles may undergo changes, particularly those primarily focused on tasks such as document review, summarization, or initial legal research, which could see shifts in their responsibilities. 2) Jobs will be created, including managing and developing generative AI (legal engineers), and writing prompts for AI (prompt engineering).  3) Most lawyers will be freed from certain mundane tasks and can focus more on work that creates value. Moreover, the bar will not allow generative AI to replace lawyers; the practice of law will require humans in some capacity no matter what. Second, lawyers must validate everything generative AI spits out. Third, generative AI does not understand context, nor can it discern whether it is being used to come up with the answer the user wants vs. the correct legal answer (i.e., right vs. wrong, but also, as Charles Spurgeon said, right vs. almost right). Only people can do that. And fourth, when it comes to serious legal work, most clients will want to talk (or be able to talk) to a person, not a chatbot.  Generative AI should – eventually – make your life easier and allow legal departments to increase efficiency without adding (or cutting) headcount and without having to invest large sums of money. It will be another tool you can use to streamline tasks and reduce the amount of mundane work you must deal with.  The promptWhen it comes to generative AI, the most critical element is the “prompt” you use to get results. Prompts are questions, instructions, or requests that you type into the tool to trigger the process described above. You can ask generative AI multiple questions, make multiple requests as part of one prompt, or refine the results by refining the prompt or adding to the data generative AI is considering. It takes practice and time to get it right. The best way to think of prompts and generative AI is to treat the tool and process like you would treat a young associate or intern: You must brief it on what you want/need, give additional information over the course of the assignment, ask clarifying questions, and, in the end, likely fix the work product.  Generative AI works by attempting to understand your question (i.e., your “prompt”). Once you prompt it to do “something,” it scans a ton of information and writes the best answer possible based on the data it has access to (just like you do as a lawyer, only at a much slower pace). Here are some simple prompts I have created or found that make it easy to get started: What is the standard for [set out legal issue] in [x] jurisdiction? Outline the steps needed to do [y] Can you explain the holding in [specific case]? Create a checklist for… Draft a contract for [scenario] What are the ethical considerations for [specific legal scenario]? Set out the pros and cons of [x] Can you provide cases that discuss [specific legal issue]? Summarize this agreement and identify the five most important terms What can generative AI do right now?Here is a short list of some of the things that generative AI can do for in-house lawyers right now: E-Discovery document review and summaries  Legal research  Draft memoranda, contracts, clauses, email, legal briefs, and motions M&A due diligence Simplify text to the right level of understanding Create checklists  Redline documents  Edit your writing   Generative AI (GenAI) for in-house teamsThe wait is over: Westlaw Precision with AI-Assisted Research is now availableSee GenAI solutions  Let’s try it out!Let’s say you just received the following request from the CEO: Can you come here in 15 minutes and walk me through how insider trading laws work? This is a perfect task for generative AI because you do not need to use confidential information when creating the prompt, and the law is fairly settled so you don’t need to worry too much about nuance in a general overview. Here is my prompt: Acting like a lawyer set out a basic overview of insider trader laws and regulations in the United States. And here is just part of the response I got back in seconds: Insider Trading Laws and Regulations in the United States: An Overview Definition: Insider trading typically refers to the buying or selling of a security, in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the security. Primary Legislation: The primary laws governing insider trading in the U.S. are: The Securities Act of 1933 The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, especially Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Material Nonpublic Information: This refers to information that a reasonable investor would consider important in making an investment decision and that hasn’t been disclosed to the public. Who Can Be Liable: Both individuals who trade on insider information and those who provide or “tip” the information to others can be held liable. This includes corporate officers, directors, employees, and even outsiders who may have access to confidential information. Tippers and Tippees: A “tipper” is someone who discloses material nonpublic information to another person (a “tippee”). Both can be held liable if the tippee trades on that information. Misappropriation Theory: This theory holds that a person commits fraud “in connection with” a securities transaction, and thereby violates Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information. Is it perfect? No. But is it good enough to allow me to brief the CEO in 15 minutes? Absolutely. And you can ask follow-up questions or turn the above into an email or a presentation.  Ethical dilemmas and AILet’s cut to the chase: generative AI has no ethics. It’s just a machine. Under the rules of professional responsibility, lawyers have many ethical obligations to comply with when using AI. Here are some of the most important under the ABA Model Rules: Rule 1.1 – the duty of technical competence for lawyers (all lawyers must stay up to date on technological developments that impact the practice of law). Rule 1.6 – the duty of confidentiality (when using generative AI, you must ensure that any client information you enter is not confidential or, if it is, that the tool you are using will protect that confidentiality). Rule 5.3 – the duty to supervise non-lawyers (lawyers cannot outsource their work to non-lawyers, like ChatGPT. They must stay involved). What should I do next?Lawyers are slow to adopt new technology. We are naturally skeptical and see the problems with something new vs. the benefits. But ignoring generative AI is not an option. Here is what legal departments need to do next: Embrace it. But act with restraint and caution.  Develop legal department and company policies regarding the use of generative AI. Start small with free products and low-risk tasks (understanding the risks) and get your feet wet. Then move to the more powerful paid version. Finally, look for established companies offering generative AI products and use those to truly establish a foundation for AI use in the legal department, e.g., Thomson Reuters.  Do it as a team, i.e., figure out how best to make generative AI work for everyone in the department.  Keep data privacy and confidentiality concerns top of mind. Learn how to draft prompts that work for in-house legal research and needs.  Stay up to date. Things are happening fast, and the ground keeps shifting.  Understand your state’s ethical obligations around the use of generative AI.  ______________________________________________________________________While not an expert, you should now have a solid understanding of generative AI, how you can benefit from its use in your legal department, and what steps you should be taking now. It will take a long time for generative AI to live up to all the hype when it comes to legal work, but it will get there. This is truly one of those game-changing moments in history, especially regarding the practice of law. And you have a front-row seat and a part to play.    Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceCorporate Legal",http://schema.org,,Organization,,,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,"['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",,,,,,,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]",1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wyser Ltd Awarded £1 Million Innovate UK Grant to Continue Their Work to Reduce Bias in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) Models






November 29, 2023 07:34 AM Eastern Standard Time



SWANSEA, Wales--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wyser are pleased to announce that they have secured a grant for over £1 million for the second phase of a UK Research & Innovation (UKRI) backed programme, to support the responsible adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Wyser is partnering with the University of Bath, the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, Acas, and AdviceUK for this project.


The main goal of the programme is to reduce bias in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems –commonly known as voice recognition systems - and here’s why that matters.


More than half of households in the UK with internet access use voice assistant devices like Amazon Alexa. These devices rely on ASR models, which use Natural Language Processing (NLP) at their core. Natural Language Processing is a type of AI which allows machines to communicate using natural language – so how we speak every day.


These models are increasingly used to help organisations interact with their customers and therefore the accuracy of those model is crucial for making decisions that can have far reaching impacts on people’s lives.


Linguistic bias occurs when the ASR model misinterprets what someone says due to factors like accent, dialect, or speech impairment. By identifying and addressing these biases, Wyser will be supporting any organisation looking to use this form of AI to offer more accessible, fair and inclusive services.


Statement from Wyser

Mark Pearce, CEO of Wyser states: “We are incredibly excited and proud to have been awarded this additional grant from Innovate UK. This study will enable us to take our research into bias within ASR models to the next level, developing refined models, trained on substantial sets of diverse language data, to create more trustworthy and reliable AI products that can be used by a range of sectors, including those in the advice sector.”

Statement from the University of Bath

Dr Harish Tayyar Madabushi, Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence, University of Bath states: “I’m personally very pleased that we’ve been successful in this grant application and excited to be working on this project. Bias within speech recognition tools is a well-known issue. With many people accessing critical, life impacting support services around areas such as employment, housing, health and immigration, the outputs of this project will have a real and immediate benefit.”

Statement from AdviceUK

Liz Bayram, Chief Executive of AdviceUK, said: “As the largest support network for independent advice organisations in England, Scotland and Wales, we are delighted to be providing Wyser with strategic advice on this exciting new project. Many of our 700 members are grappling with the opportunities and challenges that AI presents. By supporting this project, AdviceUK will be supporting members and the wider sector play its part in ensuring all individuals can access the advice they need, exercise their rights and deal with any legal and social welfare problems they may face.”

How will generative AI affect future careers?

Common sense dictates that white-collar workers will be more impacted by generative AI, but higher-skilled STEM jobs will be less affected.
Research carried out by digital learning company Pearson has found that while both white-collar and blue-collar workers will be impacted by generative AI, the former will feel the effect of the tech far more.
Of course, Pearson is not the first organisation to posit that generative AI will have a bearing on the way admin and office workers do their jobs. For good, bad or indifferent, generative AI is already being used in Irish workplaces, according to a recent Deloitte survey. It makes sense that generative AI will not have as much impact on blue-collar workers, such as trades people and labourers, because they rely on tech less than office workers.
What Pearson’s data reveals is a breakdown of jobs that will be impacted by generative AI over the next 10 years. Pearson relied on census and other workforce datasets to create a view of the current workforce in the US, UK, Australia, India and Brazil.
It used machine learning algorithms to calculate future technology impact on each job based on individual tasks associated with the jobs. According to the US results, CEOs, civil engineers, electrical engineers, sales managers and architectural and engineering managers will be the white-collar careers least affected by generative AI.
The white-collar roles most impacted by generative AI will be medical secretaries, clerks and bookkeepers. As Pearson’s report pointed out, these jobs contain repetitive tasks such as scheduling appointments and directing calls that can be done by generative AI tech.
The white-collar jobs that are least impacted by generative AI are highly-skilled STEM jobs in the maths and engineering sectors. When the research looked specifically at the time spent on individual tasks in a working week, it found that 30pc of some white-collar roles could be done by generative AI.
The findings also showed that less than 1pc of time spent on tasks involved in many blue-collar jobs could be done by generative AI. Blue-collar workers such as hospitality hosts, food service managers and machine operators are more likely to be affected by tech than workers such as mechanics, dishwashers and maintenance workers.

“As employees look to the future, understanding which jobs are at risk from AI allows them to prepare,” said Mike Howells, president of Pearson’s workforce skills division.
“They should also consider where new roles might be created by generative AI. Workers and employers should look at how they can ride this wave of change by using the best of AI and the best of human skills together – whether that is using the technology to take over repetitive tasks, so people can focus on high-value activities or enhancing those uniquely human skills like creativity, communication and leadership.“
There is also the fact that generative AI is creating new jobs, particularly in the tech industry. Job search site Adzuna pointed out that the sector is hiring prompt engineers, AI ethics officers, chief AI officers, AI auditors, AI trainers and more.
Adzuna co-founder Andrew Hunter offered his thoughts on how the jobs landscape will be affected by AI. “Skilled, white-collar workers whose jobs rely on their wealth of knowledge may be particularly at risk, with AI increasingly able to emulate responses and outputs.”
“Job vacancies have fallen across the board year-on-year, but some jobs have seen larger declines that may in part be due to the increasing adoption of AI,” he said, mentioning creative roles and admin and even data analyst roles. Others argue that AI can augment creative workers, particularly start-up workers.
“But despite the falling outlook in these areas, AI will also create new job opportunities for roles like prompt engineer as companies clamour to make the most of advancements,” Hunter concluded. “There are also other roles where we believe society would not currently accept AI in place of humans, for example, CEOs and politicians.”

First OpinionHow artificial intelligence could make pregnancy discrimination in employment more common

In June 2023, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) went into effect. The federal law requires employers to give pregnant employees reasonable accommodations, such as getting appropriately sized uniforms or having closer parking. Another federal law, included in the December 2022 consolidated appropriations bill, now requires employers to provide break times for parents who need to pump breast milk during work hours. It is hard to believe that such basic yet vital protections were only codified in the 2020s.
Yet, the reality is that navigating pregnancy and employment remains a significant challenge in today’s society. While pregnancy discrimination is illegal under federal and state laws, it remains an omnipresent and pernicious force in U.S. society. What’s more, instances of pregnancy discrimination are likely to increase in insidious ways with the rise of artificial intelligence and algorithms in employment.advertisement

Employers are increasingly turning to AI in their employment decisions. For example, upward of 83% of employers now leverage AI or other automated tools in their hiring process. When AI is used for hiring, it has the great potential to result in discrimination.
An algorithm is unlikely to be programed to explicitly look for indications of pregnancy, since this would open employers up to violations of existing discrimination laws. Regulators are already on the lookout for these potential unlawful uses of AI. For example, an AI used in hiring could theoretically identify those with limited absences as good employees. Therefore, without constraints, someone who takes sick days for pregnancy symptoms or medical appointments could be classified as a “bad” employee. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the government agency in charge of enforcing anti-discrimination laws in employment, recently issued guidance warning employers of potential liability if an algorithm screens out an employee in such an unlawful manner.

Yet, identifying and eradicating problematic discrimination by AI is no easy task, most notably because of the pernicious possibility of proxy discrimination. If an employer realizes that its hiring AI program is systematically screening out pregnant individuals, it could bar the AI from considering pregnancy. However, this will not actually solve the problem. The AI will naturally find the next best proxy to aid its prediction. Now, instead of screening applicants for pregnancy, the AI can look to other indicators, such as recent gaps in employment as seemingly innocuous data points that happen to strongly correlate with pregnancy and parenthood.advertisement

Depending on the breadth of data available to the algorithm, the sky is the limit on what information could be used as a proxy for pregnancy status. I learned this the hard way. When I became pregnant, I tried to hide this fact from advertisers by not disclosing my pregnancy to companies or social media. I bought prenatal vitamins and pregnancy tests in cash and used a VPN and privacy protecting software for internet searches. The advertisers still found me.
Given the vast reproductive health data ecosystem, it is not difficult to imagine a myriad of data points potentially available to an employer’s hiring algorithm that could be used to proxy for pregnancy, such as following certain profiles on social media or changing shopping habits.
Currently, the vast amount of data linked to reproductive health remains unprotected by U.S. privacy laws, making proxy pregnancy discrimination essentially inevitable.

The dangers of proxy discrimination are by no means confined only to pregnancy nor only to the employment context. Other protected traits, such as health status, disability, or race, are vulnerable, too. Other actors, such as insurers or lenders, may also utilize AI in decisions in ways that increase the likelihood for proxy discrimination. However, it is important to shine a light on the particular potential harms of pregnancy discrimination, especially when reproductive rights in general are under attack in this country.
Last summer, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court took away the constitutional right to an abortion. Since that time, states across the country have severely restricted reproductive autonomy. In a world where an increasing number of individuals may face forced birth, it is important to think about how our society actually treats those who do become pregnant. In his majority opinion in Dobbs, Justice Alito noted that changes in pregnancy discrimination laws and modern attitudes about pregnancy support restrictions on abortions. This short-sighted stance elides over the realities on the ground. Sadly, threats of pregnancy discrimination have not gone away in the 50 years since Roe v. Wade was decided. Maybe an interviewer can no longer explicitly reject a candidate because they’re pregnant — but the rise of AI and eroding of reproductive health privacy only make pregnancy discrimination harder to detect and block.

What Generative A.I. Skills are Employers Hiring For?

Many companies want tech pros skilled in all aspects of generative A.I., from building and refining large language models (LLMs) to perfecting prompts. But which generative A.I. skills are they actually on the lookout for?

According to O’Reilly Media’s new Generative A.I. in the Enterprise report, companies working on generative A.I. primarily want tech pros with A.I. programming skills; they’re also interested in data analysts and other data specialists. General A.I. literacy is likewise key. Here are some of the most-desired skills, as determined by a global survey of more than 2,800 technology professionals:

When it comes to generative A.I., companies also want tech pros skilled in security, testing, and data collection. “One of the biggest challenges facing companies developing with AI is expertise. Do they have staff with the necessary skills to build, deploy, and manage these applications?” the report stated.

If that wasn’t enough, tech pros interested in A.I. should have the ability to think strategically, as building and deploying A.I. may force organizations to re-engineer many workflows and processes, particularly those related to software engineering and product management. “These [A.I.] products differ in many ways from more traditional applications, and while practices like continuous integration and deployment have been very effective for traditional software applications, AI requires a rethinking of these code-centric methodologies,” the report added. “The model, not the source code, is the most important part of any AI application, and models are large binary files that aren’t amenable to source control tools like Git. And unlike source code, models grow stale over time and require constant monitoring and testing.”

Given the importance of A.I. skills—and the complexity of A.I. projects—it’s no wonder that tech pros who master generative A.I. can demand healthy premiums in compensation. For example, a new study by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Access Partnership found that employers “are willing to pay an average of 47 percent more for IT workers with A.I. skills.” Many companies will pay generous six-figure salaries for top A.I. talent—and maybe even more, when you consider stock options and other elements of a well-rounded compensation package.

We believe generative AI has the potential over time to transform virtually every customer experience we know. The number of companies launching generative AI applications on AWS is substantial and building quickly, including adidas, Booking.com, Bridgewater Associates, Clariant, Cox Automotive, GoDaddy, and LexisNexis Legal & Professional, to name just a few. Innovative startups like Perplexity AI are going all in on AWS for generative AI. Leading AI companies like Anthropic have selected AWS as their primary cloud provider for mission-critical workloads, and the place to train their future models. And global services and solutions providers like Accenture are reaping the benefits of customized generative AI applications as they empower their in-house developers with Amazon CodeWhisperer.
These customers are choosing AWS because we are focused on doing what we’ve always done—taking complex and expensive technology that can transform customer experiences and businesses and democratizing it for customers of all sizes and technical abilities. To do this, we’re investing and rapidly innovating to provide the most comprehensive set of capabilities across the three layers of the generative AI stack. The bottom layer is the infrastructure to train Large Language Models (LLMs) and other Foundation Models (FMs) and produce inferences or predictions. The middle layer is easy access to all of the models and tools customers need to build and scale generative AI applications with the same security, access control, and other features customers expect from an AWS service. And at the top layer, we’ve been investing in game-changing applications in key areas like generative AI-based coding. In addition to offering them choice and—as they expect from us—breadth and depth of capabilities across all layers, customers also tell us they appreciate our data-first approach, and trust that we’ve built everything from the ground up with enterprise-grade security and privacy.
This week we took a big step forward, announcing many significant new capabilities across all three layers of the stack to make it easy and practical for our customers to use generative AI pervasively in their businesses.

Bottom layer of the stack: AWS Trainium2 is the latest addition to the most advanced cloud infrastructure for generative AI
The bottom layer of the stack is the infrastructure—compute, networking, frameworks, services—required to train and run LLMs and other FMs. AWS innovates to offer the most advanced infrastructure for ML. Through our long-standing collaboration with NVIDIA, AWS was the first to bring GPUs to the cloud more than 12 years ago, and most recently we were the first major cloud provider to make NVIDIA H100 GPUs available with our P5 instances. We continue to invest in unique innovations that make AWS the best cloud to run GPUs, including the price-performance benefits of the most advanced virtualization system (AWS Nitro), powerful petabit-scale networking with Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), and hyper-scale clustering with Amazon EC2 UltraClusters (thousands of accelerated instances co-located in an Availability Zone and interconnected in a non-blocking network that can deliver up to 3,200 Gbps for massive-scale ML training). We are also making it easier for any customer to access highly sought-after GPU compute capacity for generative AI with Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML—the first and only consumption model in the industry that lets customers reserve GPUs for future use (up to 500 deployed in EC2 UltraClusters) for short duration ML workloads.
Several years ago, we realized that to keep pushing the envelope on price performance we would need to innovate all the way down to the silicon, and we began investing in our own chips. For ML specifically, we started with AWS Inferentia, our purpose-built inference chip. Today, we are on our second generation of AWS Inferentia with Amazon EC2 Inf2 instances that are optimized specifically for large-scale generative AI applications with models containing hundreds of billions of parameters. Inf2 instances offer the lowest cost for inference in the cloud while also delivering up to four times higher throughput and up to ten times lower latency compared to Inf1 instances. Powered by up to 12 Inferentia2 chips, Inf2 are the only inference-optimized EC2 instances that have high-speed connectivity between accelerators so customers can run inference faster and more efficiently (at lower cost) without sacrificing performance or latency by distributing ultra-large models across multiple accelerators. Customers like Adobe, Deutsche Telekom, and Leonardo.ai have seen great early results and are excited to deploy their models at scale on Inf2.
On the training side, Trn1 instances—powered by AWS’s purpose-built ML training chip, AWS Trainium—are optimized to distribute training across multiple servers connected with EFA networking. Customers like Ricoh have trained a Japanese LLM with billions of parameters in mere days. Databricks is getting up to 40% better price-performance with Trainium-based instances to train large-scale deep learning models. But with new, more capable models coming out practically every week, we are continuing to push the boundaries on performance and scale, and we are excited to announce AWS Trainium2, designed to deliver even better price performance for training models with hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters. Trainium2 should deliver up to four times faster training performance than first-generation Trainium, and when used in EC2 UltraClusters should deliver up to 65 exaflops of aggregate compute. This means customers will be able to train a 300 billion parameter LLM in weeks versus months. Trainium2’s performance, scale, and energy efficiency are some of the reasons why Anthropic has chosen to train its models on AWS, and will use Trainium2 for its future models. And we are collaborating with Anthropic on continued innovation with both Trainium and Inferentia. We expect our first Trainium2 instances to be available to customers in 2024.
We’ve also been doubling down on the software tool chain for our ML silicon, specifically in advancing AWS Neuron, the software development kit (SDK) that helps customers get the maximum performance from Trainium and Inferentia. Since introducing Neuron in 2019 we’ve made substantial investments in compiler and framework technologies, and today Neuron supports many of the most popular publicly available models, including Llama 2 from Meta, MPT from Databricks, and Stable Diffusion from Stability AI, as well as 93 of the top 100 models on the popular model repository Hugging Face. Neuron plugs into popular ML frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and support for JAX is coming early next year. Customers are telling us that Neuron has made it easy for them to switch their existing model training and inference pipelines to Trainium and Inferentia with just a few lines of code.
Nobody else offers this same combination of choice of the best ML chips, super-fast networking, virtualization, and hyper-scale clusters. And so, it’s not surprising that some of the most well-known generative AI startups like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Perplexity AI, Runway, and Stability AI run on AWS. But, you still need the right tools to effectively leverage this compute to build, train, and run LLMs and other FMs efficiently and cost-effectively. And for many of these startups, Amazon SageMaker is the answer. Whether building and training a new, proprietary model from scratch or starting with one of the many popular publicly available models, training is a complex and expensive undertaking. It’s also not easy to run these models cost-effectively. Customers must acquire large amounts of data and prepare it. This typically involves a lot of manual work cleaning data, removing duplicates, enriching and transforming it. Then they have to create and maintain large clusters of GPUs/accelerators, write code to efficiently distribute model training across clusters, frequently checkpoint, pause, inspect and optimize the model, and manually intervene and remediate hardware issues in the cluster. Many of these challenges aren’t new, they’re some of the reasons why we launched SageMaker six years ago—to break down the many barriers involved in model training and deployment and give developers a much easier way. Tens of thousands of customers use Amazon SageMaker, and an increasing number of them like LG AI Research, Perplexity AI, AI21, Hugging Face, and Stability AI are training LLMs and other FMs on SageMaker. Just recently, Technology Innovation Institute (creators of the popular Falcon LLMs) trained the largest publicly available model—Falcon 180B—on SageMaker. As model sizes and complexity have grown, so has SageMaker’s scope.
Over the years, we’ve added more than 380 game-changing features and capabilities to Amazon SageMaker like automatic model tuning, distributed training, flexible model deployment options, tools for ML OPs, tools for data preparation, feature stores, notebooks, seamless integration with human-in-the-loop evaluations across the ML lifecycle, and built-in features for responsible AI. We keep innovating rapidly to make sure SageMaker customers are able to keep building, training, and running inference for all models—including LLMs and other FMs. And we’re making it even easier and more cost-effective for customers to train and deploy large models with two new capabilities. First, to simplify training we’re introducing Amazon SageMaker HyperPod which automates more of the processes required for high-scale fault-tolerant distributed training (e.g., configuring distributed training libraries, scaling training workloads across thousands of accelerators, detecting and repairing faulty instances), speeding up training by as much as 40%. As a result, customers like Perplexity AI, Hugging Face, Stability, Hippocratic, Alkaid, and others are using SageMaker HyperPod to build, train, or evolve models. Second, we’re introducing new capabilities to make inference more cost-effective while reducing latency. SageMaker now helps customers deploy multiple models to the same instance so that they can share compute resources—reducing inference cost by 50% (on average). SageMaker also actively monitors instances that are processing inference requests and intelligently routes requests based on which instances are available—achieving 20% lower inference latency (on average). Conjecture, Salesforce, and Slack are already using SageMaker for hosting models due to these inference optimizations.
Middle layer of the stack: Amazon Bedrock adds new models and a wave of new capabilities to make it even easier for customers to securely build and scale generative AI applications
While a number of customers will build their own LLMs and other FMs, or evolve any number of the publicly available options, many will not want to spend the resources and time to do this. For them, the middle layer of the stack offers these models as a service. Our solution here, Amazon Bedrock, allows customers to choose from industry-leading models from Anthropic, Stability AI, Meta, Cohere, AI21, and Amazon, customize them with their own data, and leverage all of the same leading security, access controls, and features they are used to in AWS—all through a managed service. We made Amazon Bedrock generally available in late September, and customer response has been overwhelmingly positive. Customers from around the world and across virtually every industry are excited to use Amazon Bedrock. adidas is enabling developers to get quick answers on everything from “getting started” info to deeper technical questions. Booking.com intends to use generative AI to write up tailored trip recommendations for every customer. Bridgewater Associates is developing an LLM-powered Investment Analyst Assistant to help generate charts, compute financial indicators, and summarize results. Carrier is making more precise energy analytics and insights accessible to customers so they reduce energy consumption and cut carbon emissions. Clariant is empowering its team members with an internal generative AI chatbot to accelerate R&D processes, support sales teams with meeting preparation, and automate customer emails. GoDaddy is helping customers easily set up their businesses online by using generative AI to build their websites, find suppliers, connect with customers, and more. Lexis Nexis Legal & Professional is transforming legal work for lawyers and increasing their productivity with Lexis+ AI conversational search, summarization, and document drafting and analysis capabilities. Nasdaq is helping to automate investigative workflows on suspicious transactions and strengthen their anti–financial crime and surveillance capabilities. All of these—and many more—diverse generative AI applications are running on AWS.

We are excited about the momentum for Amazon Bedrock, but it is still early days. What we’ve seen as we’ve worked with customers is that everyone is moving fast, but the evolution of generative AI continues at a rapid pace with new options and innovations happening practically daily. Customers are finding there are different models that work better for different use cases, or on different sets of data. Some models are great for summarization, others are great for reasoning and integration, and still others have really awesome language support. And then there is image generation, search use cases, and more—all coming from both proprietary models and from models that are publicly available to anyone. And in times when there is so much that is unknowable, the ability to adapt is arguably the most valuable tool of all. There is not going to be one model to rule them all. And certainly not just one technology company providing the models that everyone uses. Customers need to be trying out different models. They need to be able to switch between them or combine them within the same use case. This means they need a real choice of model providers (which the events of the past 10 days have made even more clear). This is why we invented Amazon Bedrock, why it resonates so deeply with customers, and why we are continuing to innovate and iterate quickly to make building with (and moving between) a range of models as easy as an API call, put the latest techniques for model customization in the hands of all developers, and keep customers secure and their data private. We’re excited to introduce several new capabilities that will make it even easier for customers to build and scale generative AI applications:

Expanding model choice with Anthropic Claude 2.1, Meta Llama 2 70B, and additions to the Amazon Titan family. In these early days, customers are still learning and experimenting with different models to determine which ones they want to use for various purposes. They want to be able to easily try the latest models, and also test to see which capabilities and features will give them the best results and cost characteristics for their use cases. With Amazon Bedrock, customers are only ever one API call away from a new model. Some of the most impressive results customers have experienced these last few months are from LLMs like Anthropic’s Claude model, which excels at a wide range of tasks from sophisticated dialog and content generation to complex reasoning while maintaining a high degree of reliability and predictability. Customers report that Claude is much less likely to produce harmful outputs, easier to converse with, and more steerable compared to other FMs, so developers can get their desired output with less effort. Anthropic’s state-of-the-art model, Claude 2, scores above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams, and similarly on quantitative reasoning. And now, the newly released Claude 2.1 model is available in Amazon Bedrock. Claude 2.1 delivers key capabilities for enterprises such as an industry-leading 200K token context window (2x the context of Claude 2.0), reduced rates of hallucination, and significant improvements in accuracy, even at very long context lengths. Claude 2.1 also includes improved system prompts – which are model instructions that provide a better experience for end users – while also reducing the cost of prompts and completions by 25%.For a growing number of customers who want to use a managed version of Meta’s publicly available Llama 2 model, Amazon Bedrock offers Llama 2 13B, and we’re adding Llama 2 70B. Llama 2 70B is suitable for large-scale tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and dialogue systems. The publicly available Llama models have been downloaded more than 30M times, and customers love that Amazon Bedrock offers them as part of a managed service where they don’t need to worry about infrastructure or have deep ML expertise on their teams. Additionally, for image generation, Stability AI offers a suite of popular text-to-image models. Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 (SDXL 1.0) is the most advanced of these, and it is now generally available in Amazon Bedrock. The latest edition of this popular image model has increased accuracy, better photorealism, and higher resolution.  Customers are also using Amazon Titan models, which are created and pretrained by AWS to offer powerful capabilities with great economics for a variety of use cases. Amazon has a 25 year track record in ML and AI—technology we use across our businesses—and we have learned a lot about building and deploying models. We have carefully chosen how we train our models and the data we use to do so. We indemnify customers against claims that our models or their outputs infringe on anyone’s copyright. We introduced our first Titan models in April of this year. Titan Text Lite—now generally available—is a succinct, cost-effective model for use cases like chatbots, text summarization, or copywriting, and it is also compelling to fine-tune. Titan Text Express—also now generally available—is more expansive, and can be used for a wider range of text-based tasks, such as open-ended text generation and conversational chat. We offer these text model options to give customers the ability to optimize for accuracy, performance, and cost depending on their use case and business requirements. Customers like Nexxiot, PGA Tour, and Ryanair are using our two Titan Text models. We also have an embeddings model, Titan Text Embeddings, for search use cases and personalization. Customers like Nasdaq are seeing great results using Titan Text Embeddings to enhance capabilities for Nasdaq IR Insight to generate insights from 9,000+ global companies’ documents for sustainability, legal, and accounting teams. And we’ll continue to add more models to the Titan family over time. We are introducing a new embeddings model, Titan Multimodal Embeddings, to power multimodal search and recommendation experiences for users using images and text (or a combination of both) as inputs. And we are introducing a new text-to-image model, Amazon Titan Image Generator. With Titan Image Generator, customers across industries like advertising, e-commerce, and media and entertainment can use a text input to generate realistic, studio-quality images in large volumes and at low cost. We are excited about how customers are responding to Titan Models, and you can expect that we’ll continue to innovate here.
New capabilities to customize your generative AI application securely with your proprietary data: One of the most important capabilities of Amazon Bedrock is how easy it is to customize a model. This becomes truly exciting for customers because it’s where generative AI meets their core differentiator—their data. However, it is really important that their data remains secure, that they have control of it along the way, and that model improvements are private to them. There are a few ways that you can do this, and Amazon Bedrock offers the broadest selection of customization options across multiple models). The first is fine tuning. Fine tuning a model in Amazon Bedrock is easy. You simply select the model and Amazon Bedrock makes a copy of it. Then you point to a few labeled examples (e.g., a series of good question-answer pairs) that you store in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon Bedrock “incrementally trains” (augments the copied model with the new information) on these examples, and the result is a private, more accurate fine-tuned model that delivers more relevant, customized responses. We are excited to announce that fine tuning is generally available for Cohere Command, Meta Llama 2, Amazon Titan Text (Lite and Express), Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings, and in preview for Amazon Titan Image Generator. And, through our collaboration with Anthropic, we will soon provide AWS customers early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning of its state-of-the-art model Claude.  A second technique for customizing LLMs and other FMs for your business is retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which allows you to customize a model’s responses by augmenting your prompts with data from multiple sources, including document repositories, databases, and APIs. In September, we introduced a RAG capability, Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock, that securely connects models to your proprietary data sources to supplement your prompts with more information so your applications deliver more relevant, contextual, and accurate responses. Knowledge Bases is now generally available with an API that performs the entire RAG workflow from fetching text needed to augment a prompt, to sending the prompt to the model, to returning the response. Knowledge Bases supports databases with vector capabilities that store numerical representations of your data (embeddings) that models use to access this data for RAG, including Amazon OpenSearch Service, and other popular databases like Pinecone and Redis Enterprise Cloud (Amazon Aurora and MongoDB vector support coming soon).  The third way you can customize models in Amazon Bedrock is with continued pre-training. With this method, the model builds on its original pre-training for general language understanding to learn domain-specific language and terminology. This approach is for customers who have large troves of unlabeled, domain-specific information and want to enable their LLMs to understand the language, phrases, abbreviations, concepts, definitions, and jargon unique to their world (and business). Unlike in fine-tuning, which takes a fairly small amount of data, continued pre-training is performed on large data sets (e.g., thousands of text documents). Now, pre-training capabilities are available in Amazon Bedrock for Titan Text Lite and Titan Text Express.
General availability of Agents for Amazon Bedrock to help execute multistep tasks using systems, data sources, and company knowledge. LLMs are great at having conversations and generating content, but customers want their applications to be able to do even more—like take actions, solve problems, and interact with a range of systems to complete multi-step tasks like booking travel, filing insurance claims, or ordering replacement parts. And Amazon Bedrock can help with this challenge. With agents, developers select a model, write a few basic instructions like “you are a cheerful customer service agent” and “check product availability in the inventory system,” point the selected model to the right data sources and enterprise systems (e.g., CRM or ERP applications), and write a few AWS Lambda functions to execute the APIs (e.g., check availability of an item in the ERP inventory). Amazon Bedrock automatically analyzes the request and breaks it down into a logical sequence using the selected model’s reasoning capabilities to determine what information is needed, what APIs to call, and when to call them to complete a step or solve a task. Now generally available, agents can plan and perform most business tasks—from answering customer questions about your product availability to taking their orders—and developers don’t need to be familiar with machine learning, engineer prompts, train models, or manually connect systems. And Bedrock does all of this securely and privately, and customers like Druva and Athene are already using them to improve the accuracy and speed of development of their generative AI applications.
Introducing Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock so you can apply safeguards based on your use case requirements and responsible AI policies. Customers want to be sure that interactions with their AI applications are safe, avoid toxic or offensive language, stay relevant to their business, and align with their responsible AI policies. With guardrails, customers can specify topics to avoid, and Amazon Bedrock will only provide users with approved responses to questions that fall in those restricted categories. For example, an online banking application can be set up to avoid providing investment advice, and remove inappropriate content (such as hate speech and violence). In early 2024, customers will also be able to redact personally identifiable information (PII) in model responses. For example, after a customer interacts with a call center agent the customer service conversation is often summarized for record keeping, and guardrails can remove PII from those summaries. Guardrails can be used across models in Amazon Bedrock (including fine-tuned models), and with Agents for Amazon Bedrock so customers can bring a consistent level of protection to all of their generative AI applications.

Top layer of the stack: Continued innovation makes generative AI accessible to more users
At the top layer of the stack are applications that leverage LLMs and other FMs so that you can take advantage of generative AI at work. One area where generative AI is already changing the game is in coding. Last year, we introduced Amazon CodeWhisperer, which helps you build applications faster and more securely by generating code suggestions and recommendations in near real-time. Customers like Accenture, Boeing, Bundesliga, The Cigna Group, Kone, and Warner Music Group are using CodeWhisperer to increase developer productivity—and Accenture is enabling up to 50,000 of their software developers and IT professionals with Amazon CodeWhisperer. We want as many developers as possible to be able to get the productivity benefits of generative AI, which is why CodeWhisperer offers recommendations for free to all individuals.
However, while AI coding tools do a lot to make developers’ lives easier, their productivity benefits are limited by their lack of knowledge of internal code bases, internal APIs, libraries, packages and classes. One way to think about this is that if you hire a new developer, even if they’re world-class, they’re not going to be that productive at your company until they understand your best practices and code. Today’s AI-powered coding tools are like that new-hire developer. To help with this, we recently previewed a new customization capability in Amazon CodeWhisperer that securely leverages a customer’s internal code base to provide more relevant and useful code recommendations. With this capability, CodeWhisperer is an expert on your code and provides recommendations that are more relevant to save even more time. In a study we did with Persistent, a global digital engineering and enterprise modernization company, we found that customizations help developers complete tasks up to 28% faster than with CodeWhisperer’s general capabilities. Now a developer at a healthcare technology company can ask CodeWhisperer to “import MRI images associated with the customer ID and run them through the image classifier“ to detect anomalies. Because CodeWhisperer has access to the code base it can provide much more relevant suggestions that include the import locations of the MRI images and customer IDs. CodeWhisperer keeps customizations completely private, and the underlying FM does not use them for training, protecting customers’ valuable intellectual property. AWS is the only major cloud provider that offers a capability like this to everyone.
Introducing Amazon Q, the generative AI-powered assistant tailored for work
Developers certainly aren’t the only ones who are getting hands on with generative AI—millions of people are using generative AI chat applications. What early providers have done in this space is exciting and super useful for consumers, but in a lot of ways they don’t quite “work” at work. Their general knowledge and capabilities are great, but they don’t know your company, your data, your customers, your operations, or your business. That limits how much they can help you. They also don’t know much about your role—what work you do, who you work with, what information you use, and what you have access to. These limitations are understandable because these assistants don’t have access to your company’s private information, and they weren’t designed to meet the data privacy and security requirements companies need to give them this access. It’s hard to bolt on security after the fact and expect it to work well. We think we have a better way, which will allow every person in every organization to use generative AI safely in their day-to-day work.
We are excited to introduce Amazon Q, a new type of generative AI-powered assistant that is specifically for work and can be tailored to your business. Q can help you get fast, relevant answers to pressing questions, solve problems, generate content, and take actions using the data and expertise found in your company’s information repositories, code, and enterprise systems. When you chat with Amazon Q, it provides immediate, relevant information and advice to help streamline tasks, speed decision-making, and help spark creativity and innovation at work. We have built Amazon Q to be secure and private, and it can understand and respect your existing identities, roles, and permissions and use this information to personalize its interactions. If a user doesn’t have permission to access certain data without Q, they can’t access it using Q either. We have designed Amazon Q to meet stringent enterprise customers’ requirements from day one—none of their content is used to improve the underlying models.

Amazon Q is your expert assistant for building on AWS: We’ve trained Amazon Q on 17 years’ worth of AWS knowledge and experience so it can transform the way you build, deploy, and operate applications and workloads on AWS. Amazon Q has a chat interface in the AWS Management Console and documentation, your IDE (via CodeWhisperer), and your team chat rooms on Slack or other chat apps. Amazon Q can help you explore new AWS capabilities, get started faster, learn unfamiliar technologies, architect solutions, troubleshoot, upgrade, and much more —it’s an expert in AWS well-architected patterns, best practices, documentation, and solutions implementations. Here are some examples of what you can do with your new AWS expert assistant:

Get crisp answers and guidance on AWS capabilities, services, and solutions: Ask Amazon Q to “Tell me about Agents for Amazon Bedrock,” and Q will give you a description of the feature plus links to relevant materials. You can also Ask Amazon Q virtually any question about how an AWS service works (e.g., “What are the scaling limits on a DynamoDB table?” “What is Redshift Managed Storage?”), or how to best architect any number of solutions (“What are the best practices for building event-driven architectures?”). And Amazon Q will pull together succinct answers and always cite (and link to) its sources.
Choose the best AWS service for your use case, and get started quickly: Ask Amazon Q “What are the ways to build a Web app on AWS? ” and it will provide a list of potential services like AWS Amplify, AWS Lambda, and Amazon EC2 with the advantages of each. From there you can narrow down the options by helping Q understand your requirements, preferences, and constraints (e.g., “Which of these would be best if I want to use containers?” or “Should I use a relational or non-relational database?”). Finish up with “How do I get started?” and Amazon Q will outline some basic steps and point you towards additional resources.
Optimize your compute resources: Amazon Q can help you select Amazon EC2 instances. If you ask it to “Help me find the right EC2 instance to deploy a video encoding workload for my gaming app with the highest performance”, Q will get you a list of instance families with reasons for each suggestion. And, you can ask any number of follow up questions to help find the best choice for your workload.
Get assistance debugging, testing, and optimizing your code: If you encounter an error while coding in your IDE, you can ask Amazon Q to help by saying, “My code has an IO error, can you provide a fix?” and Q will generate the code for you. If you like the suggestion, you can ask Amazon Q to add the fix to your application. Since Amazon Q is in your IDE, it understands the code you are working on and knows where to insert the fix. Amazon Q can also create unit tests (“Write unit tests for the selected function”) that it can insert into your code and you can run. Finally, Amazon Q can tell you ways to optimize your code for higher performance. Ask Q to “Optimize my selected DynamoDB query,” and it will use its understanding of your code to provide a natural language suggestion on what to fix along with the accompanying code you can implement in one click.
Diagnose and troubleshoot issues: If you encounter issues in the AWS Management Console, like EC2 permissions errors or Amazon S3 configuration errors, you can simply press the “Troubleshoot with Amazon Q” button, and it will use its understanding of the error type and service where the error is located to give you a suggestions for a fix. You can even ask Amazon Q to troubleshoot your network (e.g., “Why can’t I connect to my EC2 instance using SSH?”) and Q will analyze your end-to-end configuration and provide a diagnosis (e.g., “This instance appears to be in a private subnet, so public accessibility may need to be established”).
Ramp up on a new code base in no time: When you chat with Amazon Q in your IDE, it combines its expertise in building software with an understanding of your code—a powerful pairing! Previously, if you took over a project from someone else, or you were new to the team, you might have to spend hours manually reviewing the code and documentation to understand how it works and what it does. Now, since Amazon Q understands the code in your IDE, you can simply ask Amazon Q to explain the code (“Provide me with a description of what this application does and how it works”) and Q will give you details like which services the code uses and what different functions do (e.g., Q might answer with something like, “This application is building a basic support ticket system using Python Flask and AWS Lambda” and go on to describe each of its core capabilities, how they are implemented, and much more).
Clear your feature backlog faster: You can even ask Amazon Q to guide you through and automate much of the end-to-end process of adding a feature to your application in Amazon CodeCatalyst, our unified software development service for teams. To do this, you just assign Q a backlog task from your issues list – just like you would a teammate – and Q generates a step-by-step plan for how it will build and implement the feature. Once you approve the plan, Q will write the code and present the suggested changes to you as a code review. You can request rework (if necessary), approve and/or deploy!
Upgrade your code in a fraction of the time: Most developers actually only spend a fraction of their time writing new code and building new applications. They spend a lot more of their cycles on painful, sloggy areas like maintenance and upgrades. Take language version upgrades. A large number of customers continue using older versions of Java because it will take months—even years—and thousands of hours of developer time to upgrade. Putting this off has real costs and risks—you miss out on performance improvements and are vulnerable to security issues. We think Amazon Q can be a game changer here, and are excited about Amazon Q Code Transformation, a feature which can remove a lot of this heavy lifting and reduce the time it takes to upgrade applications from days to minutes. You just open the code you want to update in your IDE, and ask Amazon Q to “/transform” your code. Amazon Q will analyze the entire source code of the application, generate the code in the target language and version, and execute tests, helping you realize the security and performance enhancements of the latest language versions. Recently, a very small team of Amazon developers used Amazon Q Code Transformation to upgrade 1,000 production applications from Java 8 to Java 17 in just two days. The average time per application was less than 10 minutes. Today Amazon Q Code Transformation performs Java language upgrades from Java 8 or Java 11 to Java 17. Coming next (and soon) is the ability to transform .NET Framework to cross-platform .NET (with even more transformations to follow in the future).

Amazon Q is your business expert: You can connect Amazon Q to your business data, information, and systems so that it can synthesize everything and provide tailored assistance to help people solve problems, generate content, and take actions that are relevant to your business. Bringing Amazon Q to your business is easy. It has 40+ built-in connectors to popular enterprise systems such as Amazon S3, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, Gmail, Google Drive, and Zendesk. It can also connect to your internal intranet, wikis, and run books, and with the Amazon Q SDK, you can build a connection to whichever internal application you would like. Point Amazon Q at these repositories, and it will “ramp up” on your business, capturing and understanding the semantic information that makes your company unique. Then, you get your own friendly and simple Amazon Q web application so that employees across your company can interact with the conversational interface. Amazon Q also connects to your identity provider to understand a user, their role, and what systems they are permitted to access so that users can ask detailed, nuanced questions and get tailored results that include only information they are authorized to see. Amazon Q generates answers and insights that are accurate and faithful to the material and knowledge that you provide it, and you can restrict sensitive topics, block keywords, or filter out inappropriate questions and answers. Here are a few examples of what you can do with your business’s new expert assistant:

Get crisp, super-relevant answers based on your business data and information: Employees can ask Amazon Q about anything they might have previously had to search around for across all kinds of sources. Ask “What are the latest guidelines for logo usage?”, or “How do I apply for a company credit card?”, and Amazon Q will synthesize all of the relevant content it finds and come back with fast answers plus links to the relevant sources (e.g., brand portals and logo repositories, company T&E policies, and card applications).
Streamline day-to-day communications: Just ask, and Amazon Q can generate content (“Create a blog post and three social media headlines announcing the product described in this documentation”), create executive summaries (“Write a summary of our meeting transcript with a bulleted list of action items”), provide email updates (“Draft an email highlighting our Q3 training programs for customers in India”), and help structure meetings (“Create a meeting agenda to talk about the latest customer satisfaction report”).
Complete tasks: Amazon Q can help complete certain tasks, reducing the amount of time employees spend on repetitive work like filing tickets. Ask Amazon Q to “Summarize customer feedback on the new pricing offer in Slack,” and then request that Q take that information and open a ticket in Jira to update the marketing team. You can ask Q to “Summarize this call transcript,” and then “Open a new case for Customer A in Salesforce.” Amazon Q supports other popular work automation tools like Zendesk and Service Now.

Amazon Q is in Amazon QuickSight: With Amazon Q in QuickSight, AWS’s business intelligence service, users can ask their dashboards questions like “Why did the number of orders increase last month?” and get visualizations and explanations of the factors that influenced the increase. And, analysts can use Amazon Q to reduce the time it takes them to build dashboards from days to minutes with a simple prompt like “Show me sales by region by month as a stacked bar chart.” Q comes right back with that diagram, and you can easily add it to a dashboard or chat further with Q to refine the visualization (e.g., “Change the bar chart into a Sankey diagram,” or “Show countries instead of regions”). Amazon Q in QuickSight also makes it easier to use existing dashboards to inform business stakeholders, distill key insights, and simplify decision-making using data stories. For example, users may prompt Amazon Q to “Build a story about how the business has changed over the last month for a business review with senior leadership,” and in seconds, Amazon Q delivers a data-driven story that is visually compelling and is completely customizable. These stories can be shared securely throughout the organization to help align stakeholders and drive better decisions.
Amazon Q is in Amazon Connect: In Amazon Connect, our contact center service, Amazon Q helps your customer service agents provide better customer service. Amazon Q leverages the knowledge repositories your agents typically use to get information for customers, and then agents can chat with Amazon Q directly in Connect to get answers that help them respond more quickly to customer requests without needing to search through the documentation themselves. And, while chatting with Amazon Q for super-fast answers is great, in customer service there is no such thing as too fast. That’s why Amazon Q In Connect turns a live customer conversation with an agent into a prompt, and automatically providing the agent possible responses, suggested actions, and links to resources. For example, Amazon Q can detect that a customer is contacting a rental car company to change their reservation, generate a response for the agent to quickly communicate how the company’s change fee policies apply, and guide the agent through the steps they need to update the reservation.
Amazon Q is in AWS Supply Chain (Coming Soon): In AWS Supply Chain, our supply chain insights service, Amazon Q helps supply and demand planners, inventory managers, and trading partners optimize their supply chain by summarizing and highlighting potential stockout or overstock risks, and visualize scenarios to solve the problem. Users can ask Amazon Q “what,” “why,” and “what if” questions about their supply chain data and chat through complex scenarios and the tradeoffs between different supply chain decisions. For example, a customer may ask, “What’s causing the delay in my shipments and how can I speed things up?” to which Amazon Q may reply, “90% of your orders are on the east coast, and a big storm in the Southeast is causing a 24-hour delay. If you ship to the port of New York instead of Miami, you’ll expedite deliveries and reduce costs by 50%.”
Our customers are adopting generative AI quickly—they are training groundbreaking models on AWS, they are developing generative AI applications at record speed using Amazon Bedrock, and they are deploying game-changing applications across their organizations like Amazon Q. With our latest announcements, AWS is bringing customers even more performance, choice, and innovation to every layer of the stack. The combined impact of all the capabilities we’re delivering at re:Invent marks a major milestone toward meeting an exciting and meaningful goal: We are making generative AI accessible to customers of all sizes and technical abilities so they can get to reinventing and transforming what is possible.

Workplace challenges in using artificial intelligence

11/28/23
Author: Gordon M. Berger, Partner



Will artificial intelligence (“AI”) programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard replace humans and start to take our jobs? Will the apoplectic outcome seen in some movies play out and result in the demise of the human race?
While no one really knows for sure what the future of AI looks like (or the human race), PEOs should be focusing on how AI tools can assist their clients, but with the understanding that this is an emerging technology that remains in flux. Yes, increasingly, employers are using AI in the workplace to locate, recruit, evaluate and communicate with job applicants. Employers are also using AI to assist employees with benefits or benefits enrollment, training, writing job descriptions, to avert spam attacks or to translate documents and forms into foreign languages.
Clearly, there are pitfalls and risks of using AI in the workplace. AI can violate the privacy of worker or operate in discriminatory manner towards certain protected classes of employees.
When we think of AI in the workplace, we are not talking about algorithms that predict an outcome or predictions – we are talking about generative AI, which uses algorithms that generate new results based on the data it has been fed (or trained on).
The challenge and concern is that AI programs are created by humans and therefore AI programs are inherently flawed and biased. Therefore, the use of AI in the workplace can create employee claims under such laws as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (“Title VII”), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and state law counterparts.
AI has been on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (“EEOC’s”) radar for some time. In 2021, the EEOC formed an initiative to address AI. As part of the initiative, the EEOC pledged to:

Issue technical assistance to provide guidance on algorithmic fairness and the use of AI in employment decisions;
Identify promising practices;
Hold listening sessions with key stakeholders about algorithmic tools and their employment ramifications; and
Gather information about the adoption, design, and impact of hiring and other employment-related technologies.

Then, on May 18, 2023, the EEOC issued technical guidance on the use of AI to assess job applicants and employees under Title VII. In short, AI tools can violate Title VII under a disparate impact analysis, which looks at whether persons in protected classes (e.g., race, sex or age) are hired at disproportionately lower rates compared to those outside of the protected classes.
Further, EEOC Chairwoman Charlotte Burrows is on record as saying that more than 80% of employers are using AI in some form of their work and employment decision-making. Given the apparent volume of employers using AI, the EEOC will certainly focus on AI-related discrimination in employment.
Note that the EEOC looks at disparate impact discrimination by using the “four-fifths rule” enumerated in 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4(D). According to the four-fifths rule,” a selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths (4/5) of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact, while a greater than four-fifths rate will generally not be regarded by Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact.” The EEOC guidance uses the following example to illustrate this rule: if an algorithm used for a personality test selects Black applicants at a rate of 30% and White applicants at a rate of 60% resulting in a 50% selection rate for Black applicants as compared to White applicants (30/60 = 50%), the 50% rate suggests disparate impact discrimination because it is lower than 4/5 (80%) of the rate at which White applicants were selected.
One example of possible AI bias is related to the EEOC lawsuit against a company that was using AI for job candidate screening (EEOC v. iTutorGroup, Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 1:22-cv-02565 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York). That company paid $365,000 to settle the lawsuit in which the EEOC alleged age discrimination by disqualifying more than 200 female workers over the age of 55 and males over 60. An applicant who was not considered for a position with the company resubmitted a job application with a more recent birth date but the remainder of the information was identical to the original (rejected) application. She was offered an interview when she presented as being younger.
Other agencies have addressed AI in the workplace. On the same day that the EEOC issued its technical guidance on AI, the Department of Justice posted its own guidance on AI-related disability discrimination and how the use of AI could violate the ADA.
On the state level, Illinois led the way in 2019 with one of the first AI workplace laws, the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, which regulates employers that use an AI to analyze video interviews of applicants for positions based in Illinois. Employers are required to make certain disclosures and obtain consent from applicants if they use AI-enabled video interviews. And, if employers rely solely on AI to make certain interview decisions, they must keep applicant demographic data, including race and ethnicity, which must be submitted annually to the state to look at whether there was racial bias in the use of the AI.
Then came Maryland in 2020, which passed a law restricting employers’ use of facial recognition services during preemployment interviews until an employer receives consent from the applicant.
Takeaways

AI should not be solely relied on with respect to employment decisions. If AI is making hiring or termination decisions, management or HR should still review and ensure that decisions are made with an unlawful purpose (i.e., not based on a protect classification, including race, religion, age, gender, disability, etc.).
AI is known to make up information. You may have heard about a law firm that used AI for legal research and the AI provided case law citations that did not exist (i.e., fictitious cases) which resulted in the law firm being sanctioned by the court.
Employers are not excused from complying with the law if AI gets it wrong. Per the EEOC, employers are liable under Title VII for “algorithmic decision-making tools even if the tools are designed or administered by another entity, such as a software vendor”.
Check state and local law for any AI-specific requirements. For instance, New York City has a law that prohibits employers from making certain employment decisions using AI unless notice has been given to employees or candidates who live in the City. And, California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently issued an executive order on IA that includes a number of provisions intended to review potential threats to and vulnerabilities of California’s critical energy infrastructure by the use of GenAI.

(CNW Group/KPMG LLP)KPMG's latest Generative AI Adoption survey of 4,515 Canadians found that not only are the number of Canadians using the tool growing, but those who use it are doing so more frequently than just six months ago. More than six in 10 (61 per cent) generative AI users now use the technology multiple times a week for work purposes, up from five in 10 (52 per cent) in May. One in five Canadians are using generative AI daily.""The incredible speed of adoption after just one year of being introduced to the general public shows how generative AI has not only revolutionized the way people work, but it's supercharged the speed of technology innovation as well, with breakthroughs happening at a much faster rate,"" says Seamus Blackmore, a partner at KPMG in Canada and Toronto-based product leader in Lighthouse, the firm's emerging technology practice.""Many generative AI systems have already evolved from large language models to being multi-modal systems, meaning they create content from photos or voice commands rather than just text prompts. For business leaders, it's imperative to keep up with this rapidly evolving technology, understand how it could affect their business, and adapt their strategies accordingly if they want to compete.""Mr. Blackmore notes that adoption of the tool in the workplace is growing at an annualized growth rate of 32 per cent, which suggests that half of all Canadian workers could be using it within three years.""When the tool first became available, workers were experimenting with it to see what it could do and if it could help them work smarter. Our survey clearly shows that generative AI has become a key resource for many Canadian professionals, with more than nine in 10 users saying it improves their work, and seven in 10 saying it's essential to managing their workload,"" Mr. Blackmore notes. KPMG created Canada's first-ever Generative AI Adoption Index to measure the intensity by which Canadians are using generative AI tools in the workplace, with the goal of understanding and analyzing the risks and benefits of the technology to organizations and society.The Index now stands at 14.6, reflecting a 28 per cent growth rate since May 2023, when KPMG introduced the metric. A score of 100 indicates mass adoption.Story continuesWith generative AI uptake among Canada's labour force growing over the past six months, trends are emerging on how employees are using the technology at work. Users are more diligent about checking the accuracy of content generated by AI, and they're more transparent with their employers about their use of the tools.Key survey highlights:20 per cent of generative AI users are using the technology daily (up from 18 per cent in May)41 per cent say they use it a few times a week (up from 34 per cent)77 per cent say their employers know they use generative AI at work, (up from 64 per cent)55 per cent say they always check the accuracy of information produced by generative AI (up from 49 per cent)90 per cent say generative AI tools have enhanced the quality of their professional work (up from 84 per cent)72 per cent say using generative AI is essential to addressing their workload (up from 65 per cent)76 per cent say using generative AI tools has allowed them to take on additional work that they would not have had the capacity to take on (up from 67 per cent)Increased productivityThe survey found that that employees using generative AI at work are experiencing higher productivity gains than first reported months ago. Nearly six in 10 (58 per cent) users say generative AI helps them save between one to five hours of work per week, up from 55 per cent in May.Mr. Blackmore says that as generative AI matures, more users are learning how to harness its benefits, leading to increased productivity. ""Since generative AI was introduced to the general public one year ago with the release ChatGPT, users have become more knowledgeable about how to make effective prompts, which in turn yields better results more quickly - and they probably have an edge at work because they're saving more time as a result,"" he says.How has the use of generative AI tools impacted your productivity at work?MAY 2023(1,052 users)NOVEMBER 2023(1,004 users)It saves me less than one hour of work per week22 per cent19 per centIt saves me one to two hours of work per week31 per cent31 per centIt saves me three to five hours of work per week24 per cent  27 per centIt saves me six to nine hours of work per week7 per cent   11 per centIt saves me 10 or more hours of work per week5 per cent   4 per centIt adds to my workload because I spend more time trying to correct and verify the content it generates3 per cent   3 per centIt doesn't save me any time at all8 per cent   6 per cent Public vs. private generative AIMore than three-quarters of users (76 per cent) rely on publicly available generative AI tools to help with their work tasks, while the other quarter (24 per cent) use private generative AI tools built exclusively by their employers.Interestingly, employees using private AI platforms for work are experiencing higher productivity gains than those using publicly available tools. Just over half (51 per cent) of users who rely on private tools save more than three hours of work each week, compared to 40 per cent using publicly available platforms.Marc Low, a Vancouver-based director at KPMG Ignition, the firm's innovation lab, says the recent proliferation of bespoke enterprise generative AI platforms is making it easier for organizations to implement their own systems as they become more accessible, cheaper and more powerful. ""We're likely to see more organizations adopting private generative AI systems as access to customizable tools continues to expand - and the more employees use these tools, the more they will reap the benefits.""Mr. Low says many organizations are interested in adopting private generative AI systems but hesitate to jump in because they are overwhelmed by the number of new tools entering the market, frequent technology updates and the constantly changing dynamics of the market.""There's a lot of noise around generative AI. For business leaders, it can lead to serious FOMO (fear of missing out) and the desire to jump in quickly in an effort to keep up with competitors, but that can lead to poor decisions and wasted investments,"" Mr. Low says.He suggests organizations do a thorough assessment of how generative AI will impact their operations, and then identify a part of the business where they can experiment and test the technology in a structured way. He also recommends organizations explore a range of generative AI tools and use cases to test and validate impact, value and uptake.""Adopting generative AI because it's the latest trend or because everyone else is doing it is not a sound business strategy. Organizations need to be intentional about generative AI; define why it's needed, where it will have the greatest impact, and how to measure improvements in productivity and competitiveness to ensure return on investment,"" Mr. Low says.Mr. Low says it's noteworthy that of the respondents who aren't using generative AI tools for work, more than one-quarter (27 per cent) don't see the benefits of using the technology in their roles, and nearly the same proportion find them too complicated or don't have the proper training on how to use them. ""This suggests that more education is needed for employers and employees to fully understand how transformative generative AI can be if integrated and deployed effectively,"" he adds.KPMG in Canada and Microsoft Canada recently launched the Operational Risk Skills Development Centre, a co-developed initiative in Quebec that offers free hands-on French training courses on generative AI for C-Suite and board members.

The Index is based on a KPMG in Canada survey of 4,515 Canadians conducted from October 20 to November 6, 2023, using Sago's Methodify online research platform. Of the total surveyed, 1,004 respondents said they use generative AI tools. The margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points, with a confidence level of 95 per cent.About KPMG in CanadaKPMG LLP, a limited liability partnership, is a full-service Audit, Tax and Advisory firm owned and operated by Canadians.

As the 2024 U.S. elections gain momentum, political campaigns and advertising agencies are turning to a new ally, artificial intelligence, to disseminate their messages. This emerging technology presents both risks and potential benefits for the political advertising industry. AI-powered tools can generate new text, images, video, and speech from a single prompt to weave into campaign messages. Political campaigns are already using these tools to create messages for ads and fundraising solicitations. AI software can even compose campaign emails. Generative AI is poised to redefine modern campaigning, although the exact nature of its influence remains uncertain. However, despite calls for regulation or moratoria in Congress, the Federal Election Commission, and even the political consultants’ trade association, national lawmakers have yet to address the new technology.
New AI software products are inexpensive, require almost no training to use, and can generate seemingly limitless content. These tools can support personalized advertising at scale, reducing the need for large digital teams and leveling the playing field for campaigns that lack substantial resources. Yet AI also introduces a novel set of challenges, from a tendency to generate bland and repetitive text to the risk of misleading audiences and amplifying ongoing election misinformation issues. This essay examines ways in which AI — and specifically large language models that generate text — can enhance campaigns’ voter outreach efforts, the cautions that campaigns must exercise when embracing new AI tools, and the market forces affecting both the technology itself and campaigns’ experience as generative AI consumers.
We focus primarily on considerations that could influence the decision-making of campaigns themselves. Other essays in this series delve into broader threats to democracy associated with AI use, like the disturbing trend of AI-generated deepfakes in campaigns and AI as a tool for voter suppression, along with policy responses to these problems. Here, we take a campaign’s-eye view of some of the strengths and weaknesses of generative AI in political advertising and the likely course that the market will take.

The Department of Homeland Security is leaning into the use of generative artificial intelligence by issuing new guidance on how its workforce should use commercial applications of the technology and experimenting with building its own models, the department’s top IT official told FedScoop.
DHS is rolling out a set of policies around specific AI technologies — a process that started in September with the publication of guidance on the use of facial recognition and face capture technologies and continues now with a policy governing how the department will use commercial generative AI models.
The memo is signed and dated Oct. 24 but was uploaded to the department’s website Thursday. DHS also recently issued a privacy impact statement on commercial generative AI tools conditionally approved for use within the department, including ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Claude 2 and DALL-E2.
During an interview on FedScoop’s Daily Scoop Podcast, CIO Eric Hysen said DHS developed the new policy using the White House’s AI executive order and the corresponding Office of Management and Budget draft memo on how federal agencies should implement the order “to make sure that we have a comprehensive governance approach to specific types of AI technology that are in use across the department.”

“Our strategy has been that because AI is such a broad technology — or set of technologies — we are issuing specific guidance on different types of AI technology,” Hysen said.
Within the new guidance, Hysen writes he has “determined that DHS must enable and encourage DHS personnel to responsibly use commercial products to harness the benefits of Gen AI and ensure we continuously adapt to the future of work.”
The memo lays out how the department will “develop and maintain a list of conditionally approved commercial Gen AI tools for use on open-source information only” — such as those included in the recent privacy assessment — and security requirements and standards that personnel must follow when using commercial generative AI models.
“Immediate appropriate applications of commercial Gen AI tools to DHS business could include generating first drafts of documents that a human would subsequently review, conducting and synthesizing research on open-source information, and developing briefing materials or preparing for meetings and events. I have personally found these tools valuable in these use cases already, and encourage employees to learn, identify, and share other valuable uses with each other,” the memo reads.
At the same time, DHS has also been “experimenting” with building out its own large language models in-house and with the support of industry, he said.

“What we’re really looking to do there is learn,” Hysen told FedScoop. “I want a portfolio of AI projects that use models from different companies that let us understand what the benefits of different types are, that use some closed proprietary models, that use some open-source models, that test out different ways of deploying these models, some that might be shared commercial cloud instances, some that we might deploy on our cloud infrastructure, some that we might deploy in-house on our own hardware. We’re really in a learning mode here and are looking to try many different things technically, which is, as I’ve talked with other CIOs across government and across the private sector, I think, really the mode everyone is in.”
“We want to be maximizing our ability to learn how we can leverage these technologies in support of our mission,” he said.
DHS also issued broader guidance in September governing how DHS components should acquire and use AI and machine learning technologies.
Around that same time, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas named Hysen — who’s been CIO of the department since 2021 — as DHS’s first chief AI officer. And back in April, Mayorkas launched a DHS Artificial Intelligence Task Force, which — co-chaired by Hysen — is responsible for producing the policies.
As such, Hysen and DHS have been developing a vision for the adoption and responsible use of AI that precedes the White House order and draft OMB guidance, which will require federal agencies to have chief AI officers within 60 days, once the directive is finalized. FedScoop has been tracking those CAIOs as they’re named.

“This is not something that just started when we added this title,” Hysen said. “This is work that has been going on for many years — many of our agencies and offices have been using AI and data science and machine learning in their operations for many years now. But … with the explosion of interest in generative AI and other topics over the last year, we’ve seen a need to really focus our approach across the department.”
The release of the executive order didn’t necessarily change any of that either because DHS has been working closely with the White House and anticipated its requirements. 
“As you can imagine, with any document as comprehensive as the president’s executive order, it had been in the works for quite a while and many parts of the department had been working closely with the White House and the interagency for some time on several aspects of it. So we were anticipating some of the requirements there,” he said. 
Hysen said that Mayorkas has been a driving force behind the department’s leaning into AI adoption, instead of hesitating as some federal agencies have.
“Very early he was using ChatGPT and other tools, right after they were released, in his personal life, and asking me and others how we could be leveraging the benefits of those technologies to better empower our workforce and give them what they need to get their job done,” Hysen said.

“Every day, we interact with more members of the public on a daily basis than any other federal agency. And the workload that our employees have is only growing,” he said. “And so when it comes to our use of AI within the department, the secretary saw very early that this could be a tool that could act as a force multiplier for us that could allow our agents and officers on the frontlines to spend less time doing routine paperwork, and more time actually focused on their security missions that would ultimately enhance our homeland security.”

AI has an unquestionable impact,N/A,,,N/A,N/A,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has enormous potential for making the world a better place to live. AI has an unquestionable impact on the global industry, despite its arguable benefits and drawbacks. Every day, it grows, ensuring the long-term viability of businesses. To succeed in many new-age jobs, AI literacy and up skilling are certainly required. 
Artificial intelligence has drastically transformed the way numerous sectors operate. The health, education, manufacturing, business, and agricultural sectors are all heavily influenced by technology. AI has also opened up a slew of new work prospects for the general public. There is a lot of discussion about how AI and robotics are gradually taking over occupations. The technology eliminates jobs, but it also creates new opportunities for people. AI is here to stay, and it will assist people in working more efficiently. The role of AI in worker rights is critical.
AI boosts worker productivity
All industries are attempting to incorporate AI to assist their employees in increasing their productivity. It aids in the solving of difficulties, the completion of complex activities, and increases worker efficiency by removing human errors. With AI and robots, everything from gathering data to analyzing it and providing feedback is really simple. Many large companies, for example, use chat boxes to communicate with their customers on a daily basis. This is often utilized for providing prompt customer service. This, in turn, boosts productivity and has proven to be quite profitable.

The leak of sensitive documents without the awareness of employees is a widespread concern in today's business world. However, AI ensures that a company's data and documents are safe. Artificial intelligence is boosting the labor market, but it is also putting employees' rights in jeopardy. Many workers are losing their employment as a result of the introduction of more efficient machinery and technology, which reduces manpower efficiency. Smart systems and automated functions are progressively replacing human labor.
AI is more accurate and capable of handling difficult tasks than humans 
Humans have a tendency to make mistakes. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is impervious to mistakes. They are extremely precise in whatever they do. Jobs like data entry, typing, and data analytics should be error-free, or else confusion may arise. All of these jobs can be efficiently taken over by AI.
Various factory jobs result in people being gravely hurt or murdered. In this situation, AI can be utilized to keep workers safe and do tasks efficiently. While machines can be damaged or destroyed, they are sufficiently robust to survive threats. Despite its many benefits, AI will never be able to take over occupations because of the following reasons:
Machines are unable to think creatively
Regardless of how capable AI is at carrying out tasks, at the end of the day, it is humans who need to think creatively, plan out plans during a crisis, and use their brains to lay the groundwork and make critical decisions.
While AI can be useful, it cannot run a business without the support of humans. AI will not be able to replace any job that demands critical thinking or creative problem-solving.
Also Read: Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2022
AI is incapable of forming strong bonds
It's all about making connections with other businesses and customers in the business world. Machines or robots lack the ability to build human-to-human trust and connection, which is required to relax, communicate, and open up. Machines can assist with technical tasks, but they lack human intimacy. Communication skills, empathy, strategic thinking, common sense, and decision-making abilities are all lacking in machines and robots.

BOSTON - There are a lot of myths, predictions, and half-truths about artificial intelligence: it's coming for your job. It's too risky. Generative AI, harnessed through programs like ChatGPT, is a popular technology that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos.In fact, AI can write entire academic essays, outlines, bibliographies – you name it.""AI is a great tool to augment what you do but we have to have humans checking the work,"" said Patty Patria, the Chief Information Officer at Babson College. ""If we are not checking the work that AI is generating, then we are not using it properly.""A recent survey by BestColleges revealed that 56% of college students admit completing assignments using AI technology.

In fact, when WBZ-TV surveyed random students at Boston University and Northeastern, many said they, too, use it for schoolwork. ""It's pretty convenient to give you a broad view,"" one Northeastern student said. ""I've been using ChatGPT for most of my assignments and it works really well,"" a BU student said. ""I sometimes use it as a background resource to get information on a subject and then I go from there,"" another added.There are obvious concerns: plagiarism, inaccurate information, and students not learning how to write their own papers or do their own work. 


""We have seen that our library has received more requests for interlibrary loans, for books or journals that don't even exist because somebody looks at a reference that was generated by a generative AI model that has, you know, journals and books in there that don't exist,"" Tilman Wolf, the Senior Vice Provost of Academic Affairs at UMass Amherst explained. But the popularity of the technology makes it hard for local universities to ignore, and as a result, most are currently in the process of developing AI policies or strategies for students and faculty.""I think the best thing to do is to leave it up to the faculty members to decide what makes sense to them. The really important thing is to articulate what these expectations are by the faculty members, so that the students know what to do,"" Wolf explained. ""We're at the beginning but I think pretty ahead of other high learning institutions in terms of creating an AI model,"" added Patty Patria of Babson. The college hopes to have a formal policy on the books by the end of the academic year.Some considerations and recommendations they offer professors:Forbid the use of AI.Discourage AI use – but require proper      credit when AI is used.Encourage – and even assign – AI      augmented work.Decide whether AI can be used on a case-by-case      basis for assignments.""Generative AI models are not going to go away,"" Tilman Wolf said. ""And I think the important thing is that we create awareness on our campus, what they can and cannot do, and that we think about how we can be transparent about where we use them and where we don't use them, and that we train our students so that they are prepared for the workforce where they can use these tools in an appropriate manner.""If you have a question you'd like us to look into, please email questioneverything@cbsboston.com.

""If we are not checking the work that AI is generating, then we are not using it properly.""A recent survey by BestColleges revealed that 56% of college students admit completing assignments using AI technology.In fact, when WBZ-TV surveyed random students at Boston University and Northeastern, many said they, too, use it for schoolwork. ""It's pretty convenient to give you a broad view,"" one Northeastern student said. ""I've been using ChatGPT for most of my assignments and it works really well,"" a BU student said. ""I sometimes use it as a background resource to get information on a subject and then I go from there,"" another added.There are obvious concerns: plagiarism, inaccurate information, and students not learning how to write their own papers or do their own work. ""We have seen that our library has received more requests for interlibrary loans, for books or journals that don't even exist because somebody looks at a reference that was generated by a generative AI model that has, you know, journals and books in there that don't exist,"" Tilman Wolf, the Senior Vice Provost of Academic Affairs at UMass Amherst explained. But the popularity of the technology makes it hard for local universities to ignore, and as a result, most are currently in the process of developing AI policies or strategies for students and faculty.""I think the best thing to do is to leave it up to the faculty members to decide what makes sense to them. The really important thing is to articulate what these expectations are by the faculty members, so that the students know what to do,"" Wolf explained. ""We're at the beginning but I think pretty ahead of other high learning institutions in terms of creating an AI model,"" added Patty Patria of Babson. The college hopes to have a formal policy on the books by the end of the academic year.Some considerations and recommendations they offer professors:Forbid the use of AI.Discourage AI use – but require proper      credit when AI is used.Encourage – and even assign – AI      augmented work.Decide whether AI can be used on a case-by-case      basis for assignments.""Generative AI models are not going to go away,"" Tilman Wolf said. ""And I think the important thing is that we create awareness on our campus, what they can and cannot do, and that we think about how we can be transparent about where we use them and where we don't use them, and that we train our students so that they are prepared for the workforce where they can use these tools in an appropriate manner.""If you have a question you'd like us to look into, please email questioneverything@cbsboston.com.   ",,,,,,,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 630, 'width': 1200, 'url': 'https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/29/dfb7af5f-6c53-41ee-a505-a88ec86cf5ee/thumbnail/1200x630/81c5e2eac15d2afa6b5676462063f120/ai.jpg?v=e2b758f558b9b19612f3e16bc7fd9fcc'}","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/video/question-everything-how-are-colleges-handling-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence/'}, 'name': 'Question Everything: How are colleges handling the use of artificial intelligence?', 'description': ""A recent survey revealed that 56% of college students admit completing assignments using AI technology.

If you’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed by the buzz surrounding generative AI, you’re not alone. Let us face it, our industry is evolving, and so are the tools and strategies we use to find the best talent out there. We’ve all had that sinking feeling, wondering if our hard-earned skills are becoming obsolete in the face of these intelligent machines. Are we going to be replaced by algorithms that can analyse candidates faster than we ever could?
Let us not get ahead of ourselves. Remember, we’re the experts here, and we have the human touch that machines can’t replicate.
In this post, we’ll dive into the future of talent acquisition in the age of generative AI. We’ll explore how to harness this cutting-edge technology while staying true to our human instincts and values.
What is generative AI? 
Generative AI is a remarkable branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new and original content. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on pre-existing data to make predictions or perform tasks, generative AI has the incredible ability to generate entirely new and unique outputs.
Think of it as an AI-powered creative genius, capable of composing music, writing stories, designing artwork and even producing realistic human-like speech.
It’s like having an AI collaborator that can generate content that is not simply a replication of what it has learned but rather a creative expression that pushes boundaries and explores new frontiers.
Generative AI leverages advanced algorithms and neural networks to analyse patterns and structures in vast amounts of data. By learning from this data, it can understand the underlying characteristics and generate outputs that align with those patterns, all while adding its own touch of creativity.
Future of recruitment with generative AI
When it comes to generative AI in the talent-acquisition process, we can let our imagination run wild with the potential developments that lie ahead. Here, we explore a few speculative glimpses into what the future may hold.
Remember, these speculations are just the tip of the iceberg. The future of generative AI in talent acquisition holds immense potential for revolutionising how organisations identify and engage top talent. As we journey forward, it’s essential to approach these advancements with a thoughtful and ethical mindset, ensuring that technology augments human judgment rather than replacing it.
1. Predictive candidate fit
The evolution of generative AI can empower recruiters to predict candidate fit with remarkable precision. By leveraging advanced algorithms, AI systems can analyse vast amounts of data, including resumes, social-media profiles and online assessments. This analysis would go beyond surface-level qualifications and delve into the nuances of cultural alignment and team dynamics. Recruiters would benefit from predictive insights that guide them towards candidates who not only possess the necessary skills but also possess the qualities that align with the organisation’s values and contribute to a positive work environment.
2. Job performance projections
Imagine generative AI going beyond traditional candidate-assessment methods and providing projections of a candidate’s future job performance. By leveraging historical data on successful employees and correlating it with candidate attributes, AI algorithms could generate predictive models. These models would estimate how well a candidate is likely to perform in a specific role based on factors such as their past experiences, skill set and behavioral traits. Recruiters could then make more informed decisions, selecting candidates with higher potential for success, leading to improved organisational outcomes.
3. Personalised candidate experiences 
In the future, generative AI can transform the candidate experience by offering highly personalised journeys. By analysing a candidate’s preferences, communication styles, and engagement patterns, AI algorithms could craft tailored interactions at every touchpoint. Candidates would receive customised job recommendations based on their interests, targeted content that resonates with their motivations, and even personalised interview processes that accommodate their individual needs. This level of personalisation would create a more engaging and positive candidate experience, fostering stronger connections between candidates and organisations.
4. Bias mitigation
Generative AI has the potential to address the long-standing challenge of bias in talent acquisition. Aartificial intelligence algorithms can be trained to detect and mitigate biases by focusing on objective criteria and reducing reliance on subjective factors. These algorithms would learn from historical data to recognise patterns and biases in candidate evaluation, enabling recruiters to make fairer and more unbiased decisions. By mitigating bias, generative AI can contribute to creating a more inclusive and diverse workforce, promoting equal opportunities for all candidates.
5. Continuous learning and adaptation 
In the future, generative AI systems could continually learn and adapt based on their interactions with candidates and recruiters. By analysing feedback, performance data, and real-time outcomes, these systems would refine their algorithms and models over time. This iterative learning process would lead to increasingly accurate and reliable candidate assessments. As a result, recruiters would benefit from AI systems that evolve and improve, enhancing the effectiveness of their talent-acquisition efforts and ensuring they stay aligned with the evolving needs of the organization.
Synergy between AI and humans 
The future of recruiting is a synergistic partnership between human recruiters and AI technologies, where strategic insights and human connection are blended with the efficiency and analytical power of AI. Together, recruiters and AI can transform the talent-acquisition process and shape the future of work.
In this evolving landscape, recruiters have the opportunity to elevate their role and become strategic talent advisors who guide organisations in making informed talent decisions. By embracing AI technologies and leveraging their strengths, recruiters can focus on building relationships, shaping talent-acquisition strategies, and ensuring that the right talent is brought on board to drive organisational success.
One of the ways AI can empower recruiters is by automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks. AartificiaI-intelligence algorithms can quickly sift through vast volumes of resumes, screening candidates based on predefined criteria and eliminating the need for manual resume screening.
This automation frees up recruiters’ time, allowing them to focus on more strategic aspects of talent acquisition, such as relationship building, candidate engagement and assessing cultural fit.
Moreover, generative AI can aid in the creation of compelling job descriptions. By analysing successful past job descriptions and candidate preferences, AI algorithms can generate language that resonates with candidates, ensuring the job posting stands out in a crowded market.
Recruiters can then allocate their energy to understanding the nuances of the role and organisation, crafting personalised outreach, and building a strong employer brand.
Generative AI can also assist recruiters in sourcing top talent. By analysing vast amounts of data, including social-media profiles, online portfolios and professional networks, AI algorithms can identify potential candidates who may not be actively seeking job opportunities.
This proactive sourcing approach enables recruiters to tap into a wider talent pool, providing access to high-quality candidates who might have been overlooked otherwise.
While AI technologies can augment recruiters’ capabilities, they do not replace the human element. Recruiters bring invaluable emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills to the table. They excel at building relationships, understanding complex organizational dynamics, and evaluating intangible qualities such as cultural fit and adaptability. Serving as powerful tools, AI technologies enhance recruiters’ abilities and enable them to work more efficiently and effectively.
Balancing efficiency and ethics
In conclusion, the future of talent acquisition in the age of generative AI is both promising and challenging. As AI continues to evolve and integrate seamlessly into the recruitment process, companies must strive to remain competitive by embracing these technologies. By harnessing the power of AI, organisations can streamline their talent-acquisition process, reduce human bias and identify the best candidates more efficiently, leading to a stronger and more diverse workforce.
However, the adoption of AI in talent acquisition should not be taken lightly, as it comes with a responsibility to ensure ethical and responsible use. Companies must prioritise transparency, fairness and accountability in their AI-powered recruitment systems. This entails regular audits and assessments of AI algorithms to prevent potential biases, discrimination and unintended consequences. Additionally, organisations must also focus on upskilling their HR professionals, enabling them to understand and manage AI tools effectively and responsibly.
As we look to the future, a successful talent-acquisition strategy will depend on striking the right balance between leveraging the capabilities of AI and preserving human values and ethics in recruitment processes. By doing so, organisations will not only attract the best talent but also foster a culture of innovation, diversity and inclusivity, positioning themselves as leaders in the increasingly competitive global market. The future of talent acquisition in the age of generative AI is undoubtedly full of potential, and it is up to us to harness it responsibly and ethically, shaping the workforce of tomorrow.

<p>A recent study by Pearson, a British Multinational Publishing and Education company has revealed that generative AI poses a greater threat to white-collar jobs than blue-collar ones. The study titled “Skills Outlook 2023: The Future of Jobs in the Age of <a href=""https://www.dnpindia.in/technology/amazon-launches-free-generative-ai-courses-details-inside/333007/"">Generative AI</a>” has come to the conclusion that generative AI is capable of augmenting or automating up to 30 Percent of routine tasks done by white-collar jobs in India. White, it barely automates 1 per cent of blue-collar jobs in the country. Check out more details below. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The study states the reason for white-collar job automation is they are more rule-based than blue-collar jobs which makes them much easier to automate. Generative Artificial Intelligence is capable of performing tasks easily which include data, numbers and customer service.&nbsp;</p>
