Why It Matters		



As artificial intelligence learns to interpret and respond to human emotion, senior leaders should consider how it could change their industries and play a critical role in their firms.

What did you think of the last commercial you watched? Was it funny? Confusing? Would you buy the product? You might not remember or know for certain how you felt, but increasingly, machines do. New artificial intelligence technologies are learning and recognizing human emotions, and using that knowledge to improve everything from marketing campaigns to health care.

These technologies are referred to as “emotion AI.” Emotion AI is a subset of artificial intelligence (the broad term for machines replicating the way humans think) that measures, understands, simulates, and reacts to human emotions. It’s also known as affective computing, or artificial emotional intelligence. The field dates back to at least 1995, when MIT Media lab professor Rosalind Picard published “Affective Computing.”
Javier Hernandez, a research scientist with the Affective Computing Group at the MIT Media Lab, explains emotion AI as a tool that allows for a much more natural interaction between humans and machines.“Think of the way you interact with other human beings; you look at their faces, you look at their body, and you change your interaction accordingly,” Hernandez said. “How can [a machine] effectively communicate information if it doesn’t know your emotional state, if it doesn’t know how you’re feeling, it doesn’t know how you’re going to respond to specific content?”


The paradigm is not human versus machine — it's really machine augmenting human.

While humans might currently have the upper hand on reading emotions, machines are gaining ground using their own strengths. Machines are very good at analyzing large amounts of data, explained MIT Sloan professor Erik Brynjolfsson. They can listen to voice inflections and start to recognize when those inflections correlate with stress or anger. Machines can analyze images and pick up subtleties in micro-expressions on humans’ faces that might happen even too fast for a person to recognize.
“We have a lot of neurons in our brain for social interactions. We’re born with some of those skills, and then we learn more. It makes sense to use technology to connect to our social brains, not just our analytical brains.” Brynjolfsson said. “Just like we can understand speech and machines can communicate in speech, we also understand and communicate with humor and other kinds of emotions. And machines that can speak that language — the language of emotions — are going to have better, more effective interactions with us. It's great that we’ve made some progress; it’s just something that wasn’t an option 20 or 30 years ago, and now it’s on the table.”
Which industries are already using emotion AI?
Advertising — In 2009, Rana el Kaliouby, PhD ’06, and Picard founded Affectiva, an emotion AI company based in Boston, which specializes in automotive AI and advertising research — the latter for 25 percent of the Fortune 500 companies.
“Our technology captures these visceral, subconscious reactions, which we have found correlates very strongly with actual consumer behavior, like sharing the ad or actually buying the product,” el Kaliouby said.
In the case of advertising research, once a client has been vetted and agreed to the terms of Affectiva’s use (like promising not to exploit the technology for surveillance or lie detection) the client is given access to Affectiva’s technology. With a customer’s consent, the technology uses the person’s phone or laptop camera to capture their reactions while watching a particular advertisement.
Self-reporting — like feedback during a test group — is helpful, el Kaliouby said, but getting a moment by moment response allows marketers to really tell if a particular ad resonated with people or was offensive, or if it was confusing or struck a heartstring.
Call centers — Technology from Cogito, a company co-founded in 2007 by MIT Sloan alumni, helps call center agents identify the moods of customers on the phone and adjust how they handle the conversation in real time. Cogito’s voice-analytics software is based on years of human behavior research to identify voice patterns.
Mental health —  In December 2018 Cogito launched a spinoff called CompanionMx, and an accompanying mental health monitoring app. The Companion app listens to someone speaking into their phone, and analyzes the speaker’s voice and phone use for signs of anxiety and mood changes.
The app improves users' self-awareness, and can increase coping skills including steps for stress reduction. The company has worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston.
Another emotion AI-driven technology for mental health is a wearable device developed at the MIT Media Lab that monitors a person’s heartbeat to tell whether they are experiencing something like stress, pain, or frustration. The monitor then releases a scent to help the wearer adjust to the negative emotion they’re having at that moment.

Media Lab researchers also built an algorithm using phone data and a wearable device, that predicts varying degrees of depression.
Automotive — Hernandez, the Media Lab researcher, is currently working on a team putting emotion AI into vehicles.
While much attention has been paid to safety in the environment outside of a car, inside there a range of distractions that can impact safety. Consider a car that could tell if a driver was arguing with the passenger next to them, based on elevated blood pressure, and adjust the speed of the distracted operator. Or a sensor that signaled the steering wheel to subtly maneuver the car into the middle of the lane, after a sleep-deprived driver unknowingly is listing to the curb.
Affectiva has a similar automotive AI service of its own, which monitors a driver’s state and occupants’ experiences to improve road safety and the occupant experience.
Assistive services — Some people with autism find it challenging to communicate emotionally. That’s where emotion AI can be a sort of “assistive technology,” Hernandez said. Wearable monitors can pick up on subtleties in facial expressions or body language in someone with autism (like an elevated pulse rate) that others might not be able to see.
Hernandez said there are also “communicative prostheses” that help autistic people learn how to read other’s facial expressions. One example is a game in which the person uses the camera on a tablet to identify “smiley” or “frowny” faces on the people around them.
“That is a way for them to engage with other people and also learn how facial expressions work,” Hernandez said, adding that this video technology that measures moods in “smiley” or “frowny” faces could work for customer feedback in crowded theme parks or hospital waiting rooms, or could be used to provide anonymous feedback to upper management in a large office.
Is emotion AI something to welcome or to worry about?
Hernandez recommended any business interested in applying this technology needs to promote a healthy discussion — one that includes its benefits and what is possible with the technology, and how to use it in private ways.
“What I tell companies is think about what aspects of emotional intelligence should play a critical role in your business,” Hernandez said. “If you were to have that emotional interaction, how would that change, can you use technology for that?”
El Kaliouby said she sees potential in expanding the technology to new use cases, for example,  using the call center technology to understand the emotional well-being of employees, or for other mental health uses. But concern over coming off as Big Brother is a legitimate worry, and one that will have to be continuously addressed within the scope of privacy and this technology. To that point, el Kaliouby said that Affectiva requires opt-in and consent for all use cases of its technology.
Another thing to keep in mind is that the technology is only as good as its programmer.
Brynjolfsson warned as these technologies are rolled out, they need to be appropriate for all people, not just sensitive to the subset of the population used for training.
“For instance, recognizing emotions in an African American face sometimes can be difficult for a machine that’s trained on Caucasian faces,” Brynjolfsson said. “And some of the gestures or voice inflections in one culture may mean something very different in a different culture.”
Overall, what’s important to remember is that when it’s used thoughtfully, the ultimate benefits of the technology can and should be greater than the cost, Brynjolfsson said, a sentiment echoed by el Kaliouby, who said it is possible to integrate the technology in a thoughtful way.“The paradigm is not human versus machine — it's really machine augmenting human,” she said. “It's human plus machine.”

Technology will bring a dramatic shift in our lives. But how can we guarantee that we will benefit from it?Elisa Camorani·FollowPublished inDataDrivenInvestor·7 min read·Mar 10, 20192ListenShareAI revolution is clearly different from the previous industrial revolution. The introduction of machinery should have improved our lives by delegating work to appliances, but it actually boosted a way of living where the distinction between private life and work is blurred. According to the most recent futurist predictions, AI, instead, will give us the possibility to experience a new form of life, endued with more time for ourselves, which frees us from obligations, such as physically intense, stressful works.However, there is an important matter to consider. In a society where algorithms will be in charge of the most important decisions, can we still define ourselves as free? Which regulations and limits should we implement upon AI, to be sure that we will gain more freedom, and we will not be ‘dominated by machines’?4 Books that Challenge Your View on Artificial Intelligence and Society - Data Driven InvestorDeep learning, robots thinking like humans, artificial intelligence, neural networks- these technologies have sparked…www.datadriveninvestor.comIn my opinion, the answer to this question depends on which philosophical concept of freedom the reader bears in mind. In this essay, I will discuss two notions of freedom, and how AI will indeed provide us with it.Ultimately, I will examine potential concerns regarding political reality and cultural transformation.First of all, it is essential to consider the changes that will occur in our society, due to technological development.Artificial Intelligence is already being widely employed, and its applications are likely to expand further, both affecting work life and governance.In fact, AI ends the era of specialists. Nowadays, data analysis and machine learning are capable of quickly evaluating the course of actions, by assigning risks scores and comparing the outcomes of each choice.Data analysis predictions always take into consideration a greater number of factors, possible consequences, and longer time perspectives than any human assessment could ever do. Therefore, the cost-benefit analysis developed by algorithms will always turn out to be more efficient.For this reason, AI already manages many operations in companies and government.For instance, forms of AI, such as social media control and prediction of individual behaviour for crime prevention, highlight terrorist activity and major threats to national security where intervention is required.AI, through drones and geo-maps, coordinates disaster response worldwide, and monitors the optimal allocation of social welfare funding, which guarantees social and economic sustainability. AI plays a fundamental role in public healthcare as well, by auditing statistics on diseases’ conditions, providing preventive diagnosis and planning treatments.Other examples that could be added to this list: urban planning, financial fraud prevention and analysis, and law enforcement are just some of the most developed branches of AI.In sum, it is clear that AI can substitute the role of governance. The only actions needed are collecting data and setting short-, medium- and long-term goals. After that, AI will basically indicate to us the best path towards such goals.Working life will be revolutionised in the same way. We are already witnessing the use of AI in many job fields: not only manufacturing but also farming, financial services, healthcare, and retail.For this reason, a transatlantic network of thinkers is currently advocating a profoundly different future for countries, which offers alluring promises: a life with much less work, or no work at all, calmer, more equal, more communal, more pleasurable, more thoughtful, more fulfilled. Even though this post-work forecast still present issues, it is not perceived anymore as a utopia.Will we really be free however, in a future where robots work for us, decide how to allocate funds, and how to manage firms and regulate international policy relations?The technological revolution, if properly governed, will endow us with freedom for two reasons.First, AI-based societies could finally provide each of us with the basic opportunities to plan the life we desire. Secondly, it will donate us the most precious resource we are always running out of: time.The first statement recalls the concept of freedom discussed by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, and the republican freedom as non-domination by Philip Pettit.According to the ‘human development approach’, society should ensure a minimum threshold of capabilities and leave the decision about whether to exercise them, or not, in the hands of the public. For instance, a good society should give everyone the possibility to live a healthy life. Then, each individual should be free to decide if he or she wants to live in a healthy or unhealthy way without judgement being passed upon them.As the Human Development Index clearly demonstrates, the minimum threshold of capabilities can be defined quantitatively. Statistics and ciphers can tell us when a life can be considered of ‘normal length’ and ‘healthy.’ Once again, we see the relevance of data. Data can measure if fundamental human rights are respected. It is important to note, that anything, which can be translated into data, is part of the language of artificial intelligence.My outlook assumes that any individual, that lives in a society where the fundamental rights are guaranteed and is able to live the way he wants, can be considered free.Consequently, algorithms can play a great role in securing freedom. The minimum threshold can be translated as the score AI needs to achieve: the best options, in order to accomplish the result, will be clearly pointed out.AI intervention however, must be limited to the social sphere. The role of AI should be committed to ensuring equal possibilities for the well-being of everyone in society.Therefore, it should deal with decisions at a global or national level, without interfering with private life. The resulting freedom can be understood as non-arbitrary interference.The second hypothesis states that by gaining time, we will gain freedom.Thanks to AI, we will have more time for ourselves, to rediscover humanities. We will hence be free — free from duties and free to focus on what makes us different from robots: social relations, creativity, and innovation. To do this, humans will need to nurture those features that distinguish them from robotics. Forecasts and futurologist analysis state that aspects such as philosophy, art, artisanal work, and social relations will be reawakened, due to the time we will have available. Our technological future will be all about humanity, instead of technology.The increasing deployment of AI will not revolutionise citizens’ role in political reality, but will bring meaningful cultural changes to society.Possible concerns, in fact, could question what will be the role left for us in policymaking. Will it just become a matter of setting targets and delegate their achievement to tools that function better than us?This might sound unacceptable. Nonetheless, I estimate it as equivalent to our present-day situation.In the current elective system, participation is minimal. Representation does not promote direct civic engagement. Democracy is perceived as the possibility to choose who will decide for us — selecting the representative whose ‘menu of proposal’ better suits our interests — and not as first-hand involvement in political reality.Moreover, global matters are becoming too complex to be handled by singular individuals.Therefore, it would be more efficient to leave such decision-making processes to the best specialist we can employ — artificial intelligence.Finally, futurist predictions look at the skills to develop in such an environment. They will be no more that of specialist narrow knowledge, but lateral thinking, inventiveness, originality. Being able to think, to criticise, to formulate your own opinion. Will this mean that we will be intellectually free, not dominated by any kind of ideology or common sense?To conclude, the future can be positive for us, if we welcome Artificial Intelligence in the proper way.We are being given the chance to achieve human emancipation through technology.Irrational fears such as machine domination must not blind us towards this opportunity. We must remember that the concept of ‘seeking power over another’ is solely human.We will be able to forget the continuous pressure we perceive because of time, and we will have to rely more on our inner human features.Nevertheless, there are many other implications, and possible threats, posed by the employment of AI, that I will not discuss here.Here is my final question that I would like to conclude with: if we suppose this scenario will become true, will humans be able to handle the amount of freedom they are given? Will we dedicate ourselves to humanities, or will we come up with new alleged problems, or works, or obligations, because, after all, we need our life to be ruled?Please, feel free to comment and share your opinions about this topic.",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*gUrZFqqMV5CXYW1HKzwVzg.jpeg'],https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/will-artificial-intelligence-provide-us-with-more-freedom-2315e6ea8a72,https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/will-artificial-intelligence-provide-us-with-more-freedom-2315e6ea8a72,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Elisa Camorani', 'url': 'https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/@elisacamorani5'}",2021-12-08T21:38:16.933Z,2019-03-10T18:55:42.818Z,Will Artificial Intelligence provide us with more freedom?,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'DataDrivenInvestor', 'url': 'medium.datadriveninvestor.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 308, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:616/1*OMF3fSqH8t4xBJ9-6oZDZw.png'}}",,,,,,,,,Will Artificial Intelligence provide us with more freedom?,,,,,,,,,2019-03-10T18:55:42.818Z,2315e6ea8a72,['Elisa Camorani'],,,,,,,,

Humans and machines can improve accuracy when they work together

										 by Davide Valeriani, 										 										 The Conversation

Whether artificial intelligence systems steal humans' jobs or create new work opportunities, people will need to work together with them.





In my research I use sensors and computers to monitor how the brain itself processes decision-making. Together with another brain-computer interface scholar, Riccardo Poli, I looked at one example of possible human-machine collaboration – situations when police and security staff are asked to keep a lookout for a particular person, or people, in a crowded environment, such as an airport.
It seems like a straightforward request, but it is actually really hard to do. A security officer has to monitor several surveillance cameras for many hours every day, looking for suspects. Repetitive tasks like these are prone to human errors.
Some people suggest these tasks should be automated, as machines do not get bored, tired or distracted over time. However, computer vision algorithms tasked to recognize faces could also make mistakes. As my research has found, together, machines and humans could do much better.






Two types of artificial intelligence
We have developed two AI systems that could help identify target faces in crowded scenes. The first is a facial recognition algorithm. It analyzes images from a security camera, identifies which parts of the images are faces and compares those faces with an image of the person that is sought. When it identifies a match, this algorithm also reports how sure it is of that decision.

The second system is a brain-computer interface that uses sensors on a person's scalp, looking for neural activity related to confidence in decisions.
We conducted an experiment with 10 human participants, showing each of them 288 pictures of crowded indoor environments. Each picture was shown for only 300 milliseconds – about as long as it takes an eye to blink – after which the person was asked to decide whether or not they had seen a particular person's face. On average, they were able to correctly discriminate between images with and without the target in 72 percent of the images.
When our entirely autonomous AI system performed the same tasks, it correctly classified 84 percent of the images.
Human-AI collaboration
All the humans and the standalone algorithm were seeing the same images, so we sought to improve the decision-making by combining the actions of more than one of them at a time.
To merge several decisions into one, we weighted individual responses by decision confidence – the algorithm's self-estimated confidence, and the measurements from the humans' brain readings, transformed with a machine-learning algorithm. We found that an average group of just humans, regardless of how large the group was, did better than the average human alone – but was less accurate than the algorithm alone.

However, groups that included at least five people and the algorithm were statistically significantly better than humans or machine alone.
Keeping people in the loop
Pairing people with computers is getting easier. Accurate computer vision and image processing software programs are common in airports and other situations. Costs are dropping for consumer systems that read brain activity, and they provide reliable data.
Working together can also help address concerns about the ethics and bias of algorithmic decisions, as well as legal questions about accountability.
In our study, the humans were less accurate than the AI. However, the brain-computer interfaces observed that the people were more confident about their choices than the AI was. Combining those factors offered a useful mix of accuracy and confidence, in which humans usually influenced the group decision more than the automated system did. When there is no agreement between humans and AI, it is ethically simpler to let humans decide.
Our study has found a way in which machines and algorithms do not have to – and in fact should not – replace humans. Rather, they can work together with people to find the best of all possible outcomes.

Some good news: The robots aren’t coming for your job. Experts at the Conference on the Future of Work at Stanford University last month said that fears that rapid advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation will leave all of us unemployed are vastly overstated.
But concerns over growing inequality and the lack of opportunity for many in the labor force — serious matters linked to a variety of structural changes in the economy — are well-founded and need to be addressed, four scholars on artificial intelligence and the economy told an audience at Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB).
That’s not to say that AI isn’t having a profound effect on many areas of the economy. It is, of course. But understanding the link between the two trends is difficult, and it’s easy to make misleading assumptions about the kinds of jobs that are in danger of becoming obsolete.
“Most jobs are more complex than [many people] realize,” said Hal Varian, Google’s chief economist, during the forum, which was sponsored by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.
Today’s workforce is sharply divided by levels of education, and those who have not gone beyond high school are affected the most by long-term changes in the economy, said David Autor, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“It’s a great time to be young and educated. But there’s no clear land of opportunity” for adults who haven’t been to college, said Autor during his keynote presentation.

When predicting future labor market outcomes, it is important to consider both sides of the supply-and-demand equation, said Varian, founding dean of the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. Most popular discussion around technology focuses on factors that decrease demand for labor by replacing workers with machines.
However, demographic trends that point to a substantial decrease in the supply of labor are potentially larger in magnitude, he said. Demographic trends are also easier to predict, since we already know, aside from immigration and catastrophes, how many 40-year-olds will live in a country 30 years from now.
Comparing the most aggressive expert estimates about the impact of automation on labor supply with demographic trends that point to a workforce reduction, Varian said he found that the demographic effect on the labor market is 53% larger than the automation effect. Thus, real wages are more likely to increase than to decrease when both factors are considered.
Automation’s slow crawl
Why hasn’t automation had a more significant effect on the economy to date? The answer isn’t simple, but there’s one key factor: Jobs are made up of a myriad of tasks, many of which are not easily automated.
“Automation doesn’t generally eliminate jobs,” Varian said. “Automation generally eliminates dull, tedious, and repetitive tasks. If you remove all the tasks, you remove the job. But that’s rare.”
Consider the job of a gardener. Gardeners have to mow and water a lawn, prune rose bushes, rake leaves, eradicate pests, and perform a variety of other chores. Mowing and watering are easy tasks to automate, but other chores would cost too much to automate or would be beyond the capabilities of machines — so gardeners are still in demand.


Automation doesn’t generally eliminate jobs. Automation generally eliminates dull, tedious, and repetitive tasks. If you remove all the tasks, you remove the job. But that’s rare. –Hal Varian, chief economist, Google


Some jobs, including within the service industry, seem ripe for automation. However, a hotel in Nagasaki, Japan, was the subject of amused news reports when it was forced to “fire” its incompetent robot receptionists and room attendants.
Jobs, unlike repetitive tasks, tend not to disappear. In 1950, the U.S. Census Bureau listed 250 separate jobs. Since then, the only one to be completely eliminated is that of elevator operator, Varian observed. But some of the tasks carried out by elevator operators, such as greeting visitors and guiding them to the right office, have been distributed to receptionists and security guards.
Even the automotive industry, which accounts for roughly half of all robots used by industry, has found that automation has its limits.
“Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated,” Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive of Tesla Motors, said last year.

The pace of jobs change
Technology has always changed rapidly, and that’s certainly the case today. However, there’s often a lag between the time a new machine or process is invented and when it reverberates in the workplace.
“The workplace isn’t evolving as fast as we thought it would,” Paul Oyer, a Stanford GSB professor of economics and senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, said during a panel discussion at the forum. “I thought the gig economy would take over, but it hasn’t. And I thought that by now people would find their ideal mates and jobs online, but that was wrong too.”
Consider the leap from steam power to electric power. When electricity first became available, some factories replaced single large steam engines on the factory floor with a single electric motor. That didn’t make a significant change to the nature of factory work, says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. But when machinery throughout the factory was electrified, work changed radically.

The rise of the service sector
Employment in some sectors in which employees tend to have less education is still strong, particularly the service sector. As well-paid professionals settle in cities, they create a demand for services and new types of jobs. MIT’s Autor called these occupations “wealth work jobs,” which include employment for everything from baristas to horse exercisers.
The 10 most common occupations in the U.S. include such jobs as retail salespersons, office clerks, nurses, waiters, and other service-focused work. Notably, traditional occupations, such as factory and other blue-collar work, no longer make the list.
Looming over all of the changes to the labor force is the stark fact that birth rates in the U.S. are at an all-time low, said Varian. As has been widely reported, the aging of the baby boom generation creates demand for service jobs but leaves fewer workers actively contributing labor to the economy.
Even so, the U.S. workforce is in much better shape than other industrialized countries. The so-called dependency ratio — the proportion of people over 65 compared with every 100 people of working age — will be much higher in Japan, Spain, South Korea, Germany, and Italy by 2050. And not coincidentally, said Varian, countries with high dependency ratios are looking the hardest at automating jobs.
As the country ages, society will have to find new, more efficient ways to train and expand the workforce, said the panelists. They will also have to better accommodate the growing number of women in the workforce, many of whom are still held back by family and household responsibilities.
The robots may not be taking over just yet, but advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning will eventually become more of a challenge to the workforce. Still, it’s heartening to be reminded that, for now, “humans are underrated.”

These solutions require advanced infrastructures and an ecosystem of thriving innovators. How does that affect countries around the world, and especially developing nations? Should AI be a priority to tackle in order to reduce the digital and social divide?These are some of the questions explored in a Working Paper entitled ‘Artificial Intelligence in Education: Challenges and Opportunities for Sustainable Development’ presented by UNESCO and ProFuturo at Mobile Learning Week 2019. It features cases studies on how AI technology is helping education systems use data to improve educational equity and quality.Concrete examples from countries such as China, Brazil and South Africa are examined on AI’s contribution to learning outcomes, access to education and teacher support. Case studies from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Bhutan and Chile are presented on how AI is helping with data analytics in education management.  The Paper also explores the curriculum and standards dimension of AI, with examples from the European Union, Singapore and the Republic of Korea on how learners and teachers are preparing for an AI-saturated world.Beyond the opportunities, the Paper also addresses the challenges and policy implications of introducing AI in education and preparing students for an AI-powered future. The challenges presented revolve around:Developing a comprehensive view of public policy on AI for sustainable development: The complexity of the technological conditions needed to advance in this field require the alignment of multiple factors and institutions. Public policies have to work in partnership at international and national levels to create an ecosystem of AI that serves sustainable development.Ensuring inclusion and equity for AI in education: The least developed countries are at risk of suffering new technological, economic and social divides with the development of AI. Some main obstacles such as basic technological infrastructure must be faced to establish the basic conditions for implementing new strategies that take advantage of AI to improve learning.Preparing teachers for an AI-powered education: Teachers must learn new digital skills to use AI in a pedagogical and meaningful way and AI developers must learn how teachers work and create solutions that are sustainable in real-life environments.Developing quality and inclusive data systems: If the world is headed towards the datafication of education, the quality of data should be the main chief concern. It´s essential to develop state capabilities to improve data collection and systematization. AI developments should be an opportunity to increase the importance of data in educational system management.Enhancing research on AI in education: While it can be reasonably expected that research on AI in education will increase in the coming years, it is nevertheless worth recalling the difficulties that the education sector has had in taking stock of educational research in a significant way both for practice and policy-making.Dealing with ethics and transparency in data collection, use and dissemination: AI opens many ethical concerns regarding access to education system, recommendations to individual students, personal data concentration, liability, impact on work, data privacy and ownership of data feeding algorithms. AI regulation will require public discussion on ethics, accountability, transparency and security.The key discussions taking place at Mobile Learning Week 2019 address these challenges, offering the international educational community, governments and other stakeholders a unique opportunity to explore together the opportunities and threats of AI in all areas of education.Download the working paperShare                             Copied to clipboard More on this subject   Event Sixth International Conference on Learning Cities3 December 2024 - 5 December 2024     Event UNESCO International Forum on the Futures of Education 20242 December 2024 - 4 December 2024     Event Global Network of Learning Cities webinar ‘Shifting paradigms: fostering sustainable lifestyles and rethinking our relationship with nature’20 November 2024     Event Global Media and Information Literacy Week Feature Conference 202430 October 2024 - 31 October 2024  Other recent news   News Celebrating Youth’s Power in Safeguarding Traditional Building Skills16 July 2024     News UNESCO funds fire prevention efforts at the World Heritage site Los Alerces National Park, Argentina15 July 2024     News Summer Schools 2024: Ocean Literacy from the Tremiti Islands to Malmö via the Dolomite15 July 2024     News UNESCO joins hands with Tanzania to celebrate 2024 World Kiswahili Language Day15 July 2024   ",https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'The challenges and opportunities of Artificial Intelligence in education', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'representativeOfPage': 'True', 'url': 'https://www.unesco.org/sites/default/files/ai_in_education_policy_paper.jpg', 'width': '708', 'height': '368'}, 'datePublished': '2023-04-20T16:56:50+0200', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'True', 'dateModified': '2023-04-20T16:56:50+0200', 'mainEntityOfPage': 'https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/challenges-and-opportunities-artificial-intelligence-education'}, {'@type': 'Event', 'eventAttendanceMode': 'MixedEventAttendanceMode', 'location': {'@type': 'Place', 'address': {'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': ''}}}]",,,,,

However, it was in the last 20 years that the successful application of Machine Learning (ML) enabled the boom of AI. The ability of a machine to perform cognitive functions associated with the human mind, AI is used everywhere from Siri conversing with a user to IBM Watson’s autonomous weaponry. AI for businessToday, AI has begun to infiltrate board rooms and engage the workforce. It is helping employees manage their time better and add strategic value to the business. It includes a range of capabilities that can solve several business problems. In fact, AI has the potential to make a tectonic shift in the efficiency and productivity of various industries by introducing full-scale automation for tedious, time-consuming tasks and augmenting various human capabilities and functions. According to a new McKinsey Global Survey, most organisations are implementing AI devices across their standard business processes or are at least contemplating it. However, the adoption of AI is still in its nascent stages. Roughly 30 percent of the respondents of the McKinsey survey claimed to pilot the use of AI. Many others are exploring ways of utilising it to improve their productivity, ease and efficiency. The organisations already using AI have confirmed that it has resulted in a progressive transformation of their core processes such as manufacturing, marketing, human resources, etc. The relevance and scope of AI in HR TechHR is one of the core functions of any organisation. AI adoption can spell transformation for this function too. A Deloitte survey confirmed that 40 percent of respondent companies were using some form of AI in HR.

Some of them are already being witnessed while others are expected with growing investments in AI and its adoption. A growing number of startups are providing AI-based technology and services to HR functions for various activities. Some of the key ways in which AI can play a significant role in HR technology are given below:1. Talent managementEvery organisation has human capital needs and talent management refers to the organisational planning done to meet the workforce needs. As part of it, HR undertakes activities such as talent acquisition, employee management, performance management, succession management, etc. For example, organisations like Greenhouse Software are integrating IBM-AI capabilities through the IBM Watson Candidate Assistant, a suite of AI-powered tools that matches jobs to the candidates and vice-versa based on their personalities, skills and interest areas. Greenhouse collects candidate data through various funnels including social media. For example, it would observe minute details such as whether an employee submitted their work sample through LinkedIn or Glassdoor. It maintains scorecards for all the employees based on its own analysis with zero human intervention. This helps the interviewers sort through the applications ahead of time and keep the talent funnel ready.2. RecruitmentAI helps companies through the process of pre-hire assessments. While assessments are nothing new, in the era of AI, a company can predict which candidate will be a better hire in the future. Sample this, a candidate applies for a role in a company by entering his resume. An AI-powered system analyses the resume and compares it to the successful employees in the same role. A chatbot reaches out to the candidate and asks some pre-screening questions. The candidate data is collected, and AI uses it to score the candidate and present the result to a recruiter. The recruiter then decides whether to move forward to the interview stage or not. Such data cumulatively collected can be used along with employee performance and retention data to evaluate how well a candidate will perform on the job. In this way, AI capabilities minimise the scope of human bias and speed up the recruitment process. 3. SchedulingAlready, AI personal assistants like Amy Ingram are scheduling meetings, interviews and even ordering food. Amy is a human-like AI assistant who learns from observing employee preferences over time and then manages it in an automated manner for them. Similarly, AI based tools like zoom.ai allow employees to offload and automate regular tasks like look for a file and schedule meetings. By automating the repetitive and low value add tasks, employees can focus on more strategic work. It means the employees do not have to get involved in unproductive tasks that hamper employee productivity and waste organisational time. 4. Onboarding ProcessStudies suggest that employees who go through structured onboarding are 58 percent more likely to remain with the organisation after 3 years. HR can automate the many tasks of onboarding that would take hours otherwise. AI tools like zoom.ai can collect relevant data from new employees as well as generate their offer, send out the documents and answer the queries. The queries may range from how to fix the printer to setting up passwords, etc. Not only does it save HR’s time and energy, but it also makes all the above processes swift for the new employee. Once such issues are taken care of, HR teams can focus on integrating the employee into the mainstream of the organisation. 5.  Sentiment analysis A company called Ultimate Software has built an AI platform-based sentiment analysis system ‘Perception’ to gauge employee sentiments and solve Valvoline’s workplace issues. A sentiment analysis software is an AI-based tool that can give organisations an insight into their work processes and issues. This can help them resolve the problems that can nag the employees and impact their performance. Perception’s system uses machine language processing algorithms – a sub-domain of AI. By collecting and analysing the languages accumulated over a period of time, Perception gauges employee feelings through it. The company then uses the learnings in order to iron out any issues related to employee well-being, boosting employee engagement. Factors required for successful AI implementation in HR While there is no denying that AI can lead to a significant impact on the HR value chain, there needs to be a facilitation of some fundamental factors. These factors should create a value proposition for future HR processes and workforce. The organisations need to begin with the right mindset towards AI adoption with a clear business vision. The responsibility of which does not lie only with the HR heads, but with the overall leadership. The leadership also needs to propagate AI technology adoption at every level. For HR processes, there has to be a change management strategy in place as well to deal with the workforce’s emotional and work-related issues resulting from an organisation’s focus in this space. The initial AI pilots in HR technology need to be leveraged as examples of AI success within the HR sphere. This can be done by scaling them into initiatives that can impact the entire workforce. The purpose of AI adoption in HR tech is to improve the productivity and efficiency of HR so that it can meet its core objectives. Employee engagement and improved employee experience are at the heart of any successful HR operation. This should be borne in mind that the ultimate role of AI in HR technology is to facilitate employee experience at all levels.

The relevance and scope of AI in HR Tech

HR is one of the core functions of any organisation. AI adoption can spell transformation for this function too. A Deloitte survey confirmed that 40 percent of respondent companies were using some form of AI in HR. However, the benefits are not immediate in nature. 

Keeping that in mind, adoption of AI-based HR technology can yield both short-term and long-term benefits. Some of them are already being witnessed while others are expected with growing investments in AI and its adoption.

In this way, AI capabilities minimise the scope of human bias and speed up the recruitment process. 

3. Scheduling

Already, AI personal assistants like Amy Ingram are scheduling meetings, interviews and even ordering food. Amy is a human-like AI assistant who learns from observing employee preferences over time and then manages it in an automated manner for them. Similarly, AI based tools like zoom.ai allow employees to offload and automate regular tasks like look for a file and schedule meetings. By automating the repetitive and low value add tasks, employees can focus on more strategic work. It means the employees do not have to get involved in unproductive tasks that hamper employee productivity and waste organisational time. 

4. Onboarding Process

Studies suggest that employees who go through structured onboarding are 58 percent more likely to remain with the organisation after 3 years. HR can automate the many tasks of onboarding that would take hours otherwise. AI tools like zoom.ai can collect relevant data from new employees as well as generate their offer, send out the documents and answer the queries. The queries may range from how to fix the printer to setting up passwords, etc. 

Not only does it save HR’s time and energy, but it also makes all the above processes swift for the new employee. Once such issues are taken care of, HR teams can focus on integrating the employee into the mainstream of the organisation. 

5.  Sentiment analysis 

A company called Ultimate Software has built an AI platform-based sentiment analysis system ‘Perception’ to gauge employee sentiments and solve Valvoline’s workplace issues. 

A sentiment analysis software is an AI-based tool that can give organisations an insight into their work processes and issues. This can help them resolve the problems that can nag the employees and impact their performance. 

Perception’s system uses machine language processing algorithms – a sub-domain of AI. By collecting and analysing the languages accumulated over a period of time, Perception gauges employee feelings through it. The company then uses the learnings in order to iron out any issues related to employee well-being, boosting employee engagement. 

Factors required for successful AI implementation in HR 

While there is no denying that AI can lead to a significant impact on the HR value chain, there needs to be a facilitation of some fundamental factors. These factors should create a value proposition for future HR processes and workforce. The organisations need to begin with the right mindset towards AI adoption with a clear business vision. The responsibility of which does not lie only with the HR heads, but with the overall leadership. The leadership also needs to propagate AI technology adoption at every level. 

For HR processes, there has to be a change management strategy in place as well to deal with the workforce’s emotional and work-related issues resulting from an organisation’s focus in this space. The initial AI pilots in HR technology need to be leveraged as examples of AI success within the HR sphere. This can be done by scaling them into initiatives that can impact the entire workforce. 

The purpose of AI adoption in HR tech is to improve the productivity and efficiency of HR so that it can meet its core objectives. Employee engagement and improved employee experience are at the heart of any successful HR operation. This should be borne in mind that the ultimate role of AI in HR technology is to facilitate employee experience at all levels.
