Background to the report 
AI has the potential to transform public services, but also presents risks and concerns.Jump to downloads
In 2023 the Cabinet Office’s Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) began work with the Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) and HM Treasury to develop a strategy for AI adoption in the public sector. The draft strategy has four aims:

The UK public sector will be world-leading in safe, responsible and transparent use of AI to improve public services and outcomes.
The public will benefit from services that have been transformed by AI and will have confidence that the government’s use of AI is responsible.
Public and civil servants will have the tools, information and skills they need to use AI to deliver better outcomes.  
All public organisations will be more efficient and productive through AI adoption and have the foundations in place to innovate with the next wave of technologies.

Scope of the report 
This report considers how effectively the government has set itself up to maximise the opportunities and mitigate the risks of AI in providing public services.
Our primary focus for this report is the role of the Cabinet Office and DSIT in supporting the adoption of AI in the public sector. Specifically, the report looks at:

the government’s strategy and governance for AI use in public services (Part One).
how government bodies are using AI and how government understands the opportunities (Part Two).
central government’s plans for supporting the testing, piloting and scaling of AI; and progress in addressing barriers to AI adoption (Part Three).

Video summary


Report Director, Ruth Kelly, outlines our findings on the use of AI in government.
Conclusions 
AI presents the government with opportunities to transform public services. The centre of government has identified the potential for large-scale productivity gains from the adoption of AI across the public sector.
Responsibility for AI rests with DSIT and the Cabinet Office and, while the government is working on a draft strategy for AI adoption in the public sector, it has not yet finalised it or published an implementation plan.
Our survey of government bodies found that AI was not yet widely used across government, but 70% of respondents were piloting and planning AI use cases.
Government departments are required to create AI adoption plans by June 2024.
There are risks to value for money if the government does not establish which department has overall ownership and accountability for delivery of the strategy for AI adoption in the public sector and set out appropriate roles and responsibilities for those who need to contribute.
Achieving large-scale benefits is likely to require not just adoption of new technology but significant changes in business processes and corresponding workforce changes.
To deliver the transformational benefits of AI, the government needs to ensure its overall programme for AI adoption is ambitious and supported by a realistic plan for the skills, funding and wider enablers needed.
The government must also maintain focus on addressing other fundamental barriers to AI adoption, such as legacy systems, and data access and sharing, which will otherwise limit the extent to which it can exploit the future potential of AI.

The rise of artificial intelligence can mean both progress and peril to societies and humanityEven with milestones like the Artificial Intelligence Act, recently approved by the European Parliament, global governance efforts for AI technology remain insufficientThe world must urgently come together, as the stakes are too high for inactionThe growing presence of artificial intelligence (AI) in consumers’ lives has put our societies at a crossroads, said UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan, marking World Consumer Rights Day on 15 March.The secretary-general was addressing an event in Geneva on consumer experience and generative AI, gathering international organizations, businesses and consumer rights groups.Advancing at breakneck speeds, data-driven AI holds vast promise for consumer welfare, through personalizing products and services, optimizing customer support, and addressing disputes online.But at the same time, there are growing concerns over the fair, responsible and ethical use of AI, as efforts to govern the technology continue to play catch-up worldwide.Currently, a handful of global tech giants control most of the data flows and revenues from digital services.Such concentration further centralizes the direction and benefits of AI, posing a threat to fair competition, and aggravates already existing technology divides based on geography, gender, income, and race.  “Rapid changes require rapid reactions,” the UNCTAD chief urged.UNCTAD, the UN’s lead agency on consumer protection, is intensifying calls for more awareness raising and robust global regulatory frameworks – including a new generation of consumer protection policies – to ensure AI benefits all.Red flagsMs Grynspan spotlighted not only the upside of AI, but also the red flags if the technology goes unchecked.Globally, billions of people risk being left behind in the AI revolution, with two thirds of the population in least developed countries offline and women still trailing men in internet access.There’s also looming risks of abuse, given how deepfakes could massively mislead consumers, spread misinformation and destabilize societies.Transparency, accountability, inclusivityMore broadly, UNCTAD contributes to ongoing efforts driven by the UN Secretary-General’s AI Advisory Body, tasked with analyzing and advancing recommendations on the ethical development and use of the transformative technology.It advocates for a global framework to guide fair and responsible AI, underscoring the need for transparency, accountability, and inclusivity.This entails making AI algorithms more transparent and data collection practices more responsible, as opposed to tech companies closing off their systems from public scrutiny.On accountability, developers need to ensure that AI technologies positively impact societies on the whole.Additionally, AI systems should be as diverse and inclusive as the world they’re designed to serve.Public policies need to guide innovation and the design of AI to mitigate, instead of perpetuating, human biases rooted in longstanding socioeconomic inequalities.They must also ensure that AI-powered goods and services reach vulnerable and marginalized populations.Collective action is the way forwardReining in AI for the common good requires joint efforts.For consumers and policymakers, UNCTAD highlights more empowerment through AI literacy, in terms of understanding how AI systems learn, make decisions, and potentially influence users’ choices.International cooperation will remain crucial to helping develop national strategies aligned with global principles, fostering an environment where responsible AI can flourish and consumer rights are protected.UNCTAD also calls on tech companies to adopt ethical AI development practices, prioritizing consumer well-being and societal benefit over short-term profits.“Just as previous generations tackled their technological revolutions, let us work tirelessly to ensure that the AI revolution benefits every human being,” Secretary-General Grynspan concluded, “Let this be our legacy.”

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are changing everything about the way we carry out knowledge-based work. This means that lawyers and other legal professionals stand to benefit by boosting their productivity and reducing the amount of time spent on routine, repetitive tasks.


In fact, one recent survey by LexisNexis found that half of all lawyers think generative AI will significantly transform their business, and 92 percent think it will have at least some impact.

Of course, these professions also face unique challenges around the use of this technology. In the legal world, confidentiality is often paramount, and small errors on the part of AI tools could have serious consequences on people’s lives.

PROMOTED
So should legal professionals be embracing the opportunities? In this article I’ll take a dive into the transformative impact that generative AI will have on law jobs, as well as explore how the roles of lawyers, attorneys, solicitors, clerks, judges, barristers in society could change as the technology becomes commonplace.

Exploration, Fact-Finding And Research
One of the tasks where generative AI excels is reading huge stacks of documents and working out what they mean. Most lawyers will be only too familiar with this type of work, and probably willing to let a machine do it!

It’s real value, though, lies in what can be done with the time that’s saved. Spending time with clients getting to really understand their problems is a more valuable use of expert human time and something AI won't be able to beat us at for a while.

In this area of legal work, generative AI can be used to find relevant laws and rulings amongst pages of regulations, search through databases of case law and precedents, and review evidence.
It can then very quickly translate what it’s learned into whatever format it will be useful in for whoever is going to use it – whether that’s a junior lawyer, an experienced judge or just a layman who needs to understand how the law affects them.

It can also be used to generate documents, contracts and letters. These are jobs that all need doing but eat into the time of lawyers. Soon, finding a lawyer that doesn’t use generative AI to automate these everyday tasks might be as hard as finding an accountant who doesn’t use a calculator!
Last year I wrote about work being done by the California Innocence Project. Generative AI has reduced time spent by humans drafting letters and summarizing complex documents, freeing up their time to fight miscarriages of justice.
According to the LexisNexis study, lawyers themselves believe that the top use case will be research (65 percent), followed by drafting documents (56 percent), document analysis (44 percent) and writing emails (35 percent).
Risk Assessment and Due Diligence
Another thing that generative AI is great at is predictive analytics. This means it makes it easier for lawyers to make data-driven decisions. It’s often a lawyer’s task to weigh up the chances of a successful litigation against the cost of making a settlement.
While traditional AI has been used for this kind of legal forecasting for a while, adding generative AI to the mix democratizes the technology, making it usable by professionals with little knowledge of data science.
There are ethical and business concerns here, though. Lawyers will need to be transparent with clients about what decisions they’re making with the help of AI. On top of that, this type of predictive analytics requires huge volumes of data, and it’s crucial that the data is accurate and free of bias.
Of course, generative AI can also create risks, as well as predict risks. Lawyers often have access to very sensitive information about their clients, or others involved in cases they’re working on. Putting this sort of information into public AI tools could clearly lead to serious problems.
Luckily, private AI systems, including those that can be deployed securely on-premises or in private clouds, are increasingly common. As with other professions where privacy is of paramount importance, lawyers are likely to be keen adopters of these solutions.
Access to The Law and Justice
Generative AI also has the potential to improve access to law and justice by helping lawyers communicate with clients or anyone needing help. Chatbots can help answer many basic questions that people have when legal issues arise, often without needing personal data. They can easily identify questions that require an expert human response, directing the user to the most suitable professionals.
They can enhance lawyers' ability to communicate information quickly and efficiently to their clients, keeping them updated about the latest developments in their cases. For example, one complex court judgment can quickly be summarized and explained for different groups of people.
However, its critical that oversight is applied at all times, to ensure that responses are appropriate and there are no breaches of confidentiality.
What Tools Are Available?
As well as the likes of ChatGPT, Microsoft Co-Pilot and Bard – all capable of many of the routine tasks we’ve discussed here, a swathe of specialist tools are already available. A few examples include:
Harvey, a law-focussed AI chatbot.
ExParte - a platform that uses natural language processing on top of machine learning to predict the outcome of litigation.
Casetext - an AI legal assistant that uses generative AI to review and prepare documents and conduct legal research.
Deepjudge - an AI-powered legal search engine.
The Changing Role Of Lawyers
For researching, writing, legislating, interpreting and arguing law, people will always be an essential part of the process. That doesn't mean generative AI won’t change the role, though, just as previous waves of breakthrough technologies such as the printing press, computers and the internet have radically changed it in the past.
Lawyers who manage this transition well should find that their roles become more people-focused. Their priority will be understanding clients and their legal issues in a human-to-human way. This helps to build professional relationships and trust in ways that machines may never be able to replace.
With less time spent on routine and essentially repetitive tasks, there will also be more time for educating and upskilling. Lawyers have always had to keep their knowledge up-to-date, but this could mean honing technology skills in order to best take advantage of the tools becoming available. Others might choose to hone the “soft” human skills like communication and creativity instead.
Pretty much everyone, though – and this goes for professionals in general, not just lawyers – will be expected become familiar with regulatory and compliance issues around the use of data and AI. Specifically, they will need to understand all of the regulatory requirements around the use of personal data in their field of work, as well as the importance of being open and transparent about how data and AI is used.
One thing that is certain is that the successful lawyers and legal professionals of the next decade will not be those who choose to bury their heads in the sand as this wave of transformative technology sweeps over them.
Those that are able to strike a balance between harnessing the potential for driving efficiency and growth, and navigating the (many) challenges, will be on their way to future-proofing their careers.

Innovations in the field of artificial intelligence continue to shape the future of humanity across nearly every industry. AI is already the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT, and generative AI has further expanded the possibilities and popularity of AI. 
According to a 2023 IBM survey, 42 percent of enterprise-scale businesses integrated AI into their operations, and 40 percent are considering AI for their organizations. In addition, 38 percent of organizations have implemented generative AI into their workflows while 42 percent are considering doing so.
With so many changes coming at such a rapid pace, here’s what shifts in AI could mean for various industries and society at large.
More on the Future of AICan AI Make Art More Human?
 
The Evolution of AI
AI has come a long way since 1951, when the first documented success of an AI computer program was written by Christopher Strachey, whose checkers program completed a whole game on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester. Thanks to developments in machine learning and deep learning, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and the company’s IBM Watson won Jeopardy! in 2011.  
Since then, generative AI has spearheaded the latest chapter in AI’s evolution, with OpenAI releasing its first GPT models in 2018. This has culminated in OpenAI developing its GPT-4 model and ChatGPT, leading to a proliferation of AI generators that can process queries to produce relevant text, audio, images and other types of content.   
AI has also been used to help sequence RNA for vaccines and model human speech, technologies that rely on model- and algorithm-based machine learning and increasingly focus on perception, reasoning and generalization. 
 
How AI Will Impact the Future
Improved Business Automation 
About 55 percent of organizations have adopted AI to varying degrees, suggesting increased automation for many businesses in the near future. With the rise of chatbots and digital assistants, companies can rely on AI to handle simple conversations with customers and answer basic queries from employees.
AI’s ability to analyze massive amounts of data and convert its findings into convenient visual formats can also accelerate the decision-making process. Company leaders don’t have to spend time parsing through the data themselves, instead using instant insights to make informed decisions.
“If [developers] understand what the technology is capable of and they understand the domain very well, they start to make connections and say, ‘Maybe this is an AI problem, maybe that’s an AI problem,’” said Mike Mendelson, a learner experience designer for NVIDIA. “That’s more often the case than, ‘I have a specific problem I want to solve.’”
More on AI75 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies to Know
 
Job Disruption
Business automation has naturally led to fears over job losses. In fact, employees believe almost one-third of their tasks could be performed by AI. Although AI has made gains in the workplace, it’s had an unequal impact on different industries and professions. For example, manual jobs like secretaries are at risk of being automated, but the demand for other jobs like machine learning specialists and information security analysts has risen.
Workers in more skilled or creative positions are more likely to have their jobs augmented by AI, rather than be replaced. Whether forcing employees to learn new tools or taking over their roles, AI is set to spur upskilling efforts at both the individual and company level.     
“One of the absolute prerequisites for AI to be successful in many [areas] is that we invest tremendously in education to retrain people for new jobs,” said Klara Nahrstedt, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and director of the school’s Coordinated Science Laboratory.
 
Data Privacy Issues
Companies require large volumes of data to train the models that power generative AI tools, and this process has come under intense scrutiny. Concerns over companies collecting consumers’ personal data have led the FTC to open an investigation into whether OpenAI has negatively impacted consumers through its data collection methods after the company potentially violated European data protection laws. 
In response, the Biden-Harris administration developed an AI Bill of Rights that lists data privacy as one of its core principles. Although this legislation doesn’t carry much legal weight, it reflects the growing push to prioritize data privacy and compel AI companies to be more transparent and cautious about how they compile training data.      
 
Increased Regulation
AI could shift the perspective on certain legal questions, depending on how generative AI lawsuits unfold in 2024. For example, the issue of intellectual property has come to the forefront in light of copyright lawsuits filed against OpenAI by writers, musicians and companies like The New York Times. These lawsuits affect how the U.S. legal system interprets what is private and public property, and a loss could spell major setbacks for OpenAI and its competitors. 
Ethical issues that have surfaced in connection to generative AI have placed more pressure on the U.S. government to take a stronger stance. The Biden-Harris administration has maintained its moderate position with its latest executive order, creating rough guidelines around data privacy, civil liberties, responsible AI and other aspects of AI. However, the government could lean toward stricter regulations, depending on changes in the political climate.  
 
Climate Change Concerns
On a far grander scale, AI is poised to have a major effect on sustainability, climate change and environmental issues. Optimists can view AI as a way to make supply chains more efficient, carrying out predictive maintenance and other procedures to reduce carbon emissions. 
At the same time, AI could be seen as a key culprit in climate change. The energy and resources required to create and maintain AI models could raise carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent, dealing a devastating blow to any sustainability efforts within tech. Even if AI is applied to climate-conscious technology, the costs of building and training models could leave society in a worse environmental situation than before.   
 
What Industries Will AI Impact the Most? 
There’s virtually no major industry that modern AI hasn’t already affected. Here are a few of the industries undergoing the greatest changes as a result of AI.
 
AI in Manufacturing
Manufacturing has been benefiting from AI for years. With AI-enabled robotic arms and other manufacturing bots dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, the industry has adapted well to the powers of AI. These industrial robots typically work alongside humans to perform a limited range of tasks like assembly and stacking, and predictive analysis sensors keep equipment running smoothly. 
 
AI in Healthcare
It may seem unlikely, but AI healthcare is already changing the way humans interact with medical providers. Thanks to its big data analysis capabilities, AI helps identify diseases more quickly and accurately, speed up and streamline drug discovery and even monitor patients through virtual nursing assistants. 
 
AI in Finance
Banks, insurers and financial institutions leverage AI for a range of applications like detecting fraud, conducting audits and evaluating customers for loans. Traders have also used machine learning’s ability to assess millions of data points at once, so they can quickly gauge risk and make smart investing decisions. 
 
AI in Education
AI in education will change the way humans of all ages learn. AI’s use of machine learning, natural language processing and facial recognition help digitize textbooks, detect plagiarism and gauge the emotions of students to help determine who’s struggling or bored. Both presently and in the future, AI tailors the experience of learning to student’s individual needs.
 
AI in Media
Journalism is harnessing AI too, and will continue to benefit from it. One example can be seen in The Associated Press’ use of Automated Insights, which produces thousands of earning reports stories per year. But as generative AI writing tools, such as ChatGPT, enter the market, questions about their use in journalism abound.
 
AI in Customer Service
Most people dread getting a robocall, but AI in customer service can provide the industry with data-driven tools that bring meaningful insights to both the customer and the provider. AI tools powering the customer service industry come in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants.
 
AI in Transportation
Transportation is one industry that is certainly teed up to be drastically changed by AI. Self-driving cars and AI travel planners are just a couple of facets of how we get from point A to point B that will be influenced by AI. Even though autonomous vehicles are far from perfect, they will one day ferry us from place to place.

Risks and Dangers of AI
Despite reshaping numerous industries in positive ways, AI still has flaws that leave room for concern. Here are a few potential risks of artificial intelligence.
 
Job Losses 
Between 2023 and 2028, 44 percent of workers’ skills will be disrupted. Not all workers will be affected equally — women are more likely than men to be exposed to AI in their jobs. Combine this with the fact that there is a gaping AI skills gap between men and women, and women seem much more susceptible to losing their jobs. If companies don’t have steps in place to upskill their workforces, the proliferation of AI could result in higher unemployment and decreased opportunities for those of marginalized backgrounds to break into tech.
 
Human Biases 
The reputation of AI has been tainted with a habit of reflecting the biases of the people who train the algorithmic models. For example, facial recognition technology has been known to favor lighter-skinned individuals, discriminating against people of color with darker complexions. If researchers aren’t careful in rooting out these biases early on, AI tools could reinforce these biases in the minds of users and perpetuate social inequalities.
 
Deepfakes and Misinformation
The spread of deepfakes threatens to blur the lines between fiction and reality, leading the general public to question what’s real and what isn’t. And if people are unable to identify deepfakes, the impact of misinformation could be dangerous to individuals and entire countries alike. Deepfakes have been used to promote political propaganda, commit financial fraud and place students in compromising positions, among other use cases. 
 
Data Privacy
Training AI models on public data increases the chances of data security breaches that could expose consumers’ personal information. Companies contribute to these risks by adding their own data as well. A 2024 Cisco survey found that 48 percent of businesses have entered non-public company information into generative AI tools and 69 percent are worried these tools could damage their intellectual property and legal rights. A single breach could expose the information of millions of consumers and leave organizations vulnerable as a result.  
 
Automated Weapons
The use of AI in automated weapons poses a major threat to countries and their general populations. While automated weapons systems are already deadly, they also fail to discriminate between soldiers and civilians. Letting artificial intelligence fall into the wrong hands could lead to irresponsible use and the deployment of weapons that put larger groups of people at risk.  
 
Superior Intelligence
Nightmare scenarios depict what’s known as the technological singularity, where superintelligent machines take over and permanently alter human existence through enslavement or eradication. Even if AI systems never reach this level, they can become more complex to the point where it’s difficult to determine how AI makes decisions at times. This can lead to a lack of transparency around how to fix algorithms when mistakes or unintended behaviors occur. 
“I don’t think the methods we use currently in these areas will lead to machines that decide to kill us,” said Marc Gyongyosi, founder of Onetrack.AI. “I think that maybe five or 10 years from now, I’ll have to reevaluate that statement because we’ll have different methods available and different ways to go about these things.”
Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat does the future of AI look like?AI is expected to improve industries like healthcare, manufacturing and customer service, leading to higher-quality experiences for both workers and customers. However, it does face challenges like increased regulation, data privacy concerns and worries over job losses.


What will AI look like in 10 years?AI is on pace to become a more integral part of people’s everyday lives. The technology could be used to provide elderly care and help out in the home. In addition, workers could collaborate with AI in different settings to enhance the efficiency and safety of workplaces.


Is AI a threat to humanity?It depends on how people in control of AI decide to use the technology. If it falls into the wrong hands, AI could be used to expose people’s personal information, spread misinformation and perpetuate social inequalities, among other malicious use cases.

Inflection AI
Best for conversational AI technology

Headquarters: Palo Alto, CA, USA
Founded: 2022
Company Size: Less than 100 employees
Key Products: Pi, Conversational API, Inflection-2.5
Market Cap: Private company valued at $4 billion

Inflection AI earned a formidable reputation long before it released any products simply due to the pedigree of its founders: Mustafa Suleyman, a co-founder of DeepMind and former VP of AI products and AI policy at Google; REid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn and former EVP at PayPal; and Karén Simonyan, former principal scientist at DeepMind. Unlike many of the other players in this list, Inflection AI is more focused on narrow, purpose-built generative AI solutions rather than AGI. This is evident through Pi, its “personal AI” that focuses on empathetic, conversational AI with humans.
Though Pi is still more focused on conversational AI and personal usage, the recent release of Inflection-2.5 has increased its capabilities for more technical queries and can now provide results based on real-time web searches.
While testing out these new features, I received comprehensive and accurate responses for the most part. However, when I asked Pi how its performance compares against Google’s Gemini, it told me it didn’t know of a Google product by that name. Expect to see more improvements as this new addition to the tool was only released very recently.

Company and Group Works Council agree guard rails for use of artificial intelligence (AI) 
""At TUI, we are convinced that AI does not replace jobs, but rather certain tasks. That is why we are focusing on training our employees for higher-value tasks,” says Sybille Reiss, Chief People Officer of TUI Group 
""We are utilising the potential of artificial intelligence for TUI – responsibly and with a focus on opportunities,” explains Frank Jakobi, Chairman of the Group Works Council of TUI AG. 

The TUI Executive Board and the Group Works Council have adopted a joint ""Policy Paper"" on the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The paper focuses on the potential of AI and its impact on employees. For the first time, the paper formulates guard rails for the introduction and use of AI at TUI. With this paper, the Executive Board and the Group Works Council are sending out a signal in favour of an open, opportunity-driven approach to AI technologies at TUI, which will benefit both the company and its employees. 
One focus of the paper is on training employees to make them fit for a working world driven by AI. In particular, applications based on generative AI will lead to increases in productivity and efficiency. TUI will offer extensive training programmes to enable employees to get to grips with the potential of generative AI at an early stage and to test and introduce these technologies in their own area of work. There is already high interest in such programmes, as demonstrated by the introduction of two initial e-learning courses on the topic of ""Generative Artificial Intelligence"". They were accessed by almost 7,000 employees within three weeks. 
""TUI will make extensive use of artificial intelligence in its own systems and in daily work processes. It is important to us that employees can keep pace with those technological innovations. At TUI, we are convinced that AI does not replace jobs, but rather certain tasks. That is why we are focusing on training our employees for higher-value tasks. We are embracing an important topic for the future and shaping it – openly and without fear,"" says Sybille Reiss, Chief People Officer at TUI Group. 
""We are utilising the potential of artificial intelligence for TUI – responsibly and with a focus on opportunities. That is why employees are at the centre of the Policy Paper: employment and working conditions at TUI will not deteriorate as a result of the introduction and use of AI. AI should contribute to a diverse, fair and non-discriminatory working environment. With regard to applicants and employees, the following applies at TUI: the final decision is made by a human being,"" explains Frank Jakobi, Chairman of the Group Works Council of TUI AG. 
In the paper, comprehensive and regular information and involvement of employee representatives in the introduction of new AI applications is agreed. This is already standard practice for numerous other strategic issues at TUI. In future, an AI advisory team with equal representation from the company and the employee side will monitor technical progress as well as the associated ethical issues. The committee is also tasked with ensuring health protection, particularly regarding potential psychological stress. 
At TUI, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in HR is guided by a clear maxim: The final decision-making power always lies with humans. This applies to all processes that affect employees and applicants – from application and recruitment to personal career planning, qualification options, development opportunities and salary developments. AI serves as a supporting tool, but employees are responsible for every final decision.

Tools such as Open AI’s DALL.E 2, SORA and Chat GPT, Google’s Bard (now Gemini), and Microsoft’s Copilot, now make it possible for anyone to create images, text and even music from a single prompt. The sector has quickly come to assert its dominance in the tech industry, with Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh estimating that the generative AI market could grow by 42% to reach $1.3tn by 2032.







There has been huge hype around the potential of these tools for fuelling creativity, with many creative industry leaders celebrating the potential of generative AI (GenAI). But what does this mean for those whose creativity is their livelihood?
Laurence Bouvard is an actress and voiceover artist, who has worked in TV, film, theatre, videogames and audiobooks. A member of Equity, she is also chair of its Screen and New Media industrial committee.
While Bouvard recognises that GenAI is not solely responsible for the insecurity of creative work, she says it has made earning a living even more challenging. “People are beginning to lose work, sometimes finding themselves in the odd position of competing with their synthetic avatars for jobs, and with very little power to do anything about it,” she says.
In the TV and film sector, Bouvard has noticed that some industry giants are already weaponising generative AI to their advantage, suppressing workers’ rights and risking their livelihoods in the process.
“There are some companies that will not employ performers unless we sign away all our claims and rights to our work, which means the companies can then sell on our work to AI companies wanting training data. There is a serious power imbalance in this way, and it has been the case for many years,” she says.
And Bouvard is not alone in her concerns. In 2022, performing arts and entertainment trade union Equity published a report titled Stop AI stealing the show, revealing that 65% of their members felt that AI posed a threat to their employment opportunities, a number that rose to 93% for audio artists.

Digital enclosure
In their book Data grab: The new colonialism of big tech and how to fight back, authors Ulises A. Mejias and Nick Couldry outline how the extractivist business model on which generative AI is built exploits creative workers by scraping content from the internet, including their copyrighted works.
They argue that the hype around generative AI hype has served as a distraction from the processes of theft and enclosure that the makers of these tools depend on, and that this enclosure has largely happened under our noses.
“Our collective cultural and social products now serve as the extracted raw material on which AI relies,” they wrote, giving the example of how Google has used 280,000 hours of music to train its MusicLM software.
“If the generated music were to sound too much like the source material from which it derived, this would open the door to potential lawsuits. But eventually Google released the programme free of charge, like most of its products. In its final form, the AI will not comply with requests to copy specific artists or vocals, allowing Google to avoid potential charges of copyright infringement.
“But there is still a corporation expropriating our cultural production as source material to train a machine to do the work of humans, because machines will be able to do the work more quickly and cheaply.”
Given the controversy around its use of copyrighted material in its training corpus, Google said in October 2023 that it would shoulder any potential legal liabilities for users of its generative AI services arising from copyright claims about the use intellectual property in its training data.


Devaluing human creativity
Outside the threat GenAI poses to workers’ livelihoods, others are concerned that the rise of the technology could devalue original art. Chris Barker, a graphic artist and art director for Campaign magazine, for example, says that people have responded to his recent artwork – a take on the Willy Wonka experience scandal that went viral on Twitter – by asking if it was generated by AI.
“I used to do cover illustrations for The New European,” he says. “It was a very fulfilling job, brainstorming ideas with the editor about the week’s political developments and then staying up late at night photoshopping a load of little Boris Johnson ninjas protecting Dominic Cummings or Donald Trump with an arse for a face. I was really pleased with the covers and they got a load of attention, but now I would imagine people would just assume it was all AI generated, which is a shame.”
Ela Lee, whose debut novel Jaded was published earlier this year, also believes that generative AI cannot replicate the labour of love that human creativity requires.
“When I wrote my novel, I thought about every word, revisited every paragraph, scrutinised how each punctuation mark affected the prose,” she says. “Whilst AI might be able to ‘write’ something that is concise and convenient in its grammatical accuracy, I worry that it veers us towards a standard that is uniform, stripped of nuance and, ultimately, lacking the human voice that makes people connect to art.”
Some creatives, however, have a more optimistic outlook of how emerging technologies might shape the future of their work.
Serenda is a music producer and artist. She believes that creatives have always been innovative in their use of technology, and generative AI will be no different: “If anything, I hope AI inspires people to take more risks and push boundaries with the art they make. If you’re constantly pushing boundaries and creating interesting and experimental art, I think you’re always one step ahead and you have nothing to worry about.”


Government inaction
Despite the concerns from workers, creators tell Computer Weekly that the UK government has been slow to introduce new protections or update existing legislation in the context of emerging technologies – such as the Copyright, Design and Patent Act or General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – and is instead prioritising tech companies self-regulation and profits over the rights of workers.
“The government cannot take a laissez-faire approach to AI in the arts and entertainment industry. The UK is an attractive place to invest in the arts and entertainment because we have a strong copyright and intellectual property framework which protects performers,” says Tom Peters, Policy Officer at Equity.
“We want to see the government adopt the Beijing Treaty to give performers more say over how their work is used. This would build a proper protection regime that would encourage inward investment and ensure performers are able to consent to the use of their work and receive fair remuneration.” 
According to advice from The Society of Authors, which represents more than 12,000 writers, authors and translators across the UK, authors ought to be required to give consent before their work is used by an AI system, in accordance with UK copyright law.
Despite government inaction, there is already growing pushback against the practices of generative AI firms, even from within the industry itself.
Ed Newton Rex was former head of studio at Stability AI, and has worked in AI and music for 13 years. At the end of last year, he resigned from the company over the ethics of using creative work and copyright content to develop AI without consent – an issue which it is facing legal action for.
In the digital world, artists are also staging protests and fighting back with tools that prevent their work from being stolen. Offline, the US Writers Guild of America strike is undeniably the most public case of worker resistance against the exploitative use of generative AI.
Following one of the longest labour strikes in Hollywood history, they saw the introduction of an agreement over the terms of use of artificial intelligence. The new terms prevent studios from using AI to write scripts or editing scripts that have been written by a writer.
Joy Buolamwini, author of Unmasking AI and founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, proposes that creative rights can be asserted using the 4 Cs; consent, compensation, control and credit.
Undeniably, creative workers have a pivotal part to play in asserting the terms of use of AI in relation to their work, as recognised by Bouvard.
“Hopefully, between collectively bargained agreements and eventual changes to legislation, this situation will change, but it may not happen soon enough to prevent serious damage occurring to the industry,” she tells Computer Weekly.

Growth of AI 
Befоre delving intо the future оf АI, it's imроrtаnt tо first grаsр whаt Аrtifiсiаl Intelligenсe is аnd where it's сurrently аt. ""AI is the аbility оf mасhines оr соmрuter-соntrоlled rоbоts tо exeсute tаsks thаt аre аssосiаted with intelligenсe.” Аs а result, АI is а brаnсh оf соmрuter sсienсe whоse gоаl is tо сreаte intelligent mасhines thаt саn reрliсаte humаn behаviоur.

Evolution of AI
The founder of computer science, Alan Turing, stated in 1947 that before the end of the century, the usage of words and general informed opinion would have shifted so much that one could speak about machines thinking without expecting to be disputed. It wouldn't be far-fetched to claim that he was correct. Because of the nature of discovery, where previously unthinkable things become commonplace, and the old gives way to the new, it is nearly incomprehensible.
The phrase ""artificial intelligence"" was first used in the 1950s, even though the idea of thinking machines is centuries old, if only in mythology and legends. Since then, artificial intelligence technology has advanced and changed in several ways, much like its applications.
The study of neural networks dominated the history of artificial intelligence from the 1950s to the 1970s; machine learning applications began to emerge in the next three decades, from the 1980s to the 2010s. Machine learning has given birth to the more nuanced idea of Deep Learning due to constant study, increased interest, and broad application. Additionally, with new chapters opening up every year, the initial research into AI's leap into the unknown has evolved into more of a leap of faith.
Future of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) has a bright future, but it also faces several difficulties. AI is predicted to grow increasingly pervasive as technology develops, revolutionising sectors including healthcare, banking, and transportation. The work market will change as a result of AI-driven automation, necessitating new positions and skills.
АI hаs аррliсаtiоns in рrасtiсаlly every field, аnd we'll tаlk аbоut the future оf АI in eасh оf the key fields.

Heаlth Саre Industries

Indiа accounts for 17.7% оf the world's рорulаtiоn, mаking it the seсоnd-lаrgest соuntry аfter Сhinа in terms оf рорulаtiоn. Аll сitizens оf the соuntry dо nоt hаve ассess tо heаlth-саre fасilities. It is due tо а shоrtаge оf quаlified dосtоrs, inаdequаte infrаstruсture, аnd оther fасtоrs. Sоme рeорle аre unаble tо ассess dосtоrs оr hоsрitаls. 
Even if yоu dоn't gо tо the dосtоr, АI саn diаgnоse diseases based on symptoms by reаding dаtа frоm а fitness bаnd оr а рersоn's mediсаl histоry, analyzing the раttern, аnd suggesting аррrорriаte mediсаtiоn, whiсh саn be ordered easily through сell рhоnes.
Adopters stand to gain a lot from adopting Artificial Intelligence in the future in the healthcare industry. The primary focus of the healthcare industry as a whole has been gathering precise and pertinent data about patients and those who enter treatment. As a result, AI is an excellent fit for the healthcare industry's wealth of data. Additionally, there are several applications for AI in the healthcare industry.
AI is easily expandable, adaptable, and applied to many business processes. We may start to understand the possible use of the technology when we remember that AI is only a computer program. Due to its ability to provide intelligence to jobs that previously lacked it, AI is being used on a huge scale.

АI in Eduсаtiоn

The level оf eduсаtiоn reсeived by yоungsters determines а соuntry's рrоgress. We саn see thаt there аre а lоt оf соurses ассessible оn АI right nоw. Hоwever, АI will сhаnge trаditiоnаl sсhооling in the future. Mаnufасturing industries nо lоnger require skilled lаbоurers, аs rоbоts аnd teсhnоlоgy hаve mоstly reрlасed them. 
The eduсаtiоnаl system hаs the роtentiаl tо be very effeсtive аnd tаilоred tо an individuаl's рersоnаlity аnd аbilities. It wоuld рrоvide орроrtunities fоr brighter рuрils tо shine, аs well аs а better орроrtunity fоr struggling students tо сорe uр. Оn the оne hаnd, рrорer eduсаtiоn mаy strengthen individuаls аnd nаtiоns and imрrорer eduсаtiоn саn hаve disаstrоus соnsequenсes.

АI in Finаnсe

Аny соuntry's eсоnоmiс аnd finаnсiаl situаtiоn is direсtly tied tо its grоwth quаntifiсаtiоn. Beсаuse АI hаs sо muсh роtentiаl in рrасtiсаlly every industry, it hаs а lоt оf роtentiаl tо imрrоve рeорle's eсоnоmiс heаlth аnd the eсоnоmiс heаlth оf а соuntry. The АI аlgоrithm is nоw being emрlоyed in the mаnаgement оf equity funds.
When determining the орtimаl аррrоасh tо hаndle funds, аn АI system соuld соnsider а lаrge number оf vаriаbles. It wоuld оutрerfоrm а humаn suрervisоr. In the wоrld оf finаnсe, АI-driven tасtiсs аre set tо disruрt trаditiоnаl trаding аnd investing рrасtises. It соuld be disаstrоus fоr fund mаnаgement organizations thаt саnnоt аffоrd suсh fасilities, аnd it соuld hаve а lаrge-sсаle imрасt оn business beсаuse the сhоiсes wоuld be mаde quiсkly аnd аbruрtly. The соmрetitiоn wоuld be fierсe аnd tense аt аll times.
Future Robo-advisors driven by AI may be expected to be more prevalent in the financial sector. For instance, new research from Wealthramp indicates that Millennials have a more purpose-driven and technologically-centered vision of the future of financial guidance. A third of high-net-worth investors, according to Wealthramp, ""use Robo-advisors and digital tools to execute investments."" Bionic advice is another growing industry that blends computer calculations with human intuition to improve client connections more effectively than either can do on their own.

АI in Militаry and Сyberseсurity

АI-аssisted militаry teсhnоlоgies hаve сreаted аutоnоmоus weароn systems thаt dо nоt require рeорle, resulting in the sаfest wаy tо imрrоve а nаtiоn's seсurity. In the neаr future, we mаy witness rоbоt militаry thаt is аs intelligent аs а sоldier/соmmаndо аnd сараble оf dоing vаriоus tаsks.
АI-аssisted methоds wоuld imрrоve missiоn effiсасy while аlsо ensuring the sаfest exeсutiоn. The element аbоut АI-аssisted systems thаt is of a little соnсern is thаt the аlgоrithm it соnduсts is nоt соmрletely exрlаinаble. The key issue here wоuld be exрlаinаble АI, аs deeр neurаl netwоrks grоw fаster аnd соntinue tо develор. When teсhnоlоgy fаlls intо the wrоng hаnds оr mаkes рооr deсisiоns оn its оwn, it might hаve disаstrоus соnsequenсes.

Transportation

If you believe self-driving vehicles are a thing of the future, think again. Smart cars have already entered the market. Just 8% of automobiles and other vehicles had AI-driven technologies installed in them in 2015, but by 2025, that percentage is predicted to rise to 109%. At the moment, connected cars are all the rage in the automotive business. These vehicles have predictive systems that reliably inform drivers of potential spare component failures, route and driving instructions, emergency, and disaster preventive procedures, and more. By 2020, connected automobiles with inbuilt wireless connections and networks will be the industry standard. The introduction of autonomous vehicle prototypes is also gradually becoming a reality.

Advertising

AI-powered systems would effectively replicate the campaign with access to historical data and provide accurate results rather than investing thousands of dollars on a campaign to see if it would benefit a certain pool of target audiences. This would revolutionize marketing by giving companies and brands a safe location to invest their funds. Smart sentiment analysis tools and approaches might make reaching out to potential consumers simpler, generating leads and converting them to sales, determining the market share of a new product before launching, and conducting competitive research.

Impact of AI
The productivity of artificial intelligence may boost our workplaces, which will benefit people by enabling them to do more work. As the future of AI replaces tedious or dangerous tasks, the human workforce is liberated to focus on tasks for which they are more equipped, such as those requiring creativity and empathy. People employed in more rewarding jobs may be happier and more satisfied.
With better monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, artificial intelligence has the potential to drastically alter the healthcare sector. AI may help medical institutions and healthcare facilities function better, reducing operating costs and saving money. Potential for personalized medication regimens and treatment plans, as well as increased provider access to data from several medical institutions, are just a few life-changing possibilities.
Privacy Risks
When seen through a privacy-by-design lens, artificial intelligence has not differed from other technologies because privacy has not been prioritized in creating AI technology. In contrast to the risk created by data breaches, the processing of personal data by AI carries a substantial risk to individuals' rights and freedoms while simultaneously carrying very little ""fallout"" for the firms involved. AI poses several privacy problems, such as:
Data persistence - Due to affordable data storage, data persists longer than the people who produced it.
Data repurposing - Data repurposing refers to using data for purposes other than originally intended.
Data leaks—information gathered about individuals who are not the subject of the data collection
Data acquired also poses privacy concerns in ai and the future of work, such as freely giving informed permission, the ability to opt-out, restricting data collection, outlining the purpose of AI processing, and even the ability to have data deleted upon request. But how would the individuals whose data was gathered, potentially due to a spillover effect, even be aware that their information had been taken to contact companies about their data or ask for it to be deleted?

Myths About Advanced Artificial Intelligence
Deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are all the same.
All AI systems are ""black boxes,"" whereas non-AI systems are much easier to understand.
The data AI systems use to learn determines how good they are.
AI systems are intrinsically unjust; 
AI will replace human work; AI is becoming more human-like.

AI and the Future of Work
If you are wondering about how will artificial intelligence change the future, then do know that robots are probably not coming for your employment, at least not yet, so you can put some of your worries to rest?
Given how artificial intelligence has been presented in the media, particularly in some of our favorite science fiction films, it is obvious that the development of this technology has raised concerns about the possibility that humans could one day become redundant in the workplace. After all, many jobs formerly carried out by human hands have been mechanized as technology has improved. It makes sense to worry that the development of clever computers may spell the beginning of the end for employment as we know it. But don’t! Jobs will still be out there for you all.

With the momentous first year of ChatGPT in the rear-view mirror, it’s clear that Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are remarkable innovations. However, we have yet to reach a point where these models are sufficiently dependable for broad enterprise adoption for anything beyond limited applications. For one, there is the problem of AI hallucinations. While it has many diverse applications, GenAI is ultimately a sophisticated autocomplete tool, like a texting or word processing tool. It has been trained to generate impressive answers from many millions of documents, so it has no problem creating answers for users. That generative aspect is useful for creative work. It can perhaps also be useful for public, low-criticality applications of AI, for example, getting help with your term paper or blog post. But for an organization’s proprietary data or curated third-party dataset, the LLM needs to exhibit high thresholds of accuracy and correctness.In technical terms, its “temperature” needs to be low. Unfortunately a GenAI with too low a temperature lacks creative spark rendering it useless. Too high a temperature and it will strongly hallucinate. The question is how to secure the middle ground between these two extremes where creative AIs can be grounded in reality to make them inspiring and correct. An increasingly standard practice involves treating the LLM as a closed box and interacting with it through modern frameworks like LangChain. The reason why this is delivering great results and removing many of the challenges mentioned is that it introduces a fact-checking layer into the LLM. The layer blocks the production of poor answers. By establishing this architecture, we can build practical business applications on top of the AI without requiring expertise in the details of owning and fine-tuning our own LLMs. This approach is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG. RAG grounds large language models on the most accurate, up-to-date information available in the underlying knowledge graph. This enhancement improves the model’s responses. RAG applications typically retrieve supplementary text to provide context to a model. Metadata, such as timestamp, geolocation, reference, and product ID, can be used to enrich a prompt or enrich a response to some degree.In the field, we’re seeing interesting applications for this trend of using advanced technology to help the fact-checker filter work better. Microsoft, for example, has created a ‘GraphRAG’. In parallel, is the rapid adoption of vector search. Vector search was until recently, the purview of a very small set of specialized databases but is now in various data platforms, from Postgres to Neo4j.Vectors are emerging as the bedrock of GenAI. They allow the arrangement of complex documents into a “vector space” and allow users to search for “nearby” content in that space. Vectors can also be mapped into other data stores using vector search. For example, with a graph database, you can resolve a vector from ChatGPT in your graph and then search the nearby neighborhood to find curated facts from your data with which to enrich or correct the response. Vectors, RAG, and knowledge graphs: the magic trio? But RAG and vector search are proving most useful where they combine to query an entire knowledge graph containing hard facts to ground the AI. Knowledge graphs enhance RAG models by providing more context and structure than metadata alone. Knowledge graphs blend vector-based and graph-based semantic searches, which can lead to more precise and informative results. So what’s emerging as the best way of enabling effective governance of LLMs through better fact-checking and answer explanations is the widespread adoption of knowledge graphs. These knowledge graphs act as a means to easily codify the facts and model the world within which the LLM operates. By using a combination of vector search, RAG, and knowledge graph interfaces, we can synthesise the human, rich, contextual understanding of a concept with the more foundational “understanding” a computer (LLM) can achieve.At the University of Washington in the US, an AI researcher named Professor Yejin Choi is exploring an application of knowledge graphs to aid AI. Choi, who was recently interviewed by Bill Gates, is working with her team to build a machine-authored knowledge base that helps a target LLM better distinguish between good and bad insights. This centres on an AI ‘critic’ program which probes the logical reasoning of an LLM to build a knowledge graph consisting of only good reasoning and facts. For example, when asked how long it would take to dry five shirts if one shirt takes an hour, common sense tells us the time should still be one hour regardless of quantity. However, an LLM may attempt a convoluted mathematical formula instead.To address this, Choi's critic contains 6.5 million distillations of symbolic knowledge that encode common sense rules and understanding. By filtering the LLM's outputs through this large knowledge base of common sense, the critic can construct a new knowledge graph containing only high-quality, logically sound information. With such results, we can get closer to getting AI to relate things and concepts in the same way that the human brain does. And we could really benefit from that approach. We have a myriad of technologies in the world of data that can summarise numbers, calculate aggregates—perform maths, essentially. What graphs are skilled at is answering the big questions: what's important in all my data? What's unusual? And importantly, given the patterns of the data, they can forecast what’s going to happen next. It is crucial to recognize that organizations globally are already harnessing the power of knowledge graphs to unlock value from their data assets. A prime example is Basecamp Research, a UK-based biotechnology company dedicated to ethically translating nature's solutions into commercial applications. To do so, it has built a knowledge graph of the Earth’s natural biodiversity, which has over 4 billion relationships. Basecamp is using this knowledge graph to train LLMs to design proteins, using a ChatGPT-style model for enzyme sequence generation.  I might not be an AI or an LLM expert, but based on Choi’s inspirational work and such use cases, I can venture a prediction about what’s going to happen next. As we move into 2024, we will see more software and database developments like the fusion of LLM, knowledge graph, vector search and RAG to make the second year of GenAI much more useful to business than the first.See also: PDFs, RAG, and LlamaParse: Generative AI's ""Swiss Army Knife"" adds a welcome new toolkit

The roles of professionals in society are shifting thanks to the development of truly useful and powerful generative artificial intelligence. Every industry will be impacted, but we have already seen that healthcare, with its heavy use of data and technology, will be disrupted more than most.


Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat disease, develop new medicines and personalize treatments to fit individual patients. It will also fundamentally change both the day-to-day working lives of doctors, nurses and other clinical health professionals and even the way they are seen by society. As a result, they will find they are more reliant than ever on the human qualities like compassion, communication and the instinct that many who fill these jobs have for providing care.

So here’s my overview of some of the most dramatic and meaningful transformations we can expect to see in the near future, as well as some of the practical and ethical challenges that will have to be overcome.

PROMOTED
AI As A Diagnostic Assistant
Generative AI helps with diagnosing conditions by interpreting data and providing clear, in-depth insights into what is known about the patient. It can be used to examine hundreds of X-ray, MRI and CT scans and quickly give a statistical summary of its findings. This will lead to more accurate, data-driven diagnosis of many common or not-so-common conditions.

This communication can then be fine-tuned depending on the role of the healthcare professional who is using it, whether a doctor, nurse, consultant or specialist. Communicating only the insights relevant to them means there will be less noise between the professional and the specific information they need.

The World Economic Forum has also predicted that generative AI will lead to improved outcomes as it becomes able to efficiently extract data from the many disparate and siloed sources that have traditionally existed across healthcare.

It will also increasingly be used to create synthetic data, which is artificially generated to resemble real-world information. This is particularly useful for situations with limited training data, such as with rare conditions and diseases. It can also reduce the security and data protection measures that healthcare professionals must take when working with real patients’ personal data. Synthetic data can also be used to simulate healthcare scenarios like pandemics or the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms that could cause a global healthcare crisis.

Automating Routine And Administrative Tasks
It will become increasingly common for medical professionals to use generative AI to automate many of the repetitive and routine administrative tasks they carry out every day. This will free up their time to focus on directly providing care, as well as continuing their training and learning.
From managing and updating patient records to scheduling appointments, healthcare professionals engage in many time-consuming tasks that can be streamlined or even entirely taken over by AI. According to one study, doctors spend half of their working day on tasks involving maintaining electronic health records.
Generative AI can drive more efficient EHR management by intelligently organizing doctors’ notes, test results and medical imaging. It can then provide quick summaries of individual patients, highlighting aspects of their health that are a concern and generating reports for other professionals. Automating many of these tasks is likely to also have the effect of reducing errors that could impact quality of care and patient outcomes.
Generative AI In Drug Discovery
The same capabilities that allow generative AI to create text and writing can also be used to develop new candidate medicines and vaccines for clinical trials. This means that researchers can speed up the lengthy process of shortlisting potential candidates.
Last year, Oxford-based biotech firm Etcembly produced the first immunotherapy drug created with the help of generative AI.
The process promises to speed the transition of potentially lifesaving new treatments from lab to patient, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. This indicates that just like doctors and nurses, healthcare researchers and scientists will also have powerful generative AI tools to enable them to work more quickly and efficiently.
Ethical Consideration: The Human Touch
Clearly, however, integrating generative AI into healthcare in this way creates a long list of ethical challenges that can’t be ignored. This is because most use cases revolve around the use of personal data. This means that safeguarding against data leaks, losses and breaches is of paramount importance.
It’s also essential that AI algorithms make decisions that are transparent and explainable—this will be crucial for building the public trust essential for these systems’ potential to be realized.
The damage that can be caused by bias in data is also more pronounced than in nearly any other field. Its been shown that generative AI models can amplify bias present in training data. We know that women and people from minority ethnic backgrounds are more frequently diagnosed due to their underrepresentation in medical studies, and this issue could scale as AI becomes more widely used.
Data, models and outcomes must all be continually monitored and updated in order to mitigate these biases, which could otherwise further perpetuate inequalities.
Like many other professionals, those in healthcare will find themselves required to learn the skillset of the AI ethicist. This means developing the capability to evaluate potential use cases in order to determine whether applying AI is likely to cause damage, risk or danger, and ensuring adequate guardrails are in place at all times.
The Future Of Doctors And Healthcare Workers
Doctors, nurses and other clinical healthcare professionals are probably more insulated than many from the risks of being replaced by AI. Their jobs require them to function at an advanced level across many human skills that machines will not replicate any time soon. Intuition and experience all play a role, and that isn’t going to change.
AI does, however, offer the opportunity for these professionals to redefine the way they work and even their role in wider society. Shifting to models of work that allow them to spend more time with patients will also mean more time to continue their ongoing education and develop their own medical expertise.
This is likely to lead to new specializations as the need grows for clinical staff focused on AI-enhanced diagnoses, data-driven medicine and ethical AI, as well as helping patients navigate the range of new AI-assisted treatment options that will become available.
With AI handling routine analysis, record keeping and interpretation of scans, imaging and other data, doctors and nurses will spend more time getting to the bottom of more complex and nuanced patient issues.
Ultimately, the essence of providing healthcare will continue to revolve around empathy, compassion and the human touch. Generative AI creates the opportunity to augment these qualities in ways that will make professionals in this field even more essential to society. Those who are able to embrace this paradigm shift will find they are able to use their skills and training to cure sickness and improve patient lives in ever more rewarding ways.

[+] capabilities and assess how it might affect your job.Adobe Stock
Almost 40% of all global employment may be affected by AI, and in advanced economies, the figure could be as high as 60%, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund. But don’t be alarmed. That doesn’t mean 40% to 60% of jobs will disappear altogether. Instead, it means that AI automation is likely to take away, streamline or enhance some of the tasks associated with those jobs. For the most part, then, we're talking about the augmentation of human jobs. We’re talking about humans working alongside AI tools, not being replaced by them.


But still, with the many headlines about the transformative nature of generative AI, it’s no wonder people are concerned about their jobs or just concerned about being left behind by this rapidly advancing technology. In this article, we’ll explore my top tips for staying relevant in the age of generative AI.

Educate Yourself
My first tip is to get to grips with generative AI. Learn what it can do. Have a play with tools like ChatGPT to see what they’re capable of. (If your employer doesn’t allow the use of ChatGPT and other tools at work, use it in your free time.) Experiment. Have fun with it. It’s also really important to grasp that generative AI is much bigger than ChatGPT and that generative AI tools can do more than simply generate text. Generative AI can be used to create audio, voices, music, images and video. It can analyze data and extract insights. And it can write computer code.

PROMOTED
I strongly recommend you go on a learning journey. There are tons of free (and paid) courses out there that cover the whole gamut of generative AI education—from beginner and general courses to focused courses related to specific industries. There are also tech podcasts and YouTube channels that can help you get up to speed.

Assess The Potential Impact On Your Job
Once you have a good idea of what generative AI can do, compare that to your job. How might the work you do change because of generative AI? Some jobs are more exposed than others. But for most, it’s unlikely that generative AI will replace your job altogether. However, it can probably take on some of your daily tasks. In other words, generative AI (probably) won’t take your job away, but it will very likely change how you work.

I suggest you break your job down into its component tasks and core skills. Which of those component skills and tasks can be done by generative AI, now or in the near future? Which tasks will continue to require the human touch?

If your job is highly exposed to the risk of AI automation, will you potentially be looking for a new job in the next couple of years? If so, what kind of work would you like to move into, and how can you start preparing for that transition now?

Even if your exposure is moderate or low, you might still want to augment your work with generative AI. Can you, for example, adapt your job so that mundane, easily repeatable tasks are done by generative AI—thereby freeing up your time for more complex tasks? Which brings us to…
Position Yourself As Someone Who Can Harness Generative AI In Your Work
Speaking at the 2023 World Economic Forum’s Growth Summit, economist Richard Baldwin said, ""AI won't take your job. It's somebody using AI that will take your job."" This means that if you don't know how to work with AI, you're in a much riskier position—certainly compared to someone who embraces AI and knows how to use it to do their job more effectively.
So, consider how you could start integrating generative AI into your everyday work. Can you use it to polish an email, for example? (Note that many organizations have policies prohibiting using AI to create content as opposed to assist in content refinement.) Can you use it as a productivity tool? To brainstorm ideas? To summarize a lengthy report into a neat paragraph?
Grow Your Skills In More Human-Centric Areas
Knowing how to work effectively with AI is important. But it’s also important to position yourself in the organization in line with the things that AIs can’t do. For example, a generative AI tool can write decent marketing copy, but human creativity and strategic thinking are vital for planning a marketing strategy.
Basically, consider how you can take on more responsibilities in the areas where human skills are still needed and will always be needed—areas like creativity, complex decision making, strategic thinking, leadership, empathy, interpersonal relationships and so on. These are the areas where humans will continue to have the edge over machines. These are the skills that I’d advise anyone to cultivate for future workplace success.
And Above All, Learn To Embrace Change
I get it; change is uncomfortable. But today's workplaces are grappling with rapid and near-constant change. So, if change is something you struggle with, now is a good time to address that.
Working on your adaptability and flexibility will help you cope with change more easily. So, how can you find ways to boost your adaptability and flexibility? Try learning a new skill, for example, or finding small ways to step beyond your comfort zone. Volunteer for different projects at work. Or find ways to flex your creative muscles (because flexible thinking and creativity go hand in hand).
Most importantly, remember that generative AI (probably) won’t take your job. But it could improve your performance and make your work more enjoyable.

Architects and civil engineers are the shapers of our urban landscape. Their work involves balancing meticulous research and design with the ability to innovate and create.

Today, AI, and in particular language-based generative AI, is set to revolutionize these fields, just as it is changing the day-to-day role of doctors, lawyers and all professionals.


The basic idea is that generative AI tools will empower them to streamline workflows and automate repetitive elements of their work. This will leave them free to focus their limited human attention on tasks that require real ingenuity and creativity.

AI can rapidly create design ideas, using generative design algorithms to create candidates using available resources and materials. It can deploy simulations and digital twins, generate project management and budgeting plans and even help to make the construction of buildings and urban structures more sustainable.

PROMOTED
So let’s dive in and take a look at the opportunities being created now, as well as think about how AI could fundamentally change the roles of professionals in those fields.

How Generative AI is Transforming Architecture and Civil Engineering Today
Generative AI functionality is now a feature of many standard CAD tools, meaning architects and engineers can quickly explore and iterate new design concepts. These designs can then be evaluated against metrics such as structural integrity, efficiency and sustainability.
Designers can simply give the AI tool details about the project goals, location, environment, structural requirements and materials, and it will start to generate ideas for consideration.
The architectural firm Zaha Hadid Architects, responsible for projects including the sand-dune-inspired Bee’ah headquarters in the Arabian desert, uses AI image generation to conceptualize cutting-edge structures. This allows different ideas around sustainability, material choices and aesthetics to be quickly visualized and assessed.

Generative AI can also be used to create digital twins – virtual representations of buildings or structures that behave exactly like their real-world counterparts. This allows them to be stress-tested to find out how they will stand up to footfall, weather or earthquakes before a single brick has been put in place. It can also model the use of energy and water as well as the movement of people and vehicles around buildings or public spaces.

It also creates opportunities in project management, where routine tasks like scheduling meetings, collating reports and filing regulatory and compliance documents can be automated.
Language models can analyze complex building and zoning regulations, and generate predictive insights into issues that could cause delays or bottlenecks during construction. These can be communicated in natural language, meaning that potential problems are more likely to be picked up at an early stage, reducing the risk of costly errors and delays further down the line.
It has been reported that architects in China used generative design tools to design a 500-room hotel complex, which was then built from the ground up in four and a half months.
Critically, it can also be used to improve the sustainability and energy efficiency of construction projects and buildings. These requirements can be factored in at the design stage, and AI can be used to identify design features and materials that minimize ecological impact and emissions.
Compared to many other industries, toolsets are already relatively mature; industry-standard CAD platform Autodesk has offered generative functionality for several years. And Alphabet subsidiary Sidewalk Labs creates tools designed to help planners create more sustainable and environmentally-friendly urban spaces, with the assistance of AI.
The Future of Architecture and Civil Engineering
I predict that professionals in these fields who are able to augment their own skill sets through generative AI will find that they can greatly boost their productivity. They will spend less time on mundane, day-to-day aspects of their work, such as creating compliance reports or communicating complex concepts to clients through visualizations.
This will free them up to spend more face-to-face time with those clients, in order to better understand their needs. And they will find themselves more able to take a broader, strategic view of project design and execution.
Human communication skills, conflict resolution, creativity and innovation – things AI won’t be able to do for a while - will become increasingly valued and sought-after in all professions, and here it will be no different.
Inevitably it also means that architects and engineers will need at least a basic understanding of these emerging technologies. While they won’t have to become experts in technical AI, they will need to understand the role of data and in automated decision making, as well as the dangers of AI mistakes, data inaccuracy and bias.
Of course, when it comes to designing buildings, roads, bridges and structures that humans will use, we can’t delegate all of the responsibilities to machines. Humans will still have to be ultimately accountable for safety. So it’s critical that we develop the skills needed to supervise the work of machines and make sure they’re acting in a safe way.
Understanding where it is safe to let them make decisions and where human oversight has to be maintained is ultimately a question of ethics. Just as is true of almost all other professionals, architects and engineers will need a grounding in the ethical implications of AI use.
Ultimately, the dawn of the generative AI era marks a turning point for anyone involved with architecture, engineering and construction of buildings and public spaces. By understanding how AI can augment and enhance human creativity rather than replace it, it will be possible to drive transformation while increasing productivity, efficiency and sustainability. All while breaking new ground in terms of what we can create in the built environment.

Oracle advances generative AI and HR into the unknown


Oracle's new generative AI tools for HR aim to reduce costs and help candidates self-select. But some users may remain hesitant to adopt the new tech.

Published: 14 Mar 2024


 
Oracle's push to automate HR is receiving a boost from its latest release of generative AI tools.
Automation is targeting HR, and tools like generative AI might help deliver results. This week, The Hackett Group released new research that found generative AI has the potential to yield a 40% reduction in costs. The study was based on client businesses, with more than half coming from companies with at least 10,000 employees.







However, Tony DiRomualdo, senior research director at the management consultancy, said the firm has not observed any impact on HR jobs and staffing yet.
""Most HR organizations are either taking a wait-and-see approach to generative AI or conducting limited pilots,"" DiRomualdo stated.
Even Oracle acknowledges that some users need to be more confident about adoption. Oracle's first release of generative AI tools came in the fourth quarter of last year, and now it's releasing another set in the first quarter of this year.
Recruiters have long been utilizing AI to assist in sifting through resumes. But Oracle is taking this a step further by helping candidates discover suitability for a role.
""We're putting that power into the hands of the candidates to better self-select,"" said Yvette Cameron, senior vice president of global product strategy at Oracle Cloud HCM. Cameron explained that as candidates explore job opportunities, AI helps them to understand whether they are a match for a particular role.
Oracle also provides customers with an explainable AI feedback feature to reveal why specific recommendations were made. ""We don't want our AI to be a black box,"" she said.
However, Cameron acknowledged that some organizations might choose to delay using the technology for now, like how some companies still do not utilize traditional AI-based ranking assistance in recruiting despite it being available for years. She emphasized that it comes down to each customer's comfort level and interpretation of state and federal laws.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has repeatedly stated that it is watching for signs of discrimination by automated decision-making systems.

Dealing with apprehension
Evelyn McMullen, an analyst at Nucleus Research, said, ""There could absolutely be user apprehension around EEOC noncompliance or inaccuracies,"" especially concerning systems that are externally facing or interacting with candidates.
""Guardrails need to be put in place to ease hesitation and drive adoption,"" McMullen suggested. For example, candidates could appeal their results to the employer or choose to opt into or out of the automated assessment, explicitly acknowledging that AI is being used.



We don't want our AI to be a black box.

Some of the other generative AI-based tools include a candidate assistant that helps applicants get answers to common questions and understand job-specific requirements in a conversational experience.
There are also new tools for managers, including a survey generation tool for quickly obtaining employee feedback.
It's too early for productivity results, as Oracle only started incorporating generative AI into its applications in the fourth quarter of last year. However, the vendor said it expects significant productivity gains for customers.
DiRomualdo said the idea that generative AI will help HR organizations do more work with fewer people is only one possible benefit. ""There is also the question of what types of new work HR will be doing in the future,"" he said.
HR can expand its services, which could include providing advice to employees and management as well as bolstering workforce engagement, productivity and well-being programs, he said.
However, HR management might be resigned to try generative AI tools if, as Hackett predicted, HR headcounts and budgets decrease slightly while workloads increase.

IBM has informed employees that it intends to cut jobs in its marketing and communications department in a major shift towards artificial intelligence.
In December 2023, the company announced a plan to replace approximately 8,000 jobs with AI, continuing the downsizing trend around the tech sector.

International Business Machines Corp (IBM) has announced layoffs in its marketing and communications division. Chief communications officer Jonathan Adashek made the announcement in an internal meeting. The development comes on the heels of an announcement in December that the company intended to replace approximately 8,000 job posts using artificial intelligence. IBM had previously cut 3,900 jobs in January 2023.
IBM has disclosed a significant pivot towards the inclusion of artificial intelligence capabilities with upskilling programs in AI as a part of its workforce rebalancing plan. While IBM has not released information about the exact number of job cuts, it is expected to account for approximately a single-digit percentage of the company’s global strength. However, the company also expects the overall number of jobs to remain the same by the end of 2024 through select hiring.

These cuts follow the global trend of downsizing in the technology sector. Until now, over 200 companies have cut approximately 50,000 jobs, including tech giants such as Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. The cuts have been driven significantly by frequent developments in generative AI ever since ChatGPT was released in 2022.
IBM itself has invested heavily in generative AI with its Watson program, with related products doubling in number since the latter half of 2023. The pivot towards AI is critical for the company to catch up to industry leaders like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Consequently, several posts, not only in IBM but especially in backend operations, could be expected to be replaced by AI in the upcoming years.

As AI-powered tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard become workplace staples and businesses are forced to be more mindful of their bottom lines, automating labor has become a logical course of action for many.Whether CEOs decide to boast about their decision on social media (we’re looking at you Duukan) or mask the changes under layoffs and company restructures, we highlight the companies that have already ditched workers for AI, as well as some that are planning to follow suit in coming years.Read on to find out which companies are swapping humans for AI in 2024, and to learn more about one of the biggest labor market disruptions to date. For Some Workers, The AI Takeover Is Already HereWhile CEOs have been utilizing AI for some time, the dawn of tools like ChatGPT has made it easier than ever for companies to speed up manual processes, and even automate certain types of knowledge work. In fact, a recent study found that half of CEOs believe they may replace jobs with AI, with the figure rising for C-suite executives.🔎 Want to browse the web privately? 🌎 Or appear as if you're in another country?Get a huge 86% off Surfshark with this special tech.co offer. For many companies, utilizing AI is a no-brainer. Not only can it be a major cost saver at a time when rising inflation rates put further pressure on bottom lines, but it can also significantly boost productivity. This is demonstrated in our annual workplace report, which found the most productive companies are those that use artificial intelligence extensively.The result of this adoption? Widespread job insecurity. While it is true most companies are planning to augment human tasks rather than replace them altogether, the actions some companies are taking are confirming commonly held fears about the direction of the employment landscape.Understandably, most companies don’t want to gain a reputation for replacing workers with AI. So if you’re curious about which businesses are automating labor, read our summary below: 8 Companies That Have (or Probably Have) Replaced Workers With AIWhile many companies have vowed to safeguard their human workforce, lots have other ideas. Here are seven companies that have already replaced workers for AI in 2024.1. MSNUS web portal and creators of the Frutiger Aero messaging platform, MSN, decided to ditch workers for AI earlier than lots of other companies on this list. In 2020, MSN sacked dozens of journalists responsible for writing news stories displayed on the company’s homepage and has since been using AI software to create the content. According to the media company that employed the staff, PA Media, these actions were in response to financial difficulties the firm was facing, but weren’t a result of the pandemic.2. GoogleGoogle has rung in the new year by announcing not one, but two rounds of layoffs, with a potential third round on the horizon. Google CEO Sundar Pichai hasn’t explicitly announced these jobs will be replaced with AI technology outright. However, the job-cutting spree, which largely affects workers from the company ad division, coincides with a heavy deployment of AI across customer care and ad sales processes, as well as a company-wide effort to use the tech to improve “operational efficiency”.3. DukaanUnlike Google, Bangalore-based ecommerce company Dukaan took a less subtle approach to AI job replacements. Last July, company CEO Summit Shah replaced 90% of customer support staff with a chatbot that was developed in-house, before bragging about the decision on social media platform X. In the post, Shah defended the actions as “tough but necessary”, as the chatbot helped the company cut the cost of its customer support function by 85%, and drastically reduce customer wait times.4. IkeaLast June, the beloved Swedish furniture retailer Ikea announced that it would be phasing out call center work and using an AI bot called Billie to answer queries instead. However, unlike most companies on this list, Ikea is planning to upskill affected employees and has already begun training thousands of call center workers to become interior design advisors.Instead of using AI to the detriment of workers, global people manager at Ingka Group Ulrika Biesert believes its use will actually lead to the creation of new jobs at Ikea, while opening up development opportunities for existing workers.5. BlueFocusLast April, Chinese marketing agency BlueFocus decided to end the contracts of its human content writers and designers “fully and indefinitely”, in favor of generative AI. While BlueFocus didn’t state publically that it would be using AI to replace staff, the action was taken just two days after the company was granted Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI service license, and just a month after they partnered with Baidu ERNIE Bot to build a full-scale AI marketing service system, leading many spectators to put two and two together.6. SalesforceEarlier this year, US software company Salesforce fired 700 workers – equivalent to approximately 1% of its global workforce. This is in addition to similar cuts that saw the company reduce its personnel by 10% last year. Similarly to Google, Salesforce hasn’t announced that these job losses are directly linked to AI. But with Salesforce’s hiring budget decreasing as it pumps more money into artificial intelligence, some argue that it’s likely that many of these vacancies will be filled by automated labor.7. DuolingoIn January gamified language learning app Duolingo announced it will be offboarding off 10% of its contractor workforce, as the company pivots to AI to translate content. Since these workers weren’t permanent employees, no worker was officially laid off as part of this process. However, a spokesperson from Duolingo explained that part of their decision to terminate these contracts could be “attributed to AI”, sending a very clear signal that the company is happy to switch out human labor for AI.8. TurnitinTurnitin is an AI detection platform, so if you thought working with AI might be a safe career prospect, think again. Last year, Turnitin CEO, Chris Caren, stated that the company would be looking to reduce headcount, during a discussion about AI in the workplace. Caren’s vision was that future employees could be hired out of high school rather than needing multiple years experience, and that the increase in AI efficiency would also reduce the total headcount needed. At the end of 2023, Turnitin laid off 15 people.It’s a small impact on a company with 900 employees, but Caren’s original vision was that in 18 months he would be able to reduce the company’s headcount by 20%, meaning those larger redundancies could still be happening in the summer.Companies That Are Planning to Replace Workers With AIFor many companies, automating labor is a long game. Here are some businesses that are planning to replace workers with AI in the future, but are yet to hand out any pink slips.IBMTech giant IBM plans to gradually replace around 30% of its back-office roles with artificial intelligence within the next five years, equating to around 7,800 positions overall. The firm has already slowed or stopped hiring for certain clerical positions, like those working in human resources.But clerical positions aren’t the only roles at risk. IMBs CEO Arvind Krishna explained that he’s also interested in replacing roles that require more complex functions like evaluating workforce composition and productivity within the next 10 years.BTBritish telecommunications company BT plans to cut around 55,000 jobs by the end of the decade and replace around 10,000 of these roles with artificial intelligence. Chief executive Philip Jansen explains that the company is set to be a huge beneficiary of AI going forward, as it gears up to streamline its customer service operations with the technology. Not all customer service roles will become automated, however, with Jansen reassuring customers BT won’t be in a situation “where people feel like they’re dealing with robots.”    Share this postfacebooklinkedinflipboardtwitter-xwhatsapp   Did you find this article helpful?

 Clearing out the latest batch of spam emails in your inbox or creating calendar events can be exhausting. With the right AI productivity tools, you can leave those hassles behind and free up extra time in your day. Here are some of the best AI tools for work. 






1  Schedule Your Day With Reclaim.ai  
    

 Reclaim.ai is a smart calendar that automatically adjusts your schedule based on the tasks, projects, and events on your to-do list. If you need to fit some studying in between a few classes, no worries: Reclaim.ai will find the perfect time, and it will schedule time for you to enjoy lunch, too. If you aren't happy with the AI-generated schedule, you can manually rearrange tasks. 

 You should consider using Reclaim.ai if you struggle to schedule your day around appointments, meetings, and other time-sensitive tasks. If you have a predictable or linear work day, you might find that an AI to-do list app is more helpful for managing your busy work days. 





 Sign Up: Reclaim.ai (free with premium plans between $8 and $12 per month; browser app) 



2  Take Notes Effectively With NotebookLM  
    

 NotebookLM makes it easy to aggregate your information, whether they're rough meeting notes or PowerPoints. This AI tool can examine, summarize, and even answer questions about the material you add to your personal notebook. 

 NotebookLM is ideal if you need to manage a personal quick-reference guide but lack the time to edit or maintain your notes. Creating a notebook is as simple as adding sources (like Google Docs, plain text, or PDFs) and entering a few smart AI prompts. 

 Sign Up: NotebookLM (free; browser app) 








3  Transcribe Team Meetings With Krisp.ai  
    

 Gathering those pesky meeting notes for your new AI notebook is easier with an automatic transcription tool like Krisp.ai. You can transcribe meetings in Zoom, Team, Google Meet, and other apps without adding any AI ""bots"" to your meeting. 

 With Krisp.ai, you can also enjoy incredible AI-powered noise cancelation. Krisp.ai is capable of removing noisy keyboards, loud voices, and yapping dogs from the background with ease. It ensures that a subpar microphone or loud environment won't prevent you from speaking audibly, clearly, and professionally. 

 Sign up: Krisp.ai (free with premium plan at $8 per month; browser app) 








4  Perform In-Depth Research With Perplexity.ai  
    

 You might need notes if you're watching a presentation, but if you're creating your own presentation or proposal, a powerful AI research assistant can help. Perplexity.ai is an ideal option, as it seamlessly combines the convenience of tools like ChatGPT with accurate, cited answers. 

 Perplexity.ai isn't suitable as a standalone research tool, but it can be a valuable asset in your toolbox if you need to streamline your research process. 

 Sign Up: Perplexity.ai (free with premium plan at $20 per month; browser app) 



5  Generate Easy-to-Read Summaries With PDF.ai  
    





 Whether you're continuing your research or catching up on lengthy new documentation, you'll find that the easy-to-read summaries generated by PDF.ai are equally helpful. Beyond its powerful ability to condense long documents, PDF.ai also lets you instantly extract sources from a document and can answer questions about the contents of a PDF. 

 PDF.ai only lets you ask 500 questions about one document per month for free, but its affordably-priced plans are worth the cost if you need to skim lengthy documents. 

 Sign Up: PDF.ai (free with premium plans between $10 and $30 per month; browser app) 



6  Create Incredible Presentations With Slidesgo  
    






 It's difficult to master programs like PowerPoint and achieve truly professional results, but with AI tools for work like Slidesgo, there's no need to limit your presentations to your Office Suite skills. Slidesgo allows you to create a presentation with the help of AI, adapting various templates to your presentation needs. 

 Each presentation template includes a variety of graphics and icons, so making your presentation cohesive is simple. The tool's AI power means it can tweak your presentations and make them masterful within seconds. 

 Sign Up: Slidesgo (free with premium plans between $3 and $6 per month; browser app) 



7  Improve Your Communication With GrammarlyGO  
    






 While AI writing tools for work might lack some sophistication, GrammarlyGO allows you to seamlessly blend your human writing with AI-guided editing. Beyond its assistance with brainstorming and paraphrasing, GrammarlyGO offers tailored suggestions to help you elevate your writing to an intended voice and tone. 

 GrammarlyGO has a few premium subscription tiers, but all Grammarly users receive 100 free GrammarlyGO prompts each month. This is more than enough to refine your emails and improve your communication at no cost. 

 Sign Up: GrammarlyGO (free with premium plans between $12 and $15 per month; browser app) 



8  Develop Ideas and Get Feedback With ChatGPT  
    






 You can't forge the perfect AI productivity toolbox without a 'jack of all trades' like ChatGPT. This versatile AI model is capable of excelling at nearly any text-related task, but it's best used for concept development. To leverage ChatGPT effectively, you need to trust it to imagine, refine, and critique your work. 

 When you pair ChatGPT's suggestions with your own judgment, you can elevate a manuscript, email, or any other work imaginable to a masterpiece. To start, all you need is a free account and a few creative ChatGPT prompts. 

 Sign Up: ChatGPT (free with premium plans between $20 and $25 per month; browser app) 



9  Keep Your Email Clean With Spark Mail  
    






 Last but not least of the best AI productivity tools is Spark Mail. This powerful email management tool lets you proactively filter which emails reach your inbox. You can view and adjust your delivery settings for each sender and, if you're tired of receiving emails from a particular sender, you can block them entirely. 

 Spark Mail also offers features like priority email filtering, grouping emails by sender, and the ability to mute email threads you no longer wish to receive. It lacks the sophistication of truly AI-powered solutions like Sanebox, but you can manage your email for free with minimal hassle by using Spark Mail proactively. 

 Sign Up: Spark Mail (free with premium plan at $8 per month; desktop application) 

 No AI tool is powerful enough to complete every task, but streamlining your workflow by building the right ensemble of AI tools is a simple feat. Ultimately, the best AI tools for productivity for you will be the ones that you can take to their maximum potential.

LinkedIn's chief economist Karin Kimbrough says AI will create more jobs than it replaces.(ABC News)2,000 per cent surge in AI jobsShe observed that the number of English-language job ads globally looking for applicants with ChatGPT or generative AI skills has risen exponentially (from quite a small number).In 2023, the number of AI-related job listings was 21 times (or 2,000 per cent) higher than the year before.""It just speaks to the employers' desire to start bringing in talent that can help them figure out how to integrate generative AI, whether it's ChatGPT or Copilot, into their own processes and systems,"" Ms Kimbrough said.""So if last year was the year where businesses were trying to build awareness around the potential of this tool, this is the year where they're trying to build towards adoption of it.""The San Francisco-based economist says certain occupations will be ""insulated"" (or protected) from AI advancements, including locksmiths, physical therapists, construction workers, doctors and nurses.As for the workers who'll benefit the most, she listed occupations in the tech sector like web designers, software engineers and user experience (UX) technicians.Ms Kimbrough said: ""These are occupations that rely on both human skills and skills that AI can replicate, which is the 'sweet spot'.""Will advanced AI lead to wage cuts? The number of job ads requiring AI skills have risen sharply in the past year.(Reuters/Dado Ruvic/Illustration)Highly skilled jobs in advanced economies (like Australia) are more likely to face ""disruptions"" from AI, according to research from the International Monetary Fund – though it didn't stipulate a time frame.""In advanced economies, about 60 per cent of jobs may be impacted by AI,"" IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva wrote in a blog post in January.""Roughly half the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity.""For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labour demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring.""In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.""Ms Georgieva also believes that AI is likely to worsen inequality across the world economy in most scenarios, ""further stoking social tensions"" unless there is political intervention. The IMF expects AI to affect 60pc of jobs in advanced economies.(International Monetary Fund)LinkedIn's chief economist agrees that the rise of super-intelligent computers could lead to a fall in salaries for some workers — with an important caveat.""If you don't evolve, then it could push down your wages,"" Ms Kimbrough said.""But what's more likely to happen is that you're going to become more productive if you do evolve, learn to develop an AI fluency [and] get used to using tools like Copilot or ChatGPT.""""Productivity generally tends to result in higher wages, so actually, I would say it's the opposite,"" she said, in relation to most workers.She predicts it will take five to seven years before most workers are expected to know how to use AI (just like they're expected to know how to use the internet now).The problem with AI biasIt's no secret that employers generally loathe the incredibly time-intensive recruitment process.Musk sues ChatGPT maker OpenAIMr Musk, who is one of the world's wealthiest people, says the AI firm he helped create is putting money ahead of benefiting humanity. Read moreFrom sifting through hundreds or thousands of CVs to interrogating the shortlisted applicants (often through several rounds of interviews), making the candidates sit an exam (for some jobs), running background checks, and rejecting the unsuccessful jobseekers.In recent years, more companies are using AI to screen candidates (including their CVs and social media profiles), predict their likelihood of success and schedule interviews.Some of the big names include IBM, Google, Amazon and Facebook.While it's a huge time saver, there are concerns that AI may not necessarily find the best candidates at this early stage of development.For instance, Amazon developed an AI tool — which it scrapped in 2018 — to recruit top talent. But its technology reportedly discriminated against women.Amazon's AI recruitment system was reportedly trained to screen applicants by observing patterns in CVs over 10-years. However, most of the applicants were men, reflecting the male dominance of the tech sector.So Amazon's computer models formed the conclusion that men were better candidates and penalised CVs that included the word ""women"" (for example, ""women's basketball captain"").More recently, Google attracted controversy with its Gemini AI bot — which can generate images based on a user's text prompt.For example, users have typed: ""Create an image of the US founding fathers"" and ""German soldiers from the 1940s"".The results were historically inaccurate, as Gemini generated images of African-American men and Asian women wearing Nazi uniforms – and 18th-century American politicians who were non-white.It appeared the app had a bias towards racial and gender diversity, and was criticised by users for being ""woke"".In February, Google apologised for what it called ""inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions"".""We're working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately,"" Google said in a statement.""Gemini's AI image generation does generate a wide range of people. And that's generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But it's missing the mark here.""Opportunities 'we can't imagine'LinkedIn's chief economist acknowledges that AI bias is a ""valid"" risk for some companies, but ultimately believes it will lead to more diverse hiring.While a human recruiter may focus more on subjective factors (such as where the candidate went to university) and their previous job title, Ms Kimbrough said AI is better at focusing on the actual skills that a candidate could offer.""It's not a tool to weed people out. It's a tool to let recruiters spend more time finding the exact perfect fit.""The idea behind these tools is to help the recruiters, for example, actually widen the net of potential applicants.""Typically what happens is you actually pull in more women than men, and often sometimes more under-represented candidates than you had before.""Could a robot do your job?Search our database of every Australian occupation to find out how difficult it will be for artificial intelligence to do your job.Read moreShe added that it's still important to have a human decision-maker be actively involved in the recruitment process as it is ""the best failsafe"".In other words, don't rely too much on one or the other.Ms Kimbrough believes the opportunities from AI will far eclipse the human cost.""If I use history as a guide, I would say it's going to create more jobs, [but] it doesn't mean that there won't be any jobs lost,"" she said.""An economist like me would tell you, it's really important to think about those who might be bearing the cost disproportionately of a transition because of technology.""But she concludes overall it will ""create more jobs"" and ""create jobs we can't even imagine"" at this stage.Cost of living: Ask us a question or share your storyAll fields are required unless marked optional.EmailCheck this box to confirm that you are aged 15 or over. requiredUnfortunately, you cannot participate in this project if you are aged 14 or younger.SubmitThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.If you're unable to load the form, click here.Posted 12 Mar 202412 Mar 2024Tue 12 Mar 2024 at 2:48pm, updated 12 Mar 202412 Mar 2024Tue 12 Mar 2024 at 7:32pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)More on:Artificial IntelligenceAustraliaCareersInformation Technology IndustryUnemployment (Community and Society)Top Stories'The cartel scouts are watching us': Driving the dangerous road to Trump's border wallAnalysis by Annabel CrabbTwo iconic images changed the US election in a way that's unfathomable in AustraliaAustralia to take command of Red Sea task force as trade route threats in Middle East persistUS Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle resigns after conceding agency failed to prevent assassination attempt on Donald TrumpFive kids, two bedrooms: Inside the battle for a better childhood educationThese American Israeli families lost loved ones on October 7.

When generative AI tools exploded into the public consciousness, technology leaders at the General Services Administration made the decision to let agency workers “explore this space.” 
For longtime GSA CIO Dave Shive, that decision led to some eye-opening — and head-scratching — observations of the GSA workforce. But it also provided a foundation for what would inform the agency’s generative AI policy.
“It was that transparency and visibility into what people were doing and how they were doing it and increasingly why they were doing it, in connection [with] the internal compute assets that exist in GSA that allows us to have a very broad exploration for things like generative AI across the agency now,” Shive said of the GSA’s experimental gen AI phase. 
Speaking Wednesday at the FedScoop-produced Elastic Public Sector Summit, Shive recalled the “fulsome visibility” that he and other GSA IT leaders had in the early days of the agency’s generative AI test phase. Thanks to GSA’s zero trust architecture, Shive said agency leaders were able to observe “every single action” taken by those workers who wanted to look into the tech’s capabilities.

Some workers simply explored beta sites to test how various gen AI tools functioned, Shive said, while others were “writing term papers using generative AI” and others connected those gen AI tools to “external public-facing data, which was perfectly fine.”
But there was a downside to GSA’s gen AI testing approach. 
“You also saw people trying to connect those tool sets to internal private datasets, and we needed to cut everything off,” Shive said. “We realized that we had to remind people of their data use obligations [and] their privacy obligations in this space.” 
To prevent any similar data-related miscues with gen AI, Shive and his team created a “lightweight compliance framework” for GSA workers who wanted to continue dipping their toes into the generative AI waters. Creating that ask-and-approval process seemed to fix the issue, Shive said.
“Unsurprisingly, people aren’t doing stupid things anymore, [like] trying to connect to private internal databases and things like that,” Shive said.

For an agency that historically has had more data needs and requests than it can handle, “AI has been a force multiplier in allowing us to extract value out of our data stores in ways that were just never previously possible,” Shive said, citing AI’s automation and augmentative capabilities that enable GSA to “do deep inspection.”  
Ultimately, Shive said the GSA approach to generative AI aligns with its mission as a service provider to the federal government operating in a “data-rich environment” in which “nothing is trusted — no person, no device, no piece of data, and no application.” With those assumptions baked into GSA’s mission, a curious-yet-cautious approach to AI has formed. 
“We built an ecosystem of not just the monitoring and inspection, but proofing and authentication,” Shive said, “that every day a piece of data, every device, every human, or every artificial intelligence component is fully monitored, and we can act against that.”

New York and New Jersey Legislatures Introduce Bills That Seek to Regulate Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Tools in Employment


By Hannah Morris & Joseph O’Keefe on March 13, 2024




Employers who rely on artificial intelligence driven tools for their recruiting and hiring processes may face new regulations in New York and New Jersey.  In the past few weeks, three bills have been proposed (two in New Jersey and one in New York) that follow New York City’s Local Law 144 (“Local Law 144”), a law that sets rules for certain automated employment decision tools used by employers in New York City, which became effective last July.  Similar bills were introduced in both states during the 2023 legislative session.

A bill (A. 9314) proposed in the New York Assembly on February 28, 2024, would impose requirements on employers who use artificial employment decision tools (“AEDTs”) in hiring processes.  This bill is similar to Local Law 144, which we reported on here and here.  However, the new Assembly bill only targets tools used for screening and hiring applicants, while Local Law 144 also included tools used for assessing employees for advancement.  The bill would add a new section to the New York Labor Law, which would make it an unlawful employment practice for employers to screen applicants with an AEDT for jobs “within the state,” unless the AEDT was subject to a disparate impact analysis in the past year.  The bill defines AEDT as “any system used to filter employment candidates or prospective candidates for hire in a way that establishes a preferred candidate or candidates without relying on candidate-specific assessment by individual decision-makers.”  While the bill explicitly states that the disparate impact analysis would not need to be publicly filed and would be “subject to all applicable privileges,” it does require that prior to the implementation of an AEDT, employers would need to post a “summary of the most recent disparate impact analysis” and “the distribution date of the tool” on its website.  The employer would also be required to provide the state’s Department of Labor with this summary on an annual basis.  Unlike Local Law 144, New York’s proposed law does not provide for civil monetary penalties for employer violations.  Rather, the state’s Attorney General or Department of Labor Commissioner would be able to initiate investigation into possible violations and could bring actions in court to correct alleged violations.  If enacted, the bill would go into immediate effect.
Similarly, the New Jersey legislature introduced two bills (A. 3854 and A. 3911) which also aim to regulate employers’ use of AI tools in hiring.  A. 3854, like New York’s proposed bill, generally mirrors Local Law 144 and seeks to regulate AEDTs in hiring.  The stated goal of the bill is to “minimize employment discrimination that may result from the use of the tools.”  A. 3854 first defines an AEDT as “any system the function of which is governed by statistical theory, or systems the parameters of which are defined by systems…which automatically filter candidates or prospective candidates for hire or for any term, condition, or privilege of employment in a way that establishes a preferred candidate or candidates.”  Unlike the New York bill, A. 3854 would make it unlawful to sell, or offer to sell, an AEDT in the state unless (i) the AEDT has been the subject of a bias audit conducted in the past year prior to its sale; (ii) the sale of the AEDT includes, at no additional cost, an annual bias audit service that provides the results of such audit to the buyer; and (iii) the AEDT is sold, or offered for sale, with a notice stating that the AEDT is subject to the provisions of the proposed law.  Moreover, any “person” who uses an AEDT to screen a prospective job candidate would have to provide a summary on its website of the most recent bias audit, and notify each job candidate within 30 days of the AEDT’s use that an AEDT was used in connection with their candidacy, identifies the job qualifications or characteristics that the AEDT used to assess the candidate and, upon the candidate’s request, identifies the source of the data collected and the employer’s data retention policy.  Penalties for violations would range from $500 for a first offense (and each violation occurring on the same day as the first one) and a $500 to $1500 penalty for each subsequent offense.  Finally, the bill specifies that violations accrue on a daily basis for each AEDT that is sold or offered for sale in violation of the proposed law, and that “each instance” in which notice is not provided to a job candidate within 30 days constitutes a single violation, while each 30-day period thereafter constitutes a separate violation.  If the bill is enacted, it would take effect on the “first day of the third month next following enactment.”
The second New Jersey bill, A. 3911, concerns the use of AI-enabled video interviews during the hiring process.  The bill provides that “an employer in the State” that requests job candidates to record video interviews, and uses AI analysis of the videos submitted, would be required do the following: (i) “notify the applicant before the interview that [AI] may be used to analyze the applicant’s video interview and consider the applicant’s fitness for the position;” (2) “provide an applicant with information before the interview explaining how the [AI] works and what general types of characteristics it uses to evaluate applicants;” and (3) “obtain, before the interview, written consent, which may be electronic, from the applicant to be evaluated by the [AI] program.”  The proposed law would prohibit employers from using AI analysis to evaluate applicants who have not consented to its use.  Further, within 30 days of receiving a request from an applicant, an employer would have to delete the applicant’s interviews and instruct any other persons who received copies to delete the videos.  The proposed law would also direct employers who use AI analysis of video interviews to “collect and report” the race and ethnicity of applicants who are and are not offered opportunities for in-person interviews, or who are and are not offered positions.  This information would need to be reported on an annual basis to the state’s Department of Labor and Workforce Development (the “Department”).  The Department would then report to the Governor and State Legislature whether the data discloses racial bias in the use of AI.  Penalties for violations would include a $500 fine for a first offense and a $1,000 fine for subsequent offenses.  If enacted, the proposed law would take effect immediately.
We expect that we will see AI related legislative and regulatory activity this year in multiple jurisdictions.  We will keep monitoring further developments.

You know, when the steam engine was invented, people said, oh my god, locomotion will take away jobs. After that, electricity got invented, the second industrial revolution, and people said, oh, all the manual processes are going to be now automated and jobs will go away. Then came computers, the internet, and people said, oh, now computers will take away all the jobs. But let&#039;s just step back.&amp;quot;Track Budget 2024 updates real-time with BT&#039;s non-stop live streaming of India&#039;s most-important event from 8 am to 7 pm Roy emphasised the importance of skilling and reskilling in adapting to the changing landscape brought about by AI: “What I would say is it needs skilling and reskilling. The good part of AI is that it reduces the learning curve a lot so people can learn faster. You know the difference between the previous era and this era is in the previous era we used computers and automation to bring information at your fingertips. That&#039;s what people try to do. They try to digitise places, they try to digitise people, they try to digitise data. In this era it is about expertise at your fingertips. So even a common person by using a lot of these AI-generated models can produce better results. So skilling will be very very important and redeployment.&amp;quot;Echoing similar sentiments, Vyshak Venugopalan from Adobe highlighted the potential of AI to democratize creativity while simultaneously raising the standards of professional work: “We also believe the same which is AI and the powerful child of AI which is generative AI will lower the floor so that more people can enter. It will democratize creativity to a large extent. At the same time, it will also elevate the ceiling so that we all will be driven with the help of enablement and education. As Swami mentioned, the professionals will be elevated to actually uplevel the quality of work.”","{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/202403/65f57e5f80147-india-today-conclave-2024-image-arun-kumar-161126203-16x9.jpg?size=1280:720', 'caption': 'India Today Conclave 2024 (Image: Arun Kumar)', 'width': '1200', 'height': '900'}","{'@id': 'https://www.businesstoday.in/author/pranav-dixit', '@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Pranav Dixit'}"
