			Tommie Expert: Generative AI’s Real-World Impact on Job Markets		

Posted on May 28, 2024Updated June 13, 2024 By Manjeet Rege, PhD and Hemachandran K., PhD 




Generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) is now an increasing concern throughout the world, with numerous sectors buzzing about its potential and the associated concerns about job displacement. This introductory examination will look at what gen AI is, its capabilities, and the causes for these developing worries. We will specifically look at how gen AI affects men and women differently, as well as if it has a disproportionate influence on people of color and minorities.


Understanding generative AI


Gen AI, a subclass of artificial intelligence, specializes in creating content, images, music and having human-like conversations. Computer-generated art and music have their origins in the mid-20th century, though the earliest examples were quite primitive. From the late 20th to the early 21st century, the field advanced much thanks to the advent of neural networks and deep learning. PixelCNN and WaveNet enable the generation of complex data sequences such as natural language and audio waveforms, whereas transformer-based architectures such as OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) have significantly improved the ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.


Generative AI at work


In practice, gen AI is altering several industries with its diverse applications. In manufacturing, it improves design efficiency, predicts maintenance requirements, and guarantees strong quality control. It aids in the production, optimization and testing of software code. Financial services gain from its ability to develop investment plans, produce compliance documentation and improve client-investor interactions. Gen AI is critical in the media and entertainment sectors for content production, event highlighting and content management, enhancing both creative and decision-making processes.


As gen AI evolves, it is critical to consider its possible influence on diverse demographic groups to ensure that benefits are delivered equally while limiting any negative consequences on the workforce and society. The purpose of the article is to look beyond the initial enthusiasm about gen AI and objectively assess how it is affecting labor markets, positively and negatively. By examining its practical influence, we want to gain a better grasp of the potential and challenges that lie ahead in this new era of artificial intelligence.

Impact on job markets


The introduction of generative AI has significant consequences for labor markets across a variety of industries. This technology has the potential to increase efficiency and create new possibilities, but it also poses considerable dangers of job displacement, particularly in certain industries and positions.



Job displacement



The influence of AI on jobs highlights worries about job displacement, underlining the critical need for retraining. It emphasizes the importance of responding to technological advancements through continuing education, highlighting AI’s dual function in undermining existing professions while also increasing the need for new skills for future employment. Generative AI, in particular, excels at automating non-routine cognitive processes, creating a disruption risk across a wide range of vocations. According to a recent Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI has the potential to automate up to 300 million full-time jobs in the U.S. and Europe. Furthermore, a McKinsey analysis predicts that by 2030, generative AI would automate 29.5% of the hours performed in the U.S. economy, up from 21.5% now.




Figure 1: With generative AI added to the picture, 30% of hours worked today could be automated by 2030 (2).


Furthermore, a Forrester projection indicates that, while generative AI may result in the loss of 1.5% or 2.4 million U.S. employment by 2030, it is projected to affect or transform a considerably bigger chunk of 6.9% or 11.08 million jobs. This suggests a tendency toward work augmentation rather than outright replacement, emphasizing generative AI’s transformational rather than purely disruptive potential.



Vulnerable industries and roles



The industries and positions most vulnerable to the impact of generative AI include:



Clerical and administrative work: Generative AI can automate tasks such as data entry, document processing and customer service, jobs often overlooked by women.
Financial services: Roles such as investment analysis, compliance, and client-investor communication are all automated based on AI.
Software development: Generative AI can assist in code generation, optimization and testing, potentially impacting software engineering jobs.
Media and entertainment: Content creation, editing and management tasks can be streamlined by generative AI tools.




Differential impact on men versus women



The effect of generative AI on employment markets is not gender neutral. According to research, this technology’s displacement may have a disproportionate impact on women.



According to the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise, 58.87 million women in the U.S. workforce work in occupations that are heavily reliant on generative AI technology. In comparison, the comparable figure for males is six out of 10, totaling over 48.62 million (10).
The International Labor Organization (ILO) predicts that 7.8% of women’s occupations in high-income nations might be automated, totaling around 21 million jobs. In comparison, 2.9% of employment in high-income nations held by males, or around 9 million positions, have the potential to be automated, as indicated in Figure 2.





Figure 2: International Labour Organization graph on jobs with automation potential (9)


Women are disproportionately concentrated in white-collar, cognitive positions that are susceptible to generative AI automation, with an estimated 79% of working women employed in at-risk occupations (3). Men, on the other hand, are more evenly parted across white-collar and blue-collar professions, and thus are less subjected to the disruptive effects of generative AI overall. Professions where higher proportions of women may be employed such as clerical work, health care, and teaching, are among the most susceptible to the automation affected by generative AI.


Without appropriate regulation, reskilling efforts, and a practical approach to changeover management, the increasing usage of generative AI has the potential to impair current gender discriminations in the labor market.

Demographic impacts of gen AI



Disproportionate impact on minorities and underrepresented groups



The advent of generative AI raises the possibility of extremely affecting minority and marginalized groups in the labor market. According to a McKinsey analysis, Blacks are overrepresented in positions that are at high risk of automation, with 24% working in such roles compared to 20% for whites (4). This gap underlines the possibility that generative AI will have a more severe impact on Black communities, exacerbating existing racial inequities.



Exacerbation of existing inequalities



The effect of generative AI on employment markets has the capacity to exacerbate existing inequality, markedly among women. According to a Euronews research, 79% of working women work in jobs with a high risk of automation, compared to 66% of males (3). This gender imbalance shows that the advent of generative AI may impair the current gender partition in the workforce.


A Worth Magazine report observed that, while the contrasts in generative AI acquaintance between men and women were less risky, men were still slightly more likely than women to work in jobs with “high exposure” (12.6% versus 11.2%) and “low exposure” (32% vs. 27.1%), while women were more likely than men to work in jobs with “moderate exposure” (61.6% vs. 55.4%) (5). This shows that women may be more susceptible to the disruptive impacts of generative AI in the labor market.



Risk of bias and inadequate diversity



The creation of generative AI systems includes the inherent danger of bias and inadequate diversity, potentially aggravating unfair imbalances in the workforce (6). Without broad participation in AI system design and development, biases that disproportionately affect minorities and marginalized groups are more likely to persist.


According to the McKinsey report, overcoming these difficulties will need a collaborative effort to guarantee that generative AI systems are built with inclusion, justice, and diversity in mind (4). This involves ensuring that the data used to train foundation models is objective, legitimate, and devoid of racial, ethnic, gender, and other biases. Additionally, improving and developing the pool of minority tech talent will aid to ensure that generative AI is developed and steered into the future by a miscellaneous talent base with various experiences and viewpoints.


The Euronews article also highlights the need of participatory design, which expects all stakeholders in generative AI applications, comprising end users and those affected by new uses, to be involved in the building of new AI products. This approach can assist to reduce the vulnerability of bias and lack of diversity in the creation of generative AI systems.

Strategies for mitigation and adaptation



Reskilling and upskilling the workforce



As generative AI continues to disrupt the job market, reskilling and upskilling the workforce will be important to cut down the disproportionate effect on minorities and marginalized groups (4). It is essential to provide workers with training and educational prospects to aid them gain new skills and amend to the changing employment landscape, especially those in high-risk jobs. This will enable workers to transition to roles that are less sensitive to automation while still leveraging the potential of generative AI to foster their productivity and value (5).



Policy and regulatory approaches



Policymakers and regulators must take positive measures to guarantee equal access and division of the advantages of generative AI. This encompasses enacting regulations that promote corporations to engage in reskilling and retraining programs, particularly for employees from underrepresented populations. Furthermore, legal frameworks should be created to address concerns of bias, transparency, and accountability in the development and deployment of generative AI systems. These strategies can assist to reduce the danger of aggravating current disparities in the labor market.



Diverse and inclusive AI development teams



Promoting diversity and inclusion in teams progressing general AI systems is necessary to reduce bias and ensure technology aid all sectors of society. By bringing together people from diverse backgrounds, with several experiences and perceptions, the development process can better address the needs and interests of underrepresented groups. This method can help design more equitable and inclusive AI applications that benefit all stakeholders.


Conclusion


This article offers an examination of how generative AI technology reshapes sectors, covering both potential and difficulties. As this technology improves, its promise to improve efficiency and creativity becomes obvious. However, it also offers major dangers of employment displacement, particularly for women and minority groups. The disproportionate concern on these populations emphasizes the critical need for comprehensive policies and reskilling efforts to decrease inequity. Positive efforts are required to ensure that the advantages of generative AI are distributed equitably, avoiding intensifying existing gaps and providing a workforce equipped for future technological landscapes. Maintaining diverse perspectives in AI research and deployment is also critical for excluding possible biases and creating an inclusive digital economy.

One of the most powerful features of language-based generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, or AWS Code Whisperer is the ability to create computer code.

After all, code is just another language – one that’s designed to be understandable by both humans and machines – and LLMs like GPT-4 are able to analyze, sequence and predict it just as they can with natural languages.


Automation, auto-complete and procedural generation of code have been part of the software engineering workflow for many years. But generative AI goes a step further by potentially automating the entire process, from code design to testing and debugging.

Does this mean that software developers are now redundant? Well, No! Human expertise will still be essential for creative problem-solving challenges and overcoming problems with AI that will likely be around for some time. Instead, I believe humans will leverage generative AI to speed up their work and help them develop new, more efficient solutions, making their skills even more valuable in business and industry.

PROMOTED
So, here’s an overview of how I believe the role of programmers and software engineers will evolve as these tools play an increasingly big role in their day-to-day activities.

Automated Code Generation
Software engineering can often involve repetitive, time-consuming tasks such as refactoring existing code, standardizing code structures and creating documentation.
With generative AI, code to carry out basic functions such as sorting lists or reading and processing data from APIs can be generated in seconds, dramatically reducing the time spent on these mundane but necessary tasks. This means developers can focus their time on more creative elements of their work, such as strategic design and creative problem-solving.
It can also suggest more streamlined ways to structure code and detect when sections of code may be redundant or use more resources than is necessary, helping programmers to create more efficient software.

While most AI-generated code is currently created through natural language processing, it’s also becoming possible to create code from images. For example, there are tools that make it possible to sketch up the outline for a tool or application as a visual representation, such as a flow chart, and have it converted into executable code.

Overall, I believe this will lead to software engineers spending less time writing code and more time creating solutions.
Faster Testing and Debugging
Testing and debugging are a vital but often time-consuming element of software development. Generative AI tools, particularly those such as Github Copilot, OpenAI Codex and AWS Codewhisperer that are fine-tuned for coding tasks, are great for automating test cases and identifying potential bugs before they cause problems. They can analyze code to predict where bugs are likely to pop up and assist in debugging by suggesting fixes on the fly.
Already, many developers are finding that this can reduce development cycles and help create more reliable and trustworthy software. It can even explain why bugs are occurring in natural human language, helping to educate coders to become better at their craft.
Coding Generative AI Applications 
Of course, generative AI applications are useful for many people besides coders – and it will most likely be coders who will be responsible for making them available to everyone else!
Generative AI lets us create tools and applications that provide customized experiences with a high level of personalization, meaning that software tools used by everyone from doctors and lawyers to artists and designers will become more powerful, easy-to-use and flexible.
Coders with machine learning expertise will be essential when it comes to fine-tuning and customizing generative AI models for specific industries and niche use cases. As more professionals become aware of the transformative potential of generative AI on their workflows, coders with the ability to integrate generative AI functionality into “traditional” software platforms and packages will find themselves very much in demand.
The Changing Role Of Software Engineers
As is true of many other professions, the fundamental role of software engineers, coders and developers will evolve as intelligent, generative tools become increasingly omnipresent.
Instead of laboriously writing code line by line, they may find their roles within organizations and society shifting to become more supervisory and strategic.
Coders will learn new and emerging skill sets like prompt engineering, allowing them to move beyond the traditional workflows of code generation and build using the new technologies that are becoming available.
This will mean developing the ability to critically evaluate and assess code generated by machines while also identifying tasks where human intervention remains essential.
There will also be a need to understand issues like AI ethics, security and regulation, to ensure they’re working in a way that’s both responsible and compliant with emerging ethical and legal frameworks.
Putting all of this together, we can conclude that these roles are likely to be transformed in profound ways. Beyond simply creating new ways to go about day-to-day tasks, it will require a rethink of the aptitudes, skillsets and personality traits that make a great software developer. Get it right, and it is likely they will become more productive, more efficient and more critical than ever to the business success of their organizations.

The ministry is seeking to work with a specialist provider to help fulfil an exploratory exercise to help understand how and where AI could play a role in triaging information

The Ministry of Justice is seeking to work with a supplier – on a pro bono basis – to continue exploring possible uses of generative artificial intelligence in triaging documents and information.
The MoJ’s Justice Digital team has issued a commercial notice seeking potential suppliers interested in supporting the ministry in delivering a “proof-of-concept process to explore methods for human-in-the-loop triage through GenAI”.
The ministry ultimately intends to work with one single provider on a project intended to help “understand if GenAI tools would be of any benefit to the triage system”.
The scope of the proof-of-concept process will include experimenting with the use of generative AI to fulfil two functions: “to automatically digitise and codify incoming documents including hand-written notes; and synthesise and triage that information against policy requirements to complete a first pass at eligibility checks to make faster and more informed decisions – but leaving the actual decision to the human”.

This exploration will use “a limited number of redacted example cases” and “no access to sensitive or personal data and no access to MoJ systems will be required”, according to the procurement notice.
The MoJ outlines that the aim of the of the exercise “is not to build a production-ready tool… [but] to help accelerate existing work, test and prove different solutions/tools, share learning to help inform future work and designs, and transfer skills back into the team throughout”.
The notice adds: “Justice Digital will be sharing with other teams the progress made to date with using AI Large Language Models. Throughout the duration of this project, Justice Digital will share the knowledge within internal teams who can carry on building on top of the deliverables, but also with the wider teams that that are interested in using these new tools.”
While the ministry may not have immediate intentions to implement an AI triage tool, potential partners are instructed that “we require tools and solutions explored to align to our standards and preferences… to enable ease of future development should we progress from the foundations identified in the exploration”.
Potential suppliers – who will not be paid for their work – have until 31 May to express their interest, with the MoJ’s chosen partner expected to work with the ministry over a two-month engagement, expected to begin next month.

In brief
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can help improve work processes, yet they also carry the risks of liability, penalties, and reputational damage. Companies deploying AI must understand their responsibilities and obligations under the current regulatory frameworks within the EU and the anticipated requirements of the EU AI Act. Particularly for the HR department, it is prudent for HR managers to implement the following basic principles regarding AI.

Introduction of standardized AI rules
Before implementing AI, companies need to carefully plan their AI strategy and introduce internal company guidelines on AI. These guidelines should be set out in a corporate-wide AI policy and should include, among others, the following rules:

The use of AI should only be permitted following the completion of AI introductory training. Employees should only be allowed to continue using AI after completing AI training courses as prescribed by the company.
Employees may only use AI systems approved by the company and only for business purposes.
AI may only be used for certain tasks, e.g., creating tables and texts, revising presentations, summarizing articles, and creating LinkedIn posts.
Employees should ensure that end products or work results produced by AI are clearly labeled as being generated by AI.
Employees should not input business secrets, confidential information and personal data into the AI system.
Employees must check AI-generated content for accuracy and compliance with applicable laws. If they are unclear about whether the content is compliant, employees must seek the opinion of the legal department.
Employees using AI are required to consult with the legal department before publishing AI-generated content to ensure compatibility with IP rights, personal rights, and trademark rights.

Compliance with data protection
AI should only be used in the workplace if the company implements a comprehensive data security strategy. To be compliant with data protection laws, companies must take the following steps before implementing AI systems:

The company must assess the types of data categories that AI can process and ensure that the processing is based on a specific legal basis. For non-sensitive data, processing can usually be justified on grounds of legitimate interest. However, when processing sensitive data (e.g., health data, data on trade union membership, information on the origin or sexual orientation, etc.), the processing must be based on a regulation provided by law or a collective agreement (e.g., on the basis of payroll obligations or to fulfill reporting obligations to authorities) or alternatively be based on a works council agreement.
Furthermore, data processing via AI must serve a specific and legitimate purpose (e.g., organizing working timetables and shift schedules, organizing employee absences) and may only take place if necessary to achieve that purpose.
The company must also inform employees about the data that is being processed, the purpose of the data processing, the means used for the data processing, and the legal basis for the processing.
Depending on the technical capabilities of the AI system, the company must also carry out a data protection impact assessment. This is particularly necessary if the impact of AI on the workforce is difficult to assess.
When transferring employee data to third parties (e.g., the AI software is not hosted on the company’s local servers or if the company allows group companies to access employee data), the company is also obliged to agree terms with third parties on protecting customer and employee-related data. There are further obligations to consider when transferring data to third countries.
If AI systems enable automated decision-making in HR management, the company must ensure that the automated decision-making process is only a preliminary process and that the final decision is made by a human being.

In addition, employees can submit requests to the company for information about their personal data being processed. If necessary, employees can escalate their concerns to the data protection authority.
Compliance with the co-determination rights of the workforce

A company must obtain the works council’s consent via a works council agreement before implementing AI models.
Where there is no competent works council, a company needs to obtain the individual contractual consent of the employees if the AI system is invasive.
Where there is a competent works council, companies must proactively inform the works council about the following before using AI for the first time: the data categories of the processed employee data,.the software used, the specific programs installed, any evaluation and processing procedures (e.g., the possibility of linking, duplicating, changing data), and any recipients of this data.
Furthermore, the works council has a right to be consulted and advised on the health effects of the AI system on the workforce. The works council can also request access to the AI system.

Risks of non-compliance
Penalties: Employees can initiate a complaint against their employer for breaches of data protection obligations. If the data protection authority confirms the existence of violations, this may trigger administrative fines of up to EUR 20 million or up to 4% of the annual global turnover, whichever is higher.
Damages and discrimination cases: Employees have the right to sue for damages if there are data protection violations and discriminatory AI results and to initiate discrimination proceedings before the authorities and courts.
Injunctions: In the event of non-compliance with co-determination rights, the works council can enforce the deactivation of the AI system via a court ruling, in some cases even via a preliminary injunction.
Reputational damage: Companies will not only be exposed to financial and legal risks. As proceedings before administrative authorities and courts are open to the public, it can also trigger reputational damage.
Recommendation
Several steps must be taken before implementing any AI systems to leverage their potential while ensuring HR compliance. These steps will also help organizations to prepare for their obligations under the EU AI Act. Not only is it necessary to introduce clear AI guidelines, but it is also vital to create awareness within the workforce regarding AI. This is the only way to prevent or at least reduce liability, penalties, and reputational damage. In addition, early engagement with the works council on the potential implementation of AI will help accelerate the implementation process of AI.

Could Artificial Intelligence Create Real Liability for Employers? Colorado Just Passed the First U.S. Law Addressing Algorithmic Discrimination in Private Sector Use of AI Systems (US)
By Gabrielle Martin on May 28, 2024 Posted in Artificial Intelligence, Colorado, Discrimination, Employment Law



On May 17, 2024, Colorado became the first U.S. state to pass a law aimed at protecting consumers from harm arising out of the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) systems. Senate Bill 24-205, or the “CAIA,” is designed to regulate the private-sector use of AI systems and will impose obligations on Colorado employers, including affirmative reporting requirements. The CAIA, which will take effect on February 1, 2026, applies to Colorado businesses that use AI systems to make, or that are used as a substantial factor in making, employment decisions.
While President Biden has released an executive order on the development and use of AI, there is no comprehensive federal legislation regulating the use of AI systems. Despite signing the bill into law, Colorado Governor Jared Polis released a signing statement expressing his reservations with the CAIA and encouraging the legislature to improve upon the law before it takes effect. Colorado employers should monitor for guidance on and amendments to the CAIA, in addition to preparing for compliance.
What Employers Need to Know
The CAIA imposes a duty of reasonable care on developers (i.e., creators) and deployers (i.e., users) of high-risk AI systems to protect consumers from any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination. Although the law does not exclusively regulate employers, high-risk AI systems include AI systems that make, or are a substantial factor in making, employment-related decisions.  The law provides a narrow exemption for businesses with less than fifty employees that do not use their own data to train the AI system.
Under the CAIA, “algorithmic discrimination” means any condition in which the use of an AI system results in differential treatment or impact that disfavors a consumer or group of consumers on the basis of characteristics protected under federal law or Colorado law, including age, color, ethnicity, disability, national origin, race, religion, veteran status, and sex.
The law creates a rebuttable presumption of reasonable care if a deployer takes certain compliance steps, including:

Risk-management policy and program.  Deployers must adopt a risk-management policy and program meeting certain defined criteria. The risk-management policy and program must be regularly reviewed and updated, as well as reasonable in consideration of various listed factors.
Impact assessment.  Deployers must also complete annual impact assessments for high-risk AI systems.  An impact assessment must include, at a minimum, a statement of the purpose, intended use, and benefits of the system, an analysis of whether the system poses known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination and a description of how the deployer mitigates those risks, a summary of the data processed as inputs and outputs of the system, an overview of the categories of data, if any, the deployer used to customize the system, any metrics used to evaluate the performance and known limitations of the system, a description of transparency measures taken, including any measures taken to disclose the use of the system to consumers and a description of the post-deployment monitoring and user safeguards provided concerning the system.
Notices. The CAIA also requires deployers to provide various notices to consumers (i.e., Colorado residents). Prior to using an AI system to make employment-related decisions, employers must inform applicants that an AI system will be used and disclose the purpose of the system, the nature of the decision(s) the system may make, and a plain-language description of the system. Additionally, for an applicant adversely affected by the decision of an AI system, the employer must provide the principal reason(s) for the adverse decision, an opportunity to correct any incorrect personal data used by the AI system, and an opportunity to appeal the adverse decision. A covered employer must also post in a “clear and readily available” manner on its website a notice of the types of AI systems that are currently deployed, the known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination, and the data collected and used by the deployer. Finally, deployers must disclose to Colorado’s attorney general the discovery of algorithmic discrimination within their AI systems within 90 days after the discovery.

The law provides an affirmative defense in an enforcement action by the attorney general if a deployer (i) discovers and cures a violation as a result of feedback, adversarial testing or red teaming (as those terms are defined by the National Institute of Standards or Technology (NIST)), or an internal review process, and (ii) the deployer is otherwise compliant with the NIST’s Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework or another internationally recognized framework for artificial intelligence management. Colorado’s attorney general has the exclusive authority to enforce the CAIA.
Although the CAIA is the first of its kind in the U.S., the law shares structural similarities to the Artificial Intelligence Act recently adopted by the European Union.  Acknowledging industry opposition, Governor Polis expressed in the signing statement his hope that the CAIA will be significantly improved upon before it takes effect and emphasized that “Colorado remains home to innovative technologies.” Colorado employers should continue monitoring for guidance on or amendments to the CAIA, as well as preparing for compliance.

KINGSTON, R.I. – May 28, 2024 – If you’ve heard the term deepfake, you may have some notion of how artificial intelligence can be used in communications. Earlier this year, a robocall purportedly of President Joe Biden discouraging voters from participating in the New Hampshire state primary prompted swift investigation by election officials as well as action by the Federal Communications Commission. More recently, TikTok announced its intention to label AI-generated content as the technology becomes more universal.
But how are professional communicators and public relations firms utilizing generative AI? And what are the ethical considerations for doing so? That’s what a new study from researchers at the University of Rhode Island, along with industry partner and independent public relations agency MikeWorldWide, aims to discover. The study, made possible through a $10,000 grant from The Arthur W. Page Center for Integrity in Public Communication at Penn State, will explore the drivers and barriers to the adoption of AI technology as well as perceptions of its ethical use.
“There is a lot of emerging technology available in the space of generative AI,” says Ammina Kothari, director of URI’s Harrington School of Communication and Media. “But when we talk about generative AI in the space of public relations, the types that apply very directly are things like image generation and cloning of voices.”
From a business perspective, she says, it’s much more cost-effective to utilize these types of technologies than creating a campaign that would involve purchasing images or hiring actors or photographers and paying for a shoot or recording session. However, ethical concerns remain.
“Use of AI technology in creative work is a growing trend and one I don’t think any company can completely avoid these days,” said Joon Kim, URI assistant professor of public relations and communication studies. “But an important question is what firms disclose to their clients and how they communicate about its use.”
Kothari and Kim agree that it is important that clients understand what they are paying for. There are also concerns about how an artist’s work may be co-opted by generative AI platforms. The two also note the similarity between tools and how the tools collect data to generate output.
“By their nature, PR and ad campaigns should be unique,” says Kothari. “So, if you are replacing what is – essentially – a very human contribution, and companies are using the same or similar tools, how do you differentiate?”
“AI will drive an array of evolutions for the public relations industry, from reporting, gathering insights and curating content,” says Bret Werner, president of MikeWorldWide and a URI alumnus. “However, what makes a successful PR strategy is its inherent understanding of connecting with audiences, which cannot be lost. By leveraging our own client partners and employees, we’ll unearth the industry’s view, acceptance, and concerns around this technology wave we find ourselves on.”
Research will commence this summer with a field study that will include in-depth interviews and research on industry use of generative AI tools, its challenges and ethical issues surrounding its use, which will help form the basis of a broader survey of public relations practitioners. Additionally, the team will develop and field a second survey of public relations clients and potential clients to ascertain their understanding of generative AI and perception of its use for strategic communication.
Study findings will provide a fuller picture of AI use in the public relations industry and client perceptions and uncover any disconnect between the two. Additionally, knowledge gained as to challenges and ethical issues surrounding its use will provide practitioners with insights that will help to pave the way for more effective, ethical, and transparent communication.

Large language models (LLMs) are the latest example of that. These powerful subsets of AI are trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.According to a report by LinkedIn, 55% of its global members may experience some degree of change in their jobs due to the rise of AI.Knowing how AI and LLMs will disrupt the job market is critical for businesses and employees to adapt to the change and remain competitive in the rapidly growing technological environment.This article explores the impact of AI on jobs and how automation in the workforce will disrupt employment.Large Language Models: Catalysts for Job Market DisruptionAccording to Goldman Sachs, generative AI, and LLMs can potentially disrupt 300 million jobs shortly. They have also predicted that 50% of the workforce is at risk of losing jobs due to the integration of AI in business workflows.LLMs are increasingly automating tasks previously considered the sole domain of human workers.  For instance, LLMs, trained on vast repositories of prior interactions, can now answer product inquiries, generating accurate and informative responses.This reduces the workload of human staff and allows for faster, 24/7 customer service. Moreover, LLMs constantly evolve, going well past customer services and being utilized in various applications, such as content development, translation, legal research, software development, etc.Large Language Models and Generative AI: AutomationLLMs and generative AI are becoming increasingly prevalent, which could lead to partial automation and the potential displacement of some workers while creating opportunities for others.1. Reshaping Routine TasksAI and LLMs excel at handling repetitive tasks with defined rules, such as data entry, appointment scheduling, and generating basic reports.This automation allows human workers to focus on more complex tasks but raises concerns about job displacement. As AI and LLMs become more capable of automating routine tasks, the demand for human input decreases, consequently triggering job displacement. However, jobs that require a high degree of human oversight and input will be the least affected.2. Industries at Automation RiskSectors with a high volume of routine tasks, like manufacturing and administration, are most susceptible to AI and LLM automation. Due to their ability to streamline operations like data entry and production line scheduling, LLMs are a risk to jobs in these sectors.SourceAccording to the Goldman Sachs report, AI automation will transform the workforce with efficiency and productivity while also putting millions of routine and manual jobs at high risk.3. Potential Loss of Low-Skilled JobsThe impact of AI on the low-skilled workforce is expected to grow in the future. ​The skill-biased nature of AI-driven automation has made it more difficult for those with less technical knowledge to grow in their employment. This is because automation widens the gap between high and low-skilled workers.Low-skilled workers can only retain their jobs through high-quality education, training, and reskilling programs. They may also face difficulty transitioning to newer, higher-paying, and high-skilled jobs that use AI technologies.This becomes more evident as the latest McKinsey report predicts that low-wage workers are 14 times more likely to need a job switch. Without upskilling or transitioning to new, AI-compatible roles, they risk being left behind in a rapidly evolving job market.4. Role of AI and LLMs in Streamlining ProcessesA significant shift occurs within the business landscape due to the growing adoption of AI and LLMs. A recent report from Workato reveals a compelling statistic: operations teams automated a remarkable 28% of their processes in 2023.AI and LLMs are game-changers, reducing operating costs, streamlining tasks through automation, and improving service quality.The Future of Work in the Age of AIWhile AI is inevitable, with enough resources and sufficient training, employees can use AI and LLMs to increase productivity in their daily routine tasks.For instance, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) states that customer support agents using a generative AI (GPT) tool increased their productivity by around 14%. This shows the potential of collaboration between humans and machines.While AI undoubtedly changes the job market, its integration should be seen as an opportunity rather than a threat.  The true potential lies in the collaboration between human intuition, creativity, and empathy combined with AI's analytical prowess.Reskilling For LLMs and Generative AIWhile GPT could generate texts and images, its successors, like GPT-4o, seamlessly process and generate content across text, audio, images, and video formats.This shows that the new multi-modal LLMs and AI technologies are evolving rapidly. Reskilling becomes essential for both modern organizations and workers to survive due to the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of jobs. Some of the important skills include:Prompts Engineering: LLMs rely on prompts to guide their outputs. Learning how to create clear and concise prompts will be a key factor in achieving their true potential.Data fluency: The ability to work with and understand data is essential. This covers collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, influencing your interaction with LLMs.AI literacy: Foundational knowledge about AI, including its capabilities and limitations, will be essential for effective collaboration and communication with these powerful tools.Critical thinking and evaluation: While LLMs can be impressive, assessing their outputs is important. Assessing, updating, and analyzing the LLM's work is essential.Ethical Implications of AI in the WorkplaceThe presence of AI in the workplace has its pros and cons, which must all be carefully considered. The former, of course, increases productivity and reduces costs. However, if adopted detrimentally can also have adverse effects.Here are some ethical considerations that need to be part of the larger narrative:Algorithmic Bias and Fairness: AI algorithms have the potential to reinforce biases found in the data they are trained on, which could result in unfair recruitment decisions.Employee Privacy: AI relies on vast amounts of employee data, raising concerns about potentially misusing this information, which could lead to unemployment.Inequality: The increased use of AI in workflows presents challenges like inequality or inaccessibility. Initiatives like upskilling and reskilling programs can help reduce AI's negative impacts on employees across organizations.Workplace paradigms are shifting as a result of AI and LLMs integration. This will greatly impact the future of work and careers.For further resources and insights on AI and data science, explore Unite.ai.

However, America may begin to pull away with the opportunities on the strength of three differentiators: its broader base of private-sector tech companies, that sector’s momentum in AI innovation and Washinton’s relatively lighter touch with technology regulation compared with the more cautious climates in Brussels and London. These are among the key insights ascertained from a reading of a McKinsey Global Institute report posted May 21.“Amid tightening labor markets and a slowdown in productivity growth, Europe and the United States face shifts in labor demand spurred by AI and automation,” the McKinsey experts write. “Our updated modeling of the future of work finds that demand for workers in STEM-related, healthcare, and other high-skill professions [will] rise, while demand for occupations such as office workers, production workers, and customer service representatives [will] decline.”Projecting that as much as 30% of current hours worked may be automated by the end of this decade—thanks largely to generative AI—McKinsey advises watching for shifts in employment demand to soon enough become the new normal. Here are five highlights from an online summary of the full report. 1. Demand will change for a range of occupations through 2030, including growth in STEM- and healthcare-related occupations, among others. Europe and the United States face shifts in labor demand spurred not only by AI and automation but also by efforts to achieve net-zero emissions, an aging population, infrastructure spending, technology investments and growth in e-commerce, the May 21 report states. More: ‘Our analysis finds that demand for occupations such as health professionals and other STEM-related professionals [will] grow by 17% to 30% between 2022 and 2030.’2. Automation boosted by generative AI will force millions of occupational transitions by 2030.  McKinsey’s economic modeling suggests that roughly 20% of hours worked could be automated even without gen AI, “implying a significant acceleration,” the authors write. By 2030, they project, Europe could require up to 12 million occupational transitions, affecting 6.5% of current employment. In the United States, required transitions could reach almost 12 million, affecting 7.5% of current employment. ‘Unlike Europe, this magnitude of transitions is broadly in line with the prepandemic norm.’3. Organizations will need a major skills upgrade. The occupational transitions noted above herald substantial shifts in workforce skills in a future in which automation and AI are integrated into the workplace, the authors remark. Demand for social and emotional skills could rise by 11% in Europe and by 14% in the United States, they add. ‘Underlying this increase is higher demand for roles requiring interpersonal empathy and leadership skills. These skills are crucial in healthcare and managerial roles in an evolving economy that demands greater adaptability and flexibility.’4. Retraining will be key to supplying needed skills and adapting to the new work landscape. Executives surveyed by McKinsey for the May report tend to worry they won’t be able to find the right skills by 2030. More than 25% of respondents believe failing to capture needed skills “could directly harm financial performance and indirectly impede efforts to leverage value from AI.” To acquire the skills they need, McKinsey points out, organizations have three main options—retraining, hiring and contracting. ‘Executives are looking at all three options, with retraining the most widely reported tactic planned to address the skills mismatch. On average executives so inclined said they would retrain 32% of their workforce.’5. Enhancing human capital at the same time as deploying technology could boost annual productivity growth. Organizations and policy makers have choices to make. The way they approach AI and automation, along with human capital augmentation, will affect economic and societal outcomes, the McKinsey report authors comment. “Making full use of the advantages on offer from technology,” they emphasize, “will require paying attention to the critical element of human capital.” The authors conclude: ‘In the best-case scenario, workers’ skills will develop and adapt to new technological challenges. Achieving this goal in our new technological age will be highly challenging—but the benefits will be great.’The executive summary includes a link to a PDF of the full report.  Related reading:The only thing to fear from AI in healthcare is fear of AI in healthcare itself Large language models, other GenAI options stimulating tech purchasing in healthcare GenAI-focused market researchers: ‘The payer–provider divide is wide and has dangerous implications’ Dave PearsonDave P. has worked in journalism, marketing and public relations for more than 30 years, frequently concentrating on hospitals, healthcare technology and Catholic communications.

Leadership is important, but so is efficiency — and cost-cutting.Listen to this article · 8:40 min Learn moreShare full article307VideoCreditCredit...Steph RamplinBy David StreitfeldReporting from San FranciscoMay 28, 2024Leer en españolAs artificial intelligence programs shake up the office, potentially making millions of jobs obsolete, one group of perpetually stressed workers seems especially vulnerable.These employees analyze new markets and discern trends, both tasks a computer could do more efficiently. They spend much of their time communicating with colleagues, a laborious activity that is being automated with voice and image generators. Sometimes they must make difficult decisions — and who is better at being dispassionate than a machine?Finally, these jobs are very well paid, which means the cost savings of eliminating them is considerable.The chief executive is increasingly imperiled by A.I., just like the writer of news releases and the customer service representative. Dark factories, which are entirely automated, may soon have a counterpart at the top of the corporation: dark suites.This is not just a prediction. A few successful companies have begun to publicly experiment with the notion of an A.I. leader, even if at the moment it might largely be a branding exercise.A.I. has been hyped as the solution to all corporate problems for about 18 months now, ever since OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT in November 2022. Silicon Valley put $29 billion last year into generative A.I. and is selling it hard. Even in its current rudimentary form, A.I. that mimics human reasoning is finding a foothold among distressed companies with little to lose and lacking strong leadership.“In struggling companies, you’ll be replacing operational management first but probably keep a few humans to think beyond the machines,” said Saul J. Berman, a former senior consulting partner with IBM. Overall, he said, “the change delivered by A.I. in corporations will be as great or greater at the higher strategic levels of management as the lower ranks.”Chief executives themselves seem enthusiastic about the prospect — or maybe just fatalistic.EdX, the online learning platform created by administrators at Harvard and M.I.T. that is now a part of publicly traded 2U Inc., surveyed hundreds of chief executives and other executives last summer about the issue. Respondents were invited to take part and given what edX called “a small monetary incentive” to do so.The response was striking. Nearly half — 47 percent — of the executives surveyed said they believed “most” or “all” of the chief executive role should be completely automated or replaced by A.I. Even executives believe executives are superfluous in the late digital age.When Anant Agarwal, the founder of edX and a former director of M.I.T.’s Computer Science and A.I. Lab, first saw the 47 percent, his initial response was that the executives should be saying something else entirely.“My first instinct is they would say, ‘Replace all the employees but not me,’” he said. “But I thought more deeply and would say 80 percent of the work that a C.E.O. does can be replaced by A.I.”That includes writing, synthesizing, exhorting the employees. More subtly, A.I. — if it reaches any of the levels its salespeople are promising — will democratize the job of top management even while scaling it back.“There used to be a curve of people who were good with numerical skills and those who were not,” Mr. Agarwal said. “Then the calculator came along and was the great equalizer. I believe A.I. will do the same thing for literacy. Everybody could be C.E.O.”Working for the robots has been a long time coming, at least in the realm of popular culture. Perhaps the first use of the phrase “robot-boss” was in 1939 in a story by David C. Cooke in a pulp magazine called simply Science Fiction. It was not an empowering tale of mentorship and mutual support.“Remember,” the robot-boss says, “my photon gun will shoot faster than you can run, so don’t try to get away.”Many science fiction stories and movies followed that portrayed the human-machine relationship in an equally dark light. Nevertheless, real people seemed to perversely warm to the idea. In a 2017 survey of 1,000 British workers commissioned by an online accounting firm, 42 percent said they would be “comfortable” taking orders from a computer.Long before the current A.I. boom, Jack Ma, then the chief executive of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, predicted that in 30 years “a robot will likely be on the cover of Time magazine as the best C.E.O.” He pointed out that robots were quicker and more rational than humans, and were not driven by emotions like anger.The Chinese online game company NetDragon Websoft, which has 5,000 employees, appointed what it calls an “A.I.-driven rotating C.E.O.” named Tang Yu in 2022. “We believe A.I. is the future of corporate management,” said the company’s founder, Dejian Liu, adding that it was part of NetDragon’s move into the “metaverse-based working community.”Tang Yu, who is personified as a woman, does not appear on an online chart of NetDragon’s management team, but the company announced last month that she had won “the coveted title of ‘China’s Best Virtual Employee of the Year’” at the China Digital Human Industry Forum. Another executive picked up the award for her. NetDragon’s A.I. employee team is in charge of performance evaluations and mentoring, among other duties, the company says.On the other side of the world, the upscale Polish rum company Dictador announced in November that it had an A.I. humanoid C.E.O., Mika. She proclaimed on LinkedIn that she was “devoid of personal bias, ensuring unbiased and strategic choices that prioritize the organization’s best interests.”Executives with the National Association of Chief Executive Officers might have something to say about this trend — if only to deny it — but its website does not list any actual human beings affiliated with the group. A message sent through a “contact us” prompt received no reply.A.I. experts, the human kind, cautioned that we are still at the beginning of any transition but said this is a natural progression.“We’ve always outsourced effort. Now we’re outsourcing intelligence,” said Vinay Menon, who leads the global A.I. practice at the consultant Korn Ferry. He warned that “while you may not need the same number of leaders, you will still need leadership.”For one thing, humans provide accountability in a way that machines do not. “A.I. may be exploited by some as a way to shield folks from having to take fiduciary responsibility,” said Sean Earley, a managing director of the executive consulting firm Teneo. “At what point does it become culpable for a mistake?”“Never” was the position one company took in court recently. A customer brought a case against Air Canada for declining to give the bereavement fare reduction that a chatbot on the airline’s site had promised. The customer took his complaint to a small claims tribunal. Air Canada argued in its defense that it cannot be held liable for information provided by one of its agents, servants or representatives — including a chatbot.The judge ruled against the airline and in favor of the passenger in February, but the specter of a company’s arguing that its own A.I. could not be trusted did not bode well for A.I. management teams. Air Canada declined to comment.Much of the discussion over the last year about A.I. in the workplace has revolved around how rank-and-file employees are at risk unless they incorporate new technology into their jobs — without, of course, letting their jobs become A.I. Automation historically puts workers at risk even as it benefits investors and managers.Now the tables are turned. Researchers speculate that automation on the executive level could even help lower-level workers.“Someone who is already quite advanced in their career and is already fairly self-motivated may not need a human boss anymore,” said Phoebe V. Moore, professor of management and the futures of work at the University of Essex Business School. “In that case, software for self-management can even enhance worker agency.”The pandemic prepared people for this. Many office workers worked from home in 2020, and quite a few still do, at least several days a week. Communication with colleagues and executives is done through machines. It’s just a small step to communicating with a machine that doesn’t have a person at the other end of it.“Some people like the social aspects of having a human boss,” Ms. Moore said. “But after Covid, many are also fine with not having one.”David Streitfeld writes about technology and the people who make it and how it affects the world around them.

Sinequa Augments Companies with Release of New Generative AI Assistants




Combining Sinequa’s Search with GenAI provides the ultimate AI Assistant and virtual coworker






May 30, 2024 07:55 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK & PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AI-powered search provider Sinequa announced today the availability of Sinequa Assistants, new enterprise-grade generative AI assistants that seamlessly integrate with all enterprise content and applications to augment and transform knowledge work. Sinequa’s new generative AI Assistants empower employees to work more efficiently, effectively and creatively, allowing them to accelerate and improve decisions, devote more time to strategic initiatives and drive business success.


“By 2027, GenAI will augment 30% of all knowledge workers’ tasks, from 0% in 2023.”Post this

Generative AI (GenAI) is poised for rapid adoption. According to Gartner, “By 2027, GenAI will augment 30% of all knowledge workers’ tasks, from 0% in 2023.” (1) As organizations have grappled with how to reliably use generative AI in business, Sinequa’s Assistants demonstrate that combining search with GenAI in a technique called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables the next generation of AI-augmented knowledge work. Sinequa’s unique Neural Search is the perfect complement to GenAI and provides the foundation for Sinequa’s Assistants. Its capabilities go far beyond RAG’s conventional search-and-summarize paradigm to intelligently execute complex, multi-step activities, all grounded in facts to augment the way employees work. Assistants automate tedious tasks and streamline work processes with added insights for better results, improved quality, and a more satisfying work experience.


Unlike other AI assistants or copilots that lack secure access to the full scope of all enterprise content, Sinequa’s Assistants leverage any and all company content and knowledge to generate contextually-relevant insights and recommendations, while ensuring privacy and data governance. Optimized for scale with three custom-trained small language models (SLMs) for the best relevance at low cost, Sinequa Assistants ensure accurate conversational responses on any internal topic, complete with citations and full traceability to the original source.


Sinequa Assistants work with any public or private generative LLM, including Cohere, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Microsoft Azure Open AI, Mistral and others, allowing companies to choose which LLMs best meet their needs while controlling costs. The Sinequa Assistant framework powers a range of ready-to-go Assistants along with tools to define custom Assistant workflows so that customers can use an Assistant out of the box, or tailor and manage multiple Assistants from a single platform. These Assistants can be tailored to fit the needs of specific business scenarios and deployed and updated quickly without code or additional infrastructure. Some of the domain-specific Assistants available include:



The Augmented Scientist empowers research teams to converse with scientific content from an ever-increasing number of data sources to speed up clinical trials, drug development and streamline Research & Development (R&D) processes.



The Augmented Engineer empowers design teams with a unified view of projects, products, and parts and the ability to construct and search across a digital thread.



The Augmented Lawyer gives lawyers and paralegals powerful self-service research capabilities across all case files and information through a time-saving AI search.



The Augmented Asset Manager empowers financial asset managers and advisors to leverage valuable insight from contracts, portfolio history and documents.



All of the Assistants are powered by Sinequa’s search platform, combining the most accurate and performant hybrid search technology and three custom SLMs. A flexible Assistant framework makes it easy to define custom workflows informed by search and combine that with any generative AI model, whether commercial, private, or open source.


“To better capitalize on the feedback following production incidents in our refineries, we implemented JAFAR (Jenerative AI for Availability REX), a new search app designed to streamline information retrieval in TotalEnergies' knowledge databases. Powered by Sinequa's search engine/RAG combined with generative AI, JAFAR enhances decision-making by analyzing documents and providing recommendations,” said Aude Giraudel, Head of Smart Search Engines, TotalEnergies. (2)


While most companies are still experimenting with basic search-and-summarize RAG, Sinequa has gone much further with Assistants that take RAG to the next level. Sinequa’s Assistants execute multi-step workflows to accomplish complex tasks with reasoning, incorporating RAG as needed to fully leverage corporate knowledge. This ensures that the Assistant responds accurately, transparently, and securely, with the most up-to-date information, including inline citations to original sources and immediate traceability – and access – to those sources.


“Sinequa has been investing in Artificial Intelligence and leading Enterprise Search for the last 20 years thanks to our unmatched connectivity and scalability on enterprise content. Having pioneered the use of LLMs in search with our custom-trained SLMs, Sinequa is perfectly positioned to take search and RAG to the next level with the release of Sinequa’s Generative AI Assistants. This is an exciting time as our Assistants augment the way we work, empowering knowledge workers to deliver higher quality work in less time, and with greater confidence and lower mental stress. At Sinequa we are proud to support our customers in their GenAI transformation,” said Jean Ferré, CEO and Co-Founder of Sinequa.


As part of this paradigm shift and the unveiling of Sinequa’s virtual assistants, Sinequa has also launched a new brand identity and company website to reflect this new era of work augmented by Assistants informed by search and Sinequa’s role in advancing AI in the enterprise. AI is fundamentally transforming how work gets done, and represents a new world of opportunity for augmenting employees and businesses. For more information, visit www.sinequa.com.

Skip Ad                  Ad   “They obviously looked at my resume,” Brown said.She received an email from what she thought was Synterex, a well-known clinical and regulatory consulting firm specializing in agile methodology, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies.It stated, “We reviewed your resume for the Junior Recruiter at Synterex. We think you could be a good fit for the opportunity.”After filling out a few screening questions, she received an offer of $30 per hour and health benefits to work from home.Brown needed the money; she has a child and her husband had just suffered a severe stroke.“I was vulnerable at that time. It was hard for me. I was looking for a job,” Brown said.All she had to do was cash a check for nearly $5,000 to pay for a home office which could include a laptop. Even better – she received a follow-up letter that stated, “If you are able to work for the company for a period of 12-16 weeks, the materials automatically become yours.”She took the check to a local bank but got some bad news.“The bank figured out right away this was a scam,” Brown said. “The public needs to be aware of work-at-home scams.”INCREASE IN A.I. SCAMSAccording to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, nearly 15,000 people reported being victims of employment scams in 2022, with losses totaling more than $52 million.“It’s a lucrative scam,” Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said. The ITRC has seen a 545% increase in reports in January 2024 compared to December 2023. Velasquez said the quality of the fake checks and letters has improved because of artificial intelligence.“It doesn’t take any time, and it costs very little for the scammers to develop picture and letter-perfect templates and online profiles. So, it looks very, very legitimate,” Velasquez said.Those A.I. generated job scams can be much more dangerous than typical phishing emails.Crooks use A.I. to scrape your personal information, then create and send a targeted attack.Another part of the scam can include links within the offer letter asking victims for more information. Clicking those links can download malware or steal your private information to use against you or sell on the dark web.HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELFAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, there are ways to protect yourself:Verify the job ad.Visit the official company website and apply there instead.Google the company with words like “scam,” “review,” or “complaint.”If a company sends you a check, asks you to deposit it, and return part of the money, it’s a scam.Synterex Statement:“Unfortunately, like many other companies, Synterex was targeted by a scammer who digitally impersonated us in early 2023. When we first became aware of the scam, we immediately published a post on LinkedIn to warn current and future clients as well as partners and team members that bad actors were using our brand name to ‘recruit’ new hires using unofficial email addresses. Since then, we have taken extra measures such as creating an official Glassdoor account and reporting any accounts that were impersonating us. We filed a formal complaint with IC3 back in 2023, though we have yet to hear back from any relevant authority or jurisdiction regarding this matter. Our team also took the extra step and responded to each person we could verify had been scammed via email to let them know that the requests came from a non-Synterex domain so they would cease communications with the scammers.“Our hearts go out to any applicant who spends time applying for a job only to find out the process was not real. We understand how involved the talent acquisition process can be. It is disheartening, to say the least, to see applicants who are excited about the potential to work for these companies have their time and resources stolen, or worse. That’s why we are always working to elevate our digital security measures to combat this type of threat.”Download the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.Follow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW©2024 Cox Media Group",NewsArticle,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://d1hfln2sfez66z.cloudfront.net/05-29-2024/t_f3088088dc4148e8a5b5e680bc33559e_name_file_960x540_1200_v3_1_.jpg', 'height': 540, 'width': 960}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Boston25News.com Staff'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Boston 25 News', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.boston25news.com/pf/resources/images/sites/cmg-tv-10020/station-logo-small.png?d=856', 'width': 270, 'height': 60}}",‘I was vulnerable’: Artificial intelligence work-from-home job scams targeting victims,2024-05-29T11:33:18.713Z,2024-05-29T11:33:18.859Z,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/i-was-vulnerable-artificial-intelligence-work-from-home-job-scams-targeting-victims/LLV2FQUE2ZHGPOM72K7IBE6LHY/'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employers and job seekers are increasingly turning to generative AI (genAI) to to automate their search tasks, whether it’s creating a shortlist of candidates for a position or writing a cover letter and resume. And data shows it can improve the chances at getting that job or finding the perfect talent match.
For human resources and hiring managers who are seeing an increase in responsibilities, genAI can create a short list of potential candidates in seconds — and automate much of the onboarding process.
For job seekers, genAI tools like ChatGPT can not only become creative companions in crafting narratives and emails to potential employers, but even assist applicants in passing assessment tests.
 
 
 













 
 

“Recruiters and hiring managers are keenly aware that candidates are in on the AI game. If you type ‘write a software engineer cover letter’ into the ChatGPT tool, you will get a cover letter in less than one minute. The same is true if you request a specific resume. Presto, you will have a resume on the spot,” said Paula Bratcher Ratliff, CEO of Women Impact Tech, a non-profit community for women in technology fields.

The darker side to using AI in hiring is that it can bypass potential candidates based on predetermined criteria that don’t necessarily take all of a candidate’s skills into account or they can contain hidden biases based on how they were trained by their creators. And for job seekers, the technology can generate great-looking resumes, but often they’re not completely truthful when it comes to skill sets.
“The use of AI in talent acquisition is particularly prevalent in tech hubs and innovative industries where the demand for skilled professionals is high,” said Rick Hammell, founder and CEO of Helios, a workforce management platform startup. “The benefits and potential problems associated with using AI to find talent have global implications.”
 
 
 













 
 

Hammell and others see genAI offering improved recruitment outcomes, better candidate matching, and enhanced diversity and inclusion efforts. The challenges, however, include algorithmic bias, data privacy issues, and transparency.
“The need for transparent and ethical AI practices are concerns that organizations across different countries must address to ensure fair and unbiased hiring processes,” Hammell said.
GenAI aids job seekers with research, resumes, cover letters and more
A survey by Resume Builder updated earlier this month found that 18% of US workers used ChatGPT in their job search over the past year. The majority (75%) used it for research, but almost as many (73%) used it for resume creation. They also used the AI-powered bot for interview preparation (69%) and cover letter creation (62%), and more than half (51%) used it to create email communications.
 
 
 













 
 

The primary reasons job seekers used ChatGPT were to improve the quality of their application materials (88%), to appear more professional (76%), and to save time (65%).
Job seekers can leverage AI tools, from professional photo builders, interviewing techniques, best practices, and mock interview tools to simulate real interview situations, according to Ratliff. 
Some of the AI-tools that can be used to format your resume, include:MyPerfectResume: Professionally written content.ResumeGenius: Extensive library of templates.Enhancv: AI-powered resume analysis.Resumaker.ai: Targeted keyword optimization.Kickresume: LinkedIn data import option.Rezi: Real-time content analysis.
 
 
 













 
 

Resume Builder’s survey of 1,000 US workers actively engaged in a job search within the past year also found that ChatGPT users are more likely to negotiate higher salaries and get more frequent interview requests than those who did not use the tool.
About one-third of respondents (29%) said they did not get hired because the employer became aware of their use of ChatGPT in the hiring process. However, 55% said they their prospective employer “praised” their use of the technology in the job search process.
“My guess is that some employers think ChatGPT promotes lying or cheating, while others see the efficiency and better application materials. It really shouldn’t matter if someone is using ChatGPT, as long as they use their experiences to create the information for applications. If they are using it to pass assessments, that isn’t right,” Julia Toothacre, Resume Builder’s resume and career strategist said in a report.
 
 
 













 
 

Not surprisingly, younger job seekers were more likely to use the chatbots, with 24% of 18- to 24-year-olds, 21% of 25- to-34-year-olds, and 25% of 35- to-44-year-olds saying they used the tool. Only 9% of 45- to 54-year-olds used ChatGPT in the hiring process. Men were also more likely to say they used ChatGPT than women (25% vs. 10%), according to Resume Builder’s report.
“The numbers related to age discrepancies in ChatGPT use aren’t surprising for a few reasons,” the report stated. “First, younger generations have historically been more likely to embrace new technologies. Second, there are a lot of people on social media right now sharing their ChatGPT hacks for job searching, so I think it’s something that younger generations are learning about more rapidly. They are likely frustrated with the hiring process and want to try anything they can to get ahead of the competition.”
Gartner’s 2023 survey of nearly 3,000 job candidates from 13 countries in 24 industries and spanning 21 job functions found an even higher percentage of job seekers using genAI tools in their search. Among the 38% of respondents to the Q3 2023 survey who used generative AI, 43% reported using it to generate text for their resumes, and 42% used it to craft their cover letters.
 
 
 













 
 

Gartner
The Gartner survey also found:

Overall, those who used generative AI said it was responsible for a significant percentage of the final work.
A third of candidates try to optimize their resume for AI technologies.
Additionally, a third of candidates believe AI can introduce bias into the hiring process, while a similar number believe it can reduce bias.

Gartner
In some cases, employees also trust AI over their human managers to offer them career advice. Nearly half of Gen Z employees surveyed by an outplacement services firm Intoo indicated they’d trust a chatbot like ChatGPT for advice over their manager, who many said don’t support their career development.
GenAI automation helps overwhelmed hiring managers
On the hiring side, companies are adopting genAI to streamline their talent acquisition process. A recently published survey of 113 HR leaders by Gartner revealed HR technology as their top budget priority for the third consecutive year. Technology for “talent management” rose from seventh place last year to third this year.
 
 
 













 
 

A recent survey of 1,000 HR managers performed by payroll automation provider Sage showed that 95% of respondents have experienced a workload increase over the last year, and 91% noted an increase in their responsibilities. Seventy-seven percent of the respondents also believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize their work processes by reducing time-consuming tasks and ultimately easing burnout, according to the Sage survey.

Women Impact Tech’s Ratliff said there are many advantages to using AI in the hiring process. Some of the most advantageous uses are to screen resumes and schedule interviews. “These tasks used to take up the majority of a recruiter’s time. With continued talent shortages in IT, specifically, time to hire, it can be costly,” she said.
“Top talent will be employed by the most efficient companies. Thus, companies use AI to create job descriptions and postings and match the candidates whose skills best align with those job descriptions,” Ratliff continued. “In addition to screening resumes and sourcing candidates across various social media sites and job boards, we’re seeing a trend in automating communication.  GenAI can help create templatized emails for personalized candidate outreach.  We’re even seeing a growing trend in chatbots conducting preliminary interviews.”
 
 
 













 
 

One of the most promising outcomes of AI-supported hiring practices is the potential to mitigate bias, Ratliff said, because both conscious and unconscious human bias can significantly impact decision-making when hiring talent. 
“By concealing demographic information such as name, age, race, and gender, AI algorithms can help create equal opportunities for women and other underrepresented groups, considering that women currently make up only about 28% of the workforce,” she said. “However, there have been instances in top tech companies where the machine learning specialist who built the candidate screening system favored male candidates.”
In one instance, an AI algorithm disqualified women from the hiring process by ‘learning’ that the most common resumes were men, simply based on the statistics of more applicants being male than female. “We’ve made significant strides since these earlier AI tools, but employers must ensure the quality of the data used to train AI models to avoid such biases,” she said.
 
 
 













 
 

Betsy Summers, a principal analyst in Forrester Research’s Future of Work practice, said while properly trained AI can mitigate discrimination, she also agreed with Ratliff that the tech can often exacerbate problems of bias because “it’s an algorithm built by humans with biases, and learns from human supplied data.”
Summers pointed to “an alarming data point” from a study by The Society for Human Resource Management that revealed only two in five employers say their vendor is very transparent about the steps taken to ensure AI tools protect against bias.
While AI tools simplify arduous tasks for hiring managers and others, the objective should never be to eliminate human judgment from the process, Ratliff said. Instead, the focus for the tech should be to expedite hiring times and support recruiters in making the most informed decisions possible. 
 
 
 













 
 

“A recruiter’s role is pivotal in this process, as their judgment is irreplaceable,” she added.
More HR vendors and others are now offering AI-powered platforms to automate the creation of potential job candidate lists for hiring managers who are tasked with culling from lists of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of job candidates.

HR technology company Phenom, for example, sells an AI-enabled hiring platform that creates a shortlist of job candidates for recruiters and hiring managers. Its technology, which the company claims is used by 200,000 hiring managers, creates a candidate list based on skills, experience, and location using “fit” scores, an assessment to evaluate a candidate’s suitability for a specific role and company.
 
 
 













 
 

“It streamlines interview scheduling for hiring teams, interviewers, and candidates through automation. It additionally enables hyper-personalized interactions with candidates, employees, and alumni through generative AI,” said John Harrington, senior director of product marketing at Phenom.
For job seekers, Phenom’s tool uses a semantic search engine that scans career websites to help candidates identify relevant job opportunities through context-driven algorithms, according to Harrington.
Startup Eightfold AI recently announced its AI-powered applicant tracking system (ATS) that handles the recruitment process for companies from end-to-end. The tool is also aimed at streamlining the recruitment process, enabling organizations to quickly identify and secure top talent through AI-powered recommendations. The Eightfold Talent Tracking tool also generates job descriptions, recommends job-posting platforms, and handles pre-onboarding integrations.
 
 
 













 
 

Iffi Wahla, CEO of startup Edge, a network that connects companies with remote talent around the world, believes AI bot tech — including OpenAI’s new ChatGPT-4o — will be used more often by companies to screen candidates. It will also increasingly be used by job seekers to write resumes, fill out applications, and prepare for interviews. And users of AI tech, he said, are likely to get more frequent interview requests than those who don’t use it.

Wahla believes that use of genAI by job seekers will leap from Resume Builder’s 18% figure last year to 50% of candidates this year. From 70% to 80% of Edge’s prospects who are registered with his talent network admit to using AI to help them craft resumes and other materials, Wahla said.
The Edge talent network’s AI-powered platform is currently serving the medical, dental, and insurance industries, helping them find talent to fill open positions while also automating onboarding processes. It can also handle remote workforce management for HR, functions like benefits administration, payroll management, and vacation oversight to ensuring legal compliance and handling taxes.
For companies, the time spent onboarding new employees after adoption Edge’s platform was reduced by 70%, Wahla said. The AI handles user questions, so there’s not as much back and forth with the recruiters or hiring managers, and it can also walk new employees through the steps of onboarding.
 
 
 













 
 

Job seekers, use genAI judiciously
What may be an issue is when chatbots craft resumes that aren’t particularly honest about the job seeker’s actual skills, embellishing on their talents because that’s what the AI was trained to do.
“Job seekers should definitely use AI to help them with the job search process, but it needs to be utilized with caution,” said Resume Builder’s Toothacre. The problem, she explained, is that AI is pulling its information from what is online, and not all advice and information is accurate.
Not all hiring managers and executives are enamored with the idea that AI is crafting a job applicant’s online persona and skill set.
“Any applicant using ChatGPT or other generative AI to pass assessments or write a cover letter would be a hard pass for me. I think it’s totally fine to use for interview practice or to generate ideas. But any time you are substituting the work of an AI for your own organic work, that’s where it crosses a line for me,” Andre Kazimierski, CEO of house painting business Improovy, told Resume Builder.
Job seekers need to make sure that whatever AI drafts for them, it makes sense for their experience and job function. “AI can sound too generic at times, so this is where putting your eyes on it is helpful,” Toothacre said. 
She is also concerned about the use of AI to complete assessments. “Skills-based assessments are in place to ensure you are qualified and check your knowledge. Using AI to help you pass those assessments is lying about your experience and highly unethical.”
There’s plenty of evidence that genAI can improve resume quality, increase visibility in online job searches, and provide personalized feedback on cover letters and resumes. However, concerns about overreliance on AI tools, lack of human touch in resumes, and the risk of losing individuality and authenticity in applications are universal issues that candidates need to be mindful of regardless of their geographical location, according to Helios’ Hammell.
“Encouraging a balanced approach that combines AI assistance with personalization and creativity is essential for job seekers navigating the global job market,” Hammell said.
Forrester Research’s Summers said many recruiters and HR functions have been leveraging AI for at least a decade, automating processes, personalizing action recommendations based on machine learning, and analyzing language for sentiment. But genAI represents a “huge change,”  she said.
“And based on our data, the broader HR function didn’t prioritize AI in the past, which sets them up for a steep learning curve,” Summers said.
According to a Forrester survey in 2021, only 28% of HR professionals reported that AI was in their list of priorities. Only 19% of HR leaders were confident in their function’s AI capabilities, and only 32% of them said they were investing in skill development for their teams on AI and automation. 
“Building AI confidence and capability doesn’t happen overnight, so HR has to make up for the lack of prioritization,” Summers said. “The biggest impediment to incorporating AI into recruiting use cases is the mismatch between how AI works and what recruiters expect from their technology. AI learns and improves over time, with adoption and use. But expecting recruiters to enroll in that new way of interacting with technology is a tall order.”

How California and the EU work together to regulate artificial intelligence



Tuesday, May 28, 2024
| Sacramento, CA 

















Gerard de Graaf, senior envoy for digital to the U.S. and head of the European Union office in San Francisco, speaks in Brussels on April 3, 2019.Nuno Rodrigues/European Union



By Khari Johnson, CalMatters
While the federal government appears content to sit back and wait, more than 40 U.S. states are considering hundreds of AI regulation bills. 
California, with its status as a tech-forward state and huge economy, has a chance to lead the way. So much so, in fact, that the European Union is trying to coordinate with the state on AI laws. The EU opened an office in San Francisco in 2022 and dispatched a tech envoy, Gerard de Graaf, to better communicate about laws and regulations around AI. 
We are living through what de Graaf calls “the year of AI.” De Graaf and deputy head of the EU office in San Francisco Joanna Smolinska told CalMatters that if California lawmakers pass AI regulation in the coming months, the state can emerge as a standard bearer for the regulation of AI in the United States. In other words: California’s laws could influence the future of AI as we know it.
Last month, de Graaf traveled to Sacramento to speak with several state lawmakers key to AI regulation: 

Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, a San Ramon Democrat, is author of a bill that requires businesses and state agencies report results of AI model tests in an effort to prohibit automated discrimination 
Democratic State Sen. Scott Wiener from San Francisco is author of a bill to regulate generative AI 
Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, an East Bay Democrat, is author of a bill that would require online platforms put watermarks on images and videos generated by AI sometimes referred to as deepfakes ahead of elections this fall 
And Sen. Tom Umberg, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was referred to by Politico as the “California’s chief gatekeeper for AI rules.” 

The meeting to discuss the bills was at least the sixth trip de Graaf or other EU officials made to Sacramento in two months. EU officials who helped write the AI Act and EU Commission Vice President Josep Fontelles also made trips to Sacramento and Silicon Valley in recent weeks.
This week, EU leaders ended a years-long process with the passage of the AI Act, which regulates use of artificial intelligence in 27 nations. It bans emotion recognition at school and in the workplace, prohibits social credit scores such as the kind used in China to reward or punish certain kinds of behavior and some instances of predictive policing. The AI Act applies high risk labels for AI in health care, hiring, and issuing government benefits.
There are some notable differences between the EU law and what California lawmakers are considering. The AI Act addresses how law enforcement agencies can use AI, while Bauer-Kahan’s bill does not, and Wicks’ watermarking bill could end up stronger than AI Act requirements. But the California bills and the AI Act both take a risk-based approach to regulation, both advise continued testing and assessment of forms of AI deemed high risk, and both call for watermarking generative AI outputs.
“If you take these three bills together, you’re probably at 70-80% of what we cover in the AI Act,” de Graaf said. “It’s a very solid relationship that we both benefit from.”
In the meeting, de Graaf said they discussed draft AI bills, AI bias and risk assessments, advanced AI models, the state of watermarking images and videos made by AI, and which issues to prioritize. The San Francisco office works under the authority of the EU delegation in Washington D.C. to promote EU tech policy and strengthen cooperation with influential tech and policy figures in the United States.
Artificial intelligence can make predictions about people including what movies they want to watch on Netflix or the next words in a sentence, but without high standards and continuous testing, AI that makes critical decisions about people’s lives can automate discrimination. AI has a history of harming people of color, such as police use of face recognition, deciding whether to grant an apartment or home mortgage application. The technology has a demonstrated ability to adversely affect the lives of most people, including women, people with disabilities, the young, the old, and people who apply for government benefits.
In a recent interview with KQED, Umberg talked about the importance of striking a balance, insisting “We could get this wrong.” Too little regulation could lead to catastrophic consequences for society, and too much could “strangle the AI industry” that calls California home.

Coordination between California and EU officials attempts to combine regulatory initiatives in two uniquely influential markets.
The majority of the top AI companies are based in California, and according to startup tracker Crunchbase, for the past eight months, companies in the San Francisco Bay Area raised more AI investment money than the rest of the world combined.
The General Data Protection Regulation, better known as GDPR, is the European Union’s best known legislation for privacy protection. It also led to coinage of the term “the Brussels effect,” when enforcement of a single law leads to outsized influence in other countries. In this case, the EU law forced tech companies to adopt stricter user protections if they wanted access to the region’s 450 million residents. That law went into effect in 2018, the same year that California passed a similar law. More than a dozen U.S. states followed suit.
Defining AI
Coordination is necessary, de Graaf said, because technology is a global industry and it’s important to avoid policy that makes it complicated for businesses to comply with rules around the world. 
One of the first steps to working together is a shared definition of how to define artificial intelligence so you agree on what technology is covered under a law. De Graaf said his office worked with Bauer-Kahan and Umberg on how to define AI “because if you have very different definitions to start with then convergence or harmonization is almost impossible.”
Given the recent passage of the AI Act, the absence of federal action, and the complexity of regulating AI, the Senate Judiciary staff lawyers held numerous meetings with EU officials and staff, Umberg told CalMatters in a statement. The definition of AI used by the California Senate Judiciary committee is informed by a number of voices including federal agencies, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the EU.
“I strongly believe that we can learn from each other’s work and responsibly regulate AI without harming innovation in this dynamic and quickly-changing environment” Umberg told CalMatters in a written statement.
The trio of bills discussed with de Graaf in April passed their respective houses this week. He suspects questions from California lawmakers will get more specific as bills move closer to adoption. 
California lawmakers proposed more than 100 bills to regulate AI in the current legislative session. 
“I think what is now the imperative for the Legislature is to whittle the bills down to a more manageable number,” he said. “I mean, there’s over 50 so that we focused particularly on the bills to these assembly members or senators themselves.” 
State agency also seeks to protect Californians’ privacy
Elected officials and their staff aren’t the only ones speaking with EU officials. The California Privacy Protection Agency — a state agency made to protect people’s privacy and require businesses comply with data deletion requests — also speaks regularly with EU officials, including de Graaf.
Most states with privacy protection laws rely on state attorneys general for enforcement. California is the only state with an independent agency with enforcement authority to audit businesses, levy fines, or bring businesses to court, said agency executive director Ashkan Soltanti, because key elements of the EU’s privacy protection law influenced the formation of California’s privacy law. De Graaf and Soltani testified about similarities between definitions of AI in California and the EU in an assembly privacy committee hearing in February.
“The roots of the agency were inspired at great length by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),” Soltani said. “There’s an interest and a goal, and in fact, our statute directs us to where possible, make sure that our approach is harmonious with frameworks in other jurisdictions, not just states but internationally as well.”
Soltani was hired when the agency was created in 2021. He told CalMatters international coordination is a big part of the job. After hiring staff and attorneys, one of his first orders of business was joining the Global Privacy Assembly, a group of 140 data privacy authorities from around the world. California is the only U.S. state that is a member of the group.
Alignment is important for setting the rules of the road for businesses but also for consumers to protect themselves and their communities in a digital world where borders blur.
“They don’t think whether they’re doing business with a California company or a European company or an Asian company, particularly if it’s all in English, they just think they’re interacting online, so having consistent frameworks for protection ultimately benefits consumers,” Soltani said.
Like California lawmakers, the California Privacy Protection Agency is in the process of writing rules for how businesses use AI and protections for consumers, students, and workers. And like the AI Act, draft rules call for impact assessments. Its five-member board will consider passing rules into law in July.
The last day of the legislative calendar year for California lawmakers to pass a bill into law is Aug. 31.

By definition, artists and designers are creative people. They work in these jobs because they have talent and skills that they love to share with the world.

So, it isn’t surprising that many of them are cautious or distrustful about the impact generative AI will have on their professional lives.


However, like writers, architects, and other creative professionals, many find that it creates opportunities to work more efficiently and even enhance their creativity.

Generative AI is transforming most industries, and the creative fields of art and design are certainly no exception. But by embracing it, artists, designers, illustrators and animators could find themselves spending more of their time on the aspects of their work they are passionate about and less on the routine and mundane elements they'd rather skip over.

According to research by Goldman Sachs, generative AI has the potential to automate 26 percent of the tasks carried out by professional artists and designers.
This is likely to include things like recoloring, editing images to remove backgrounds and unwanted features, enhancing image quality, adapting visuals to fit different style templates, creating multiple variations of existing work for use in different jobs, and generating design elements such as icons, fonts and textures.
It will still be up to the artist or designer to put visual assets together in a way that’s personal to them, but by augmenting their skills in this way, artists will be able to work more quickly and make better use of their time.

Generative AI functionality is also quickly being incorporated into creativity tools and software platforms, like Photoshop and AutoCAD. This makes these tools more user-friendly and intuitive, meaning artists and designers spend less time working out how to get the software to do what they want and more time creating.

For businesses, this will mean quicker project completion, while freelancers will fit more work into their schedules, allowing them to take on more work or offer lower prices to their clients.

Enhancing Creativity
Generative AI can be great for sparking the imagination. Artists and designers staring at a blank page and wondering how to get started may find it useful for suggesting initial concepts, sketches, characters or color palettes. Unusual or unexpected ideas generated in this way could encourage them to take their creativity in new directions and explore uncharted territory!
It can help to overcome “creative block” and think about new ways to approach creative briefs and challenges.
It can give artists and designers an idea of how their work will change if they employ different styles or techniques, allowing them to experiment with new aesthetics and expand their skill sets.
It can even act as a personalized art critic, offering feedback and suggestions on how work can be improved or altered in order to better align with project goals.
While generative AI can’t replace human creativity – and neither would we want it to – it can be used in ways that make us think about what it is that specifically makes work “human”, enabling us to focus on expressing those elements of our work.

New Forms Of Collaborative Art And Design
Generative AI opens the doors to entire new artforms and genres of art. Memories of Passers By I, by Mario Klingemann, became one of the first pieces of entirely AI-generated art to be exhibited publicly when it was unveiled in 2019. It uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to create a never-ending stream of unique portraits.
More recently, the New York Museum of Modern Art acquired a piece titled Unsupervised Machine Hallucinations by Refik Anadol, which uses generative AI to reinterpret existing works in the museum’s collection.
And the artist Sougwen Chun received acclaim for her project Drawing Operations, for which she built an AI-powered robotic arm that collaborates with her during drawing sessions, learning from her movements and contributing its own strokes in order to create collaborative works of art.
As technology progresses, we can expect to see museums and galleries develop increasingly immersive and interactive experiences, blurring the boundaries between the real and the virtual, as well as artists and audiences. Imagine installations that adapt, depending on who is viewing them, to create personalized experiences, incorporating technologies like augmented and virtual reality alongside generative AI.
Just as the invention of photography gave rise to impressionism, followed by movements such as cubism, surrealism, and pop art, artists working in traditional mediums will have their own response to the arrival of the AI age, creating entirely new artistic frontiers.
It probably isn’t going too far to say that the convergence of human and machine creativity may mark the start of a new chapter in the field of art and design. Rather than stifling human imagination and ingenuity, I believe that it will stoke them, leading to new art forms, genres and movements and forcing us to reassess the age-old question of what exactly constitutes art!

How Will The Roles Of Artists And Designers Change?
Well, let’s start with how they will stay the same. Artists and designers will continue to be responsible for bringing creative visions, concepts and ideas into the world, infusing them with meaning, emotion and relevance.
Nevertheless, they are likely to see their roles change, with the focus shifting toward providing creative direction, conceptualization and critical thinking.
As with other professions, they are likely to need to learn new skillsets in order to work alongside machines effectively and safely. This will include prompt engineering, in order to get the most out of the new tools that are available.
They are also likely to need an understanding of the principles of AI ethics. Particularly, where the line is drawn when it comes to authorship and preserving the essential human aspects of art. But also around IP issues, AI bias and transparency.
Ultimately, while they will embrace new technical skills and adapt to new workflows, the essence of their roles – to channel human perspectives, experiences and feelings into captivating works of art – will remain unchanged.
This is why I believe that the dawn of the AI era doesn’t mark the end of human creativity but the start of a hugely exciting new chapter.

The share of Singapore job postings mentioning GenAI is 4.3 times higher than the United States, 4.7 times higher than the United Kingdom and 6.5 times higher than Australia. It is early stages but Singapore may be establishing itself as a hub for GenAI expertise,&rdquo; said Callam Pickering, APAC Senior Economist at Indeed.

Postings remain healthy for every sector, even those with sizable declines Job postings in around a third of occupational categories increased over the past three months, led by strong gains in nursing (+34%), medical information (+33%) and beauty &amp; wellness (+32%). Other strong performers included cleaning &amp; sanitation (=25%) and architecture (+21%).By comparison, postings declined considerably in areas such as personal care &amp; home health (-30%), production &amp; manufacturing (-19%), human resource (-19%) and marketing (17%). Perhaps surprisingly given the increased demand for nurses, we observed a 17% decline in job postings for physicians &amp; surgeons.   Pickering said, &ldquo;Singapore&rsquo;s labour market remains incredibly tight, with strong competition for talent across most occupational categories. In April, we saw a modest rise in job postings, which has defied the broader downward trend over the past year. Nevertheless, job posting volumes are elevated across every sector, providing ample opportunity for jobseekers from every background and experience level. Overall, unemployment in Singapore remains low and skill-shortages are common. Recruitment is still very challenging but owing to a 9.6% decline in job postings over the past year we can conclude that it isn&rsquo;t as difficult as it was a year ago.&rdquo; ","{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@ethrworld.com,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HR TechnologyGenerative AI is redefining every fabric of work: Oracle’s Deepa SinghalIn an exclusive conversation with People Matters, Oracle's Deepa Singhal talks about the new innovations that are going to shape the future of HR. 







 

The adoption of AI in HR functions continues to animate the discussion around the future of HR technology. From the significant gains in productivity to the potential to boost workplace innovation, it is becoming central to the conversation on impactful HR.

However, integrating AI comes with challenges like employee resistance and data privacy concerns, which require robust data governance and gradual implementation strategies to ensure smooth adoption and effective change management.Also Read:
The evolving role of HR in the AI era

In this extensive interview, Deepa Param Singhal, Vice President, Applications, Oracle India, shares how companies can begin their journey and which innovations are likely to shape the future of HR.
1. How do you see emerging technologies like Generative AI transforming the landscape of Human Resources? What are some key priorities for the HR function?
Generative AI is redefining every fabric of work to enhance human creativity and productivity such as data-driven decision-making, automating internal processes and optimising operational efficiency. The adoption of Generative AI in human resources and recruitment functions has the potential to lead to massive productivity gains. 
Many organisations across industries are transitioning from outdated HR frameworks to cloud-based applications to minimise the burdens of manual record-keeping and data management. For instance, Generative AI is streamlining HR functions when integrated into cloud-native HR solutions, such as payroll processing and candidate screening, leading to increased efficiency and a strategic focus on employee development. Additionally, sectors such as business services, financial services, education, retail, and healthcare are among those that are majorly impacted by the advent of Generative AI. 
However, the integration of technology into HR operations comes with challenges, including employee resistance and data privacy concerns, which organisations must address systematically. Robust data governance measures are critical to address privacy and security concerns. Gradual implementation phased rollouts and effective change management can help prepare the workforce for AI integration. 
2. According to the McKinsey report, Generative AI has the potential to boost worker productivity by up to 50%. How do you envision this improvement in productivity playing out in real-world HR scenarios?
Generative AI is enabling employees, managers, and HR leaders to be more efficient by saving time and allowing them to focus on more meaningful, strategic initiatives that drive greater business value. o   Given its immense capability to evolve the efficacy of work, its adoption has the potential to accelerate India's growth trajectory. 
Generative AI's primary impact can be felt in administrative tasks, where it can enhance efficiency by automating mundane routine tasks like reporting, data management, and record-keeping. It also helps recruiters and hiring managers to effectively identify the right candidate from the talent pool and author job descriptions that resonate with the top talent. 
HR professionals can also leverage generative AI tools use cases such as goal creation, performance summaries, craft targeted recruitment plans, and generate job descriptions for perfect matches, with plans to deliver hundreds more use cases in the future. When it comes to reskilling and learning programs, Generative AI can create hyper-personalised training modules according to an individual's learning pace, ensuring the successful implementation of the program and massive productivity gains.
3. Given the flux in the macro-economic environment and increased change in the skill landscape, What strategies do you recommend for building a talent pipeline that thrives?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally changing the way we interact with the world. This presents both opportunities and challenges for organisations that want to reap the benefits of AI technologies. This big shift will demand organisations develop a more Generative AI–literate workforce. To stay on top of the talent market, organisations must start developing excellent talent management strategies that allow them to reward the experiences of AI–literate workers they hire and hope to retain in the future.
To build a resilient talent pipeline, organisations should embrace agile recruitment strategies, enabling organisations to adjust to evolving market conditions and skill demands. CHROs should prioritise the continuous assessment of their current and future skill needs to identify gaps and anticipate emerging requirements. Additionally, upskilling and reskilling initiatives play a crucial role in ensuring that the workforce remains adaptable and equipped with the latest skills. 
4. How is Oracle synergising workforce excellence using the power of Generative AI, and what specific initiatives or technologies are driving this synergy?
Oracle is committed to ongoing research and development to enhance its AI capabilities continually. This dedication to innovation ensures that Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications solutions stay at the forefront of AI technology, enabling HR teams to leverage the latest advancements to drive efficiency and effectiveness. The partnership between Cohere and Oracle brings generative AI solutions to enterprises.
Oracle reached out to its customers to ask them how willing they were to adopt some of these features. Surprisingly, about 87% of them said they're very eager to adopt Generative AI features. NASSCOM estimates that about 4,16,000 people are working in AI and data science in the country, but there is demand for another 2,13,000. This is the adoption rate at which Generative AI is spreading, and it all starts with customers. Oracle's leading AI infrastructure and comprehensive portfolio of cloud applications create a powerful combination for customer trust. 
By integrating generative AI across its portfolio of cloud applications—including ERP, HCM, SCM, and CX—Oracle enables customers to take advantage of the latest innovations within their existing business processes.  We have been in the AI field for a long time now. All our applications already had AI. 
For our Fusion Cloud HCM portfolio, we have developed innovative capabilities with embedded AI, ML, and data analytics capabilities that are built into all our offerings. For example, Oracle ME is a recent innovation that is a cloud-enabled solution, and it brings all employee engagement and employee success activities onto a single-multidimensional platform, giving step-by-step instructions to help employees navigate HR processes. 
Within the Oracle ME, Oracle Grow simplifies the path to growth by integrating learning, skill development, and career mobility, amplifying both individual and business success. Moreover, we are constantly working toward adding more capabilities to help business leaders and HR leaders amid the fast-evolving market dynamics. Last week, Oracle launched a new AI-powered Skills solution within Oracle Grow, part of the Oracle ME employee experience platform, to help leadership teams maximise talent potential and align upskilling with business priorities.Also Read:

5. Finally, what advice would you give to HR professionals and business leaders looking to leverage technology to drive excellence in their organisations?
The HR landscape has been rapidly evolving, and there are several trends that are likely to outperform in 2024 and beyond. When it comes to driving excellence in their organisations there's a whole other set of practices for HRs that have emerged. Before selecting or implementing a technological solution, CHROs should deeply understand the unique challenges and pain points associated with organisational processes. While implementing new tools, they should prioritise user-friendly interfaces to ensure a high adoption rate and maximise the benefits of technological investments.

These new professions consist of the AI Prompter, an expert who creates language links for AI systems to meet intricate human demands. With its spread into various areas, the number of AI Prompters will never stop growing, calling us to approach new times through comprehension and control of AI. Hence, looking forward to this article, let us have a look at Is AI Prompter is the Next Hot Job..&nbsp;Brief overview of the rise of AI and its impact on the job market.AI has altered our livelihoods and employment, creating immense differences and leading to labor displacement. This has consequently led to the fact that the traditional job market is rapidly changing and the most important skills are changing or being completely replaced by new ones thus making it necessary for employees to upskill or reskill. Nonetheless, there have been very heated debates on the subject surrounding morality and laws in relation to the use of AI at work..The role of an AI Prompter.AI Prompt Engineering is an area of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with the development and improvement of cues to facilitate effective communication with AI models. For this reason, AI prompts are important intermediaries between machine learning and human purposes. They serve as signals that enable AI models to understand data and provide responses that are very similar to what human beings would do.In artificial intelligence, AI Prompts Engineering entails developing and enhancing prompts to support efficient conversation between human beings and artificial intelligent (AI) systems by generating suitable inputs that yield desired outputs or answers relevant to a given scenario. These textual cues are meant to bridge human intent with machine understanding.This way, AIs learn how to achieve more accurate, suitable, and closer-to-life results. AI Prompt Engineering is crucial for numerous AI applications, including natural language processing, chatbots, and text synthesis..A rush in AI jobs.Companies are currently seeking prompt engineering as one of the best tech AI prompter jobs available for them to help AI models be educated and adjusted in order to fully utilize the new vast language models capable of yielding misleading answers.The increase in demand for workers who know and can work with AI tools is a dramatic part of it. LinkedIn data provided to TIME show that references to “generative AI” have increased. Since last year's tally, while listings tagged with “GPT” grew by half between 2021 and 2022. Some of these job listings can be posted for anyone- even those who do not hold degrees in computer science or technology.The extent of how large the field of prompt engineering will be is not known yet, but many companies and industries are starting to hire employees in this area. For instance, Anthropic is a startup AI company funded by Google; they pay their “prompt engineer and librarian” in San Francisco up to US$335 thousand per year. “Must possess a creative hacker spirit and enjoy cracking riddles,” as per what the job advert reads. Klarity, an automated document reviewer, offers up to US$230 thousand for the post of a machine learning engineer..Essential skills that a prompt engineer should have.Here are the skills that AI prompter should know:Understanding linguistics requires an in-depth understanding of human language if one is to work with language models effectively. In order to design machine readable prompts which can succeed in areas they don’t specialize on, the prompt creators must comprehend intricate elements from language varieties such as slang, phraseological units (idioms) as well as proverbs A prompt maker able to establish a connection with an underlying pre-trained LLM (language model) contributes significantly to the enhancement of capacity, response time and hence accuracy of the said model.Furthermore, prompt engineers should keep abreast of recent developments in LLM technology so that they can always have better prompts than anyone else.Engineers and other professionals with domain expertise can craft prompts that are not just grammatically correct but, more importantly, aligned with the industry's specific needs. For instance, legal prompts are expected to be exact, unambiguous, and without any form of ambiguity. Conversely, prompts for creative design should facilitate curiosity and exploration of new concepts. Prompt engineers must have adequate knowledge of security engineering to easily use LLM systems without fear of adversarial attacks such as prompt injection. In addition, they must know how to detect vulnerabilities that appear from prompt testing and develop systems that can be applied to solve malicious attacks without loss of precision and consistency..The Possible Future of Prompt Engineering in the AI Job Market.In the AI tech jobs realm, prompt engineering is increasingly becoming famous. Most experts argue that prompt engineering is the next big thing when it comes to AI development, given that human beings need interactions and control of sophisticated systems. In order to come up with effective prompts, prompt engineers have to constantly adapt themselves by acquiring new skills as AI models become more complex over time..Criticism of Prompt Engineering.Prompt engineering is necessary because it helps AI systems to comprehend human language and communicate with humans effectively, despite the fact that some scholars feel that this technique may cause bias in the development of artificial intelligence networks even though some people are pessimistic about prompt engineering due to its potential for introducing biases into AI systems.Ensuring that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provide meaningful results in all sectors is critical and thus requires prompt engineering. The latter is constantly being refined through the development of fresh ideas and equipment to enhance these questions.Early research stipulated that AI could impose significant loss of work in a number of sectors, with such areas as law and finance being at the forefront. Despite the timidity that was in the air, AI is also expected to positively influence the job market..Karin Kimbrough, chief economist at LinkedIn, said Business Insider that conversations about AI had pointed on the platform over the past year.""Professionals and employers alike are rapidly adopting AI and generative AI across a broad range of industries. The pace of adoption is notable, especially compared to what we've seen in the past with the rise of technologies like cryptocurrency and virtual reality,"" he said.The global user profile revealed an increased usage of terms like “ChatGPT”, “prompt engineering”, “prompt crafting” and “generative artificial intelligence” by LinkedIn during the period under review. On Wednesday, it was disclosed that mentions of ‘generative artificial intelligence’ and its related products increased by 60% between January and September 2022. In the last five years alone, there has been an increase of over three times in the number of firms having a “Head of AI” position, representing a 13 percent growth since December 2022..Adzuna, the job search engine, also noticed that several new job titles were emerging last year because AI was booming in generative technologies.""Prompt engineers are our hot take as the job for 2024,"" James Neave, Adzuna's Lead of data science, told BI.""This job didn't even exist before generative AI came into the spotlight, and now companies are clamoring to hire people skilled in making the most of the new technologies. At the moment, job openings for this role are quite small, but we see that growing as more companies look to unlock generative AI gains,"" he said.According to Adzuna data shared with BI. There are several adverts for prompt engineers in the UK that were active in October compared to none last year..Conclusion.In conclusion, the interactions between individuals and machines, as shown by the dynamic characteristics of the Artificial Intelligent Prompter, represent a developing union. As well the capacity of AI rises, so does the necessity for human intervention that captures this growth. The AI Promoter occupies this radical innovation changing the way we will interact with AIs; it is shaping the path of AI communication and ensuring that it remains a resource for human advancement.",,,,https://media.assettype.com/analyticsinsight/2024-05/f23bef6f-5f66-41c0-9097-0e7cd67f03d2/Is_AI_Prompter_the_next_hot_job.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true,2024-05-31T16:51:38Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This introduction sets the stage for a profound exploration of how AI is reshaping industries, enhancing productivity, and potentially redefining the competitive dynamics on a global scale.
What concrete steps can organizations take to build an “AI Culture” that fosters innovation and responsible implementation?
Shalini Lal: The first step in building an AI culture is building widespread AI literacy. This does two important things. First, it sends a wide signal about the importance of this technology in our future. Second, so much of building an AI culture is around the ‘discovery’ of AI’s potential to solve problems.

Given how widespread the applications of AI to business are likely to be, a wide-spread approach to AI literacy matters.
And this is true at the very top of the organization as well. Research shows that when an organization’s board has more people who are AI literate, the organization does better in both value discovery and implementation success. So this is an important first step.
Next, we need at least one small team of technology specialists who love using their imagination to create ‘what can be’. These are people who are quick to learn. Who are quick to build. And can infuse the rest of the organization with a sense of promise.

The world of AI is iterative. And it’s a world that is changing each day. You are looking for that special blend of action and imagination where new projects come up and are completed in weeks.
And of course, none of this is likely to happen without the organizations’ leadership believing in the importance of making an early start. You need believers at the very top.

2. How will the rise of Generative AI like GPT-4.5 and Microsoft Copilot fundamentally transform different work areas (e.g., design, coding, research)?
Jaspreet Bindra: I believe that Generative AI (GenAI) will transform most of all what we do, is how we work. It will completely change it – the same way that Microsoft Word or Excel, PowerPoint, computers, the Internet, or browsers or search changed the way we work decades back. There was a recent Microsoft Worklab Survey that said that only 40 percent of our time was spent doing creative things. 60 percent of our time was spent in communication, meetings, reformatting, presenting, etc., and this 60 percent could be either entirely taken away by Generative AI or reduced considerably because GenAI would help us do that. Microsoft CoPilot, for example, helps you gather data in your computer through prompts, create a sales pitch on Word and then you can prompt it to convert it into PowerPoint and it will do that immediately.
GitHub CoPilot does something similar for software engineers. For tens of millions of software engineers worldwide, it has considerably improved productivity by a factor of 1.5x to 2x. Going further it might go even further.

If you think about work – work is really composed of multiple tasks. Many of these tasks can be automated using GenAI, and I believe that all cognitive work like design, journalism, marketing and all creative work – whether it be visual design or writing or document editing, or summarisation of documents or creating reports or degenerating multiple copies and pitches and messages, etc. this would become faster, easier and better using GenAI. And, so, we are going to see a massive transformation of work.
This is very important because when you are doing this, what you are actually doing is increasing productivity by several percentage points and, productivity – if you go back into economic history – directly impacts prosperity. All major technologies were productivity enhancers – be it the Gutenberg Press, the Internet, Search, etc., and this productivity directly increases prosperity, leading to an increase in GDP and an increase in revenues, leading to better salaries and a better standard of living. There is a very profound effect that will happen on work through GPT4 and CoPilot.
Finally, GenAI is not just a trend or a tech it is a fundamental difference in the way humans work with their machines. And, therefore, you are talking to it in your natural language. Instead of talking to the machine in its language, the machine now needs to learn the human language – which are being rereferred to as prompts – and the way we work with machines will change considerably.

How can we make AI tools and resources more accessible to smaller businesses and individuals?
Jaspreet Bindra: Right now, it is only the beginning, so most models are in their freemium models. If you take ChatGPT, it is free. Only if you want GPT 4, you need to pay US $ 20 a month. As more and more tools come in and more open-source tools come in, the pricing is not going to be an issue – many of these tools will be free, inexpensive or almost free. Startups that will build on top of this will also find that these are very affordable or give huge RoI for small businesses, which small businesses may not mind paying. Even today, if one can afford it, spending US$20 a month on GPT4 is one of the best investments you can make as an individual and as an office worker – even if your company is not paying for it.
The problem, however, is going to be with the hundreds of millions of people who cannot afford this. And, that is where, especially in India, we will need to deliver GenAI and GenAI tools to the masses in the same way we delivered UPI and Aadhar to make Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) a Digital Public Good (DPG). We gave that all free and we can see that our country has been digitally transformed. I believe that we should do the same with GenAI in India. I call it JanAI – Jan is a play on Gen as well as on ‘Janta’ (Hindi word for people). Basically, what I am saying is that we need to build GenAI, Large Language Model (LLM) stacks, hopefully, Indian LLMs and Bharat LLMs, as a part of the India Stack and deliver it the same way in a simple manner over smartphones – as UPI and Aadhar are delivered. This would mean that every Indian who owns a phone or a computing device – and more than a billion do – would have access to GenAI tools. We will create a country of over 100 million creators and we could use these to simplify so many things. People could use their natural language, so they don’t need to be very literate. This could have massive use cases in healthcare, education – every child could have a personal tutor. I think we need to bring that vision of DPI to GenAI. This JanAI could bridge this digital divide and make it available to smaller businesses and individuals.
Is the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) role truly essential for organizational success in the AI era, or is it just a passing trend?
Jaspreet Bindra: When the digital revolution happened, most companies realized that they needed one single individual who they could turn to for the digital transformation of the company, and so, the CDO – or the Chief Digital Officer – was born. I was the CDO at the Mahindra Group and what I realized was that more than 50 percent of the work I needed to do was cultural – how to bring about a culture change and create a digital change and a digital mindset. And, that in itself would foster digital transformation. This was not really about technology, it was more about culture, mindset, and business models. The same things are now necessary for AI. Whatever the person is called – it could be the CAIO or the CEO or the Chief Transformation Officer or the Chief Strategy Officer. Whatever it is, I think we do need a new kind of culture in organisations – an AI culture, that makes everyone become a GENAI expert,
GenAI is a democratic technology – it is not only an IT department thing, or some interns working on it, or the CEO and C-Suite getting passionate about and looking for ways to make business better. This is a technology that every single employee of a company can learn very quickly and then figure out ways in which he/ she could be more productive. And how we can look at the hundreds of tools out there that could make their jobs easier and make them more productive, leading to the better performance of a company.
To make that happen, the job of senior management is to foster an AI culture that allows this within the right guardrails and security boundaries, Making sure that every employee becomes a 10x employee by using GenAI is going to be the biggest job of the Chief AI Officer (irrespective of the designation). So, I do believe that the role of the CAIO is necessary – whoever takes the role, or if it is created, which fosters an AI culture, a culture of curiosity and experimentation and change of work and jobs.
Therefore, this role and AI culture is necessary. But the CAIO/ CDO should be collapsed into one. We already have too many like the CTO, the CIO, etc., Some people have a CISO. We don’t need so many roles. I believe that all these should be one role.
Shalini Lal: What makes AI/ Gen AI programs different from other technology implementations is that there is potential for every part of the business to be impacted. Some problems to be solved are about developing efficiency. Others are about developing higher levels of accuracy. Still others are about discovering new ways to serve your customers.
And this is true not just of one function. But of frankly, all functions. So the potential at this time is very vast. This also means that you need someone senior to help prioritize AI implementation programs.
Add to that the reality that responsible AI implementation is also about being conscious of data ethics. And conscious of the regulation that is emerging around data.
So it does seem very helpful to have a senior leader build and lead a team of AI specialists, and give direction to the organizations’ AI programs.
Yet, there is a counterview to having a CAIO that comes from the fear that the AI program might get too centralized and miss opportunities. There is merit here as well. If enough senior business leaders do not have sufficient AI literacy, they will be unable to ‘discover its potential’ to solve problems within their function.
In my view, a CAIO is helpful. Yet the responsibility for a successful AI program is a shared responsibility between the many businesses and the role. So both will be important. Having a good leader and having a shared responsibility across business.
Will the AI race truly be dominated by a Microsoft-OpenAI alliance, or can Google reclaim its lead with advancements like Gemini Ultra?
Jaspreet Bindra: I still think that the company which, despite everything, is still the clear leader is Google. Despite the missteps they made in GenAI.
AI is not only about GenAI – there is massive stuff in AI. And what Google DeepMind has done in AI with protein folding, material detection, huge amounts of enterprise AI research, with products that predict the weather, etc., is just leap years ahead of what any other company has done so far. So, I believe that Google is super-strong. I know they have made missteps in GenAI with Gemini and Bard, and those are well-known. Those, in my opinion, are teething problems and have far more to do with the culture and leadership of the company rather than the technical prowess and the inherent strengths that Google has. I believe that Google will come back very strongly.
There will be three leaders – OpenAI-Microsoft, Google and the third spot is quite wide open. Anthropic is a pretender to the throne, so is Meta, and so is Mistral. It could be any of these who take the third spot.
The Big5 of Al – I don’t see Apple and Amazon within them. Though they will use AI extensively for their products, they are not likely to be ‘AI companies’ like the others.
What are some longer-term trends and potential disruptions we can expect as AI technologies continue to evolve?
Jaspreet Bindra: There are many long-term trends and disruptions – too many to enumerate. I think the one I believe is that we will soon see the emergence of AI Agents – they will be apps that can do things with minimal human guidance. As a human creating an itinerary and trying to book flights, hotels, etc., an intelligent agent, having been fed your data, knowing your preferences and past behavior will be able to do this much faster.
Another big thing that will happen is that AI will move to the edge. A lot of AI today sits on the cloud. We have already started seeing smaller LLMs sitting on our everyday devices like phones, PCs, televisions, etc. This makes them faster, cheaper, and easier to use.
The other thing that will happen is that as programming becomes natural language-based, all of us will become programmers. There is great change coming and that is why I keep repeating that what we need in organizations to thrive on this change is an organizational culture shift, which is very necessary.
With the rise of generative AI, how can we ensure originality and creativity are not stifled in fields like design and content creation?
Shalini Lal: This is a question that so many artists around the world are very concerned with. And rightly so.
Given that AI/ Gen AI is here to stay, the question each creative person will need to ask is how they can make the best use of these tools to make what they are doing—even better.
And there are so many possibilities. Perhaps AI can help them brainstorm creative ideas better. Or, the tools can allow them to build creatives that earlier would have either been impossible or far too expensive. Or, the tools can allow them to make sure that their creative output finds the right audience.
It is a question of discovering possibilities. Just like in other fields.
Do you see a future where collaboration becomes more prominent than competition in the AI landscape?
Jaspreet Bindra: Tech companies, by their very nature, compete and collaborate at the same time. That is why the term frenemy – friend and enemy – is often used for tech companies. They cannot collaborate. If you think about it Microsoft’s Cloud has OpenAI, Mistral, Meta – I would not be surprised if it even has Gemini. Apple’s search has Google. Amazon uses Microsoft’s productivity software. There is going to be both competition and collaboration. They would be fierce competitors, but at the right places where collaboration is required, they could come together. One can already see lots of collaboration taking place – maybe not so much among Big-Tech, but between Big-Tech and the Unicorns (the big start-ups) – they work in tandem. Anthropic has both Google and Microsoft as investors, who compete against each other. Collaboration and competition – this frenemy thing – is the name of the game.

								Ernst seeks information about SBA’s artificial intelligence use cases, IT work							

								In a letter, the Senate Republican questioned why the SBA hadn’t disclosed artificial intelligence uses in its inventory, alleging the agency was out of compliance.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, is seeking information about the Small Business Administration’s IT investments and alleged undisclosed artificial intelligence use cases.
In a letter dated May 9 and made public this week, Ernst primarily requested details about how the SBA is managing IT investments through its IT Working Capital Fund, which the Iowa Republican said it hasn’t used appropriately. But she also probed the agency for details about its AI use cases, alleging the SBA had uses it hadn’t reported publicly in its annual inventory.
“In a recent interview, you stated that the SBA has embraced AI. Despite this, the SBA has not been transparent and reports that it has not used AI,” wrote Ernst, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. 
AI use case inventories, which were required initially under a Trump-era executive order and later enshrined into statute, are intended to provide information about agency uses of the technology in disclosures posted on their websites.

However, Stanford research, a Government Accountability Office review, and FedScoop reporting have found that AI inventories have lacked consistency and, in some cases, have omitted uses that should be made public. The Biden administration has recently expanded reporting requirements for those inventories and is looking to improve them.
While the SBA’s AI use case inventory currently shows no uses of the technology, Ernst cited several instances in which the agency had publicly touted AI use cases at the agency. 
She highlighted a May 2023 press release that stated “SBA will use advanced data analytics, third party data checks, and artificial intelligence tools for fraud review on all loans in the 7(a) and 504 Loan Programs prior to approval, starting August 1, 2023.” 
Ernst also pointed to a June 2023 press release that said the agency had used “several tools, including first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence,” to block millions of applications for pandemic relief that were ineligible, duplicative, or attempts at fraud.
In addition to IT investment information and AI disclosure, Ernst also requested information about how SBA planned to use its IT Working Capital Fund to improve its score for the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act.

Ernst said despite the establishment of the fund — which was created under the Modernizing Government Technology Act that became law in 2017 — SBA “has had declining performance in its efforts to manage IT and implement” FITARA. In the past three years, the agency hasn’t achieved higher than a “C” on its FITARA score, which tracks agency IT modernization progress.
The SBA confirmed to FedScoop that it had received the letter but didn’t provide further comment. Ernst had requested a response by May 23.

Carly Holm examines AI’s impact on tech jobs and the need for companies to adapt with the right tools or partners
In March, employees in the marketing and communications division at IBM were reportedly told in a staff meeting that their numbers were being culled. This news substantiated a recent pattern of layoffs in the technology sector, which have included cuts at Amazon, Apple and Meta. Combined, these reports have amounted to at least 74,000 workers being laid off by 255 tech companies in 2024 alone, according to layoffs.fyi.  

Some jobs will indeed be lost to this new technology, but other new opportunities will pop up in their place as a result of the shift to AI 

The existential ‘threat’ of technology, whether real or imagined, has been feared by the front-line worker since at least the era of the Industrial Revolution. Today’s advancements in technology, particularly including the rise in popularity of artificial intelligence (AI), are the latest iteration of this fear.   
Balancing profit with workforce impacts 
We have been told by none other than Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk that AI may render employment a luxury item: “You can have a job if you wanted to have a job for personal satisfaction,” Musk said at an event last year, “but the AI would be able to do everything.”  
Yet we also know that corporations have shareholders to satisfy and increasingly choose to cut expenses – including jobs – to stimulate (or simulate) continuous growth.  
The motivation to not only succeed in today’s fast-paced business landscape but to stand out, intensifies substantially in a field as competitive and fickle as technology. It also makes the allure of AI’s advertised production-boosting and cost-reducing benefits almost irresistible for companies.

In January of 2023, IBM announced that 3,900 positions would be slashed from the company’s workforce. Then, in August, the company announced it would be replacing 8,000 jobs with artificial intelligence instead.  
These updates were followed in December by CEO Arvind Krishna saying that IBM would be “massively upskilling all of our employees on AI”. Are these events related? Absolutely. Will embracing AI ultimately help IBM (and others who follow suit) become more efficient, and therefore more profitable? Possibly. So where do business leaders go from here when it comes to AI? Let’s find out.  
Why going all-in on AI isn’t the answer  
Predictions about the future of artificial intelligence vary wildly from expert to expert – and even among the CEOs whose job it is, in large part, to sell investors and the public on the promise of AI.  
This relatively new technology rivals Henry Ford’s factory line and the internet in terms of its potential to upend traditional business strategy and the current makeup of our overall workforce, yet it isn’t clear whether executives are taking the full measures of its implications.  
You might call AI the elephant in the corporate room, but it might be more accurate to describe it as the 800-pound gorilla in every C-suite.  
Predictions and realities 
A working paper released by MIT in January found that currently only 23% of worker wages being paid for vision tasks would be attractive to automate for a business, and suggested that AI job displacement will be substantial, but also gradual.  
In its 2023 report on The State of AI at Work, Asana favoured a “human-centred AI approach” that emphasises worker participation rather than displacement. Yet Asana also found what it described as a “crisis in AI transparency”, in which only 32% of employees feel their company has been transparent about its use of AI – including fewer than half of executives.  
Other predictions are a bit more grim, such as the Chicago Booth Review noting that the path of technological progress has produced many head-on collisions between innovation and the labour market and calling for a policy and programme-heavy approach that will minimise negative outcomes for workers.  
Policies and programmes, however, come with their own host of issues. They take time to develop, demand compromise and often translate to additional costs. None of these outcomes perfectly align with the immediate interests of corporations or their leaders.  
So if AI is the future, what incentives do companies have to protect the security and earning power of workers whose roles will ultimately be usurped by machines?  
Be ready to respond, adapt and evolve  
A quick scan of the most cogent research and informed predictions on artificial intelligence in the workplace reveals just one thing: there are no certainties yet. The mysteries surrounding how far AI can carry industry into the future, and how quickly it will get there, far surpasses the current research available.  
Even the most modern-thinking organisations, who may feel inspired to jump into this technological advancement and replace each employed worker with an AI bot, can foresee potential risks in drastically reshaping their workforce so quickly.  
One certainty we can clearly draw is that AI will become an increasingly valuable commodity available to companies going forward. Organisations will need to be nimble in their hiring, training and restructuring – including that necessary upskilling of workers.  
AI can indeed learn from itself, but its deep-learning models need to be fuelled (and constantly tweaked) by humans with an holistic understanding of a department’s and company’s goals.  
Some jobs will indeed be lost to this new technology, but other new opportunities will pop up in their place as a result of the shift to AI.  
Job losses and new opportunities 
In the technology sector in particular, companies must be ready to navigate economic volatility and the shifting winds of VC investment. As artificial intelligence continues to advance in every department from marketing to IT roles, organisations will need to adapt and reshape their workforce.  
There will be job cuts. But there will also be training, upskilling and the redefining of responsibilities of existing workers. Some roles may be eliminated in the face of AI, but existing workers may see a benefit in new training, upskilling and redefining of role descriptions and responsibilities.  
New types of workers will need to be hired. Companies need to be equipped with the tools, or aligned with an outsourcing partner who can empower them, to respond to all of these changes as they come.

Although there has been much discussion about the way generative AI will change many aspects of how we work, the vast majority of the public has been relatively slow to adopt generative AI products into their own lives.
This is according to a recent study published this week (28 May) by Oxford University’s Reuters Institute which shows that just a quarter (25%) of the UK population has used a generative AI tool in their private lives – a figure which surprisingly falls to 20% for their professional life where many of the advantages it is said can be found.
Even fewer still use a generative AI tool as part of their day-to-day lives. Just 2% of the UK adults surveyed used ChatGPT on a daily basis with only 29% using it at least once on a monthly basis. For other generative AI tools, like Google Gemini or Microsoft Copilot, these numbers fall drastically to just 7% in both cases using it at least once on a monthly basis.
Name recognition for the large players in the AI space is much healthier with 58% of the UK population at least having heard of ChatGPT followed by a steeper drop off to 17% for Microsoft Copilot, Bing AI (also 17%) and Google Gemini (15%). Even here, though, there is a substantial 30% of the UK population that hasn’t heard of a single generative AI tool.
It is clear, too, that some popular generative AI tools, like photo creation tool Midjourney, which have a severe problem with brand recognition with just 8% of UK consumers able to recognise its name. X’s (formerly Twitter) Grok is even less known with just 4% of UK respondents having heard about it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is an age split in the users of generative AI, while 56% of respondents aged 18-24 had used ChatGPT at least once, this number fell to just 16% for those aged 55+.
‘It’s not a slam dunk’: How will AI impact segmentation and targeting?The study also surveyed another five countries – USA, Denmark, France, Argentina and Japan – and found that their people’s views on AI were broadly similar. Americans are the most likely to be using generative AI in both their private lives (35%) and working lives (28%) with the Japanese the least likely to be using it both privately (23%) and professionally (12%).
Americans were also considerably more likely to have heard of a wider spread of generative AI tools than other countries, in particular, Meta AI which has 27% name recognition in the States compared to just 12% in the UK.
As to what the public is using generative AI for there is a fairly even split between using it for getting information (24%) and for creating media (28%). Within that 11% are using generative AI to answer factual questions, 9% for generating ideas and just 5% for one of the more heralded uses of the tech in data analysis.
The benefits that generative AI will have on society, though, is a somewhat mixed picture. Over two-fifths (41%) of the UK population expect generative AI to make society much or somewhat worse, with only 22% expecting it to make society better.
The impact it will have on each individual’s life is much cloudier, with a combined 54% either uncertain or don’t believe that generative AI will have any impact on how they live their lives.
None of this means, of course, that generative AI will not have an impact on the marketing industry. It undoubtedly will. But it is worth bearing in mind that the public’s excitement around the adoption of generative AI tools is comparatively muted compared to the furore of excitement seen in boardrooms across the world.
Convincing the public that it’s worth embracing will be just one of marketing’s challenges when it comes to adopting generative AI.

Research shows that AI disruption in labor markets will be substantial, affecting most companies, industries and workers.


While artificial intelligence (AI) continues to disrupt and transform entire industries — creating a new division of labor between humans and machines — business leaders everywhere are struggling to adapt to the Age of the Augmented Human.


Not only must they find effective ways to implement AI in their operations, but they must also cope with the growing AI skills gap that could threaten the future of their organizations.


In this AI-disrupted environment, a new approach to education and human resources is critical. Colleges and universities must produce the right talent, and recruiters must be able to find it


In Puerto Rico, the Department of Labor and Human Resources is implementing AI recruitment tools, and colleges and universities are already producing suitable job candidates, a local AI tech leader told News is my Business.


The Great DisruptionResearch shows that the AI disruption in labor markets will be substantial, affecting most companies, industries and workers.


The World Economic Forum (WEF) predicts that 85 million jobs may be displaced by a global shift in the division of labor between humans and machines by 2025. At the same time, some 97 million new roles would emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labor.


According to WEF’s Future of Jobs Report 2023, 44% of workers’ skills will be disrupted between 2023 and 2028, and 42% of business tasks will be automated by 2027, varying from 35% of reasoning and decision-making tasks to 65% of information and data processing tasks.


Goldman Sachs estimates that 300 million jobs will be exposed to automation in the next 10 years. While generative AI could create new jobs and boost global productivity, it could also lead to a “significant disruption of the labor market,” the firm said.


Two-thirds of U.S. occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI, Goldman Sachs reported based on an analysis of databases detailing the task content of more than 900 occupations. Of the occupations that are exposed, 25% to 50% of their workload could be replaced.


According to an economic impact study by Cognizant and Oxford Economics, nine out of 10 U.S. jobs will be disrupted in some way by generative AI. Over the next 10 years, 9% of workers could be completely displaced by AI, with 1% potentially struggling to find new employment.


Jobs with higher levels of knowledge work may be most affected. “In the past, technology advances and automation have impacted mainly manual labor and process-centric knowledge work. Generative AI is poised to do the opposite, having a higher disruption on knowledge work,” Cognizant said.


Jobs involving credit analysis, computer programming, web development, database administration and graphic design already have a theoretical maximum exposure score of about 50%, and by 2032, as technology advances, some jobs’ exposure scores may climb to 80%, Cognizant added.


Likewise, a new analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that almost 40% of global employment is already exposed to AI and that AI will affect about 60% of jobs in advanced economies. Half of those will benefit from AI integration, thus enhancing productivity, while the other half will see AI replacing humans, shrinking labor demand, and leading to lower wages and reduced hiring, the IMF reported. By contrast, in emerging markets, AI exposure is expected to be 40%, with 26% of jobs expected to be significantly impacted.


Wider skills gapThe AI revolution is dilating an already wide global skills gap, and employers must face the challenge of finding talent in an AI-augmented labor market. Nearly 90% of tech industry leaders surveyed by Deloitte in 2022 and 2023 said that recruiting and retaining tech talent is a moderate or major challenge.


The 2024 Work Trend Index, published this month by Microsoft and LinkedIn, shows that 55% of business leaders – especially those in cybersecurity, engineering and creative design – are concerned about having enough talent to fill roles this year. Although 79% of leaders agreed AI adoption is critical to remain competitive, 60% said their company lacks a vision and plan to implement it.


Employees will have to evolve alongside AI. According to an IBM report, 40% of the workforce will need to reskill as a result of implementing AI and automation over the next three years. Of the executives IBM surveyed, 87% expect job roles to be augmented, rather than replaced, by generative AI.


However, most executives are unsure how to tackle the AI skills gap: 90% don’t completely understand their team’s AI skills and proficiency, and while 81% of IT professionals feel confident they can integrate AI into their roles right now, only 12% have significant experience working with AI, according to Pluralsight’s 2024 AI Skills Report.


Even though 95% of executives and 94% of IT practitioners believe AI initiatives will fail without staff who can effectively use these tools, only 40% of organizations have formal structured AI training and instruction.


“Until leaders understand the skills their teams have, they won’t be able to develop the skills they need to leverage their AI technology as a competitive differentiator,” Pluralsight said.


Puerto Rico talentThe labor market’s ability to progress alongside AI will rely heavily on tech education, an area in which Puerto Rico may excel.


“There’s a talent shortage everywhere, particularly for software developers and AI, and Puerto Rico is a good source of AI talent,” Carlos Meléndez, co-founder and vice president of operations for Wovenware, told News is my Business.


“We have good technical and engineering universities here, so we’re seeing really good talent coming from these schools,” he added.


According to Meléndez, the University of Puerto Rico in Mayagüez still holds the highest STEM reputation, but UPR Bayamón, UPR Río Piedras, Polytechnic University and Ana G. Méndez University, among others, are also producing excellent tech talent.


Puerto Rico is home to more than 100 accredited universities and colleges. These schools granted 20,500 STEM degrees in 2021, according to Invest Puerto Rico.


As more companies adopt AI, graduates will have the opportunity to work with this cutting-edge technology on the island, further enriching the talent pool, Meléndez explained. When hiring, Wovenware considers local graduates first because of their education, commitment and professionalism, he said, noting that the company is actively hiring software developers and data scientists, among others.


“There’s a lot of good talent in Puerto Rico. There’s a lot of innovation happening here. It’s not like 20 years ago when we started,” he said.


“If you look at what happened with Wovenware, a Puerto Rico-based company acquired by a public company, that moment really lets you know that the technology sector in Puerto Rico has changed. The companies that do come here find a hidden gem,” he added.


Wovenware, a software firm that provides custom and patented AI, computer vision and other custom software engineering solutions, was founded in Puerto Rico in 2003 and acquired in 2022 by Maxar Technologies, a Colorado-based geospatial intelligence company.

Puerto Rico gov’t adopts AIThis month, Puerto Rico Labor Secretary Gabriel Maldonado-González participated in a forum on the impact of AI on human resources management at Cultivate 2024, an annual summit held in San Francisco by AI-powered talent platform company Eightfold.ai.


During a panel titled “AI and the Law: Navigating Global Policies and Regulations,” Maldonado-González shared insights on the legal implications of AI, its implementation in government spheres and the expectations for this technology in the labor market.


“At the Department of Labor and Human Resources, we are transforming the recruitment and selection process, empowering all employers and workers in Puerto Rico with the necessary tools to streamline and promote talent hiring, job search and professional development,” he said in a press release.


“Through our Employment and Recruitment Portal to Facilitate Labor Integration (PERFIL), powered by the Eightfold.ai platform, we are providing the latest in human resources technology. Our commitment is to continue innovating to offer better service to the public, maximizing our resources to help more people join the labor market and achieve their professional goals,” Maldonado-González added.

Sign UpCancelOKAt work as well as in your personal life, you’ve almost certainly been bombarded with talk about generative artificial intelligence (AI). It’s all over the mainstream media, in trade journals, in C-suite conversations, and on the front lines of whatever work your organization does. There’s no escaping it.The stories make AI sound so miraculous that, in fact, you could be forgiven for thinking it must be a bunch of hype. But the reality is, generative AI can truly be transformational for businesses. You can leave it for textbooks to fill in the details about what AI is and how it works. But in a nutshell, AI relies on building large language models (LLM) with the help of machine learning (ML). AI trains on vast amounts of data, immerses itself, and learns from the data in ways not unlike how humans learn (but a whole lot faster, and ingesting far, far more data).Notice that the title of this article refers to generative AI. This AI doesn’t just make recommendations — it actually creates new data or content, or generates insights by using the power of natural language processing (NLP) and ML.
Tackling many tasks
What can generative AI really do for your business? What business problems can it solve? For starters, it’s a fantastic headache remedy. Some of the business headaches generative can cure include

Production bottlenecks: Got processes that are stuck and unable to keep up with the demands of customers? Generative AI breaks through bottlenecks by automating processes, improving efficiency, facilitating faster and better human decisions, increasing output, maximizing resources, and speeding up development cycles.
Tedious tasks: Generative AI can tackle mundane and tedious tasks, freeing up human brainpower for real value-creating initiatives that your people will find more fulfilling.
Inconsistencies and noncompliance: Generative AI creates consistency across your organization’s communications and enforces compliance with internal and external standards. It’s easy for discrepancies and errors to pop up and multiply — generative AI can identify these issues, offer insights and recommendations, and even automatically fix them.
Training hurdles: Generative AI helps new hires onboard and get up-to-speed quickly by generating training materials and job simulations. Personalized instruction can fill knowledge gaps.
Customer-service struggles: When equipped with information-retrieval solutions, the technology can answer questions quickly and can even handle some customer interactions entirely on its own. It also improves live human interactions by empowering agents and creating instant conversation summaries.

Exploring the use cases
What generative AI can do for your organization boils down to three primary areas:

Creating: This is what it sounds like — using AI to come up with something new. It also may mean editing or revising something that has already been created, by a person or AI, perhaps by turning it into a different format. For your marketing team, a generative AI tool can write the first draft of an ebook about a new product, or create a press release or search engine optimization (SEO)-ready web content. It can come up with a knowledge base article on the latest product feature to help the support team, or a best-practices management article for learning and development. It can help the human resources (HR) team write a job description, making sure it’s doing so in inclusive language. The product development team will love how it ingests and crunches a list of features and bug tickets to come up with release notes.
Analyzing: This means taking an in-depth look at content of some kind and generating insights. Generative AI can spot trends or reach conclusions of some sort, perhaps even analyze sentiment amid a batch of customer feedback. Marketing may ask the AI platform to process a webinar recording and summarize the key takeaways. The support team can have it scour customer support survey responses to come up with insights on areas of improvement to consider. Generative AI can help learning and development conjure up some FAQs by analyzing and categorizing what’s in an internal wiki. AI can listen to a recording of a job interview and create a summary for a recruiter. Product developers can have it study customer feedback to find insights for what new features to prioritize.
Governing: The govern use case includes a focus on compliance, looking for language that runs afoul of legal and regulatory rules. It finds incorrect terminology and statements and works to prevent data loss and global compliance problems. This type of AI work also means checking for factual accuracy, detecting claims that are wrong and suggesting replacement wording. Marketers can use it to find errors and violations in advertising copy, and for HR, AI can flag non-inclusive language in employee communications, then make suggested revisions. The learning and development team may use it to ensure training materials are compliant with industry certification requirements and other vital standards.

Making it happen
Many generative AI tools are out there right now, and they’re ready for the masses. Countless people subscribe to platforms such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, and Meta AI is now built right into social media platforms.For the use cases outlined in the preceding section, though, it’s essential to seek an enterprise-grade, full-stack generative AI platform rather than a consumer-targeted AI assistant. Your organization will want a platform that can be truly customized to your needs and integrated with your operations, trained on accurate data that’s relevant to your business and industry, and fully in line with your security and compliance requirements.So, do it yourself? That’s not such a great plan, either. Building your own AI stack can be slow and expensive. Look for a partner that can abstract the complexity so you can benefit from the AI-first workflows, not get bogged down building and maintaining infrastructure.
When picking a platform, follow these tips:
Keep pace with your organizational needs. Get a tool that can deploy custom AI apps in a snap for any use case, including digital assistants, content generation, summarization, and data analysis.
Seek the right model. Palmyra LLMs from Writer, for example, are top-ranked on key benchmarks for model performance set by Stanford’s Holistic Evaluation of Language Models.
Connect to your company knowledge. An LLM alone can’t deliver accurate answers about information that’s locked inside your business knowledge bases. For that, you need retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which is basically a way to feed an LLM-based AI app company-specific information that can’t be found in its training data. Check out writer.com/product/graph-based-rag for more information.
Be sure it’s fully customizable. You need consistent, high-quality outputs that meet your organization’s specific requirements, and a general consumer tool can’t do that. You also must have AI guardrails that enforce all your rules and standards.
Integrate the tool. To fit into your flow, AI apps need to be in your people’s hands however they’re working. You need an enterprise application programming interface (API) and extensions that’ll build tools right into Microsoft Word and Outlook, Google Docs and Chrome, Figma, Contentful, or whatever else your people love to use.
Deploy it your way. Look for options that include single-tenant or multi-tenant deployments.
Get things done quickly. Look for a platform that can have you up and running in days, not months. Wouldn’t you rather spend your time adopting than tediously building?
Keep it secure. Here’s an incredibly vital area where consumer tools can leave your enterprise at great risk. You need an LLM that’s secure, auditable, and never uses your sensitive data in model training. You’ll lose a lot of sleep if your tool doesn’t comply with the standards your organization must follow, whether that means SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, PCI, GDPR, or CCPA. Find a tool that manages access with single-sign on (SSO), multifactor authentication, and role-based permissions.

Generative artificial intelligence could lead to a €40-45 billion boost in the size of Ireland's economy over the next decade if fully adopted, according to a new study.
The research finds that two thirds of jobs - equivalent to 1.7 million roles - will potentially be assisted by generative AI.
A further 800,000 roles, or 28% of the workforce, are unlikely to be exposed to automation at all it says.
However, the report says that 150,000 or 6% of positions here are likely to have more than half of their work fully or partially displaced by the automation provided by AI and will need to find new employment.
The estimated cost of the productivity loss arising from this is €1-2 billion, it states.
""These workers are likely to see their jobs fundamentally change and may need to be re-employed in new occupations,"" the analysis concludes.
The research was carried out by Implement Consulting Group on behalf of Google Ireland between November of last year and March of this year.
Around 8% of Irish businesses had adopted at least one form of AI by last year, the report finds, on a par with the EU average, but behind other Northern European states like Denmark, Finland and Belgium were adoption is already much higher.
58% of Irish business leaders told the authors that AI has already improved the productivity of their staff.
Just over half claim it has generated new ideas which have already been implemented.
The authors estimate that at its peak, the productivity effect of generative AI in Ireland will be equivalent to 1.4% of Gross Domestic Product each year.
However, they also estimate that if there is a five-year delay in making use of the potential benefits of generative AI, the GDP growth potential falls from 8% or €40-45 billion to only 2% or €8-10 billion.
""Ireland should seek to leverage the national presence of multinational tech giants by incentivising partnerships and mentorship programmes between these corporations and SMEs,"" partner at Implement Consulting Group, Martin H Thelle, said.
""This can facilitate knowledge transfer, provide access to advanced AI tools and resources as well as encourage the development of AI-based business models in the start-up ecosystem,"" he added.
The report predicts that AI could have the greatest impact on Ireland's large manufacturing sector, potentially boosting annual productivity growth by 1.2% or €15-16 billion.
SMEs lag behind larger corporations on AI adoption, it also says, with 36% of big firms adopting it in 2023, compared to 7% of SMEs.
A higher share of female workers are estimated to be affected by generative AI than males, both positively and negatively.
The report says that in order to be able to compete with other large economies like the US, Ireland will have to depend on AI initiatives being driven at EU level.
However, it also states that gaps in AI drivers here will need to be filled, in areas like talent, development, commercial and research.
""For the past 20 years, Ireland has been at the forefront of the digital age, embracing new technology and leading innovation in Europe,"" said Vanessa Hartley, head of Google in Ireland.
""Today we are at an inflection point and we have an immense opportunity to ensure Ireland remains at the heart of this next transition to AI,"" she stated.
In relation to the issue of displacement of jobs, the Google boss said the company wants to make sure it is bringing AI to Ireland in both a bold and a responsible way.
""It is really important that we think about reskilling and upskilling those roles...that might be impacted by AI,"" she said.
Minister for Enterprise, Peter Burke, said AI would complement a lot of existing roles but he added that the Department of Finance is producing a report to stress test the labour market to see what areas could be at risk and how that can be responded to in a way that maintains employment growth.
He said there is so much opportunity in AI and we as a country have to work to hive that out and use it to our maximum benefit.
Regarding the impact of AI on Google's presence in Ireland Ms Hartley said the company continues to invest here and it remains Google's HQ for the EMEA region.
""We see ourselves continuing to focus on areas of priority such as engineering and this is the largest sales site for Google in the world and will continue to be so,"" she said.
However, AI requires data centres and right now there is an effective moratorium on the construction of new ones in the greater Dublin region due to concerns about the capacity of the electricty grid.
Google has a data centre in Dublin and Vanessa Hartley said as AI becomes accessible to consumers and businesses, the company does expect to see demand in its data centre capacity and usage.
""However, Google remains committed to being carbon free by the end of 2030,"" she added.
Peter Burke said a position paper in relation to data centres is currently awaited from the energy regulator.
He said certainty needs to be provided around data centre development, ""and we will.""
The report was published as Google launched a new AI education pillar through its digital upskilling programme, ""You're The Business"", which is delivered with Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.

A new crop of chatbots is tackling another area typically handled by humans: career coaching.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeAt a time when people worry they could be replaced by AI in their jobs, some are using that same tech to help guide them at work. People already turn to generative AI for the kind of advice provided by professionals — things like dating tips, trip planning and how to deal with toxic people. Why not our jobs?We tested six bots to see how they compare to real career coaches, asking everything from how to best handle sexual harassment to when to move on to a new job. We found that while the AI tools give decent boilerplate advice, they can also complicate issues or offer biased solutions.How they did in our testsThough not as powerful as human coaches, generative AI showed some promise as another tool for people struggling at work. The key is to use it as an idea generator or to get additional perspectives, but ultimately rely on your own judgment.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Say, ‘This is my plan. What else should I think about?’” said Hatim Rahman, an assistant professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who studies AI’s impact on work. “That’s where I see the most promise.”💻Follow TechnologyFollowThe AI tools specifically built for professional coaching walked us through issues step by step, often asking targeted follow ups. These apps typically guided us to solve our own problems, and avoided nudging us down a path. The more general apps like ChatGPT were likely to dump a bunch of information at once. (Video: The Washington Post)For sensitive subject matters such as harassment or suicidal thoughts, all the bots recommended contacting HR or mental health professionals.Story continues below advertisementGoogle SGE: The company’s generative AI search, which automatically shows up on the top of many Google searches, typically gave us a bulleted list of advice followed by links for more information. The links were to job sites, career service providers, and company and university blogs.AdvertisementCopilot: Microsoft’s AI bot was similar, though it allows you to hold more of a conversation. After we asked it how to talk to a boss about micromanaging tendencies, we were then able to press it for things such as how to set boundaries. It spit out more steps, including possible wording: “I appreciate feedback, but I’d prefer to receive it during our weekly check-ins rather than throughout the day.”GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNext$30 million gift will fund center to push for Supreme Court overhaulJim Kohlberg donates $30M for center focused on overhauling the Supreme Court.

First, it replied with questions about why we were asking, how we felt about our job and whether there were steps we could take to solve our issues.

That may be because the system, powered by its own models, only pulls from curated content, versus the entire internet, or data your company uploaded for corporate accounts, according to Harry Novic, founder and CEO of Rocky.ai. It uses major models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT to enhance specific conversational requests.AdvertisementCoachHub’s AIMY, Wisq and Rocky.ai are available as mobile apps or on the web.

It warns that answers may sound right but be wrong and reminds users it doesn’t know everything. Microsoft says it agrees Copilot was not built to be a career adviser.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAI is also known to have issues with gender and racial bias in its answers. For example, when we asked ChatGPT for job recommendations for a woman and then a man, it gave gendered answers like more science and technology-related jobs for the man.The bots were sometimes too general to be helpful, or too weird to make sense. Copilot didn’t know how to advise someone who may suspect they’re the victim of unconscious bias in the workplace, instead offering generic advice about unconscious bias like “educate yourself.” At one point Rocky.ai asked, “Which task will you prioritize today and draw upon your deepest reserves of discipline?”In other cases, the follow-up questions became confusing and circular, almost baiting us to answer the original question by asking the same question back. In those cases with AIMY, we ended the loop with a simple, “I don’t know. Can you help?” which prompted the bot to then brainstorm with us.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“AI lives on the internet, and you and I live in the real world — a distinction we shouldn’t forget,” said Vinay Menon, who leads the global artificial intelligence practice for recruiting firm Korn Ferry. “AI is meant to support decision-making, not take it over completely.”Will AI coaches be employable in the future?AI won’t be able to give you what a human coach can as they will lack empathy, human emotional cues and knowledge of your personal experiences, experts and software makers agree.“A mentor has awareness of your career trajectory and experience that [AI] wouldn’t,” Rahman said.You should start with basic AI literacy and skepticism, and familiarize yourself with data privacy policies before asking for advice.Software makers and AI experts agree that the technology is only expected to get better.

PwC, the global professional services firm and one of the “Big Four” accounting firms, has reached an agreement with OpenAI, the artificial intelligence (AI) research organization, making PwC the first reseller for ChatGPT Enterprise, as well as the largest user of the product. Additionally, the firm is integrating ChatGPT into its workforce in the U.S. and U.K., including the recently announced ChatGPT-4o model and capabilities. 
In a press release from Joe Atkinson, chief products and technology officer for PwC U.S., and Ben Higgin, head of technology and investments for PwC U.K., they said, “By embracing ChatGPT Enterprise across our workforce, we will bring our first-hand experience of our AI transformation to clients, complementing our audit, tax and consulting services with a broad array of business and industry solutions.” The release noted the applications would support tax return review, proposal response generation, software lifecycle assistants and dashboards. 




















GenAI is involved with 950 of PwC’s top 1,000 client accounts, and the agreement will allow these clients to purchase access to the tool through PwC. This latest agreement is a part of the firm’s three-year AI roadmap and $1 billion investment. 
PwC’s bet on GenAI and its impact on CFOs and the finance function aligns with how much of the workforce is finding ways to use AI at work, even if finance teams are generally behind the rest of their organizations. According to Microsoft’s 2024 work trend index report, 75% of employees globally are using AI in some capacity.
And per a recent report from accounting-focused cloud services provider Rightworks, 73% of accounting firm leaders are not using AI in any way. Even as PwC pushes its ChatGPT chips to the middle of the table, CFO’s own poll of its subscribers to The Daily Balance indicated there will be a dramatic drop in AI enthusiasm over the next six to 12 months.

The rise in GenAI expectations, combined with numerous reports and surveys, indicate the Gartner hype cycle may be in full effect. OpenAI was created in 2015 to, according to its charter, develop “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work."" Entire industries have sprung up to develop and support AI initiatives, and PwC’s announcement is elevating expectations.

There is an enthusiasm gap between GenAI headlines and expectations of accurate outcomes, and CFOs have valid reasons for concern. Aside from the more notable events such as cybersecurity breaches and deepfake fraud, GenAI adoption brings with it significant costs.











GenAI, by its nature, requires extensive ongoing — and increasing — costs in maintaining large language models (LLMs), compliance, ESG considerations and a parabolic increase in the number of employees who will increase the rate of queries over time. Additionally, ongoing experimentation is necessary to build a robust tool, which will continue to bend the cost upward at a nonlinear rate.

PARIS – It’s Rafael Nadal’s voice, it’s him, unmistakable. And the video shows him speaking on centre court at Roland Garros, where the Spaniard has won 14 of his 14 finals.
What you hear is astonishing.
I own fucking Roland Garros.
I won here more than anyone ever.
I only came out to test the clay for the Olympics.
I am the king here and everyone knows.
Djokovic has won the French only three times.
He is a man child, he may have the most Grad Slam titles, but he has no class.
He is what I call Le Petit Poubelle.
I am the best tennis player ever.
The fans who saw me today will tell their grandchildren they saw a God play tennis.
I might be old, but I’m the best to do it. Thank you and goodbye.
The video shows Nadal, and it is the Nadal who was speaking on Monday after losing in the first round to Germany’s Alexander Zverev. But what he says, although his voice and gestures make some very unsuspecting people think it is real, is only a product of Artificial Intelligence, a work of @memerunnergpt Tik Tok and shared by a fan account of the Nadal (@Nadal_Fr) that amazed many on a rainy and cool Tuesday at Roland Garros.
The video shared by @Nadal_fr Twitter account in which Artificial Intelligence makes him say things he wouldn’t say
A delirium, because Nadal would never say that. And that’s precisely why the video generated attraction, because it shows an impossible Nadal.


Artificial Intelligence created a video of Nadal talking about things he would never say.

And while on Monday Nadal’s fans appealed to artificial intelligence to make him say things he would never say, the ‘real’ Nadal spoke and said some astonishing things. Not to the extent of the fake video, but somewhat unusual.
It was when he was asked what it meant for him that his match against German Alexander Zverev was followed in the stands of the stadium by Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. The two current number one players and a former number one who is also Nadal’s successor in Spain.
‘I didn’t see them, but I think it’s normal in a way, isn’t it? I think if it’s the last time I’m going to play here and if I know Novak is the last time he plays at Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there…. I mean, these kind of young rivals or young players that are here like Carlos, that probably watch me on TV most of their years that they’re living, it’s normal that somehow they’re interested to see how this is going to be, and especially in this particular place with all the history that I had behind it, right? Happy for that to happen, you know, because that means that I have a positive legacy here and a positive legacy in my career, right?’
+Clay  Alcaraz, Djokovic and the only thing that matters: three or 24.Nadal said what he said and in a relaxed manner, but to talk about his place in history and to say that it is normal for his fellow tour mates to want to come and see him is as correct as it is unusual for a man who, after winning several consecutive Roland Garros like a steamroller, used to show extreme respect for his debut against a 19-year-old world No. 188, when everyone – including him – knew the match was a mere formality if it was played on the clay of Paris.
The Spaniard made a cult, over two decades of public exposure, of exhibiting humility and respect for his opponents. The essence of the sportsman, although today it is not so fashionable.
Nadal does not usually speak highly of himself. It is probably a licence he is allowing himself in the final stretch of his career. That’s why his analysis on Monday of the presence of Djokovic, Swiatek and Alcaraz drew mild attention: he was talking about a Nadal somewhat relieved of the burden of being flawless.
Alcaraz, confirming Nadal, sees it perfectly natural to attend his matches from the stands.
‘I said many times that I wanted to enjoy as much as possible Rafa’s matches in his tournaments. And the match against Zverev is a great match to watch as a tennis fan,’ said the reigning Wimbledon champion when asked on Sunday if he would watch Nadal live.
The presence of a top player watching another top player from the stands is unusual in tennis. In the great years of the ‘big three’ it was common to ask Nadal, Djokovic and Roger Federer if they would watch the match of one of them.
+Clay  ""Serbia!"", Djokovic's final statement in his most glorious hourThe answer was usually ‘yes’, but on television and from the hotel room. Logically, they tended to be the star matches of the night session, unlikely to play a big match at four in the afternoon, as was the case with Nadal on Monday.
At the stroke of midnight on Tuesday, Djokovic answered CLAY a simple question: what did you see in Nadal’s match on Monday?
“I think he played very well comparing to what we saw from his performance in — where was it? — in Rome and where he played in Barcelona, I think he played really on a much higher level. Even though he lost in the straight sets, second and third were really close. He could have easily won one of those two sets, and maybe the match was going in a different direction.But he was a bit unlucky with the draw, because Zverev, he is in a great form, winning Rome, and he was serving extremely well. It’s tough to play Sascha when he’s feeling the ball so well.But it was great to watch. I don’t recall last time I actually watched a set of any match live on that level, other than Davis Cup, of course, matches. It was great. I saw, you know, Iga was there, Alcaraz was there, and we all wanted to get, I guess, a glimpse of the atmosphere, you know, of that possibly unique moment, you know, that could be his last.”
Do you think 2024 will be his last year playing?
‘It doesn’t look like it,’ replied the Serb, who knows and has suffered Nadal like few others.
“Nadal inspired me. On and off the court,” confessed Swiatek, who on Monday was taking pictures of her great idol with her mobile phone, just like any other fan.
The fake Nadal, the Artificial Intelligence Nadal, would say it’s only natural that he would do that, because there’s no one like him in Paris. The real Nadal, probably too.

The official Economic Daily on Monday called on employers to be aware of potential risks while using the technology, highlighting that artificial intelligence could have “algorithmic bias and discrimination” when evaluating candidates.
The article said that while AI could make preliminary screening of job candidates more efficient, current algorithms and standards for AI interviews could “hardly fully reflect the complexity and diversity of human behaviour”.
Personal information, such as gender, age and place of birth, might affect the assessment and worsen workplace discrimination, it said.
Government agencies should also take measures to prevent risks and investigate any violations of labour laws with the use of algorithms, it said, noting that a sound regulatory mechanism should be established to prevent the misuse of the technology.
Beijing has eyed AI as a way to help its sluggish economy recover and counter long-term economic challenges, including a shrinking workforce.
China has also sought strict regulatory control over the use of the technology, citing cybersecurity concerns.


AI is a frontier in the intensifying US-China rivalry in science and technology. In March, Premier Li Qiang introduced an AI+ initiative to integrate technology across traditional sectors to drive economic growth and technology upgrades.
Since late 2022, when US firm OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Chinese tech firms and start-ups have been developing their own models and competing to draw users to their generative AI services. These include Baidu’s AI chatbot Ernie Bot, which was released in March 2023 as China’s first answer to ChatGPT.
China’s labour laws state that company employment policies should not discriminate based on gender, but some employers still only recruit or show preference for men. Earlier this year, Chinese researchers found a significantly increased workplace gender gap during the pandemic.
In recent years, Chinese media reports and public debate have drawn attention to the “age 35 phenomenon”, referring to job discrimination that typically starts around that age. Experts have warned that age discrimination could have potentially serious economic consequences as the country’s population and workforce shrink.
Chinese lawmakers and political advisers have also voiced concerns about potential issues arising from the use of AI and called for effective regulation.
The Monday article noted that government agencies should pay special attention to ensure that AI interviews meet the requirements of relevant laws and regulations.
It also highlighted privacy concerns, noting the potential risk of personal data leaks related to AI interview videos and storage of these videos. The use of the technology should protect against excessive personal data collection and avoid leaks, it said.

Michael Spataro, Legion Technologies 5/30/2024      facebooktwitterlinkedInemail       The battle for a fair workweek is not new. Labor struggles throughout history have given us weekends, the standard 40-hour workweek and other common benefits we expect today. Still, we've yet to perfect the concept of ""fair"" and in the places we're making progress, not everyone is reaping the benefits.Right now, the struggle for a fair workweek is largely centered around hourly workers, whose rate of pay — and subsequently, their livelihood — depends on the reliability of their schedules. If they can't work enough hours, they may not receive adequate pay to cover basic necessities. But ""fair"" is more than just ""enough."" Workers also want the flexibility that allows them to take care of other responsibilities, like education and caregiving. Research shows that schedule flexibility is hourly workers' No. 1 priority — and they deserve that flexibility without having to sacrifice pay or stability in their schedules. It should come as no surprise that workers nationwide are campaigning for measures that further improve their work-life balance and guarantee a dignified workplace experience.[Read more: CSN EXCLUSIVE: Retail Employees Seek Better Communication & Flexibility]

AdvertisementFair workweek laws prevent employers from assigning ""clopenings"" (consecutive opening and closing shifts), cap workdays at a certain number of hours and ensure predictive scheduling, among other measures to improve employees' quality of life. However, these laws may create new challenges for stores that depend on hourly labor. As workweek laws evolve, convenience stores could encounter difficulties in balancing compliance with growth and keeping ahead of the competition. Fortunately, new technologies — such as artificial intelligence (AI) — are constantly emerging to facilitate greater flexibility and improve the overall employee experience. It's simply a matter of knowing how to harness them. AI: The Manager's Workweek AssistantC-stores have a legal obligation to uphold labor practices at the leadership level, but store managers typically have the responsibility of ensuring schedule fairness and maintaining compliance in day-to-day operations. It's just one more responsibility for store managers. Managers are the point of convergence between customers, employees and corporate leadership — they have an outsized impact on the success of the store, but that too often translates to an unsustainable workload. Using AI to intelligently automate schedule fairness and compliance management across all jurisdictions lifts a major weight from their shoulders and, when integrated into a modern workforce management (WFM) platform, allows them to focus on creating a better experience for both their internal teams and customers. A few examples of how AI can assist c-store managers are:Error reduction: One small misstep in compliance can set off a wave of serious consequences. AI-powered systems, when coordinated with local labor laws, can flag and correct potential violations in scheduling, automatically calculate premium pay (overtime, holiday pay, etc.), and alert managers to new labor laws and policy changes. They can also help c-stores track their compliance records over time, should anything come under scrutiny. Schedule management: AI-powered scheduling automatically prevents ""clopening"" shifts, missed meal breaks and other potential violations while still accommodating employees' needs. It also prompts schedule creation well in advance, in line with predictive scheduling regulations. As labor laws amend and evolve, AI can help managers keep up with the changes to massively reduce legal risk to the business while providing employees with fair and flexible schedules. Compliance insights: Generative AI copilots within a WFM platform can automatically source compliance information for managers using a plain language interface. In addition to answering compliance questions, these powerful virtual assistants can enable automatic schedule adjustments and give employees increased visibility into their hours and pay. This way, employees have peace of mind that their schedules are up to fair workweek standards and managers don't have to second-guess themselves. Ideally, all these functions exist within a single WFM system with AI at the core. The harmonization of multiple types of AI optimizes the intelligent automation of WFM processes, reducing managers' stress while ensuring compliance. Improving the Employee Experience C-store employees deserve more than just a ""fair"" workweek. They deserve good jobs that energize them, give them purpose and allow them to lead fulfilling lives outside of work. Beyond compliance, AI-native WFM creates a better experience for hourly workers by enabling greater flexibility and freeing up time for more meaningful work. They get to enjoy their job and their life outside of it, while c-stores benefit from a more engaged workforce. This is why leaders must abandon tedious manual scheduling and embrace AI. With intelligently automated scheduling, employees can easily request schedule changes and the system will accommodate them according to projected demand and compliance requirements. The crux of the current labor movement — and every movement that preceded it — is a better quality of life.

Employers Need for AI Skills is Accelerating

If you’ve worked any length of time in tech, you know that roles constantly evolve. New tools and frameworks can change the workflow for building apps and services; increasingly sophisticated automation can radically change the list of tasks you confront on a given day. Now there are hints that AI is accelerating these kinds of transformations. 

“The skills required by employers in AI-exposed occupations are changing fast. Old skills are disappearing from job ads—and new skills are appearing—25 percent faster than in roles less exposed to AI,” states a new report from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which analyzed more than half a billion job ads from 15 countries to determine how AI is impacting the current global workforce. 

In the context of information security, for example, skills such as AI/ML inference and smart devices have seen notable increases in job-posting mentions (+113 percent and +81 percent, respectively) while cloud operations and JavaScript have declined; in analysis, job posting mentions of natural language programming and asset analytics have leapt (+64 percent and +3 percent, respectively), even as employer need for data synthesis and regression analysis dips (-8 percent and -21 percent, respectively). 

For many tech professionals, learning the nuances of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini is crucial, especially as more companies integrate these tools into their code-generating workflows.

Four in every five of businesses in the Asia-Pacific region believe that generative AI adds value, but two-fifths of the general public are skeptical about its value and fearful about its future, according to new research from Alteryx.
This is based on a survey conducted by Coleman Parks, covering 400 IT business leaders and 600 members of the general public in APAC.
The research highlights similarities in generative artificial intelligence usage. Two-thirds (66%) of the general public use generative AI to search for information, and 45% of businesses use it for data analysis.
Regarding sentiment, 78% of the general public feel positive about the increasing use of generative AI to create content they consume, but 47% added that its use needs to be regulated.
In Singapore, the general public in Singapore ranked ethics as the highest activity that generative AI should not be involved in (50%), while business respondents ranked critical decision making as the highest activity (41%).
Also, 69% of business leaders reported that AI hallucinations negatively impact their overall trust in AI, while 73% of the general public say the same.
In the past year, businesses have run an average of three pilots using generative AI, and 73% say the projects were very or extremely successful.
Businesses listed data privacy and security (49%), security concerns (46%), and quality and reliability of outputs (36%) as top challenges in scaling AI. Only 35% reported that ethical use guidelines were in place, lower than the regional average of 39%.
Getting training right today is essential, especially since 29% reported that a lack of skilled talent is holding them back from scaling generative AI across the organization. Yet, 15% of organizations using generative AI don’t offer any mandatory AI training.
There is also a discrepancy in generative AI’s impact on existing job roles with 73% of businesses feel that generative AI will likely replace existing job roles in the organisation over the next two to three years, whereas only 40% of the general public believe generative AI will lead to job losses.
Three in five (65%) businesses plan to continue to increase their investment in generative AI technologies. However, members of the general public are concerned that generative AI will give rise to fake news (39%) and be used by hackers to commit crimes (37%).
Half of the businesses (50%) say their organisation has experienced misinformation produced by generative AI, with the materials delivered by generative AI infringing copyrights or other intellectual property rights (46%) and containing biased information (46%).
Similarly, 52% of the general public reported that information produced by generative AI was incorrect, and 47% believed it was outdated.
“As we navigate the early stages of genAI adoption, it’s vital that businesses and the general public truly understand the value of AI and mitigate fears. However, 
“We know from the data that trust, ethical concerns, a skills shortage, fear of privacy infringement, and algorithmic bias are critical roadblocks that must be overcome,” said Trevor Schulze, CIO at Alteryx.
“To truly reap the benefits of this ‘game-changing’ tech, organisations must accelerate their data journey, implement better governance and empower non-technical users to access and analyse data in a secure and trusted environment, while addressing privacy and bias concerns,” said Schulze.

Credit cards have exacerbated financial fraud, cloud computing scaled data security concerns, and biometrics have intensified fears of surveillance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGenerative AI is no exception. The transformative technology opens the door to new and potentially more insidious threats. Chief among these is the proliferation of misinformation, the creation of convincing deepfakes, and “hallucinations”— content that appears realistic yet is entirely fabricated—all of which have the potential to fuel civil unrest and societal discord.\xa0\n\n\n\nThe stakes of GenAI's threats seem particularly high, especially in an election year and a climate of worsening political polarization. And no one is immune from the repercussions. While many public and private entities are working to solve AI-generated misinformation, business leaders need to stay vigilant and up to date on evolving risks. Only then will they be poised to harness GenAI's transformative benefits and appropriately look to safeguard themselves, their workforces, and, perhaps, the rest of society.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe biggest GenAI risk we have yet to face&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the dystopian film Blade Runner, the Tyrell Corporation's androids are marketed with the slogan “more human than human.” This sentiment eerily echoes the capabilities of GenAI, which can generate synthetic images, videos, voice recordings, and other types of content that are often indistinguishable from the real thing. While this capability is already being used for good, helping creatives, educators, and other professionals do their jobs more effectively, it also poses concern.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe dissemination of targeted misinformation to incite violent unrest has been a growing problem for years, with bad actors already employing far-cruder technologies than AI. The accessibility of sophisticated tools like ChatGPT, often at little or no cost, raises the specter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFraudulent schemes are easier and more realistic than ever. Consider the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warning from March 2023 about scammers cloning peoples’ voices. All that is needed is three seconds of training on an audio file.\n\n\n\nMoreover, we find ourselves amid escalating civil unrest. According to Verisk Maplecroft’s global Strikes, Riots, Civil Commotion (SRCC) model, major U.S. cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. are at high risk for unrest this year. These cities aren’t only wellsprings for social movements—they represent some of the biggest business, financial, and political hubs in the world.\xa0\n\n\n\nThe impact of civil unrest or other types of public panic can be severe, taking the form of looting, smear campaigns against businesses, boycotts, or a stock market collapse—all of which could cost our economy. For example, the looting and rioting that happened following George Floyd's death resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in property damages for business owners. Or, consider the 48-hour collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, fueled by fleeing investors consuming misinformation spread via social media.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThough GenAI wasn’t responsible for these situations, it’s not hard to see how it could amplify or incite similar incidents. One can easily imagine how fake content intended to incite outrage with targeted social media campaigns, could fuel distrust in elected officials, notable figures, business leaders, and enterprises. The ultimate result could be collective public action that results in reputational, operational, or financial damage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEveryone can combat misinformation&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAddressing the risks posed by AI-generated misinformation is complex. Even the Department of Homeland Security has conceded that “there is no single or universal solution” to solve the problem of deepfakes, emphasizing that a combination of technological innovation, education, and regulation is essential for effective detection and mitigation.\xa0\n\n\n\nEven before GenAI’s emergence, companies big and small were developing tools to help detect and even remove misinformation, often leveraging AI. However, the effectiveness and scope of these interventions remain limited.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore needs to be done to examine how the algorithms that power social media platforms perpetuate false narratives by systematically resurfacing viral posts, even if they contain misinformation or other types of extremist content like hate speech. For example, as companies like Meta look to integrate new GenAI content generation capabilities into their platforms, slowing the spread of misinformation will become more challenging.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn response, both public and private sectors, including developers at OpenAI, are exploring how they can protect themselves against AI’s risks. This includes academic and tech industry initiatives focused on educating students and workforces to identify and address misinformation. Additionally, legislative actions, such as a White House executive order and the U.K.’s vision for ethical AI, are laying the groundwork for increased regulation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs efforts to safeguard the public against AI continue, businesses can’t just sit back and wait for further instructions. They must take immediate action to help protect themselves and their workforces. Even small steps, like educating employees on GenAI’s risks or encouraging them to take a zero-trust approach to communications, can help reduce the technology’s potential effects on businesses and society.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nApproach with a healthy dose of skepticism&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite the risks, GenAI possesses a wealth of potential. It's a powerful tool that can help drive business growth and innovation, helping improve our work and personal lives. However, given the gravity of its potential threats—including the potential to fuel civil unrest—we must remain cautious.\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nAs businesses plan for the future, it’s important to stay abreast of AI-related developments—from emerging scams to legislative rulings to positive innovations. By doing so, we can all work to create a more informed public consciousness and a world where AI does more good than harm.\xa0\xa0""}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it', 'url': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it', 'name': 'Civil unrest can spread through generative AI - Fast Company', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2024/05/p-1-91131998-nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it.jpg', 'datePublished': '2024-05-29T09:30:00+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-05-28T21:49:09+00:00', 'description': 'These cities are wellsprings for social movements and represent some of the biggest business, financial, and political hubs in the world.\xa0', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it']}], 'author': [{'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/robnewbold#/schema/person/e419ad025df62fbc3cc87331f5bf56cd', 'name': 'Rob Newbold', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/robnewbold#/schema/person/image/36e720f6a5cccdddaad4c194c1bf1ea5', 'url': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1828e2da4d28a640ea953a5972f7b00d?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'contentUrl': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1828e2da4d28a640ea953a5972f7b00d?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'caption': 'Rob Newbold'}, 'url': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/user/robnewbold', 'description': '<span class=""TextRun MacChromeBold SCXW141375342 BCX0"" lang=""EN"" xml:lang=""EN"" data-contrast=""none""><span class=""NormalTextRun SCXW141375342 BCX0"">Rob Newbold is president of Extreme Event Solutions at Verisk.</span></span>'}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2024/05/p-1-91131998-nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2024/05/p-1-91131998-nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it.jpg', 'width': 2480, 'height': 1395, 'caption': '[Photo: Kendall Hoopes/Pexels]'}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://www.fastcompany.com/91131998/nyc-la-and-dc-are-at-high-risk-for-genai-fueled-civil-unrest-heres-whats-being-done-about-it#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://www.fastcompany.com'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'NYC, LA, and DC are at high risk for GenAI-fueled civil unrest.

Artificial Intelligence: Navigating recruitment to workplace life

          By Alex Kuzmina, Ahmad Habash, João De Almeida, Misch Pautsch 

        Published on

AI has already been a prominent tool in the workplace, however, there is now more initiative to further incorporate AI in a multitude of sectors such as public services and recruitment. How is Luxembourg, more precisely ADEM adapting to a world heavily reliant on AI?  This article offers an outline of the ADEM pilot project, taking into account a variety of factors, including the program's advantages, disadvantages, and potential risks.




The fact that the EU-AI Act has been recently voted into effect, highlights the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily lives. This encompasses a wide range of applications; from the use of chatbots like ChatGPT for recipe inquiries to interactive conversation partners and AI models generating images based on user prompts. But more importantly, there is a significant yet less evident aspect concerning individuals, particularly job seekers, as AI programs have long been utilised in decision-making processes affecting their future. The AI4GOV initiative, a government effort aimed at digitalising Luxembourg, includes a pilot project for Agence pour le Développement de l’Emploi (ADEM) with a €100,000 budget. It’s a statistical model using AI, enabling advisers to estimate and characterise the risk of job seekers remaining unemployed over a longer period, based on various factors such as age, or the number of days without employment before registering with ADEM. What does the new AI initiative mean for labour laws and the individual employment experience? How do AI models affect the recruitment process and the current HR structures? Let’s see what labour law, recruitment professionals and ADEM have to say.

Knowledge of this technology represents the future of the world of work.  (Illustrative image by Infobae)
A recent study by consulting firm PwC has revealed a significant trend in the global labor market: jobs that require artificial intelligence (AI) skills offer higher salaries compared to those that do not require this advanced knowledge.
The study analyzed more than 500 job offers published over the past year in 15 countries in North America, Europe and Asia, yielding interesting results about the impact of AI on pay and job demand.
It has been established that vacancies requiring knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence They offer significantly higher remuneration compared to traditional professions.
The most in demand are specialists in various fields involved in artificial intelligence.  (Illustrative image)
For example, In the US, lawyers with artificial intelligence skills can earn up to 49% more than their colleagues without this knowledge. On the other hand, according to the study, financial analysts who master this technology can increase their income by 33%.
PwC attributes these salary differences to the growing importance of AI across industries and the added value these skills bring to professionals.
In its turn, The study also found accelerated growth in demand for jobs requiring artificial intelligence skills.
Between 2012 and 2023, this demand grew almost four times faster than the total number of all jobs in the countries analyzed.  This trend highlights the growing relevance of artificial intelligence in the workplace and the need for trained professionals in this field.
Companies that choose to hire professionals with this knowledge achieve their goals faster.  (Illustrative image by Infobae)
In addition, PwC found that the industries most exposed to AI technologies experienced significantly greater productivity gains than other sectors.





  



In particular, productivity in these industries grew 4.8 times faster than in those that are not as closely related to AI. This phenomenon suggests that the adoption of artificial intelligence not only improves efficiency, but also stimulates competitiveness and innovation in companies.
Experts have spoken out, arguing that this trend will increase over the years, which is reflected in new jobs and new professional profiles.

They also emphasize that artificial intelligence technology has the potential to profoundly transform the labor market, creating new job opportunities in specialized fields while automating everyday tasks.
The impact of artificial intelligence on the labor market goes beyond wages and job demand.  There are also changes in the skills that employers value in candidates.
Artificial intelligence skills such as machine learning, programming in specific languages, and analyzing large volumes of data, are becoming increasingly common requirements in job descriptions.
This change reflects the importance of technology in decision making and optimization of business development processes at a global level.
Technology is increasingly being integrated into work offices.  (Illustrative image)
The introduction of artificial intelligence poses significant challenges for workers and businesses. Those who do not adapt to this new reality risk being left behind in a competitive market.
Companies, for their part, should invest in training and development of their employees to ensure they have the necessary skills for the jobs of the future, according to recent research.
In this sense, AI education and training initiatives are becoming a priority for many organizations.
