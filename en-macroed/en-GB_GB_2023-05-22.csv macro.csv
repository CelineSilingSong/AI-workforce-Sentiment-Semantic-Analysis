It seems that out of nowhere artificial intelligence has become the next big thing, as AI is expected to radically change the world, especially the labor market. A recent Goldman Sachs study concluded that AI’s ascendance would disrupt 300 million jobs. However, proponents of automation claim that new and better jobs will be created, and AI will make workers' lives easier.


Keeping abreast of the fast-moving trend is in the best interests of your career and future. One of the best ways to stay ahead of the curve and ensure that you remain relevant is to adapt to the rapid changes by continually educating and upskilling yourself or asking your employer to enroll you in courses that will enable you to take advantage of the new future of work.

Jobs At Risk Due To AI
As tech companies are in cost-cutting mode, AI could displace professionals that were once highly sought after and highly compensated, like software engineers. Tech jobs, including coders, computer programmers and data analysts, may be in jeopardy as technologies, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, can do as good or a better job of coding faster than people.

PROMOTED
AI-powered chatbots are already used to answer customer service questions and make sales calls. As AI technology improves, telemarketing and human customer service jobs will likely be completely automated. Data-entry clerks will not be needed, as AI software can more efficiently extract data and add it to spreadsheets and other documents.

Jobs that entail interpreting large volumes of information and simplifying it for publication or briefings, like journalists and paralegals, will be vulnerable to automation. AI could also replace creatives, like screenwriters, photographers, graphic designers, artists, advertisers and content creators.

In the not-too-distant future, self-driving automobiles and trucks will displace human drivers. In warehouses, fulfillment centers and factories, many people who pack, lift, schlep and load the goods onto the trucks will no longer be needed. It's only a matter of time until the tech dispenses with tradespeople, who will be laid off from their welding, painting and assembly line jobs. This is a significant concern for blue-collar and frontline workers.

According to an academic research study, automation technology has been the primary driver of U.S. income inequality over the past 40 years. The report, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that 50% to 70% of changes in U.S. wages can be attributed to wage declines among blue-collar workers replaced or degraded by automation. Artificial intelligence, robotics and new sophisticated technologies have caused a vast chasm in wealth and income inequality. It looks like this issue will accelerate with the mass adoption of AI.

Jobs Being Created By AI
It’s not all doom and gloom. Many people are excited about the potential for AI and all the opportunities it will open up. There will be a need for AI engineers, data scientists and ethicists.
The new economy will require AI professionals to train AI models on large datasets. These people will need in-depth knowledge of AI and data science.
To ensure that machine learning doesn’t spin out of control, companies will look to employ AI ethicists who are responsible for ensuring that AI is used responsibly and ethically. Attorneys will start specializing in legal matters regarding AI.
The Worst-Case Scenario
There is a reasonable concern that AI can create havoc. Geoffrey Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto and a cofounder of the Google Brain project, is heralded as one of the world’s most respected voices in the development of deep learning, a type of machine learning that has revolutionized AI. In a statement to the New York Times, Hinton announced that he was leaving Google to focus on his research and to speak out about the potential dangers of AI.
In March, Elon Musk and other prominent technologists signed an open letter warning about its potential risks. They called for a pause on AI development and training, as it poses ""profound risks to society and humanity.""
""Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,” reads the open letter. “Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?""
How To Manage AI
Regulatory agencies must get ahead of the trend before it's too late. They will need to write rules, regulations and guidelines for AI's ethical and non-harmful development and usage and ensure it's used safely and responsibly or risk punitive repercussions. There need to be mechanisms to offer education, information and updates about AI, so that the public understands what is happening.
Last Tuesday, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law. U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) questioned Altman about AI's impact on the job market.
""There will be an impact on jobs, we try to be very clear about that,"" Altman said. “And I think it will require partnership between the industry and government, but mostly action by government to figure out how we want to mitigate that.”

 Generative AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) that can produce content such as audio, text, code, video, images, and other data. While previous AI algorithms were used to identify patterns within a training data set and make predictions, generative AI uses machine learning algorithms to create outputs based on a training data set. 


 Generative AI can produce outputs in the same medium in which it is prompted (e.g., text-to-text) or in a different medium from the given prompt (e.g., text-to-image or image-to-video). Popular examples of generative AI include ChatGPT, Gemini, DALL-E, Midjourney, and Perplexity, among others.


 The technology is the most discussed technological change since the smartphone. In 2023, the worldwide market in AI was worth about $196 billion, according to Grand View Research, with the U.S. market alone, according to Bloomberg, expected to grow to $1.3 trillion within the next decade.12


Key Takeaways
Generative AI is a form of machine learning that can produce text, video, images, and other types of content.ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Gemini are generative AI applications that produce text or images based on user-given prompts.Generative AI is used in everything from creative to academic writing and translation; composing, dubbing, and sound editing; infographics, image editing, and architectural rendering; and in industries from automotive to media/entertainment to healthcare and scientific research.Concerns about generative AI include its potential legal, ethical, political, ecological, social, and economic effects.
  How Does Generative AI Work?  
 Generative AI is a type of machine learning that works by training software models to make predictions based on data without the need for explicit programming.3


 Specifically, generative AI models are fed vast quantities of existing content to train the models to produce new content. They learn to identify underlying patterns in the data set based on a probability distribution and, when given a prompt, create similar patterns (or outputs based on these patterns).4




 Part of the umbrella category of machine learning called deep learning, generative AI uses a neural network that allows it to handle more complex patterns than traditional machine learning. Inspired by the human brain, neural networks don't require human supervision or intervention to distinguish differences or patterns in the training data.5


 Generative AI can be run on various models, which use different mechanisms to train the AI and create outputs. These include generative adversarial networks, transformers, and variational autoencoders.6


  Generative AI Interfaces  
 Integrating AI into everyday technology has altered many people's interactions with digital devices. Voice-activated AI assistants, now ubiquitous in smartphones, smart speakers, and other everyday devices, illustrate this shift. Similarly, generative AI is becoming increasingly accessible through various user-friendly software interfaces.


 A fundamental change driving the widespread adoption of generative AI has been the development of intuitive user gateways. Unlike earlier iterations that required technical expertise or data science knowledge, modern generative AI interfaces allow users to interact using natural language. This access has significantly expanded the user base and potential applications of generative AI.


 Here are some of the most popular recent examples of generative AI interfaces.


  ChatGPT  
 Created by OpenAI, ChatGPT is an example of text-to-text generative AI—essentially, an AI-powered chatbot trained to interact with users via natural language dialogue. Users can ask ChatGPT questions, engage in back-and-forth conversation, and prompt it to compose text in different styles or genres, such as poems, essays, stories, or recipes, among others.


 When it was first released in November 2022, ChatGPT quickly brought wide attention to generative AI's uses; within months, ChatGPT was for AI what Google was for search or Kleenex was for tissues, a virtual synonym for its product line.


 Many people use the free version of ChatGPT online. OpenAI also sells the application programming interface (API) for ChatGPT, among other enterprise subscription and embedding options.78


  DALL-E  
 DALL-E is an example of text-to-image generative AI released in January 2021 by OpenAI. It uses a neural network trained on images with accompanying text descriptions. Users can input descriptive text, and DALL-E will generate photo-realistic imagery based on the prompt. It can also create variations on the generated image in different styles and perspectives.9


 DALL-E can also edit images, whether by making changes within an image (known in the software as Inpainting) or extending an image beyond its original proportions or boundaries (called ""outpainting"").109




  Gemini  
 Formerly Bard, Gemini is a text-to-text generative AI interface based on Google’s large language model. Like ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot powered by AI technology that can answer questions or generate text based on user-given prompts.


 Google first billed it as a “complementary experience to Google Search.” By the spring of 2024, Google Snippets was using Gemini to present answers to search queries atop Google's traditional lineup of search results.


50%
The growth in Google's emissions since 2019, primarily because of data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.11
  AI's Effect on the Environment  
 In 2019, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) announced aggressive plans to cut its total greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 from its 2019 baseline. Even as its annual reports speak over dozens of pages about AI's ""potential"" to lower such emissions through vague promises of model efficiency and ""resiliency,"" the takeaway is in its own data.


 By 2024, its emissions had grown almost 50% since 2019, increasing 13% in 2023 alone.11 Even as Google still promises to meet its 2030 timeline, Google's 2024 report noted that the increase in emissions ""was primarily because of increases in data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions"" involved in generative AI. The report said, in a notable understatement given the planetary stakes, that any mitigation or decrease in AI's climate effects ""may be challenging.""


  The History of Generative AI  
 Modern AI really kicked off in the 1950s with Alan Turing’s research on machine thinking and his creation of the eponymous Turing test.125


 The first neural networks (a key piece of technology underlying generative AI) that were capable of being trained were invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt, a psychologist at Cornell University.13


 The journey from these early concepts to the AI powerhouses we see today has been marked by waves of innovation and periods of stagnation. Neural networks gained traction in the 1980s, but it was the introduction of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues that truly revolutionized the field. GANs, which pit two neural networks against each other to produce increasingly realistic data, opened new frontiers in generating images, music, and text.


 The 2010s saw an explosion in deep learning capabilities, fueled by advances in computing power and the availability of massive data sets. The release of GPT-3 in the 2020s was a watershed moment, showcasing AI's potential to produce coherent, contextually relevant content across various domains.


  The 2020s Breakthrough  
 The true economic impact of generative AI began to crystallize in 2022 with the public release of ChatGPT. Its user-friendly interface gave the public access to powerful AI capabilities, reaching an estimated 100 million users within just two months of launch. Such rapid adoption underscored the technology's potential to reshape industries and economies.


 In the mid-2020s, companies across a range of sectors have been integrating generative AI into finance, healthcare, education, creative industries, and more. Giants like Google (with its Gemini model) and Anthropic (with Claude) are pushing forward generative AI's capabilities, developing multimodal AI systems that can process and generate text, images, and code.14


 The economic implications are often predicted to be staggering. A 2024 McKinsey report estimated that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. This potential is driving unprecedented investment in the technology, with companies like JP Morgan Chase committing over $1 billion annually to AI capabilities.15


  Generative AI's Second Wave  
 A June 2024 report from Deloitte on generative AI's ""second wave"" was far more cautious in tone than the consulting industry's largely celebratory publications on AI in 2022 and 2023. Deloitte said two key areas of ""trust"" remain a ""major barrier to large-scale generative AI adoption"": trust in generative AI's output and trust from workers that it won't replace them.


 The report notes that this has ""not prevented organizations from rapidly adopting"" the technology, ""with 60% reporting they are effectively balancing rapid implementation with risk management.""16 While casting about for profitable companies in its surveys, Deloitte noted that's thus not been the case.



A 2024 Deloitte report offered the sobering conclusion that, thus far, most companies' costs for highly skilled labor and sophisticated computing technology for generative AI have run well ahead of any earnings. The consulting firm also said that the most reliable earnings from generative AI have been in cybersecurity to combat AI-powered cyberattacks.1614
  How Is Generative AI Used?  
 Most generative AI systems are based on foundation models, which can perform multiple open-ended tasks. The possibilities of generative AI are wide-ranging for applications, and arguably, many have yet to be discovered, let alone implemented.17


 The ability for generative AI to work across types of media (text-to-image or audio-to-text, for example) has opened up creative and lucrative possibilities. No doubt, as businesses and industries continue to integrate this technology into their research and workflows, many more uses will emerge.


Important
A major concern with generative AI is that algorithms can amplify or replicate existing biases inherent from its training data. Amazon, for example, created (and then abandoned) an AI-powered recruiting tool that was biased against women.18
  Recent Transformative Developments in Generative AI  
 Despite the relative novelty of generative AI, the technology has already seen rapid advances.


 Today's generative AI models can be used for the following tasks:


 TranslationCreative, academic, and business writingCode writingComposing and songwritingDubbingDictation and transcription Speech and voice recognitionIllustrationInfographics3D modelingImage editingArchitectural rendering  


 As time passes and the technology grows more sophisticated, it's expected to become more effective at these tasks and be able to take on new and more complex work.19


 Software development is one field that is expected to see massive shifts thanks to the power of generative AI, with as much as 9.3% of industry revenue being attributed to AI's ability to quickly create code and generate user interfaces.19


 Generative AI will also impact the banking industry, helping overhaul the industry's legacy code systems, personalize retail banking services to customers, and create more accurate risk models for lending and investing.19




  Applications by Industry  
 Examples of applications across different fields include the following:


 Automotive industry: Synthetic data produced by AI can run simulations and train autonomous vehicles. 20Healthcare and scientific research: Scientists can use AI to model protein sequences, discover new molecules, or suggest new drug compounds to test, while doctors and practitioners can use AI to analyze images to aid in diagnoses.21 Media and entertainment: AI can be used to quickly, easily, and more cheaply generate content, or (as a tool) to improve the work of creatives like designers.Climate science and meteorology: AI can simulate natural disasters, forecast the weather, and model different climate scenarios.17Education: AI can be used to supplement classroom learning with one-to-one tutoring via a chatbot or to create course materials, lesson plans, or online learning platforms.22 Government: The U.S. government has publicly released information about its use of generative AI since 2022.23 Its list has included employing AI to analyze weather hazards, process veteran feedback on their experiences with the U.S. Veterans Affairs, and for patent searches.


 Of course, AI can be used in any industry to automate routine tasks such as minute-taking, documentation, coding, or to improve existing workflows alongside or within preexisting software. 


  The Pros and Cons of Generative AI  
 Pros and Cons of Generative AI

Pros

Automation can increase productivity.
Reduces the skill and time barriers for creative roles and content creation.
Could allow for faster and more accurate analysis of complex data.
AI can be used to create synthetic data sets for training other AI systems, speeding AI development.



Cons

AI hallucinations can result in users being provided with inaccurate or completely fictional information.
AI training relies on accurately labeled data. Inaccurately labeled data can cause issues with training AI models.
There is almost no regulatory framework for AI, raising issues such as privacy and ownership of AI output.
Most generative AI systems thus far have been trained on copyrighted content found online.




 Like any major technological development, generative AI opens up a world of potential, which has already been discussed above in detail, but there are also drawbacks to consider. 


 Overall advantages of generative AI include the following:


 Increasing productivity by automating or speeding up tasks19Removing or lowering skills or time barriers for content generation and creative applicationsEnabling analysis or exploration of complex data 15Using it to create synthetic data on which to train and improve other AI systems17


 Disadvantages of generative AI include the following:


 Hallucination: This refers to the tendency for certain AI models to generate nonsense or errors that do not correspond to fact or real-world or common-sense logic.247Reliance on data labeling: Although many generative AI models can be trained in an unsupervised manner using unlabeled data, data quality and veracity remains an issue. Many tech companies, including OpenAI, Facebook, and TikTok, rely on low-paid contract workers who perform data enrichment work such as labeling or generating training data.2526Difficulty with content moderation: Another concern is the ability for AI models to recognize and filter out inappropriate content. As is the case with data labeling, much of this work still relies on human contractors to tag and filter through large amounts of offensive and potentially traumatizing content.26Ethical issues: In addition to labor concerns like the examples above, algorithms have been demonstrated to amplify or replicate existing discrimination and biases inherent in the training data.27Legal and regulatory issues: The U.S. has been slow to offer any legal or regulatory framework for the use of AI. Yet, its development could pose the following problems:


 Copyright issues: Since generative AI models are trained on a vast quantity of data, it can be difficult to verify whether the materials included in the data or the resultant works generated are in violation of copyright laws.28Privacy issues: Generative AI raises concerns around the collection, storage, use, and security of data, both personal and business-related.Autonomy and responsibility: AI technology raises concerns around liability. For example, for autonomous systems like self-driving cars, it is unclear how to determine liability for accidents.27


 Political implications: Generative AI raises issues around false or misleading information and the veracity of media such as photo-realistic imagery or voice recordings. It can also interfere with processes that invite democratic engagement by falsifying a high volume of comments, submissions, or messages.29Energy consumption: AI models have a large ecological impact, as they require a vast quantity of electricity to run. As usage grow, so will the demand on the environment.3031




 Which Industries Can Benefit from Generative AI?
Generative AI can benefit just about any type of field or business by increasing productivity, automating tasks, enabling new forms of creation, facilitating deep analysis of complex data sets, or even creating synthetic data on which future AI models can train.Generative AI is also widely used in many different government applications.


 What Are Some Popular Examples of Generative AI?
Popular generative AI interfaces include ChatGPT, Bard, DALL-E, Midjourney, and DeepMind.


 What Is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is the ability to train computer software to make predictions based on data. Generative AI uses machine learning algorithms.3


 What Is a Neural Network?
A neural network is a type of model, based on the human brain, that processes complex information and makes predictions. This technology allows generative AI to identify patterns in the training data and create new content.32


  The Bottom Line  
 Generative AI is still a relatively new technology with the potential to transform many of the ways we work and live. Traditionally, AI has been the realm of data scientists, engineers, and experts, but the ability to prompt software in plain language and generate new content in seconds has opened up AI to a much broader user base. 


 However, there are wide-ranging concerns and issues to be cautious of its applications. Many implications, ranging from legal, ethical, and political to ecological, social, and economic, have been and will continue to be raised as generative AI continues to be adopted and developed.

But Gus Nisbet, a 30-year-old music producer, is excited about what AI has to offer the workplace.“It's all about co-creation,” says Nisbet, who also works as a creative strategist at sonic branding agency MassiveMusic in London. He is already using generative AI tools including OpenAI’s ChatGPT to streamline administrative tasks and enhance creative projects. “I’ll start up the idea and then use AI to flesh it out and develop it in more varied ways,” he says.Since Nisbet has integrated AI tools into his daily workflow, he’s seen a huge surge in efficiency. Tasks that may usually have taken a half-day to complete, like analysing client feedback on a project, can be handled much faster when run through ChatGPT. “If you are using it in the right way, on the right task, you can crunch about four or five hours of work into about 30 minutes,” he says. He uses that extra time to focus on the tasks that require complex thinking and creativity. While the growing capabilities of AI are certainly making many workers anxious, others are embracing the technology. They are already using the tools to improve on-the-job productivity and efficiency. And emerging data shows that there may be more AI optimism in the workplace than headlines – and our own biases – lead us to believe.Microsoft’s annual Work Trend Index, released in May 2023, shows while 49% of people are worried AI will replace their jobs, far more – 70% – would delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen their workloads.“Employees are more eager for AI to help with this burden of digital debt than they are afraid of job loss,” says Colette Stallbaumer, Microsoft’s general manager for Future of Work. According to the report, 64% of workers struggle to get all their work done each day, often due to the constant influx of emails, meetings and other digital distractions. Once workers start experimenting with AI tools, says Stallbaumer, they realise “these tools are not going to replace my job, they’re actually going to be able to augment what I can do and my capabilities”. Stallbaumer points to her own workflow, in which she uses AI to manage her meetings. “When every meeting becomes a digital artefact you can engage with it in a whole new way,” she says. Stallbaumer will use AI to summarise key points of meetings she’s missed and can even ask it to analyse the meeting in real time, to determine what people agree on and what requires further discussion.Getty ImagesSome workers say AI frees up mental bandwidth to do more creative things and seize on larger ideas (Credit: Getty Images)Not only is she optimistic about the technology, but she also says she doesn’t want to go back to life without it. “People might’ve attended an hour-long meeting to get the two minutes of information they really needed,” says Stallbaumer, “so this is a game changer, because you can actually choose what works for you.”Many AI tools also offer shortcuts to completing repetitive tasks or managing workers’ time. Nisbet, for example, uses AI image generators like Midjourney to “spice up” the decks he presents to clients as well as AI search tools to scan through music databases for relevant lyrics – a job that would otherwise take hours. Daniel Rock, assistant professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, agrees that reducing people’s workloads is a key advantage of AI entering the workplace. “I am very excited about the potential gains for removing a lot of drudgery at work,” he says. “That will help people focus on the stuff where they’re really needed, where human thought can be most helpful.”Ideally, say the experts, as workers reclaim the time previously spent sitting in meetings or dissecting lengthy emails, they will have time for the parts of the job they enjoy – the complex, creative, human parts. And this is worth being optimistic about.“Ironically, by using machines to speed up workflows, it means you can give your work a more human touch,” says Nisbet. “You have much more time to ideate, to think outside the box, rather than just going through the motions of getting it done.”You have much more time to ideate, to think outside the box, rather than just going through the motions of getting it done – Gus NisbetStallbaumer adds that this free time should also allow for more innovation. She points to the Microsoft research, which shows that workers who are currently struggling to get all their work done are also three-and-a-half times more likely to be struggling to innovate and think strategically.It’s still far too early to know what the full impact of AI on the workplace will be, but experts are optimistic – and many workers are increasingly positive on the technology, too. Nisbet already sees these AI tools as collaborators. “People will still want that human connection and spirit embedded within the work,” he says. “And these tools can be used to help facilitate that narrative.”Even for nervous workers, leaning into AI optimism simply might be a good strategy. As Rock says, “Thinking about how you can work with these machines is always a better proposition than how you can fight against them.”How we work",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kennedy, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. “Will it bring increasing unemployment rather than economic security?”Listen to This ArticleListen · 12:42 minThe same question could have been raised before Congress last week in its hearing on artificial intelligence. In effect, it was.Sam Altman, chief executive of the San Francisco start-up OpenAI, testified last Tuesday before members of a Senate subcommittee, urging the government to regulate the fast-growing A.I. industry. Congressional leaders shared their worries about the threats that A.I. could pose, including the spread of misinformation and privacy violations.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOne of their most emphatic concerns was job displacement: Who will assume responsibility to protect workers whose jobs might be transformed, or even eliminated, by generative A.I.?Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, declared that his “biggest nightmare in the long term” is the job loss that A.I. could cause, before saying to Mr. Altman, “Let me ask you what your biggest nightmare is.”“There will be an impact on jobs,” Mr. Altman replied. “And I think it will require partnership between the industry and government, but mostly action by government.”Mr. Altman, like so many other executives unleashing new technologies on the world, has asked the government to assume the bulk of responsibility in supporting workers through the labor market disruptions prompted by A.I. It’s not yet clear how government will rise to that task.Generative A.I. could automate activities equivalent to 300 million full-time jobs globally, according to a recent estimate by Goldman Sachs. Already the chief executive of IBM said he expected A.I. to affect white-collar clerical staffing, eliminating the need for up to 30 percent of certain roles while creating new ones. The White House on Tuesday is hosting workers for a discussion of their experiences with automation and monitoring technologies in the workplace.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHistorically, when automation has led to job loss, the economic impact has tended to be offset by the creation of new jobs. Generative artificial intelligence, according to the Goldman report, could raise America’s labor productivity growth by nearly 1.5 percentage points per year over a decade. It could increase annual global gross domestic product by 7 percent. It could give rise to previously unimagined creative occupations.More In Business4,010 July 19, 2024Running the Packers Is Complicated. A Sense of Humor Helps.

Automation has been a significant driver of income inequality in America, according to a study from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University. By their estimates, 50 to 70 percent of changes in the U.S. wage structure since 1980 were due to loss of income among blue-collar and office workers because of automation.Areas of the country where robots have been adopted most intensively, particularly manufacturing-heavy parts of the Midwest, have also seen the most precipitous declines in employment, according to research from Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T.While makers of A.I. have tended to focus on the technology’s potential for job creation, many workers will experience painful disruption as they try to train for and find new roles that pay well and are fulfilling.“We’ve never been in a period where the scope of automation is so wide potentially,” said Harry Holzer, an economist at Georgetown. “Historically if your job gets automated, you find something new. With A.I. the thing that’s kind of scary is it could simply grow and take over more tasks. It’s a moving target.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWorkers in administrative and clerical support may have particular cause for concern about generative A.I., according to the Goldman research. And many of them are already expressing anxieties.“It’s definitely scary,” said Justin Felt, 41, a customer service worker in Pittsburgh, who has worked for Verizon Fios for nearly 12 years. He feels that employers have not been entirely upfront with their workers about the ways they are incorporating generative A.I. into customer support roles, he said. “It’s definitely taking our work.”These technologies are flooding into workplaces at a rapid clip. BuzzFeed just introduced a chatbot that offers up recipe recommendations, McKinsey is helping clients use A.I. to fix technological bugs and the accounting firm KPMG is using ChatGPT to generate code. So some economists have begun putting forward proposals to protect the workers most likely to be affected.Workers could benefit, for example, from paid leave policies that allow them to take time away from their jobs to develop new skills. Germany already has a similar program, in which workers in most German states can take at least five paid days a year for educational courses, an initiative the labor minister recently said he planned to expand.Another possibility is a displacement tax, levied on employers when a worker’s job is automated but the person is not retrained, which could make businesses more inclined to retrain workers. The government could also offer A.I. companies financial incentives to create products designed to augment what workers do, rather than replace them — for example, A.I. that provides TV writers with research but doesn’t draft scripts, which are likely to be of low quality.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“If the government sets the agenda in developing technologies that are more complementary to humans, that would be very important,” Mr. Acemoglu said. “Industry is looking to the government for leadership.”The government’s previous efforts to support workers through periods of job displacement have had mixed results. A study of Trade Adjustment Assistance, a U.S. government program that provides financial assistance and training for workers who lose jobs because of trade, found that manufacturing employees who temporarily dropped out of the work force to participate in the program in the early 2000s still hadn’t caught up on earnings several years later compared with workers who lost jobs but didn’t qualify for T.A.A. support.Many economists say employers could also play a role in helping displaced workers.“Business always looks to government to deal with job loss,” said Simon Johnson, a professor at M.I.T. and a co-author with Mr. Acemoglu of the book “Power and Progress.” “But Microsoft and Alphabet — they are in the driver’s seat, in regards to where they choose to put their technological resources.”Workers could benefit, for example, from employer apprenticeships and retraining programs. The accounting giant PwC recently announced a $1 billion investment in generative A.I., which includes efforts to train its 65,000 workers on how to use A.I. What spurred the initiative was the chief executive’s trip to the World Economic Forum’s gathering in Davos, Switzerland, where he heard constant discussion of generative A.I.“A number of us walking out of that room knew something had changed,” recalled Joe Atkinson, the company’s chief products and technology officer.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPwC’s workers have expressed fears about displacement, according to Mr. Atkinson, especially as their company explores automating roles with generative A.I. Mr. Atkinson stressed, though, that PwC planned to retrain people with new technical skills so their work would change but their jobs wouldn’t be eliminated.Some tech companies are offering employees courses in cloud computing, cybersecurity and generative A.I. Among them is IBM, which also has an apprenticeship program that trains workers, including those without four-year degrees, for high-paying roles in fields like software development and data science. The company C3 AI offers its 1,000 employees bonuses of $250 to $1,500 for becoming certified in technological subjects including A.I. and cloud computing. KPMG is working to train every one of its employees to use generative A.I.Community colleges are intensifying their focus on A.I., too. Miami Dade College has received over $15 million in grants for its technology programs, with some of the money used to open two centers focused on preparing students for careers in A.I. Houston Community College recently announced a bachelor’s degree in A.I. and robotics, and Southwest Tennessee Community College is working to create an associate degree. The American Association of Community Colleges launched an A.I. incubator network focused on helping faculty teach about A.I. and colleges create A.I. degrees.“As Wayne Gretzky once said when asked about his success, ‘I skate to where the puck is going,’” said Dennis Natali, a professor at Pikes Peak State College in Colorado, which released a plan this year to roll out A.I. certificates. “Our college constantly assesses the work force landscape and prepares to support displaced workers.”As colleges and businesses scramble to retrain workers, some experts are optimistic about this technological transition. They note that throughout history people have feared technological advancement but often ended up benefiting from it, going back to the Luddites, weavers who protested the mechanization of the textile industry.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut that doesn’t mean the transition period will unfold smoothly. Michael Chui, an A.I. expert at McKinsey, pointed out that even the Luddites saw their income stagnate for decades.“Anyone who loses their job involuntarily — it’s a difficult time,” he said. “In some ways the Luddites weren’t wrong about the risk.”Audio produced by Jack D’Isidoro.Emma Goldberg covers the future of work for the Business section.

Artificial Intelligence Is Coming for Creative Workers Too
White collar creatives presumed they were immune from automation. They were wrong.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, and its implications for work, it can be hard to discern “cope” from outright ignorance. One example is the refrain that creativity, and therefore the creative industries, are somehow immune from technological disruption.
This perspective was captured by researchers from innovation charity Nesta in 2015, when they wrote: “creativity is inversely related to computerisability”. If poetry is that which can not be translated, creativity is that which is incapable of automation.
Such an assessment is obviously stupid. Swathes of creative work have already been automated over the last five centuries: manuscripts with beautiful calligraphy gave way to moveable print more than half a millennium ago – a process which has only required less human labour ever since. It was the same with textile and ceramic manufacture after the early 19th century. Rather than creativity being something beyond automation, the very essence of the Industrial Age was deskilling creative artisanal labour.
So why would any intelligent person believe it? Because it is convenient and re-assuring. Automation in blue collar jobs was seen as inevitable, and sometimes uncritically celebrated, because the people writing the headlines and op-eds and commissioning the documentaries weren’t the ones losing out. And while they covered the plight of workers in manufacturing, it was simply more expedient to believe the same could never happen to them. Yet it increasingly seems that the opposite is true. Far from bypassing white collar industries, machine learning is coming for them first.
This is no longer speculation, with the regulation of AI part of a recent list of demands put forward by striking screenwriters in Hollywood. Among their proposals, the Writers Guild of America calls for the “regulated use of artificial intelligence”, adding that AI shouldn’t “write or rewrite literary material”, or be used to generate source material for humans to subsequently work on.
Equally important, given the nature of machine learning, which recursively improves as it is fed more data, is that material worked on by humans should not be used to train AI. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers rejected those proposals. Their counter-offer? To hold “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology”. A powerful industry actor refusing to accept constraints regarding the use of AI is no longer the stuff of science fiction.
That white collar jobs are those most exposed to automation was also put forward in a recent note by Goldman Sachs. It claimed that 18% of all global work could be automated by AI, a figure rising to 25% in the UK and US. But while the most vulnerable positions were in office and administrative work, legal services, architecture and engineering, the least exposed were in construction, installation and maintenance.
But even if machine learning can perform repetitive tasks like accountancy and legal services, or perform roles which synthesise information quickly, can it really intrude on the creative industries? After all, the value of screenwriters resides in that most human of resources, the imagination.
Until recently it was fashionable to answer in the negative. In his 2017 report on the creative industries for the UK government, Peter Bazalgette mentioned the word “automation” three times and “artificial intelligence” just once. Where the paper does reference technological change, it cites that same 2015 study by Nesta – which concluded that 87% of creative jobs have either no or low chance of being automated. Among the safest occupations, according to the study, were “PR and communication activities”, which stood less than a 12% chance of being automated, and computer programming – which was 8%. Fast forward to February this year, and ChatGPT3 (since surpassed by ChatGPT4, released in March) successfully passed the interview for a level 3 engineer at Google. A government report from just six years ago already looks as dated as a game of Snake on a Nokia 3210.
At the heart of all of this – from computer programming to writing shows like Succession and Ozark – is the question of precisely how “creative” creative work is. While an algorithm isn’t going to direct the next Citizen Kane, or author an epic to rival Tolstoy (at least not yet), it seems inevitable that machine learning will replace many of the tasks involved in creating things like games, novels, films and series.
This will start with the replacing of seemingly lower-level tasks – think translating code in programming or writing initial drafts of dialogue for a script – and progress from there. Hence the screenwriters’ demands – which are explicitly aware of how AI will improve over time.
Rather than the rise of the robots wiping out entire professions, machine learning will remove entry level positions in dozens of industries – meaning these jobs still exist, only there will be fewer of them. This is not only an issue regarding employment, but poses deeper questions about how to sustain the conveyor belt of future human talent.
Geoffrey Hinton, who recently resigned from his position at Google so he could “talk about the dangers of AI”, has already criticised the role of competition and commercial incentives when it comes to the technology. “I think Google was very responsible to begin with”, he opined at the Emtech conference earlier this month. But once “OpenAI had built similar things using […] money from Microsoft, and Microsoft decided to put it out there, then Google didn’t have much choice. If you’re going to live in a capitalist system, you can’t stop Google competing with Microsoft.” What is driving the technology isn’t a thoughtful weighing up of rewards and risks, of which there are many, but the economic prize of disrupting multiple trillion dollar industries.
The idea that capitalist competition creates consequences beyond the intentions of capitalists is nothing new. In The Communist Manifesto, Marx wrote how capitalist society had conjured up “such gigantic means of production and of exchange” that it was akin to a sorcerer “no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.” What Marx had in mind when he wrote those lines were the rising ziggurats of the Industrial Revolution, dotting the skylines of Europe’s cities. Yet more than 170 years later they read as even more apt in the unfolding race for AI. If the sorcerers are Google, Microsoft, Apple and Meta, then the key question is this: if any of them create a new form of intelligence can they control the consequences?
But we don’t need to go as far as speculating whether AI would, as Hinton muses, mean humanity is merely “a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence”. The fact that striking screenwriters are arguing against recursive learning in their industry is significant enough. If machines are set to swallow ever more creative work, as well as the repetitive data-crunching that will cost millions of jobs in industries like accounting and legal services, then the conclusion should be obvious: we will need a radically different kind of economic system. Recognising that doesn’t require the emergence of a real life Skynet.

Here's how WIRED will—and won't—use the technology.,Some publications are already using text and image generators. Here's how WIRED will—and won't—use the technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tags,N/A,"How WIRED Will Use Generative AI ToolsSome publications are already using text and image generators. Here’s how WIRED will—and won’t—use the technology.Like pretty much everyone else in the past few months, journalists have been trying out generative AI tools like ChatGPT to see whether they can help us do our jobs better. AI software can’t call sources and wheedle information out of them, but it can produce half-decent transcripts of those calls, and new generative AI tools can condense hundreds of pages of those transcripts into a summary.Writing stories is another matter, though. A few publications have tried—sometimes with disastrous results. It turns out current AI tools are very good at churning out convincing (if formulaic) copy riddled with falsehoods.This is WIRED, so we want to be on the front lines of new technology, but also to be ethical and appropriately circumspect. Here, then, are some ground rules on how we are using the current set of generative AI tools. We recognize that AI will develop and so may modify our perspective over time, and we’ll acknowledge any changes in this post. We welcome feedback at mail@wired.com.Text Generators (e.g. LaMDA, ChatGPT)We do not publish stories with text generated by AI, except when the fact that it’s AI-generated is the whole point of the story. (In such cases we’ll disclose the use and flag any errors.) This applies not just to whole stories but also to snippets—for example, ordering up a few sentences of boilerplate on how Crispr works or what quantum computing is. It also applies to editorial text on other platforms, such as email newsletters. (If we use it for non-editorial purposes like marketing emails, which are already automated, we will disclose that.)This is for obvious reasons: The current AI tools are prone to both errors and bias, and often produce dull, unoriginal writing. In addition, we think someone who writes for a living needs to constantly be thinking about the best way to express complex ideas in their own words. Finally, an AI tool may inadvertently plagiarize someone else’s words. If a writer uses it to create text for publication without a disclosure, we’ll treat that as tantamount to plagiarism.We do not publish text edited by AI either. While using AI to, say, shrink an existing 1,200-word story to 900 words might seem less problematic than writing a story from scratch, we think it still has pitfalls. Aside from the risk that the AI tool will introduce factual errors or changes in meaning, editing is also a matter of judgment about what is most relevant, original, or entertaining about the piece. This judgment depends on understanding both the subject and the readership, neither of which AI can do.We may try using AI to suggest headlines or text for short social media posts. We currently generate lots of suggestions manually, and an editor has to approve the final choices for accuracy. Using an AI tool to speed up idea generation won’t change this process substantively.We may try using AI to generate story ideas. An AI might help the process of brainstorming with a prompt like “Suggest stories about the impact of genetic testing on privacy,” or “Provide a list of cities where predictive policing has been controversial.” This may save some time and we will keep exploring how this can be useful. But some limited testing we’ve done has shown that it can also produce false leads or boring ideas. In any case, the real work, which only humans can do, is in evaluating which ones are worth pursuing. Where possible, for any AI tool we use, we will acknowledge the sources it used to generate information.We may experiment with using AI as a research or analytical tool. The current generation of AI chatbots that Google and Microsoft are adding to their search engines answer questions by extracting information from large amounts of text and summarizing it. A reporter might use these tools just like a regular search engine, or to summarize or trawl through documents or their own interview notes. But they will still have to go back to the original notes, documents, or recordings to check quotes and references. In this sense, using an AI bot is like using Google Search or Wikipedia: It might give you initial pointers, but you must follow the links back to the original sources.In practice, though, AI will make mistakes and miss things that a human would find relevant—perhaps so much so that it doesn’t save any time. Even if these tools do prove useful, we won’t want our reporters to rely on them any more than we’d let them rely on the limited information on Wikipedia. We’ll continue to insist on the same standards of research and original reporting as always. We also know that there are many professionally published research databases out there that come with lawful and highly accurate text- and data-mining tools, so we will constantly evaluate whether those meet our needs.Image Generators (e.g. Dall-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)We may publish AI-generated images or video, but only under certain conditions. Some working artists are now incorporating generative AI into their creative process in much the same way that they use other digital tools. We will commission work from these artists as long as it involves significant creative input by the artist and does not blatantly imitate existing work or infringe copyright. In such cases we will disclose the fact that generative AI was used.We specifically do not use AI-generated images instead of stock photography. Selling images to stock archives is how many working photographers make ends meet. At least until generative AI companies develop a way to compensate the creators their tools rely on, we won’t use their images this way.We or the artists we commission may use AI tools to spark ideas. This is the visual equivalent of brainstorming—type in a prompt and see what comes up. But if an artist uses this technique to come up with concepts, we will still require them to create original images using their normal process, and not merely reproduce what the AI suggested.This policy was updated on May 22, 2023 to allow the use of AI-generated images and video under certain conditions.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersLily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsLily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowMatt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowMatt Kamen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new report reveals that corporate legal department lawyers view generative AI’s potential similarly to their law firm peers, although adoption remains in early phases

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT have a future with corporate attorneys, who believe that such tools can and should be leveraged for legal work — although adoption still isn’t widespread and may be dependent on how legal departments are able to address the tools’ perceived risks.
A recent survey has found that those in corporate law departments are largely optimistic about the potential for generative AI and programs such as ChatGPT in performing both legal and non-legal work.

In total, 82% of respondents say generative AI can be applied to legal work, while 54% believe it should be applied to legal work, roughly the same rate as their law firm counterparts. Similarly, 70% believe these tools should be applied to non-legal work as well.

The survey, conducted in late April by the Thomson Reuters Institute, gathered insight from more than 580 respondent lawyers and legal professionals within corporate law departments in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The survey forms the basis of a new report, ChatGPT and Generative AI within Corporate Law Departments, which takes a deep look at the evolving attitudes towards generative AI and ChatGPT within departments, measuring awareness and adoption of the technology as well as lawyers’ views on its potential risks.
The report — which pairs with an earlier report done by the Thomson Reuters Institute, ChatGPT and Generative AI within Law Firms — also reveals several key findings that show not only how corporate law departments are approaching their ChatGPT and generative AI plans, but how those plans differ from law firms, and what legal departments want out their law firm partners’ generative AI use. These findings include:
Higher awareness and willingness to apply — Corporate law department leaders surveyed generally had high awareness of ChatGPT and generative AI, with 95% of respondents saying they had either heard of or read about ChatGPT or generative AI. That is higher than the awareness among law firm leaders, of whom 91% said they had either heard of or read about ChatGPT or generative AI.
More comfort with using the technologies — Only a small number of corporate law departments (11%) said they are already using or planning to use ChatGPT and generative AI in their legal operations; however, this was again significantly higher compared to use or planned use by law firm respondents (5%). Among those respondents who said they’re already using or planning to use ChatGPT and generative AI in their operations, 19% of both corporate legal and law firm respondents say they are already using these technologies on a wide-scale basis.
Acknowledgement of the risks involved — Three-quarters of corporate law professionals say they have risk concerns surrounding use of ChatGPT and generative AI, mostly in areas of accuracy, privacy, confidentiality, and security. Further, about one-quarter of respondents said they have received warnings from their companies about ChatGPT and generative AI usage for their work, but only 10% reported ChatGPT and generative AI had been banned at their companies. Many of the objections over AI use in legal work acknowledged the importance of human touch and expertise in the legal profession, the uniqueness and complexity of legal issues, the need for supervision and review of AI-generated materials, as well as ethical considerations and the perception by some that the technology may not be fully ready yet for appropriate use in legal.
Even with the potential risks, general counsel and others are actively preparing for a potentially major change in how work is done. “We’re not shutting our eyes to this,” says one senior legal officer at a large corporation. “We’re working on a solution that would work for us.”
And awareness of generative AI’s potential is likely to spur acceptance and usage, even in the usually reticent legal profession. “Before ChatGPT, technological advancement in legal software has been pretty incremental, but now it appears poised to take big steps toward something significant,” says Gunter Eren, General Counsel in Research & Development at the Business Innovation Centre of Konica Minolta in the U.K.

But the integration of Firefly into Photoshop will expand the offering, allowing for the creation of images and templates from scratch and making for quicker edits to photos.Since the launch of image-generating AI, many artists have raised concerns that the AI has been trained on artworks under copyright. Adobe has sought to avoid this issue by training the Firefly AI on 100m images from Adobe’s stock library, as well as images in the public domain where copyright has expired.

The director of digital media and strategy for Adobe Asia-Pacific, Chandra Sinnathamby, said the tool would make it easier for small businesses to do their own graphic design, but they were intended as a co-pilot to speed up the process rather than to replace graphic designers altogether.“The whole idea is: how do we help that creative accelerate, and that content creation at scale, with precision and speed?” he said. “Most campaigns you have to collaborate with various different things. So we how do we accelerate that collaboration process?”AI tools could be used by predators to ‘automate child grooming’, eSafety commissioner warnsRead moreAs AI fakes cause confusion online, Sinnathamby said Adobe has tried to set a standard, with content credentials acting as a marker on images that have been created or edited using AI. Adobe has 1,000 members of its content authenticity initiative and has made the technology available broadly since 2019.“It [is] one of the things that follows this asset no matter where [it goes], and therefore it’s always transparent where the asset the digital asset came from,” Sinnathamby said.Artists who have contributed to stock photos in the AI library are also identified using this tracking technology and paid when their work is used, according to Sinnathamby.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Graphic designAdobeComputingSoftwarenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveNancy Pelosi endorses Kamala Harris: ‘I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory’ – livePilot, 26, dies as her plane crashes after skydiving flight over Niagara FallsYou’ve heard of nepo babies, but what about nepo dogs?

Western technology companies have long struggled with offering their services in languages other than English. A combination of political and technical challenges have impeded companies from building out bespoke, automated systems that function in even a fraction of the world’s 7,000+ languages. With large language models powered by machine learning, online services think they’ve solved the problem. But have they? 
A new report from CDT examines the new models that companies claim can analyze text across languages. The paper explains how these language models work and explores their capabilities and limits.
Large language models are a relatively new and buzzy technology that power all sorts of content generation and analysis tools. You’ve read about them in articles about ChatGPT and other generative AI tools that produce “human”-sounding text. But these models can also be adapted to analyze text. Companies already use large language models to moderate speech on social media, and may soon incorporate these tools into systems in other areas such as hiring and making public benefits decisions.
In the past, it has been difficult to develop AI systems — and especially large language models — in languages other than English because of what is known as the resourcedness gap. This gap describes the asymmetry in the availability of high quality digitized text that can serve as training data for a model. English is an extremely highly resourced language, whereas other languages, including those used predominantly in the Global South, often have fewer examples of high quality text (if any at all) on which to train language models.
Recently, developers have started to contend that they can bridge that gap with a new technology called multilingual language models: large language models trained on text from multiple languages at the same time. Multilingual language models, they claim, infer connections between languages, allowing them to uncover patterns in higher resourced languages and apply them to lower resourced languages. In other words, by training on lots of data from lots of languages, multilingual language models can more easily be adapted to tasks in languages other than English.
Language models in general, and multilingual language models in particular, may allow for the creation of exciting new technologies. An effort to increase access to online services in multiple languages will certainly be a step in the right direction. They may even help to open up different opportunities and access to information for people who speak one of the many languages that are currently rarely supported by online services. 
However, while multilingual language models show promise as a tool for content analysis, they also face key limitations:
Multilingual language models often rely on machine-translated text that can contain errors or terms native language speakers don’t actually use. When multilingual language models fail, their problems are hard to identify, diagnose, and fix.Multilingual language models do not and cannot work equally well in all languages.Multilingual language models fail to account for the contexts of local language speakers.
These shortcomings are amplified when used in high risk contexts. If these models are used to scan applications for asylum for example, errant systems may limit a users’ ability to access safety. In content moderation, misinterpretations of text can result in takedowns of posts which may erect barriers to information, particularly where not a lot of information in a particular language is available.
To adequately assess if these models are up to the task, we need to know more. Governments, technology companies, researchers, and civil society should not assume these models work better than they do, and should invest in greater transparency and accountability efforts in order to better understand the impact of these models on individuals’ rights and access to information and economic opportunities. Crucially, researchers from different language communities should be supported and be at the forefront of the effort to develop models and methods that build capacity for tools in different languages.
This new report is the third in a series published by CDT on the capabilities and limits of automated content analysis technology; the first focused on English-language social media content analysis technology and the second on multimedia content analysis tools.

Generative AI companies will change the future of work.getty

Given the current economic climate, businesses are acutely interested in reducing costs, increasing efficiencies and exploring new growth opportunities. Technological innovations to optimize existing processes could dramatically increase a company’s bottom line. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 marked a turning point in how Generative AI can be used in the workplace - setting off a wave of change in how we work.

Generative AI is powered by models (e.g. algorithms and architectures) trained on a trove of data that is gathered through public domains. With this data, these Generative AI models are able to learn patterns, structures, and relationships, enabling them to generate new content and ideas based on their acquired knowledge. Although the underlying infrastructure behind Generative AI models have been around for many years, through an easy-to-use user interface, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has enabled more knowledge workers to gain access to this technology. Under the hood of any Large Language Model, which is what powers ChatGPT, transformers use self-attention to predict the next word in the sentence. This allows the model to come up with answers that are coherent to the average person.

Given how easy it is to use Generative AI models and the fact that the compute costs have decreased drastically over the last few months, more and more startups are leveraging them to create Generative AI applications for office workers. From summarizing video calls to automatically creating marketing copies, here are five companies that are able to improve our day-to-day workflows.

Guru AI
Guru is unique on this list in that it uses cutting edge vision models instead of Large Language Models to allow developers to quickly create interactive video AI products. Guru has an out-of-the-box model that makes it simple to analyze user motion in videos. Not only is it able to recognize the specific movements of people, and objects, it is able to understand what actions they are taking. For example, swinging a golf club or walking up a flight of stairs. It also gives developers the capability to conduct time series analysis - counting the number of reps an action is taking place or trimming a video to identify specific segments of motion. With Guru, professionals no longer have to just describe how to do a movement, but can show the specific visual markers on the video - allowing the recipients to truly understand and mimic said movement.
So how can businesses use Guru? A physiotherapist could create an app that performs custom physical therapy assessments virtually, correcting patients on how best to do certain exercises. A basketball team could use it to compare and contrast how different players are shooting 3-pointers - pinpointing exactly what players are doing down to each specific movement.

Loopin
Loopin records and summarizes video calls, allowing teams to focus on what matters instead of taking notes during these meetings. After the meeting ends, it automatically sends a meeting summary to each participant on what was discussed and lays out the action items as next steps as well. What differentiates Loopin from other similar tools is that it’s able to connect the dots between meetings – allowing teams to review notes from related meetings without going through other applications.
Refact
If you’re a software engineer, refact would definitely speed up the software development cycle. Not only does it suggest code as you’re writing, but it also identifies code that can be optimized – making it easier to understand. Refact also has the ability to analyze your code and provide documentation on what the lines of code are supposed to do. There is also an AI Chatbot that you’re able to converse with about the code in question – allowing anyone to get a better understanding of the syntax of the code given a specific context. This is especially helpful for junior engineers or students who are just learning how to code.Alicent can scan through any piece of content and provide a tailored summary of that page with the ... [+] voice of the AI assistant.getty
Alicent
Alicent is a Chrome Extension that is able to take on different roles as powerful AI assistants. It is able to generate highly specific texts for different use cases such as writing social media posts or landing page copies. Alicent stands out in that it can scan through any piece of content and provides a tailored summary of that page with the voice of the AI assistant. Marketers for a retail brand can instantaneously come up with email copies just by scanning their own product pages – coming up with tailored descriptions for each product in their inventory.

Fabric
Fabric is a unified collaborative workspace, the command center of all your files - solving digital clutter and chaos. It uses semantic search to look through all your files and enables you to find what you need even if you don’t recall exactly where it is. You’re able to instantaneously save content from a website, make a note of it and share with your coworkers as well.
So what’s next?
The five startups mentioned above are just a few of the many companies that employ Generative AI to enable employees to be more productive - automating work that would have taken a lot more time or resources to accomplish before. As the technology matures, I envision a future where each one of us will have numerous AI helpers in many facets of our professional lives. This will reduce the amount of time spent on the mundane and routine work we have to do, while empowering us to do work that we truly enjoy and is truly value-add.Lawrence Wang '19Lawrence Wang '19

What a difference six months makes. Until late last year, few people outside of cutting-edge artificial intelligence had even heard of Large Language Models or generative AI.

Now, of course, it’s a different world. When OpenAI revealed ChatGPT in late 2022, it created an explosion of global interest and excitement on a scale we’ve rarely seen before.


Since then, companies like Google
GOOG
+2.4%, Microsoft
MSFT
+1.4%, and Meta have created their own large language models.

It seems everyone, everywhere — from school students to seniors to C-suite executives — is talking about how it’s going to change everything.

They’re not wrong. Generative AI represents a step change in capability because it’s both incredibly powerful and incredibly flexible. And it’s that adaptability which means it’s going to reinvent the way companies run their businesses, serve their customers, and get work done.

Retail is right at the center 
For retailers, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity.

It’s not hard to see why the industry is so excited. Let’s consider just a few of the ways retail will be impacted.
New ways to engage with customers


1/1





Skip Ad
 
Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE
We’ve all seen how effective ChatGPT can be at conversing, answering questions, and summarizing information in a natural, engaging, and relevant way. It’s easy to see how this could be extended to retail customer support — responding to queries, explaining products, offering product recommendations, and more.
Just think, every role in every retailer has the potential to be reinvented, with people working with “AI co-pilots” becomes the norm. We can also expect a large number of new tasks for people to perform, such as ensuring the accurate and responsible use of AI systems. It’s why organizations that invest in training people to work alongside generative AI will have a significant advantage.
Leading brands are already pushing ahead with this kind of AI-backed digital experience. Macy’s, for example, uses AI-powered shopping assistants to improve customer experiences by allowing shoppers to have their questions about product availability and location automatically answered.
What about personalization? Brands like Starbucks and others have been using AI algorithms to suggest personalized product recommendations for several years now. But generative AI’s ability to crunch vast amounts of data and provide insights in real time will take this to a whole new level.
That’s all the more important given how difficult retailers have traditionally found it to bring together all the disparate insights they have on their customers in a coherent way. Generative AI will be the key that unlocks that vision — long talked about but as yet unrealized — of providing hyper-relevant retail suggestions to each customer in each moment.
New ways to run the business
One of the things generative AI excels at is summarizing insights from a wide variety of unstructured data sources. This makes it ideally suited to tasks like demand forecasting and inventory management.
Using sources like historical sales data, market trends, weather conditions, and social media sentiment, retailers will be able to get a much more accurate picture of upcoming demand, enabling them to minimize stockouts, reduce excess inventory, and improve operational efficiency.
There’s also great promise in areas like product design. By fine-tuning generative AI on existing designs and other data sources, retailers will be able to generate brand-relevant and on-trend designs instantly. The technology even opens up the prospect of customers customizing their own products for their own needs on demand.
Stores, too, will be transformed
In recent years, retailers have been focused on blending physical and digital experiences in their stores. This is another area that generative AI promises to radically enhance.
Take merchandising. By analyzing product attributes, historical sales and customer preferences, generative AI will be able to suggest optimized store layouts and product placements, as well as provide enhanced personalized wayfinding experiences to shoppers.
Imagine, for example, a generative AI-based app that guided you around your local store, proactively recommending products relevant to your unique preferences and needs in each moment — whether that’s a sandwich that fits your current dietary regimen or the latest assortment from your favorite fashion brand.
And what about virtual try-ons? With generative AI able to produce extraordinarily lifelike images on demand, apparel and beauty retailers will be able to provide “magic mirror” experiences that show how different products, styles and colors would fit a customer — and even predicting how that fit would change over time.
Infinite possibilities
We’re only at the start of the generative AI revolution. And we’ve only had a taste of the true impact on retail. But the technology is advancing incredibly fast. It’s why it’s critically important to ensure AI is used responsibly. That means setting guardrails for acquiring, refining, and deploying data. It also means thinking through cybersecurity operations. Managing regulatory and privacy risks is a good start, and retailers can take it a step further by making certain the technology they’re using is responsible by design.
There’s little doubt that, soon, strong generative AI capabilities will be a baseline requirement for any retailer that wants to keep pace with its peers.
It’s why I think retail leaders should lean in strongly on this exciting new technology — and start exploring how it can transform the way they run their businesses and serve their customers. It’s an overused phrase but this time ‘test and learn’ can be a true strategy for how to lean-in and keep-up with the latest AI trends.

But what does that mean for professional workers?These amazing technological feats have business leaders asking how AI will transform their industries. And, similar to the excitement we saw in 2011 following the game show stunt—nearly every major news outlet covered it at the time—the answers are filled with a mix of hype and real, practical insight. Perhaps nowhere is that fever pitch hotter than in the legal field, where conjecture around the potential for generative AI in everything from legal research to contract development has been building for years. Now, we’re at the point where a judge in Colombia has used AI to inform a ruling in a court case. In fact, according to new research from Thomson Reuters, 82 percent of legal professionals believe generative AI solutions can be applied to legal work and 59 percent say it should be applied to legal work. Big data technology and data science illustration.

Tackling Case Law
Just as the trivia supercomputer’s turn in the spotlight did not immediately translate to commercial success, there are some critical hurdles that need to be overcome before today’s generative AI solutions graduate from passing the bar exam to adding value in a real-world, professional legal setting.

  Generative AI — in the form of large language model (LLM) applications like ChatGPT, image generators such as Stable Diffusion and Adobe Firefly, and game rendering techniques like NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation — is rapidly ushering in a new era of computing for productivity, content creation, gaming and more.
At the Microsoft Build developer conference, NVIDIA and Microsoft today showcased a suite of advancements in Windows 11 PCs and workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs to meet the demands of generative AI.
More than 400 Windows apps and games already employ AI technology, accelerated by dedicated processors on RTX GPUs called Tensor Cores. Today’s announcements, which include tools to develop AI on Windows PCs, frameworks to optimize and deploy AI, and driver performance and efficiency improvements, will empower developers to build the next generation of Windows apps with generative AI at their core.
“AI will be the single largest driver of innovation for Windows customers in the coming years,” said Pavan Davuluri, corporate vice president of Windows silicon and system integration at Microsoft. “By working in concert with NVIDIA on hardware and software optimizations, we’re equipping developers with a transformative, high-performance, easy-to-deploy experience.”
Develop Models With Windows Subsystem for Linux
AI development has traditionally taken place on Linux, requiring developers to either dual-boot their systems or use multiple PCs to work in their AI development OS while still accessing the breadth and depth of the Windows ecosystem.
Over the past few years, Microsoft has been building a powerful capability to run Linux directly within the Windows OS, called Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). NVIDIA has been working closely with Microsoft to deliver GPU acceleration and support for the entire NVIDIA AI software stack inside WSL. Now developers can use Windows PC for all their local AI development needs with support for GPU-accelerated deep learning frameworks on WSL.
With NVIDIA RTX GPUs delivering up to 48GB of RAM in desktop workstations, developers can now work with models on Windows that were previously only available on servers. The large memory also improves the performance and quality for local fine-tuning of AI models, enabling designers to customize them to their own style or content. And because the same NVIDIA AI software stack runs on NVIDIA data center GPUs, it’s easy for developers to push their models to Microsoft Azure Cloud for large training runs.
Rapidly Optimize and Deploy Models
With trained models in hand, developers need to optimize and deploy AI for target devices.
Microsoft released the Microsoft Olive toolchain for optimization and conversion of PyTorch models to ONNX, enabling developers to automatically tap into GPU hardware acceleration such as RTX Tensor Cores. Developers can optimize models via Olive and ONNX, and deploy Tensor Core-accelerated models to PC or cloud. Microsoft continues to invest in making PyTorch and related tools and frameworks work seamlessly with WSL to provide the best AI model development experience.
Improved AI Performance, Power Efficiency
Once deployed, generative AI models demand incredible inference performance. RTX Tensor Cores deliver up to 1,400 Tensor TFLOPS for AI inferencing. Over the last year, NVIDIA has worked to improve DirectML performance to take full advantage of RTX hardware.
On May 24, we’ll release our latest optimizations in Release 532.03 drivers that combine with Olive-optimized models to deliver big boosts in AI performance. Using an Olive-optimized version of the Stable Diffusion text-to-image generator with the popular Automatic1111 distribution, performance is improved over 2x with the new driver.
Stable Diffusion performance tested on GeForce RTX 4090 using Automatic1111 and Text-to-Image function.
With AI coming to nearly every Windows application, efficiently delivering inference performance is critical — especially for laptops. Coming soon, NVIDIA will introduce new Max-Q low-power inferencing for AI-only workloads on RTX GPUs. It optimizes Tensor Core performance while keeping power consumption of the GPU as low as possible, extending battery life and maintaining a cool, quiet system.  The GPU can then dynamically scale up for maximum AI performance when the workload demands it.
Join the PC AI Revolution Now
Top software developers — like Adobe, DxO, ON1 and Topaz — have already incorporated NVIDIA AI technology with more than 400 Windows applications and games optimized for RTX Tensor Cores.
“AI, machine learning and deep learning power all Adobe applications and drive the future of creativity. Working with NVIDIA we continuously optimize AI model performance to deliver the best possible experience for our Windows users on RTX GPUs.” — Ely Greenfield, CTO of digital media at Adobe
“NVIDIA is helping to optimize our WinML model performance on RTX GPUs, which is accelerating the AI in DxO DeepPRIME, as well as providing better denoising and demosaicing, faster.” — Renaud Capolunghi, senior vice president of engineering at DxO
“Working with NVIDIA and Microsoft to accelerate our AI models running in Windows on RTX GPUs is providing a huge benefit to our audience. We’re already seeing 1.5x performance gains in our suite of AI-powered photography editing software.” — Dan Harlacher, vice president of products at ON1
“Our extensive work with NVIDIA has led to improvements across our suite of photo- and video-editing applications. With RTX GPUs, AI performance has improved drastically, enhancing the experience for users on Windows PCs.” — Suraj Raghuraman, head of AI engine development at Topaz Labs
NVIDIA and Microsoft are making several resources available for developers to test drive top generative AI models on Windows PCs. An Olive-optimized version of the Dolly 2.0 large language model is available on Hugging Face. And a PC-optimized version of NVIDIA NeMo large language model for conversational AI is coming soon to Hugging Face.
Developers can also learn how to optimize their applications end-to-end to take full advantage of GPU-acceleration via the NVIDIA AI for accelerating applications developer site.
The complementary technologies behind Microsoft’s Windows platform and NVIDIA’s dynamic AI hardware and software stack will help developers quickly and easily develop and deploy generative AI on Windows 11.
Microsoft Build runs through Thursday, May 25. Tune into to learn more on shaping the future of work with AI.

Much of this speculation is fueled by the ability of these large language models(LLMs) to write code.As someone who has been in the data analysis field for the majority of my professional career, understanding the impact of generative AI in our field is something that has definitely piqued my interest. Giving in to curiosity, I have since spent a fair amount of time assessing the current capabilities of generative AI within the context of data analysis.In this article, I summarize and share my findings with you as I believe generative AI will have a significant role in data analysis work going forward. Furthermore, I believe that it is imperative for the data analyst community to understand the profound impact it will have on not only their field but the business landscape as a whole.Where We Stand TodayAt this point, we know that generative AI can write SQL, Python, and R code. We can also assume the efficiency of the code they produce will only get better over time with continuous fine-tuning. But that’s just the start.At the end of March (2023), OpenAI’s ChatGPT released a plugin called Code Interpreter. If you are one of the few who currently have access to the Alpha version, you can upload data files into it and invoke Python to perform regression analysis and descriptive analysis, look for patterns in your data and even create visualizations. All without having to write or even know a line of Python code! Esteemed Wharton School of Business professor Ethan Mollick has a nice write-up on this.So there you have it. The ability to load, analyze, and present data without writing a stitch of code. Game over yes? Not so fast.As incredibly impressive as these capabilities are, there are some significant limitations to Code Intrepretor, that are indicative of some of the challenges that generative AI would have in taking over the data analysis industry.First, it requires the upload of ONE table. One two-dimensional CSV file (currently limited to 100 MB). The size limitation aside, imagine being tasked with building one table with all of your company’s data…I could probably stop there, but let's go on.With your one table in hand, you now have to get approval to get your one table with ALL of your company’s data pushed outside of your company’s firewall into an LLM that they have no control over…We can probably stop there.The current alternative(more on this later) to the above would be that your company builds its own LLM. While theoretically possible, the complexities of training and fine-tuning the model, the expertise required and the enormous costs of doing so would only make that cost-effective for an extremely short list of companies.But for the sake of understanding, let's take a step back and imagine your company is on that list.But first, let’s start with some perspective. If we look back to the introduction of business intelligence tools in the early 2000s, the great value of those tools lies in their ability to provide non-technical, line-of-business people the ability to leverage their domain knowledge by enabling them to select, analyze and present data, without writing a stitch of code. Sound familiar?Providing user-friendly means to analyze data is nothing new. It will always have incredible value. Indeed, it is a multi-billion dollar industry that continues to grow. However, these tools have no use without domain knowledge. This applies to any data analysis, regardless of the tool(s) being used. Even if it's generative AI. Without domain knowledge, we do not know what questions to ask of our data. And even if the questions were provided to us, how do we interpret our findings?And in my view, the greatest value of data analysis work lies in its ability to answer ad hoc questions. Unforeseen, mission-critical questions. Complex, multi-layered, nonlinear types of questions. Answering these questions requires domain knowledge.For example, why did sales on our best-selling product just drop off a cliff? Our primary supplier just went out of business, what do we do? Why did our customer churn rate double last month? These are not straightforward types of questions that can follow an established decision tree.What these few examples have in common is that they require immediate answers to situational questions that have never been asked before. And that is really the key. If you understand the construct of generative AI, its inability to answer questions of this nature is truly its Achilles heel in ever being able to replace data analysts fully.To briefly summarize, generative AI utilizes existing data sets to ‘train’ an LLM to generate a probability-driven answer based on whatever training data it has been fed. And while you can continuously fine-tune your model with ever more precise data sets, how would you train your model on multi-layered, situational questions that have never been asked before?It would be analogous to you starting a new job as a data analyst in an industry that you are not yet familiar with. And on day one, you are asked to urgently answer one of the questions above. Where would you even start? What data would you pull? How would you even know what all of the potential variables you would need to consider? And, even if you could somehow derive an answer, how would you know if it is correct?It is for these reasons that I don’t foresee the role of data analyst ever being fully replaced by generative AI. However… generative AI, in its current state, already has many uses in the data analysis field and those uses will only continue to expand with ever-increasing functionality.Current Potential Uses for Generative AI in Data AnalysisAs of today, the highest and best use of generative AI in the data analysis field is its ability to both write code and in turn, explain the code it writes (which it does quite well). I’ve personally used it to help me write and understand Python code.For those of you who are looking to enter the data analysis field, I could not encourage you enough to take advantage of generative AI to help you learn to code. It would have greatly speeded up my learning curve when I was first cutting my teeth in this field.In another, truly exciting development for data analysts, generative AI has fueled the development of dedicated coding tools. GitHub has released its Copilot product, which can suggest coding solutions/improvements in real-time as you are writing it!Earlier in this article, I referred to the potential hurdles companies would face in building their own LLMs. There is possibly one new alternative to that: Databricks has recently released an open-source LLM called ’ Dolly’. In theory, this could solve the issues of cost (being open source) and having to push your data outside of your company’s firewall. It’s a smaller-scale LLM, more suited for focused datasets.I mention Dolly, primarily as an example of how quickly developments in the field of generative AI are moving and as a heads-up to how they may affect the data analysis field going forward.As we have already seen, the evolution of AI will only continue to progress at light speed.ConclusionThere is no doubt in my mind that generative AI will reshape the workflows in data analysis. Generally speaking, repetitive types of tasks or even analyses will in time be performed by generative AI. I could also see coding becoming more of a commodity, versus being a highly developed skill.Based on the above, I believe that the prototypical data analyst in the future will possess business line-level domain knowledge combined with an ability to incorporate generative AI tools to help them be more efficient and productive with their time.Lastly, on a personal note, I would encourage anyone reading this to embrace generative AI. Learn about it and use it both in your personal and business lives.

When we hear or read a string of words, we are unconsciously making predictions about what’s coming next. That’s much like what AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard do. At root they are predicting what the next word should be in their responses, with human-like accuracy.
Large language model AIs and human brains are fundamentally different, but that doesn’t mean that AIs don’t have a role in understanding the human brain. Gina Kuperberg, the Dennett Stibel Professor of Cognitive Science and professor of psychology, studies language comprehension—how the brain makes sense of language. She and her colleagues use AI to help understand human cognition.
“As I’m speaking to you right now, you’re taking every single word and you’re incrementally building up meaning from the combination of words that I’m using,” she told me. “You’re doing that really quickly. You’re not waiting until the end of each sentence or each clause to do that. You’re doing that as you’re going along, and based on your interpretation, you’re predicting what I’m going to say next.”
In her research, she is trying to figure out the neurobiology of that mechanism, where in the brain it takes place, how quickly it happens, and precisely how it happens.
Tufts Now spoke with Kuperberg, who is also a psychiatrist in the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, to learn more about language and learning.
Tufts Now: What similarities and differences are there between large language model AI chatbots and humans in terms of learning languages?
Gina Kuperberg: A large language model is trained with very, very large bodies of text. It’s trained to predict upcoming words. In doing so, it picks up the statistical contingencies, the very complex higher-order relationships between words. 
Our brains are constantly predicting the next word, too, and our brains are very good at picking up statistical contingencies and very complex higher order relationships between words.
So, in one sense, you could say the reason why these large language models are so successful is because they capitalize on something that our brains do all the time. But just because these chatbots can predict the next word and perform so well doesn’t necessarily mean that the precise mechanisms by which they do that are the same as those used by the human brain.
Is there anything that cognitive neuroscientists can learn from these AIs to understand the human brain?
Well, it may be that they are learning similar representations to the human brain, and that may tell us something. But it’s also important to recognize that, even though these large language models produce language so well, the precise computational mechanism by which they get there are quite different from those used by the human brain. 
We know quite a lot about the neurobiology of cognitive processes, including language in the brain. And we also know quite a lot about how these large language models are constructed. And they’re very different.
For example, in the human brain, with different layers of cortical structure, we know that there’s constant interaction and feedforward and feedback interactions between these different layers.
And we know that the state-of-the-art language models like ChatGPT, the transformer-based language models, don’t have feedback interactions between layers. They’re wired differently from the human brain. 
So just because you can get a really good end result with them—and we can use that to try and understand human language comprehension and production—that doesn’t that we can make claims about the precise connectivity and the precise mechanisms by which it reaches that end goal.
Do you use these AIs in your research?
We use them more as a tool to try and understand how the brain works. For example, we know that the brain predicts upcoming words, so we use ChatGPT to predict upcoming words and then look to see how the predictability of each upcoming word correlates with brain activity.

For another project in my lab, we’re looking at produced speech, and we’re looking to see the similarities between ChatGPT predictions of each word that someone produces and what the brain produces. 
We’re also seeing whether the predictability of each word produced by people with schizophrenia is reduced compared to our controls. And then we’re also giving the language model progressively less context to see whether that makes a difference. 
I’m curious about the work that you’re doing with schizophrenia—can you explain that a bit more?
Speech produced by people with schizophrenia, which is a severe mental disorder, can in some patients be characterized by what’s known as thought disorder. That means that their language can be disorganized and difficult to understand. 
We’re trying to figure out whether we can describe the speech produced by people with schizophrenia in terms of reduced predictability, and whether people with schizophrenia predict on the basis of global or more local context. A large language model is ideal for testing this hypothesis. My graduate student Tori Sharpe is leading the project.
We have access to speech samples produced by people with schizophrenia in their very first episode of psychosis as they’re describing pictures, and we can assess the predictability of each word that they produce. We find that predictability of each word is reduced in schizophrenia. 
That’s interesting, but what’s more interesting is that, based on only the local context, people with schizophrenia produce language that is just as predictable as the language produced by people without schizophrenia. The way that we were able to figure this out is by giving the large language model different amounts of context to make its prediction.
When you give the model words 1-50, and estimate the predictability of word 51, and then compare people with and without schizophrenia, you find that the people with schizophrenia produce less predictable words. But if you give the model words 42 to 49, and use this limited context to estimate predictability, then it turns out that there is no difference between the predictability of the people with schizophrenia and healthy controls.




“What’s cool about predictive coding is that it’s biologically and cognitively plausible—it was first used to describe phenomenon and the visual system. It has lots of feedforward and feedback connections across layers just like the human brain.”

That’s important, because it tells us that people with schizophrenia are able to predict the next word based on local rather than global context. That’s been a hypothesis in the research for a while, but now with large language models, we can systematically test it.
Is that related to memory—that people with schizophrenia can’t hold words one through 41 in short-term memory, only words 42 to 49?
It may well be related to their working memory, but that’s still an open question. In our current research with one measure of short-term working memory, we saw no difference. It may be a more specific kind of verbal working memory that is impaired in patients. We also found that the local versus global difference predicted the degree of thought disorder within the patient group, which is important because it provides a way to operationalize this clinical symptom.
Are there other uses of AIs in your research?
A grad student in my lab, Samer Nour Eddine, is developing a “toy” language model based on the principles of an algorithm known as predictive coding. The nice thing about toy language models is that, unlike large language models where the inner workings are somewhat obscure, you can understand how they work and tweak their precise mechanisms and algorithms.
The predictive coding algorithm has been very successful in explaining important phenomena in the human visual system. What Samer did was to use the precise architecture and algorithm of predictive coding to simulate a neural signature called the N400, which is highly sensitive to the predictability of each incoming word.  When you get an incoming word that is unpredictable, the N400 is large, but it gets smaller and smaller as words become more and more predictable. 
Samer has used predictive coding to simulate this N400 effect. There’s no way a large language model can do that. A large language model can describe the sensitivity of this N400 effect to predictability, but it can’t simulate its time course—the rise and the fall of the N400 over time— and it can’t simulate other factors that the N400 is sensitive to. 
What’s cool about predictive coding is that it’s biologically and cognitively plausible—it was first used to describe phenomenon and the visual system. It has lots of feedforward and feedback connections across layers just like the human brain. I think some people are trying to develop large language models based on predictive coding principles, but it is quite different from the state-of-the-art things like ChatGPT, whose architecture is quite different from a predictive coding architecture.
Some people are alarmed by chatbots’ abilities. You seem to be using them in useful ways in your research. What is your general take?
It’s just like anything, isn’t it? When paper first came into use, Plato was alarmed; he thought people would use it unwisely and it would destroy the brain’s ability to think and use memory. 
I think one should certainly be alarmed in terms of large language models being unprecedented tools for disseminating misinformation. But there are always amazing uses for new technology and new AI tools. 
It’s going to change the way people write. It can’t change the way people think. It’s not going to make us obsolete. So, like the internet, there are really good things to be done with AI tools, and really bad things, and it’s up to us to use these things wisely and carefully.

The recent comeuppance of generative AI tools has raised the discussion around prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is the art and science of giving generative AI models the right prompts to receive the output you want. A broader definition could also include your ability to choose the right models for the right purposes and determine whether to use generative AI in the first place.
The value you can gain from generative AI — both as a company and as an individual knowledge worker — is directly correlated to your prompt engineering ability. However, there has been a lot of debate lately about what role this skill will play in the future of work. Some people argue that a small subset of people who become experts at prompt engineering now will dominate the labor market tomorrow. But I see it unfolding similar to the way using Zoom or searching on Google became a technology cornerstone for any knowledge worker. 






There might be a very small group of specialized prompt engineers or highly-paid generative AI specialists with deep industry-specific expertise, but most people will add it to their regular toolbox without being paid explicitly for it. This is partly because the organizations behind AI research are incentivized to empower broad adoption and accessibility; this is why ChatGPT came out in the first place. Just like the Internet, it will only become easier to use. In many cases, users will not even know generative AI is being used.

Which companies are the most important vendors in AI and hyperautomation? Check out the Acceleration Economy AI/Hyperautomation Top 10 Shortlist.

Prompt Engineering Principles
In the spirit of bringing everyone on board the generative AI movement, here are some value-added prompt engineering principles you can apply in your company. These principles come from a mix of my personal experience having applied generative AI tools in my startup, advice from friends building AI companies, a ChatGPT prompting course run in partnership with OpenAI that I just finished, my LinkedIn feed that’s been almost exclusively AI-related for the past few months, and this excellent podcast episode from Andreessen Horowitz and Guy Parsons, a designer who compiled a book on prompt engineering.
Prompting is a highly iterative process. Just like building a startup, the best strategy for prompting is to start as quickly as possible. Even if you’re not sure exactly what output you want, start with a prompt that heads in the right direction. You can refine your follow-up prompt based on the model’s first response. Meticulously planning out your early prompts is like renting an office and buying a fancy espresso machine for your startup before having a customer.Write clear and specific prompts — that doesn’t mean short. Your prompts can be entire paragraphs with multiple sections, specific sub-requests, or examples.Use delimiters like quotes, brackets, or dashes to help the model differentiate each part of your prompt. For example, you can summarize an article by copy-pasting it into ChatGPT or an API call to GPT-3, but you need to identify the quoted text through quotation marks and leave your questions about the text unmarked. This helps the model parse through your input.Ask for a structured and specific output by telling the model exactly what kind of output you want. If you’re doing market research on competitors, for instance, ask for a list of 30 bullet points wherein each bullet contains the name of a competitor separated by their employee count and their monthly recurring revenue (MRR).Be flexible on details. Sometimes models will not accommodate all your given rules. GPT-3, for example, often will not adhere to exact word count limits. In these cases, you need some flexibility, perhaps by asking for a sentence count limit instead.Few-shot prompting is when you give a successful example or setup, and ask the model to complete it or repeat it but with different content. Try this technique if the model is not following the guidelines you set in your input. This problem can arise either because your desired output is harder to describe in words than in examples or because the model doesn’t have much training data relating to the topic.To reduce hallucinations, or outputs that are blatantly false but sound convincing, ask the model to pull actual quotes or pieces of information from a source document and ask for the source so you can fact-check the output. This is especially relevant if you’re using the AI-powered Bing or ChatGPT plugins.Play around with temperature, which is a large language model‘s (LLM) degree of randomness or freedom of exploration. For creative applications, a higher temperature can yield more original results. This variable is accessible through API calls to models like GPT-3.5, not through the web ChatGPT interface.Fine-tuned, application-specific LLMs beat base models like GPT-4. When it comes to current AI systems, which don’t have full-fledged consciousness yet, breadth is at a tradeoff with depth in capability. Designing an LLM with custom data sets that are fine-tuned for your industry-specific application will yield better results. You can use base models, like the GPT-n series, as a starting point.It’s easy to get outputs 80% right but nailing the final 20% is often impossible. It’s difficult to edit small details within outputs compared to, say, using Photoshop instead of Midjourney. This is one reason why companies need to keep a human in the loop if generative AI is being used in a critical workflow. If generated assets are being posted on company social media accounts, for example, there should be human oversight. That human should also be able to make manual tweaks if needed. Oftentimes, generative AI is just a starting point. This is especially true if you’re generating code to be used in production.Leverage resources like PromptBase, AIPRM, and Parsons’ book on prompting to get inspiration, find effective prompts for your application or industry, and supercharge your use of generative AI.
Guidebook: Insights Into the Why and How of AI and Hyperautomation’s Impact
Here are some additional in-depth prompt engineering principles described in an enterprise context, courtesy of Microsoft.
Evolving AI Skillsets
The current definition of prompt engineering is certainly not final. Companies of all shapes and sizes must continue adapting the skills of their team around new tools and trends. Whether it’s encouraging your engineers to build a ChatGPT plugin through a weekend hackathon, which we recently held at the incubator where I work, or supercharging your growth team through generative AI-powered A/B testing, there are many possibilities.
One tool to highlight is AutoGPT, which is essentially GPT-3.5 paired with a bot that autonomously completes tasks. For example, a friend of mine recently ordered a pizza using only the AutoGPT interface. AutoGPT will take a user’s high-level instruction — like ordering a pizza, writing a business plan, or booking a hotel — and use the GPT-3.5 LLM in combination with various programs to complete the task. It will ask follow-up questions to receive the information it needs from you, like your login. This is similar to ChatGPT plugins which give users access to real-time data streams, perform functions with existing services, and make transactions directly through the ChatGPT interface.
Being a new project, AutoGPT comes with many limitations. Its breadth and flexibility are offset by its lack of capability. It seems like ChatGPT plugins like those of Instacart or Expedia, which have direct access to company databases, are still a better option for consumers. Nonetheless, it highlights an exciting trend of combining traditional software stacks with natural language processing. This combination is powering a new wave of convenience for consumers or internal teams.
Final Thoughts
Altogether, prompting is an amazing skill to have. However, as tools become more widespread and easier to use, I believe prompt engineering will not be a very unique skill. It probably won’t give anyone a major advantage in labor markets five or 10 years down the line but, rather, become a baseline necessity. As such, it is vital for companies to upskill their workforce as we continue into the AI era. The residual internal innovation and even product development of doing so won’t hurt either.

Whether we realize it or not, advancements in artificial intelligence are increasingly influencing the paths of our careers.
Advancements in human capital management systems, more strategic and data-driven human resource and talent management practices, and increased attention to bias are all factors that are changing how people are hired, developed, promoted and fired. 
I teach and work in talent management and leadership development. I’ve used these programs and practices in the real world and continue to learn and research how these practices are changing. Artificial intelligence and systems are already big business, grossing over US$38 billion in 2021. Without a doubt, AI-driven software has the potential to advance quickly and change how companies make strategic decisions about their employees.  
Here’s what that acceleration may mean to you.
Applying
Imagine you apply for a job in the very near future. You upload your carefully written résumé through the company website, noting that the platform looks eerily similar to other platforms you’ve used to apply for other jobs. After your résumé is saved, you provide demographic information and complete countless fields with the same data from your résumé. You then hit “submit” and hope for a follow-up email from a person. 
Your data now lives within this company’s human capital management system. Even if they collect them, very few companies are looking at résumés anymore; they’re looking at the info you type into those tiny boxes to help make comparisons between you, dozens or hundreds of other applicants, and the job requirements. Even if your résumé demonstrates that you are the most qualified applicant, it alone is unlikely to catch the eye of the recruiter, because the recruiter’s attention is elsewhere.



With input from artificial intelligence, measures of employee performance will become more objective and increasingly data-driven.

Getting the job
Let’s say you get the call, you ace the interview and the job is yours. Your information hits another stage within the company’s database, or HCM: active employee. Your performance ratings and other data about your employment will now be tied to your profile, adding more data for the HCM and human resources to monitor and assess.
Enhancements in AI, technology and HCMs enable HR to look at employee data on deeper levels. The insights gleaned help identify talented employees who could fill key leadership roles when people quit and guide decisions about who should be promoted. The data can also identify favoritism and bias in hiring and promotion.
As you continue in your role, data on your performance is tracked and analyzed. This may include your performance ratings, supervisor’s feedback, professional development activity – or lack thereof. Having this large amount of data about you and others over time now helps HR think about how employees can better support the growth of the organization.
For example, HR may use data to identify how likely specific employees are to quit and evaluate the impact of that loss. 
Platforms that many people already use every day aggregate productivity data from sign-in to signoff. Widely available Microsoft tools including Teams, Outlook and SharePoint can help provide insight to managers via their workplace analytics tool. The Microsoft productivity score tracks overall usage within the platform. 
Even the metrics and behaviors defining “good” or “bad” performance may change, relying less on the perception of the manager. As data grows, even the work of professionals like consultants, doctors and marketers will be quantitatively and objectively measured. A 2022 New York Times investigation found that these systems, designed to improve worker productivity and accountability, had the effect of damaging morale and instilling fear. 
It’s clear that American employees should begin to think about how our data is being used, what story that data is telling, and how it may dictate our futures. 
Optimizing and understanding your career
Not every company has an HCM or is advanced in using talent data to make decisions. But many companies are becoming savvier and some are incredibly advanced. At a recent Microsoft Viva summit I attended, chief human resources officers from companies like PayPal and Rio Tinto outlined ways they are using these advancements. 
Some researchers claim that AI could promote equity by removing implicit bias from hiring and promoting, but many more see a danger that AI built by humans will just repackage old issues in a new box. Amazon learned this lesson the hard way back in 2018 when a résumé-sorting AI it built had to be abandoned when it favored men for programming roles. 
What’s more, the increase of data collection and analysis can leave employees unclear on where they stand while the organization is very clear. It’s best if you understand how AI is changing the workplace and demand transparency from your employer. These are data points that employees should consider asking about during their next review:

Do you see me as a high-potential employee?
How does my performance compare with others’?
Do you see me as a successor to your role or others’?

Just as you need to master traditional aspects of workplace culture, politics and relationships, you should learn to navigate these platforms, understand how you are being assessed, and take ownership of your career in a new and more data-driven way.

 AI is being used extensively to enhance productivity in most sectors. From automating tasks to enhancing customer and client experience, generative AI is here to step up the game. It can streamline business workflows, help businesses save resources, and give rise to a new generation of business applications. 







 Let's find out the different ways generative AI is expected to impact productivity in the near future and how you can take advantage of it in your work. 


 1. AI Will Complement New Workflows 
    

 People are always on the lookout for simplifying their workflows, developing new ones, and improving their productivity levels through effective task management. Generative AI has the ability to quickly adapt and complement new workflows and take the load off employees. With its quick and adaptive abilities, AI can complement workflows in almost any sector. 

 For example, data analytics can be simplified with generative AI, resulting in faster findings. Large datasets can be quickly analyzed using generative AI algorithms, which yield insights and predictions. This level of data processing has applications in a variety of industries. 





 In marketing, for example, generative AI technologies may study client behavior and forecast how customers will react to new products or services. In cybersecurity, generative AI algorithms can evaluate historical event data and assist data scientists in identifying possible security threats. However, whether the use of AI is completely increasing cybersecurity remains debatable. 



 2. Automation of High-Level and Complex Tasks 
    

 Research by Goldman Sachs has shown that AI has the potential to automate about two-thirds of U.S. professions. A quarter to as much as half of the workload of those affected occupations could be replaced. 






 Although the influence of AI on the labor market is anticipated to be enormous, most careers and industries are only partially susceptible to automation. As a result, workflows are more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI. 

 Generative AI, which can better understand historical patterns and context, summarize highly complex information, use predictive intelligence, and suggest the best actions, will usher in a new era of personalized and highly efficient experiences. It could also help automate more complex tasks and take business process automation to the next level. 



 3. Do More With Less Time 
    

 Generative AI has the potential to automate processes that ordinarily require creative input from a human. This can help businesses save time and money while generating high-quality results. 





 By helping more people to work much faster than before, it's reasonable to predict that some jobs will see a decrease in the number of hours required, leading to shorter workdays. After all, AI is already being used to streamline the way remote and hybrid work is done. 

 Companies will also find new ways to measure productivity as they progressively embrace automation, and human capital becomes less necessary in the future. Although human intervention will still be required with AI, employees in many businesses may find themselves working shorter hours. 



 4. Minimal Impact on High-Skilled Workers 
    






 According to a study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research and MIT, the lowest-skilled employees are expected to profit the most from these developments in AI. As generative AI continues to automate more tasks and understand more context, low-skilled and mid-skilled labor can reap maximum benefits. 

 However, high-skilled jobs, which require more human intervention and complex skills, may receive limited assistance from AI. This is because AI recommendations are based on one's own knowledge and repetitive actions. Hence, high-skilled workers benefit less from AI support and may face minimal impact from its adoption. 

 Employees with the highest level of expertise will benefit very little, if at all, from the incorporation of AI into their jobs. This is due to the fact that these top performers are already providing responses of the same quality as those recommended by AI, leaving less possibility for development. 








 Supercharge Your Productivity With Generative AI 
 Given the rate at which generative AI is advancing, we can expect it to have a significant impact on the employment market and our place in it. 

 The rise of generative AI tools will have a more significant influence on some jobs than others. A great way to ensure your future relevance is to upskill yourself in domains where AI is yet to reach its full potential.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



One listing says the job would be part of a team that will “shape the way generative AI technologies transform Apple’s mobile computing platforms,” potentially hinting at expanded AI capabilities on iPhones and other devices in the near future.
Apple’s ambitions for AI
The job listings provide a glimpse into Apple’s ambitions for AI, even as the company has been tight-lipped about any specific plans. Apple CEO Tim Cook declined to discuss product roadmaps during a recent Q2 earnings call when asked about Apple’s AI strategy, but said the technology presented “enormous” opportunities.
Similarly, one job listing reads, “AI represents a huge opportunity to elevate Apple’s products and experiences for billions of people globally.” The listing says the role would involve “leveraging state-of-the-art generative models to ship extraordinary products, services and customer experiences for the iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, iPad and more.”
Generative AI has become an active area of research and development for many of the largest technology companies. Google, Microsoft, Meta and others have released updates to AI systems that can generate conversational text, photos and code and the infrastructure upon which these systems operate. The technology is not without risks, however, such as the possibility of bias in AI systems and the inadvertent release of confidential data.
Independence from third-party AI tools
In recent months, Apple has restricted employees from using certain external AI tools like ChatGPT  and GitHub’s Copilot, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. Apple told staff not to use those tools because they could release sensitive data, the report claims.
The moves suggest Apple aims to advance its own AI efforts to avoid relying on other companies’ technologies. With vast resources and more than a billion iPhone users, Apple is well positioned to develop innovative AI for its products.
Still, the company’s plans remain unclear with Cook and other executives providing few details on how Apple might integrate more advanced AI into new iPhones, iPads, the Apple Watch or its other offerings.

(Los Angeles Times)       By Brian MerchantTechnology Columnist    May 24, 2023 5 AM PT      Share       Share via Close extra sharing options    Email     Facebook    X    LinkedIn    Threads    Reddit    WhatsApp    Copy Link URLCopied!   Print        What will it look like when AI comes for your job? How will it happen? Will it happen at all? These are the questions on so many minds in the age of OpenAI and Google’s Bard, of the suddenly ubiquitous text and image generators such as ChatGPT and Midjourney.The maddening thing is that, at least at first, it’s probably not going to look like much of anything. There will be no cybernetic android that lumbers over to your desk and takes over your work duties, no disembodied robot voice that suddenly assumes command over your department. It might just look like routine layoffs, or a freelancer having more trouble finding work.A friend of mine, a veteran artist and prolific freelance illustrator, told me it’s been a “really weak year,” and believes the rise of AI image generation is to blame. He’s spoken to art directors at ad agencies, where he’s made much of his past income, who told him they’ve begun using Midjourney internally; the work isn’t published publicly, so there are fewer concerns about copyright and no working illustrators who might see the material and shame them. Advertisement    That is what it will look like to many as managers turn to AI to meet their needs to cut costs: not a fiery robot apocalypse, but a slowly declining rate of work on offer.More maddening still, few are likely to agree on what constitutes technological replacement, and what does not.Case in point: Since the text generators burst onto the scene late last year, a number of digital media companies have been experimenting with AI-generated content. CNET quietly started publishing AI-written stories in November, and  BuzzFeed and Insider have announced that they’re trying out different forms of AI-generated content too.           Technology and the Internet   Column: Your boss wants AI to replace you. The writers’ strike shows how to fight back  Artists, journalists and screenwriters are leading the fight against employers who would seek to replace them with the products of ChatGPT and other generative AI software. May 11, 2023  At the same time, all three companies have also been experimenting with laying off their staff. CNET fired 10% of its newsroom in March, and Insider followed suit in April.  BuzzFeed shut down its entire Pulitzer Prize-winning News division, which was home to around 60 journalists, and laid off 15% of employees companywide.Now, digital media is a particularly punishing business — another former heavyweight, Vice, declared bankruptcy just last week — and one that’s no stranger to layoffs at any given time. Yet the timing struck many as alarming, especially at a moment when executives in other industries are explicitly stating their intent to use AI to take over jobs previously done by humans; IBM Chief Executive Arvind Krishna, for instance, estimated AI would replace around 8,000 of the firm’s jobs in coming years.Not two weeks after the News division was shut down, BuzzFeed held its annual Investor Day, at which Chief Executive Jonah Peretti spoke about, among other things, the ways his company was embracing AI. “BuzzFeed has always lived at the intersection of technology and creativity,” he said at the event. “And recent developments in artificial intelligence represent an opportunity to take this convergence to the next level.” Advertisement    AI, he said, was making brand-new kinds of content possible and would soon replace the “static” content we’ve grown accustomed to reading on websites with “new formats that are more gamified, more personalized and more interactive.” BuzzFeed, he continued, is using generative AI to “establish the blueprint for AI-driven revenue growth across the company. … And with the developments with both creators and AI, we see the opportunity to build a content creation model that makes our creative team more efficient and sustainably expands our output without increasing fixed costs.”When I shared the observation that BuzzFeed seemed to be going all in on AI on the heels of laying off its News staff on Twitter, the reaction was, uh, strong.   Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti, speaking at Investor Day, just one week after laying off its entire News team: ""Over the next few years, generative AI will replace the majority of static content""https://t.co/7SGwFiitY5 pic.twitter.com/qI9bSWYrTD— Brian Merchant (@bcmerchant) May 17, 2023   “Unrelentingly bleak,”  MSNBC host Chris Hayes commented. “None of this has to happen,”  writer Molly Jong-Fast tweeted. “Writing doesn’t need to be automated.”Displeased for a different reason was Peretti, who sent me a direct message accusing me of “completely misrepresenting” what he said. But what started as a hostile exchange — “totally irresponsible,” he called my gloss on his speech — soon became something more productive, as Peretti explained his views on how BuzzFeed would be utilizing AI. Our conversation via DM offered a window into the thinking of an executive in a field that generative AI stands to  affect.“In the future, AI will replace static content because content will become more personalized and dynamic,” Peretti said. “For example, you’ll be able to ‘chat with an article’ to get related information or background on a story you might have missed earlier. This has nothing to do with replacing writers or having AI write articles.”Peretti said  he was not automating the production of news articles, or replacing writers with AI. “I was talking about the industry as a whole when I described ‘static content’ being replaced,” he said, “and my prediction is it will be replaced with formats like the BuzzFeed AI quizzes, i.e. human-created content with interactivity added with AI.”        Technology and the Internet   Column: Afraid of AI? The startups selling it want you to be  ChatGPT and other new AI services benefit from a science fiction-infused marketing frenzy unlike anything in recent memory. There’s more to fear here than killer robots.March 31, 2023  I pointed out that laying off the people whose jobs were to write articles, and then pointing to the company’s embrace of AI is nonetheless to make the case to investors that said new technology will make up the difference. On Investor Day, Peretti said the use of AI “sustainably expands our output without increasing fixed costs,” after all.“What happened to News and AI are unrelated,” he said, “I shut down BuzzFeed News because it was losing millions of dollars, and I still supported it for years and years despite the losses.”He went on: “Some investors might misunderstand what we are doing and think it is about ‘automated output’ as you say. I’ve never said that, and I think it is a big misunderstanding of how AI will ultimately be used in media. Think of AI as a new medium, not as a labor replacement. We won’t be replacing BFN output; we’ll be making totally different types of content. We’ll need creative people to make these new formats.” And herein lies the crux of the matter. I believe Peretti when he says he’s not looking at this as a way to replace workers — even if I am absolutely convinced that he’s trying to replace their value. But when automation unfolds in a historical context, it’s rarely a one-to-one affair. It’s not as though there’s going to be a staff writer who specializes in science news one day, and a bot that is trained to reproduce her output that will be deployed the next. In the world of news-gathering, anyway — workers like voice-over artists and illustrators have found their art vacuumed up and spat out by generative AI trained on their work, though the legality of such practices is still very much in question, and humans are still needed to edit the final output.Automation is uneven and messy, and it’s far more likely to proceed the way we’re seeing unfold at BuzzFeed — previously there was a big expensive team of humans doing difficult and labor-intensive work, and now they are gone and there is a different content product altogether, one built by a combination of new technology and input from a more precarious worker. (In his Investor Day speech, Peretti also spoke of the growing importance of partnerships with independent content creators. “The shift will allow BuzzFeed to produce more with a smaller headcount, while also leaning into new internet trends,” as Axios reported.)When I asked if he would try to maintain the same output without the News desk, he didn’t answer, and that certainly appears to be the plan.The way he sees it, I think, is that News was simply no longer viable — it had never made money, and it was unlikely to in the future. Shuttering that department was one decision; embracing AI for a different part of his business was another. But it’s hard to say whether Peretti would have been comfortable jettisoning News if there wasn’t a buzzy technology to create new kinds of content to intrigue investors with. News may have not been profitable in a strict sense, but it lent the entire BuzzFeed operation credibility and prestige, and generated knock-on value that the rest of the enterprise benefited from. If generative AI hadn’t exploded when it did, would BuzzFeed be able to jettison News? Maybe not!That’s speculative, and Peretti insists otherwise. But AI is above all an ambiguity generator. It allows those who hold the power to justify making all kinds of calls, in the name of embracing the future, improving efficiency and so on. And in this still very young AI-infested moment of ours, we can’t be sure which way many of those calls will break.        Technology and the Internet   Column: Uber and Lyft’s ‘deactivation’ policy is dehumanizing and unfair. It must end  The seemingly random firing of drivers is one way ride-hail companies keep workers powerless. Can’t they bear the cost of humane engagement?Feb. 28, 2023  There are, however, plenty of worrying signs — studio executives refused to agree not to use AI that would displace writers, in a sticking point in the ongoing writers’ strike, for one — and ample anecdata in the form of all those Twitter threads about workers getting the boot in favor of ChatGPT. But it’s still hard to know how, when and if AI will have a major impact on the jobs picture. Peretti says he’s sympathetic to this.“So many journalists are losing their jobs and it is a real crisis,” Peretti  said. “People should be worried. And history has valuable lessons for sure. The irony is if our AI entertainment efforts had started sooner and performed better, I could have had enough surplus profit to continue underwriting losses at news like I’d done for years previously.”In the end, we’re still getting more AI and fewer humans — even if the AI is not doing the humans’ job, exactly. AI will be used by executives and managers much this way, I think: to help gin up investment in future-forward products that require less labor costs to make, to buffer layoffs or attrition in human departments, and to hire more part-time or project-based workers.There’s no jobs apocalypse coming; there’s just a series of managers making the calls they think will best benefit their bottom line, and serve their boards.
