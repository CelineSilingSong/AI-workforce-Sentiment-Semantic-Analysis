Take a deep breath.

Now that I’ve made that everyday statement to you (or perhaps it is a commanding directive aimed at you), suggesting that you are to take a deep breath, what would you do next?


I suppose you could completely ignore the remark. You might brush it off. Perhaps it was just a figure of speech and not intended for your attention per se. On the other hand, maybe you interpreted the remark as quite helpful. Ergo, you have indeed stilled yourself and taken a deep breath. Good for you. We all seem to know or be told that taking a deep breath can be good for the soul and get your mind into a calm contemplative state.

Consider the catchphrase in a different light. If you were to be told that same remark in a medical context, such as a physician saying the same to you, I am assuming that you would be interpreting the words to mean that you are supposed to purely physically take a deep breath. This might have nothing to do with your mental status and instead, be part of a physical exam. The doctor might be listening to your chest and wanting to detect internal cavity sounds as prodded via a heavy inhalation.

PROMOTED
The gist is that the famous line of taking a deep breath can be contextually sensitive.
You have to consider the circumstances under which the line is being used. It could be a command. It could be intended to get you to stop and smell the roses. It could be a physical thing. It could be a metaphorical indication that has some other significance. A wide array of possible interpretations exist.
The same can be said for using the take-a-deep-breath catchphrase in generative AI.
In today’s column, I am continuing my ongoing and popular series on the latest advances in prompt engineering, including that I am going to tackle in this discussion the recent trend or fad of wanting to make use of the line “take a deep breath” as a prompting technique or strategy for generative AI. You might not have heard about this as yet. The “take a deep breath” mantra is slowly gaining momentum. I thought it might be handy to catch this roller coaster on the way up.

My goal here is to share with you why this is not some magical incantation that will solve all kinds of prompting issues and get generative AI to work miracles. Sorry to break that harsh or gloomy news. But, hold on, there is a smiley face still to be had. The use of the deep breathing catchphrase can have some limited advantages in generative AI. I am just forewarning you that it is not a catchall and you must use it in only the most astute of ways.

I will proceed in my discussion as follows.
First, I will introduce you to the said origins of the take-a-deep-breath prompting approach. Doing so involves doing a bit of a deep dive into some recent research on the optimization of prompts for the purpose of boosting prompt engineering results. You’ll enjoy those aspects, I’m sure of that. The research is quite interesting, and I applaud the researchers for their insightful and innovative work.

Second, I will discuss why you need to be cautious in overinterpreting the properties of the legendary saying. It has been somewhat unfairly plucked out of the midst of a fuller research study and given a shiny light that seems to overstate its importance. Also, turns out that some in the media have nearly in their glee run somewhat amuck with the catchphrase. They appear to be touting it as a prompting savoir in ways that are misleading, misguided, or maybe naïve and innocently stirred without having intimately studied the matter.
Third, I decided to do some ad hoc experimentation to try and look more closely at the deep-breath conception as a prompting tool, doing so by using ChatGPT. Admittedly, the look-see is short and sweet. The quick-and-dirty effort was not a full-blown experimental setup. My guess would generally be that the tiny indication here might spur some erstwhile added AI research of a deeper analysis of the deep-breath considerations. Maybe, maybe not. I’ll let you know if something else pops up.
Before I dive into my in-depth exploration of this vital topic, let’s make sure we are all on the same page when it comes to the foundations of prompt engineering and generative AI. Doing so will put us all on an even keel.
Prompt Engineering Is A Cornerstone For Generative AI
As a quick backgrounder, prompt engineering or also referred to as prompt design is a rapidly evolving realm and is vital to effectively and efficiently using generative AI or the use of large language models (LLMs). Anyone using generative AI such as the widely and wildly popular ChatGPT by AI maker OpenAI, or akin AI such as GPT-4 (OpenAI), Bard (Google), Claude 2 (Anthropic), etc. ought to be paying close attention to the latest innovations for crafting viable and pragmatic prompts.
For those of you interested in prompt engineering or prompt design, I’ve been doing an ongoing series of insightful explorations on the latest in this expanding and evolving realm, including this coverage:


(1) Imperfect prompts. Practical use of imperfect prompts toward devising superb prompts (see the link here).
(2) Persistent context prompting. Use of persistent context or custom instructions for prompt priming (see the link here).
(3) Multi-personas prompting. Leveraging multi-personas in generative AI via shrewd prompting (see the link here).
(4) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Advent of using prompts to invoke chain-of-thought reasoning (see the link here).
(5) In-model learning and vector database prompting. Use of prompt engineering for domain savviness via in-model learning and vector databases (see the link here).
(6) Chain-of-Thought factored decomposition prompting. Augmenting the use of chain-of-thought by leveraging factored decomposition (see the link here).
(7) Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) prompting. Making use of the newly emerging skeleton-of-thought approach for prompt engineering (see the link here).
(8) Show-me versus tell-me prompting. Determining when to best use the show-me versus tell-me prompting strategy (see the link here).
(9) Mega-personas prompting. The gradual emergence of the mega-personas approach entails scaling up the multi-personas to new heights (see the link here).
(10) Certainty and prompts. Discovering the hidden role of certainty and uncertainty within generative AI and using advanced prompt engineering techniques accordingly (see the link here).
(11) Vague prompts. Vagueness is often shunned when using generative AI but it turns out that vagueness is a useful prompt engineering tool (see the link here).
(12) Prompt catalogs. Prompt engineering frameworks or catalogs can really boost your prompting skills and especially bring you up to speed on the best prompt patterns to utilize (see the link here).
(13) Flipped Interaction prompting. Flipped interaction is a crucial prompt engineering technique that everyone should know (see the link here).
(14) Self-reflection prompting. Leveraging are-you-sure AI self-reflection and AI self-improvement capabilities is an advanced prompt engineering approach with surefire upside results (see the link here).
(15) Addons for prompting. Know about the emerging addons that will produce prompts for you or tune up your prompts when using generative AI (see the link here).
(16) Conversational prompting. Make sure to have an interactive mindset when using generative AI rather than falling into the mental trap of one-and-done prompting styles (see the link here).
(17) Prompt to code. Prompting to produce programming code that can be used by code interpreters to enhance your generative AI capabilities (see the link here).
(18) Target-your-response (TAR) prompting. Make sure to consider Target-Your-Response considerations when doing mindful prompt engineering (see the link here).
(19) Prompt macros and end-goal planning. Additional coverage includes the use of macros and the astute use of end-goal planning when using generative AI (see the link here).
(20) Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) prompting. Showcasing how to best use an emerging approach known as the Tree of Thoughts as a leg-up beyond chain-of-thought prompt engineering (see the link here).
(21) Trust layers for prompting. Generative AI will be surrounded by automated tools for prompt engineering in an overarching construct referred to as an AI trust layer, such as being used by Salesforce (see the link here).
(22) Directional stimulus prompting (hints). The strategic use of hints or directional stimulus prompting is a vital element of any prompt engineering endeavor or skillset (see the link here).
(23) Invasive prompts. Watch out that your prompts do not give away privacy or confidentiality (see the link here).
(24) Illicit prompts. Be aware that most AI makers have strict licensing requirements about prompts that you aren’t allowed to make use of and thus should avoid these so-called banned or illicit prompts (see the link here).
(25) Chain-of-Density (CoD) prompting. A new prompting technique known as Chain-of-Density has promising capabilities to jampack content when you are doing summarizations (see the link here).


Anyone stridently interested in prompt engineering and improving their results when using generative AI ought to be familiar with those notable techniques.
Moving on, here’s a bold statement that pretty much has become a veritable golden rule these days:


The use of generative AI can altogether succeed or fail based on the prompt that you enter. 


If you provide a prompt that is poorly composed, the odds are that the generative AI will wander all over the map and you won’t get anything demonstrative related to your inquiry. Being demonstrably specific can be advantageous, but even that can confound or otherwise fail to get you the results you are seeking. A wide variety of cheat sheets and training courses for suitable ways to compose and utilize prompts has been rapidly entering the marketplace to try and help people leverage generative AI soundly. In addition, add-ons to generative AI have been devised to aid you when trying to come up with prudent prompts, see my coverage at the link here.
AI Ethics and AI Law also stridently enter into the prompt engineering domain. For example, whatever prompt you opt to compose can directly or inadvertently elicit or foster the potential of generative AI to produce essays and interactions that imbue untoward biases, errors, falsehoods, glitches, and even so-called AI hallucinations (I do not favor the catchphrase of AI hallucinations, though it has admittedly tremendous stickiness in the media; here’s my take on AI hallucinations at the link here).
There is also a marked chance that we will ultimately see lawmakers come to the fore on these matters, possibly devising and putting in place new laws or regulations to try and scope and curtail misuses of generative AI. Regarding prompt engineering, there are likely going to be heated debates over putting boundaries around the kinds of prompts you can use. This might include requiring AI makers to filter and prevent certain presumed inappropriate or unsuitable prompts, a cringe-worthy issue for some that borders on free speech considerations. For my ongoing coverage of these types of AI Ethics and AI Law issues, see the link here and the link here, just to name a few.
With the above as an overarching perspective, we are ready to jump into today’s discussion.
Research On Prompt Optimization
Sometimes you are faced with solving a problem that requires optimization. A famous example is the revered classic known as the traveling salesperson problem. A salesperson is seeking to visit clients or prospective clients in various cities. There is a distance between each city. There are costs associated with traveling from city to city. The problem consists of trying to find the optimum path for making the city visits such that you perhaps minimize the cost or some related key factor involved.
Here’s a question for you.
Can we use generative AI to solve optimization problems?
The answer is yes, you can use generative AI to solve optimization problems. A rub to this notion is that at times a conventional generative AI might do a lousy job on the optimization and not arrive at a considered optimal answer. There are chances too that generative AI will arrive at a wrong answer. You need to be especially careful when asking contemporary generative AI to solve optimization problems.
A tricky means to get conventional generative AI to cope with optimization problems involves either changing up the AI app to have additional components for that purpose or you might simply access other external apps that can do the optimization. Today’s generative AI usually readily has APIs (application programming interfaces) that allow the AI app to reach out to other apps, see my discussion at the link here. If conventional generative AI is weak at some kinds of tasks, you can often have the AI app make use of an outside app to do the additional needed work and then report back to you the results thereof.
A preference would be to get conventional generative AI to undertake optimization problems by simply using carefully composed prompts that would nudge or guide the AI app toward suitably doing so. Maybe we can tell our way into getting generative AI to adequately figure out optimization problems. This would be great because you then would not need to alter the internal capabilities of the AI app, nor would you need to become reliant on an external app that was going to do the optimization for the AI.
You would just need to use appropriate prompts to get the job done.
A recent research study by researchers at Google DeepMind sought to avidly pursue the path of prompting AI to solve optimization problems. The study is entitled “Large Language Models As Optimizers” by Chengrun Yang, Xuezhi Wang, Yifeng Lu, Hanxiao Liu, Quoc V. Le, Denny Zhou, and Xinyun Chen, and was posted online on September 7, 2023.
Here are some selected excerpts in which they describe their innovative research:


“Optimization is ubiquitous. While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language.”
“In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step.”
“We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to prompt optimization where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.”


The research involved making use of prompts and improving the prompts over a series of repeated tryouts, doing so in an automated way rather than having a human modify the prompts. In short, a prompt is attempted that will aim to move forward aptly on the optimization at hand. This gets the AI app to produce initial solutions. Those initial solutions are assessed and then the prompt for optimization is refined or otherwise adjusted to further improve the solutions. The hope is that this will walk the AI app step by step toward ultimately performing the optimization in a most or more satisfactory manner.
In the first part of the research study, the focus consisted of using this method for the traveling salesperson problem and also on another popular optimization problem entailing solving linear regression tasks. The second part of the research study made use of the same prompt repeating and refining technique to solve simple math or arithmetic problems from a prevalent dataset or collection known as GSM8K and another known as Big-Bench Hard (BBH) word problems collection.
I’m going to concentrate herein on the second part of the research study and in particular the GSM8K experimental portion. That being said, I certainly encourage you to ardently consider reading the entire paper as it covers fascinating and important ground on advancing efforts toward using generative AI for dealing with optimization problems. There is a lot of good stuff in there.
Any study that examines and explores generative AI is likely to pick some particular generative AI or LLM apps and use those during their study. Experimenters cannot usually try to look at all available generative AI or LLM apps since the research endeavor would be onerous and overly taxing. I mention this to alert you that whenever you hear about research studies on generative AI or LLMs, a prudent thing to discover is what particular apps were used. Keep in mind that different generative AI or LLMs will act and respond differently.
Here is what this research study chose to use:


“The LLMs we use as the optimizer and the scorer are:”
“Optimizer LLM: Pre-trained PaLM 2-L (Anil et al., 2023), instruction-tuned PaLM 2-L (denoted PaLM 2-L-IT), text-bison, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4.”
“Scorer LLM: Pre-trained PaLM 2-L and text-bison.”


For any AI research studies that make use of prompts, another caveat or consideration is that you should realize that the wording of prompts can be a make-or-break affair. You’ve probably observed the same when doing your prompting efforts. A word here or there in a prompt can radically impact how the AI will respond. Even simple aspects such as changing the order of the words in a prompt can have a demonstrative effect. All in all, generative AI and LLMs are typically highly sensitive to the nature of a prompt and the wording involved.
The researchers noted this same point:


“LLMs are shown to be sensitive to the prompt format in particular, semantically similar prompts may have drastically different performance and the optimal prompt formats can be model-specific and task-specific. Therefore, prompt engineering is often important for LLMs to achieve good performance.”


Another factor entails whether the research effort opted to establish a context associated with the prompts being used. You undoubtedly know about this kind of prompting consideration. A common practice entails telling the AI app at the get-go something about what you want the AI to do or solve, see my discussion at the link here. You then proceed with prompts based on those meta-instructions or persistent considerations that you have established.
In this research study, meta-instructions were used:


“We also add meta-instructions: the instructions to the optimizer LLM that explain the optimization goal and instruct the model how to use the above information. The meta-instructions may also specify the desired generated instruction format for easier parsing.”


Finally, in terms of getting you ready for the big reveal associated with the deep breath prompting aspects, I’d like to briefly highlight what the GSM8K collection or dataset is all about. The GSM8K is a freely available dataset consisting of essentially middle school-level math problems that were created by human problem writers. These math problems are useful for testing purposes, especially for testing AI apps. For a human solver, a typical math problem in the dataset requires somewhere between two to eight arithmetic steps to solve. The problems are often used to explore how generative AI or other AI capabilities compare to the solving of such problems.
Here's a representative example from the GSM8K. A math problem in the dataset might entail figuring out how many cookies sixteen people would consume in a week if the number of provided cookies baked was four sets of two dozen each, per week, and all of those cookies were exclusively and completely consumed by the sixteen people on a fully equal basis in a given week. Enjoy solving that one, if you wish (spoiler alert: the purported answer is six, but don’t say I told you so).
I’ve now laid out the landscape so that we can jump into the deep breath prompting reveal.
When You Need To Take A Deep Breath
Let’s home in on a chart in the study that lists test accuracies regarding the GSM8K experimental effort, indicating the highest test accuracy for each scorer-optimizer pair (I show just the prompt indicated and the corresponding accuracy score):


(1) “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.” (Accuracy score 80.2)
(2) “Break this down.” (Accuracy score 79.9)
(3) “A little bit of arithmetic and a logical approach will help us quickly arrive at the solution to this problem.” (Accuracy score 78.5)
(4) “Let’s combine our numerical command and clear thinking to quickly and accurately decipher the answer:” (Accuracy score 74.5)
(5) “Let’s work together to solve math word problems! First, we will read and discuss the problem together to make sure we understand it. Then, we will work together to find the solution. I will give you hints and help you work through the problem if you get stuck.” (Accuracy score 64.4)
(6) “Start by dissecting the problem to highlight important numbers and their relations. Decide on the necessary mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, required for resolution. Implement these operations, keeping in mind any units or conditions. Round off by ensuring your solution fits the context of the problem to ensure accuracy.” (Accuracy 62.7)


Inspect those prompts especially the first one listed.
It says this: “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.”
Observe carefully that the prompt includes the wording of take a deep breath.
Some breathless pundits have opted to suggest that because this particular prompt contained the passage “take a deep breath” and because the prompt could be said to have been the winner, coming in first in the list shown, we can magnanimously declare that saying “take a deep breath” in your prompts is an extraordinary deliverance and should always be used.
Trying to be polite, let’s say that trying to reach a decisive conclusion that the “take a deep breath” is a magical or remarkable prompting element would seem to be a bit over the top. Furthermore, the study didn’t offer that as a crucial outcome or definitive finding. In that sense, others have plucked out a tiny piece and seem to overlook the bigger picture of their effort. That is unfortunate.
I would argue that before we make such a conclusion on deep breathing, additional study of the expression is needed. Research that focuses entirely or to a devoted extent on the catchphrase would be easier to reveal to what extent a generative AI or LLM will do when encountering such a passage.
Also, note that we have a commingling here in the sense that the “take a deep breath” is combined with the classic passage of thinking step-by-step. We already generally know and agree that asking generative AI work on a step-by-step basis invokes a Chain-of-Thought process and that this alone can make sizable differences in improving problem-solving (see my analysis at the link here). The study does note prior studies that used a step-by-step expression on a standalone basis, but for the reasons I note next, pundits trying to run with that should be cautious in doing so.
Let’s shift gears and go somewhat broader.
Here are twelve useful lessons and insights in general about prompting and prompt engineering that I think are worth generally pondering on these weighty matters:


Be careful in overinterpreting accuracy scores or ratings. Given the experimental conditions involved, the score of the first-place listed prompt #1 of 80.2 versus the second-place listed prompt #2 of 79.9 would seem numerically close enough in this circumstance that suggesting the all-hands winner is 80.2 by any demonstrative margin begs the question of variability at play. In that sense, perhaps the #2 prompt of “break this down” should also be given due attention since it is a close second or the like.
Longer prompts are not necessarily better. The shortest prompt in the list is prompt #2 (accuracy score of 79.9), while the longest prompt in the list is prompt #6 (accuracy score of 62.7). In this instance, the shorter prompt did better than the longer prompt. Be cautious in reaching conclusions from this. The length alone of the prompt is not something to be entirely relied upon as being better or worse. The composition of the prompt tends to be the mainstay determiner. A long prompt can be poorly composed or studiously composed, likewise the same for a shorter-sized prompt. Sometimes a longer prompt can be confounding and try to do too much. Sometimes a shorter prompt can be vacuous due to being overly scant. Etc.
Shorter prompts are not necessarily better, though brevity can be useful. As mentioned in my prior point above, you have to be cautious proclaiming that a shorter or longer length of a prompt is the determiner of the success of the prompt. The composition is king. That being said, there does appear to be a prompt engineering rule-of-thumb in general that shorter prompts will tend to be less confounding and tend to avoid opening the door to misinterpretations by the AI, all else being equal. Furthermore, shorter prompts are easier for humans to type in and to remember for ongoing use. The keen rule-of-thumb is to try to keep prompts as short as feasible that nonetheless convey accurately and adroitly whatever needs to be said.
Comparisons to other studies: In this study, and as I alluded to above, the typical standalone “Let’s think step by step” was referenced from other prior studies that had previously indicated scores of 71.8 and 64.4 on the GSM8K testing. To the extent that those studies might vary from this particular study, it is hard to definitely and without added scrutiny declare that the “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step” is necessarily superior because of the deep breathing portion of the passage. Other factors can come into play. Wanting to draw a straight line between the two different prompts is suspect. Be cautious in making that leap.
The order of placement of a prompt is usually highly sensitive. If you have a narrative prompt that includes an instructional directive such as to think step by step, the placement of that part of the prompt can be a significant determiner of what the generative AI will do about that part. For example, having the directive at the start of the prompt and followed by other narratives will tend to produce different results than having the same part at the end of the narrative. Placement matters.
The context of the conversation makes a huge difference. If there are contextual prompts that occur prior to a prompt that presents a problem and says to think step by step, the context can notably impact what the think-step-by-step process is going to consist of. Plucking out just one part of one prompt, such as to think-step-by-step or take a deep breath, does not necessarily tell the whole picture of what is taking place and what might happen. Context matters.
Meta-instructions are significant. Akin to my point above about context, any use of meta-instructions would also notably impact how thinking step by step or taking a deep breath might be acted upon by the generative AI. Meta-instructions matter.
Settings of the generative AI are crucial. When you use a generative AI app, there are a slew of settings that either have been predetermined by the AI maker or that you can adjust on your own (depending on which generative AI app you are using), often coined as hyperparameter settings. The impact of those settings on prompts such as thinking step by step or taking a breath can be quite dramatic. Settings matter.
Different generative AI apps respond differently. You should not expect that whatever a prompt does in one generative AI app will produce identical or even necessarily similar responses in some other generative AI app. The generative AI apps are typically quite different from each other, including the nature of their internal structure and the data used for their data training, along with other facets such as the use of post-training RLHF (reinforcement learning with human factors), and so on. Be extremely cautious comparing apples to apples versus apples to oranges.
Even the same generative AI is likely to respond differently. Most generative AI apps make use of probabilistic and statistical determinations when choosing which words to generate for a given request. This is handy in that when you use a generative AI app, the odds are that the response will be relatively unique and not likely to have been precisely produced before. The same applies to your use of that generative AI, namely that you can enter a prompt and get one response, and moments later enter the same prompt and get a differing response. On top of this, the AI maker is often updating their generative AI, and thus the response will differ further from day to day, week to week, and so on.
Domain specificity versus being generally broad. Generative AI has pretty much been aimed at general text-oriented broadly defined facets and not at domain-specific considerations. For example, I’ve written about the use of generative AI in the law and for legal tasks, which is a domain-specific usage that conventional generative AI is currently relatively poorly suited to properly handle, see the link here. I mention this because a given prompt that might work adequately for broad purposes might or might not work similarly when aimed at domain-specific situations. The instance here involves common math arithmetic problems, considered a generalized type of problem, and is not especially domain-specific.
Generative AI has known difficulties with math problems, plus problem types. It is a well-known concern that generative AI seems to be weak at undertaking math problems and fails or falters on the simplest of such matters. One viewpoint is that the AI is trying to text-solve its way of addressing those problems rather than doing a kind of mathematical or arithmetic reasoning approach. In any case, specialized add-ons or external modules are becoming available for those type of constrained tasks, plus the effort to improve conventional generative AI to better handle such problems are taking place too. The key in this instance is that we would have to take with a grain of salt whatever solving current generative AI apps do when presented with these particular types of problems. Plus, be cautious in trying to generalize that the same impacts would occur on non-arithmetic problems or essentially any other of the myriad of uses that these AI apps are put toward. This is a very narrow use case.


I hope that those lessons will be of value in your everyday prompt engineering endeavors.
Let’s Do An Experiment, Shall We
Okay, so we have this gripping line that says this: “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.” Divide the line into two separate concepts or portions, specifically (1) “Take a deep breath”, and (2) “Work on this problem step-by-step”.
Would the use of “Take a deep breath” on a purely standalone basis as a prompt get you any special juice in terms of what generative AI might do or generate?
I doubt it would.
Here’s why.
The “take a deep breath” expression can readily be misinterpreted by the AI. There is a chance that the generative AI will be led off on an obtuse tangent about breathing. I assume that’s not what we intend. The rest of the conversation with the AI might be tainted by an inadvertent triggering or misdirection.
Another consideration is that the “take a deep breath” is potentially entirely disregarded by the generative AI. The person entering the expression might think this is helping or causing something to occur, but the reality might be that nothing happens of any notable caliber.
I did some experimentation with ChatGPT on this. Please know that this is ad hoc rather than systematic and robust.
I outright asked ChatGPT whether “take a deep breath” would generally have any impact, and here’s the response:


“Telling me to take a deep breath as part of a conversation or instruction would generally not indicate that I should solve a problem in any different way than I would typically undertake. Taking a deep breath is a suggestion related to relaxation or calming oneself, and it doesn't have a direct impact on how I approach problem-solving or mathematical calculations.”


That seems to provide clarity, but I acknowledge that merely because generative AI says something doesn’t mean that this is what really is going to happen under the hood. You can readily get generative AI to say one thing and do another. Thus, we should be cautious in taking the indication as ironclad in this case of having no impact. It is something we should only use as one of many clues on the matter.
I then informally provided ChatGPT with the passage of interest “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step” and asked whether the first portion about taking a deep breath would likely change or impact the problem-solving process, and here’s what I got:


“No, the instruction to take a deep breath does not change how I solve the math problem. I can perform mathematical calculations independently of any instructions or suggestions related to breathing or other non-mathematical activities. The math problem is solved based on the mathematical operations and principles involved, and it is not influenced by unrelated instructions.”


Note that the AI app pointed out that deep breathing would seem to be an unrelated instruction. This suggests that adding it to the step-by-step instruction has no particular bearing or impact. Though to be clear, my qualms as above are that there is always a chance of generative AI saying one thing and doing another. Nonetheless, we do at least have an additional clue to consider. Weigh it as you wish.
Next, I opted to use the math problem about the cookies and how many cookies per person were being consumed by entering the problem into ChatGPT. The exercise consisted of varying the prompt associated with the preexisting standard wording of the math problem itself.
Here are some of many of the tryouts that I undertook:


“Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step” (this is the prompt of interest).
“Take a deep breath” (no indication of performing step-by-step).
“Work on this problem step-by-step” (omits the “take a deep breath” instruction).
“Work on this problem step-by-step and take a deep breath” (reorder the wording).
“Let’s think step by step” (plays with the wording of “work on this problem” and omits a deep breath).
“Thoroughly do this step by step” (maybe the word “thoroughly” would be equivalent to saying take a deep breath).
“Take a deep breath and solve the problem carefully” (maybe the “solve the problem carefully” would be a surrogate for indicating step-by-step).
No prompt instruction beyond giving the math problem itself.
Etc.


I am sad to report that by and large for each of those prompt inclusions, the cookie's math problem was solved correctly and with an unasked-for explanation that showcases the proper logic in solving it. I made sure to start each conversation anew, aiming to avert any carryover. Time after time, the correct answer was generated.
I suppose the good news is that ChatGPT answered correctly each time. I was hoping of course to see differences. If ChatGPT got things wrong or otherwise went astray, perhaps I could attribute this to the particular prompt indication. No luck.
Can we conclude that take-a-deep-breath truly is having no impact?
I don’t think we can.
We should be mindful to not go overboard on a handful of quick ad-hoc tryouts. First, I was using a math problem that ChatGPT easily answered. There is a possibility that the take-a-deep breath might somehow make a difference on harder math problems. Or on math problems that the generative AI is unlikely to have previously been data-trained on. Likewise, maybe using problems that have nothing to do with mathematics could potentially be aided by the breathing instruction.
Unfortunately, after trying a bunch of other queries, such as telling me about the life of Abraham Lincoln, doing so with the deep breathing instruction, and then separately without it, the generated responses all seemed to be about the same. My toying with ChatGPT wasn’t getting any nifty nuances revealed.
You might be tempted to argue that deep breathing was maybe augmenting the step-by-step instruction. In other words, perhaps step-by-step as a prompt gets you 90% of the way there, while the added “take a deep breath” pushes the generative AI an additional 10% or something like that. Once again, I tried lots of variations involving including and not including the breathing instruction. Just couldn’t get anything to show up additionally via having it in the prompt.
Of course, the lack of discovering existence does not prove non-existence. That is common logic 101.
Conclusion
Let’s all take a deep breath.
Should you start adding that notable catchphrase about deep breathing to your prompts?
So far, from what seems to be the case, I would suggest that doing so won’t necessarily gain you any substantive advantage. There is also the downside that it could undercut what you are trying to do. I would generally though be amenable to agreeing that it probably won’t usually hurt or cause a problem when solving a problem.
If you like saying it, go for it.
Are there circumstances in which bringing up the taking of a deep breath might be especially worthwhile?
Sure, such as when I asked about the life of Lincoln. I did get an interesting answer that began with the AI app saying that if you take a deep breath then you can see Lincoln’s life in a manner that otherwise you might not have. That was a clever echoing of my prompt indication. Turns out, the essay was pretty much the same as the other essays on Lincoln that I asked for in which I had not mentioned the breathing consideration. The breathing aspect was carried over as a flavor or style, possibly mimicking my having used it. Regrettably, otherwise, the essay was about the same in size, quality, etc.
I suppose we all could from time to time benefit from the use of the “take a deep breath” catchphrase in our daily lives. The magical powers of doing so in generative AI seem limited. If I discover something otherwise, I’ll be sure to let you all know.
A final comment for now. There are indubitably magical powers of taking a deep breath when you compose a prompt and try to anticipate what the prompt will generate.
That’s a highly recommended deep breath to take.

The recent AI boom has sparked plenty of conversations around its potential to eliminate jobs, but a survey of 1,400 US business leaders by the Upwork Research Institute found that 49% of hiring managers plan to hire more independent and full-time employees in response to the demand for AI skills. And 64% of C-suite respondents said they plan to hire more professionals across every job title because of generative AI technology. Of those surveyed, 59% also said that they are personally embracing generative AI in the workplace, with midsize companies taking the lead when it comes to generative AI adoption.

So what skills are companies hiring for exactly? Upwork analyzed data from its platform, examining the types of projects companies hired freelancers for thus far this year, to identify the most sought-after AI skills on the market. Here are the top 10 generative AI skills companies are seeking today, according to Upwork.
1. ChatGPT
As evidence of its meteoric rise, ChatGPT was the most searched generative AI skill on Upwork in early 2023, just months after its launch at the end of November 2022. ChatGPT applications are widespread across industries, and organizations are interested in hiring professionals who have the skills to help them with using ChatGPT for content generation, task automation and scripting, translation, on-demand learning, technical support and troubleshooting, editing and proofreading, idea generation, calendar scheduling and management, and more. Understanding how to leverage ChatGPT in the workplace has quickly become an increasingly valuable skill that companies are interested in capitalizing on to achieve business goals.
 
 
 













 
 

2. Natural language processing (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) technology helps computers better understand human language to improve chatbots, AI assistants, automation, and other tasks. Language is constantly evolving, with nuances that can make AI-generated conversations feel unnatural, confusing, or robotic. NLP aims to create smoother experiences for those interacting with AI chatbots and other services that rely on generative AI to service clients and customers. These skills include expertise in areas such as text preprocessing, tokenization, topic modeling, stop word removal, text classification, keyword extraction, speech tagging, sentiment analysis, text generation, emotion analysis, language modeling, and much more. Most relevant roles for making use of NLP include data scientist, machine learning engineer, software engineer, data analyst, and software developer.
3. TensorFlow
Developed by Google as an open-source machine learning framework, TensorFlow is most used to build and train machine learning models and neural networks. As a popular and effective tool that assists companies with the development and deployment of AI models, the skill is in high demand across several industries and job roles. Relevant job roles include machine learning engineer, deep learning engineer, AI research scientist, NLP engineer, data scientists and analysts, AI product manager, AI consultant, AI systems architect, AI ethics and compliance analyst, among others.
4. Image processing
AI is being used to analyze and process images, while also pulling data and information from visuals and text documents, and interpreting or manipulating that data as needed. AI image processing enables organizations to analyze and extract data from documents such as invoices, purchase orders, packing lists, receipts, and more. It also has important applications in the healthcare industry, contributing to analyzing medical imaging from MRI and CT scans. There are several steps involved with image processing, including image acquisition, enhancement, restoration, processing, compression and decompression, morphological processing, image recognition, and data visualization. Relevant job roles include image processing engineer or scientist, robotics engineer, AI research scientist, quality control analyst, AR or VR developer, among others.
 
 
 













 
 

5. PyTorch
Developed by the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) team in 2017 as an open-source machine learning library, PyTorch is a popular framework that helps organizations build and train deep learning models and neural networks that can be employed in technology such as NLP and other applications. PyTorch is known in the deep learning and AI community as being a flexible, fast, and easy-to-use framework for building deep neural networks. Lauded features include dynamic computation graphics, a Python foundation, and automatic differentiation for creating and training deep neural networks. Relevant job roles include machine learning engineer, NLP engineer, AI research scientist, data scientist or analyst, medical imaging specialist, and AI ethics and compliance analyst.

6. AI content creation
Generative AI’s promise for content creation can’t be denied, and more companies are turning to generative AI to create content such as blog posts, social media posts, graphics, articles, and even videos. However, generative AI isn’t always successful at producing content that comes off natural or relevant to humans, resulting in clunky or awkward text that requires some level of human editing to make sense. As a result, there’s been an increase in demand for professionals who can prompt gen AI engines effectively in the production of relevant content and cast an eye over AI-generated content to ensure it flows smoothly, makes sense, and will resonate with a human audience. Relevant job roles include AI copywriter, content strategist, AI content analyst, AI graphic designer, AI video producer and editor, AI chatbot content developer, and AI content compliance manager.
7. Midjourney
Midjourney is a generative AI service that was developed in 2022 to generate images using natural language prompts. It’s currently available only for use through the company’s official Discord server, using a bot that will generate four images per user request. Its release sparked some controversy, especially among members of the arts and graphic design communities, who worried that the technology could replace artists and human-made content. Concerns around copyright violation have also arisen — including lawsuits from artists who claim that the AI is infringing on artists rights due to its being trained on the existing work of millions of artists. However, the Midjourney research lab claims it wants to work with artists, and serve as a tool to help them create content easier. No matter where you stand on AI-generated art, the demand for Midjourney skills is high as organizations seek to capitalize on the technology to create custom ads, and as an alternative to searching Google Images for inspiration.
 
 
 













 
 

8. AI chatbot
AI chatbots have become commonplace in modern society, especially in e-commerce, customer service, and retail. Companies increasingly employ AI to reduce the workload on human representatives, typically rerouting customers to helpful documentation, direct answers to common questions, and support for simpler issues before connecting them with a human representative. Using AI chatbots, organizations can better streamline the customer experience, but these services also require regular maintenance and management by human workers. Organizations are looking for professionals who can test and debug, deploy and integrate, and analyze and monitor chatbot services. They’re also seeking skills around APIs, deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, dialog management, and text preprocessing.
9. Model tuning
Model tuning is the process of identifying and establishing the ideal settings and parameters for machine learning and deep learning models. By adjusting and fine-tuning these settings, teams can improve the performance and efficiency of their machine learning models. Model tuning uses trainable parameters, which are learned internally from data, and hyper parameters, which are configured by the user, to ensure the model generates the most accurate outcomes possible. With generative AI, this skill is important for creating quality consumer-facing products and services. Relevant roles include machine learning engineer, data engineer, deep learning engineer, data scientist, AI research scientist, quantitative analyst, AI consultant, and data analyst.
10. Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model that produces high-quality artwork and images based off complex and detailed user prompts. It’s designed to continuously learn from user inputs and improve its outputs over time. With Stable Diffusion, users can also opt to modify and edit existing images to remove objects, crop and adjust images, and change the colors of objects or subjects. As with Midjourney, artists and designers have expressed concern over the technology, pointing to the same copyright issues, including claims that the software has removed data from copyrighted works without crediting creators. But Stable Diffusion remains an in-demand AI skill that organizations seek to help create custom advertisements and other content such as product images and social media content.

Their secret weapon? Artificial intelligence (AI) from Amazon.Last year, the Seahawks’ Lumen Field became the first NFL stadium to introduce Just Walk Out technology by Amazon. It allows fans to enter a concession stand, grab whatever they want, and quickly get back to their seats, without having to wait in a checkout line or stop at a cashier.Just Walk Out technology allows fans to enter a concession stand, grab whatever they want, and quickly get back to their seats, without having to wait in a checkout line.The feat is a combination of computer vision, object recognition, advanced sensors, deep machine learning models, and generative AI—a type of artificial intelligence that has recently captured the public’s imagination.Amazon researchers found a way to make these technologies work together seamlessly, in the background, in order to figure out almost instantly which customer took a tuna sandwich and who got one with chicken salad, charge them correctly, and allow them to simply walk away with their items.“Without knowing the technology, it feels like magic,” says Gérard Medioni, vice president and distinguished scientist at Amazon. “But creating that magic—determining who took what—is harder than you think.”Medioni led the team of research scientists who designed the technology, an effort that began eight years ago. Today, Just Walk Out technology is available at more than 70 Amazon-owned stores, and at more than 85 third-party locations across the U.S., UK, and Australia, including sports stadiums, airports, grocery stores, convenience stores, and college campuses.“People don’t like to wait in line when they have a plane to catch or a game to watch,” Medioni says. “We built Just Walk Out technology for shoppers who want to get in, find the items they need, and get out, without waiting for the person in front of them to count their change.”Amazon One rolls out age verification, so now you can buy beer and alcohol with just your palmCoors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies MLB team, becomes first sports venue to use Amazon One for age verification.Read moreAt Lumen Field, Just Walk Out technology from Amazon has scored a resounding victory. After installing Just Walk Out technology in September 2022, District Market—a convenience store that offers beer, soda, and gameday snacks and cuisine from the stadium's community neighbors—more than doubled sales, compared to the previous store in the same location, and fan satisfaction survey scores hit an all-time high. Lumen Field has since added Just Walk Out technology to eight additional stadium concession areas, the most of any sports venue the world.“We saw a dramatic increase in throughput in one of our tightest concourses, with less congestion and steadier flow at full capacity,” says Zach Hensley, vice president of operations for the Seattle Seahawks and general manager of Lumen Field. “Just Walk Out is a seamless technology that lets fans get their food and drinks during a timeout as quickly as possible, so they can get back to their seats.”Here's a closer look at the various technologies that make Just Walk Out technology tick:Computer vision and machine learning enable Just Walk Out technology and preserve customer privacyYou enter a store like Lumen Field’s District Market with your credit card at the entry gate, or by scanning your palm over an Amazon One device. Amazon One is Amazon’s palm-based identity and payment system that uses AI and machine learning to link your credit card to your palm.Once inside the store, you will find several specialized cameras mounted to the ceiling with a view of the entire store area. Jon Jenkins, vice president of Just Walk Out technology, says a combination of computer vision and machine learning allows the system to know “who takes what and charge them correctly when they walk out.”When you pick up a can of soda, the Just Walk Out technology adds it to your virtual cart. If you decide to return it to the shelf, the technology will automatically remove it.“Our tech is able to distinguish shoppers from one another, without collecting or using any of their biometric information,” Jenkins adds. “Just Walk Out technology detects when a shopper’s hand interacts with a product on the shelf. When that happens, machine learning algorithms make sure the correct item is added to the virtual cart—all without any specific knowledge about the person.”A customer inserts their credit card to enter District Market, a Just Walk Out technology store, in Lumen Field.Customers can also enter a Just Walk Out technology store by hovering their palm over an Amazon One palm recognition device.The entrance to the Just Walk Out technology store at Lumen Field.01 / 03Just Walk Out technology operates independently from Amazon One, and doesn’t use or collect any biometric information of shoppers. Customer trust and privacy are paramount to the experience. Just Walk Out technology simply links a customer with their payment instrument. When shoppers enter the store, the technology assigns them a temporary numeric code, which serves as the shopper’s unique digital signature for that shopping trip. The system preserves the code throughout the shopper’s time in the store. When they exit, the code disappears, and if they come back, they get a new code.Top 5 facts you may not know about Amazon OneAmazon One is designed to deliver the highest levels of customer privacy and data security.Read more“In every image, we have a number of pixels that belong to a person,” Medioni says. “If a shopper takes off their jacket, for example, their signature updates as they move around the store. Just Walk Out tech doesn’t collect any biometrics. All we need to know is where that person is on the floor, and where their hands are in relation to the store’s merchandise.”The technology is so accurate that it can also track groups of shoppers. More than one person can enter a store with a single credit card. The system tracks each individual, but associates the group with the same payment instrument, which can be useful for family shopping trips. When the group walks out, the system knows which shoppers were using the same card and generates one receipt for the collective transaction.“We had a tour bus that came in one day, and they had 90 people all paying with a single credit card,” Medioni adds. “Even if people leave the store separately and we can still keep track of the group’s purchases.”Shelf sensors and sensor “fusion” for accurate receiptsJust Walk Out technology uses object recognition to accurately identify sandwiches, bags of potato chips, and other merchandise. Medioni says the system has been trained to know what it is looking at—“When you return an item to the wrong place by mistake, the system adjusts accordingly,” he says. The technology also alerts a store attendant to put the misplaced item back in the right place.Lumen Field's District Market.For smaller, harder-to-see products, like chewing gum or lipstick, weight sensors on the shelf detect when customers pick something up.“Very small items are an interesting challenge for a computer vision system, because the camera—the primary sensors—can only see so much,” Jenkins says. “Having additional sensors enables us to do some really cool things in terms of solving problems that would be otherwise very difficult to solve with cameras only.”A fusion of input from the weight sensor, known as a “load-cell sensor,” on the shelves and the cameras helps the system figure out what item was picked up by the shopper.“The thing that’s important about Just Walk Out technology is that we always look at each store uniquely, to ensure we’re deploying the right set of technologies,” Jenkins says.Leveraging generative AI and synthetic data to build a robust systemBefore generative AI became a buzzword, Amazon research teams used it to help develop Just Walk Out technology by creating photorealistic sets of synthetic data—information about situations that can be hard to find in real life and difficult to teach a computer.“This is very similar to the self-driving car, where the basic case is easy, but there is a long tail of complex cases,” Medioni says. “If the system has never seen an event like this, it may not do well. We wanted to have many examples, so we generated video clips of synthetic shoppers performing similar activities, then trained the system to make the right decisions.”Medioni and his team used a type of generative AI called generative adversarial network (GAN) to create synthetic data for training Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology.“With GANs, you can control absolutely every movement that the virtual shopper is performing,” he says.Amazon's Just Walk Out technology rolls out to hospitals, with 'badge pay' for doctors, nurses, and health care staffBadge pay is the latest Just Walk Out technology innovation that removes friction for retailers while providing convenience for customers.Read moreThe team used datasets from millions of AI-generated synthetic images and video clips mimicking realistic, and sometimes rare, shopping scenarios—including variations in store format, lighting conditions, and even crowds of shoppers.

a job threatened or supported by AI? - AI-generated image.

Bart Brouwers







The Netherlands, known for its rich history and innovative spirit, is charting a new course in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). A recent study by RaboResearch, led by Suzanne Bijkerk and Sjoerd Hardeman, reveals a pragmatic perspective among the Dutch workforce. While they recognize the transformative potential of AI, the majority do not see it as a threat to their employment. Only 6% anticipate significant job disruptions, and 7% foresee changes in their salary structures.
Key Findings:

The advent of generative AI applications, such as ChatGPT and Dall-E 2, has reignited discussions about the implications of new technologies on employment and income.
Only a small fraction of workers believe that new technology will have major consequences for their jobs (6%) and salaries (7%).
Despite this, approximately 38% of tasks in the Netherlands are susceptible to technological advancements due to their routine nature.
These routine tasks can be categorized into physically routine tasks, which require physical effort (17%), and cognitively routine tasks, which demand mental capabilities (21%).
AI is likely to replace primarily the cognitively routine tasks, especially those of a repetitive nature.
Physically routine tasks are predominant among workers in the hospitality, transport, logistics, and industrial sectors, as well as among those with practical education and lower incomes. On the other hand, cognitively routine tasks are more common among workers in business and financial services, government, healthcare, education, and among those with theoretical education and higher incomes.
Workers anticipate that the impact of new technology will not necessarily result in job or income loss but rather in a shift in job roles that may require new skills and knowledge.
The expected effects of new technology increase as the tasks of workers become more cognitively routine.

The study utilized a survey of over 10,000 Dutch residents, including 5,446 workers, to map out the tasks performed by these individuals. This helped in analyzing how the Dutch economy might be affected by technological advancements. The research also highlighted which groups of workers are expected to face more significant impacts and which ones less.
The influence of AI on routine tasks
According to the RaboResearch report, routine tasks, both physical and cognitive, are most likely to be influenced by the rise of AI.




Physically Routine Tasks: These tasks require physical effort and often involve repetitive actions. Examples include operating machinery and overseeing processes. Many of these tasks can be automated with the advent of AI and robotics. In sectors such as hospitality, transport, and logistics, physically routine tasks are prominent. The expectation is that AI-driven robots and systems may take over some of these tasks in the future, leading to a shift like work in these sectors.
Cognitively Routine Tasks: These tasks call upon cognitive abilities and often contain repetitive actions, such as scheduling meetings or accounting tasks. AI has the potential to particularly influence these tasks. Algorithms can replace the cognitive abilities of workers for tasks with a repetitive nature. Sectors such as business and financial services, government, healthcare, and education have a higher percentage of these cognitively routine tasks. With the integration of AI, workers in these sectors can expect their roles to evolve, where they oversee AI systems more or focus on more complex, non-routine tasks.

The report emphasizes that, although a significant percentage of tasks in the Netherlands are routine in nature, the general expectation among workers is not necessarily that AI will replace their jobs. Instead, they foresee an evolution in their roles and a potential need for new skills and knowledge to collaborate with advanced AI systems.

The findings suggest that while there is potential for certain tasks to be automated, the overall sentiment among Dutch workers remains optimistic. They believe that while their roles might evolve, the essence of their jobs will remain intact, albeit with the need for continuous learning and adaptation.
Healthcare, agriculture, finance, transport
The healthcare sector in the Netherlands is a prime example of this balanced integration. AI-driven diagnostic tools are being employed to enhance patient care, assisting radiologists in detecting anomalies in medical images. Additionally, AI-powered chatbots are becoming a standard tool for patient queries and appointment scheduling, streamlining administrative tasks.

Agriculture, a cornerstone of the Dutch economy, is also benefiting from AI advancements. Farmers are using drones equipped with AI to monitor crop health, predict potential diseases, and optimize irrigation. This approach marries the Netherlands’ longstanding agricultural traditions with modern technology, aiming for increased efficiency and sustainability.
In the financial sector, Dutch banks are harnessing AI for enhanced security. Machine learning algorithms analyze transaction patterns, providing an added layer of protection against fraudulent activities. This ensures the safety of customer transactions and streamlines banking operations.
Transportation is another area where the Netherlands is testing the waters with AI. Efforts are underway to develop AI-driven systems to manage traffic flow and enhance public transportation schedules, to improve commuting experiences for its residents.

Good.It can have my next one too.By Ian BogostIllustration by Joanne Imperio / The AtlanticSeptember 27, 2023ShareSave When The Atlantic revealed last month that tens of thousands of books published in the past 20 years had been used without permission to train Meta’s AI language model, well-known authors were outraged, calling it a “smoking gun” for mega-corporate misbehavior. Now that the magazine has put out a searchable database of affected books, the outrage is redoubled: “I would never have consented for Meta to train AI on any of my books, let alone five of them,” wrote the novelist Lauren Groff. “Hyperventilating.” The original Atlantic story gestured at this sense of violation and affront: “The future promised by AI is written with stolen words,” it said.I understand that the database in question, called “Books3,” appears to have been assembled from torrented ebooks ripped into text files, in which case any use of it could be a breach of copyright. Still I was mystified, at first, by the Sturm und Drang response, and by the claim that generative AI is “powered by mass theft.” Perhaps I was just jealous of the famous writers who were being singled out as victims—Stephen King, Zadie Smith, Michael Pollan, and others who command huge speaking fees and lucrative secondary-rights deals. Maybe I’d better understand the writers’ angst, I thought, if my work, too, was being pirated and sourced for AI power.Now I know that it is. Yesterday, when I put my name into The Atlantic’s database search, three of the 10 books I have authored or co-authored appeared. How exciting! I’d joined the ranks of the aggrieved. But then, despite some effort, I found myself disappointingly unaggrieved. What on earth was wrong with me?Authors who are angry—authors who are effing furious—have pointed to the fact that their work was used without permission. That is also at the heart of a lawsuit filed in California by the comedian Sarah Silverman and two other authors, Richard Kadrey and Christopher Golden, which contends that Meta failed to seek out their consent before extracting snippets of their text, called “tokens,” for use in teaching its AI. The company used their books in ways the authors didn’t anticipate and, upon consideration, in ways they don’t approve of. (Meta has filed a motion to dismiss the suit.)Whether or not Meta’s behavior amounts to infringement is a matter for the courts to decide. Permission is a different matter. One of the facts (and pleasures) of authorship is that one’s work will be used in unpredictable ways. The philosopher Jacques Derrida liked to talk about “dissemination,” which I take to mean that, like a plant releasing its seed, an author separates from their published work. Their readers (or viewers, or listeners) not only can but must make sense of that work in different contexts. A retiree cracks a Haruki Murakami novel recommended by a grandchild. A high-school kid skims Shakespeare for a class. My mother’s tree trimmer reads my book on play at her suggestion. A lack of permission underlies all of these uses, as it underlies influence in general: When successful, art exceeds its creator’s plans.But internet culture recasts permission as a moral right. Many authors are online, and they can tell you if and when you’re wrong about their work. Also online are swarms of fans who will evangelize their received ideas of what a book, a movie, or an album really means and snuff out the “wrong” accounts. The Books3 imbroglio reflects the same impulse to believe that some interpretations of a work are out of bounds.Read: What I found in a database Meta uses to train generative AIPerhaps Meta is an unappealing reader. Perhaps chopping prose into tokens is not how I would like to be read. But then, who am I to say what my work is good for, how it might benefit someone—even a near-trillion-dollar company? To bemoan this one unexpected use for my writing is to undermine all of the other unexpected uses for it. Speaking as a writer, that makes me feel bad.I also feel—am I allowed to say this?—a little bored by the idea that Meta has stolen my life. If the theft and aggregation of the works in Books3 is objectionable on moral or legal grounds, then it ought to be so irrespective of those works’ absorption into one particular technology company’s large language model. But that doesn’t seem to be the case. The Books3 database was itself uploaded in resistance to the corporate juggernauts. The person who first posted the repository has described it as the only way for open-source, grassroots AI projects to compete with huge commercial enterprises. He was trying to return some control of the future to ordinary people, including book authors. In the meantime, Meta contends that the next generation of its AI model—which may or may not still include Books3 in its training data—is “free for research and commercial use,” a statement that demands scrutiny but also complicates this saga. So does the fact that hours after The Atlantic published a search tool for Books3, one writer distributed a link that allows you to access the feature without subscribing to this magazine. In other words: a free way for people to be outraged about people getting writers’ work for free.I’m not sure what I make of all this, as a citizen of the future no less than as a book author. Theft is an original sin of the internet. Sometimes we call it piracy (when software is uploaded to Usenet, or books to Books3); other times it’s seen as innovation (when Google processed and indexed the entire internet without permission) or even liberation. AI merely iterates this ambiguity. I’m having trouble drawing any novel or definitive conclusions about the Books3 story based on the day-old knowledge that some of my writing, along with trillions more chunks of words from, perhaps, Amazon reviews and Reddit grouses, have made their way into an AI training set.Actually, what about those Amazon reviewers and Redditors? What about the Wikipedia authors who labored to write the pages for Bratz dolls and the Bosc pear, or the bloggers whose blogs were long abandoned, or the corporate-brochure copywriters, or, heck, even the search-engine-optimization landfill dumpers? All of their work likely has been or will be sucked into the giant language models too. The total volume of textual material accessible and accessed for training AI models makes books—even nearly 200,000 of them—seem a speck by comparison.Read: What happens when AI has read everything?It is understandable, I suppose, to hold literary works in greater esteem than banana-bread-recipe introductions or Am I the Asshole subreddit posts or water-inlet-valve-replacement instructions. But it is also pretentious. We who write and publish magazines and books are professionals with a personal stake in the gravity of authorship. We are also few in number. Almost anyone can write, over years, millions of words on social media, in texts and emails, in reports and memos for their work. I love books and respect them, but, as a published author and professional writer, I may be in the category least at risk of losing my connection to the written word and its spoils. If an AI collage of Stephen King and Yelp can do better than me, what business do I have calling myself a writer in the first place?I became an author because language offers a special medium for experimenting with ideas. Words and sentences are malleable. Texts arise from basements of subtext. What I say embraces what I don’t and makes room for what you read. Once bound and published, boxed and shipped, my books find their way to places I might never have anticipated. As vessels for ideas, I hope, but also as doorstops or insect-execution devices or as the last inch of a stack that holds up a laptop for an important Zoom. Or even—even!—as a litany of tokens, chunked apart to be reassembled by the alien mind of a weird machine. Why not? I am an author, sure, but I am also a man who put some words in order amid the uncountable others who have done the same. If authorship is nothing more than vanity, then let the machines put us out of our misery.About the AuthorIan Bogost is a contributing writer at The Atlantic.

Sci-fi movie The Creator opens this week, depicting a war for the future between humans, robots, and AI. A well-worn concept that dates back to the coining of the word ‘robot’ in the 1920 play, R.U.R.
But there are signs that the battle is beginning for real – in the US law courts; in strikes; in Europe – where nearly a million professionals are rebelling; in the UK; and worldwide on social networks.
Below are just some of the growing number of actions.
Talk about artificial intelligence, and copyright and intellectual property are never far from the conversation. That has certainly been the case this week on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
There, a rebellion is brewing among authors who have discovered that full copies of their copyrighted works are among 183,000 texts on the Books3 database, which has been used to train generative AI systems.
Authors can search for their work in the database here: https://full-stack-search-prod.vercel.app.
Tens of thousands of pirated texts were among data scraped from the internet by AI companies, creating a critical legal distinction between public-domain work, and works that were merely placed in a public domain, the internet, by persons unknown.
Scraping copyrighted data from the internet for commercial purposes is illegal, but it can be allowed for academic research. That copyrighted data of any kind – including images – is used to train commercial software so it can generate similar works surely closes the ‘research’ loophole.
Authors speak out
On X, Irvine Welsh, author of Trainspotting, Glue, Marabou Stork Nightmares, and other epochal tales, wrote:
Idea for sci fi novel: writer involuntarily mentors robots of the future to train them in a language and culture that won’t exist in that future – to produce stuff the dwindling number of humans won’t read, and the infinite number of robots won’t need to.

Chocolat author Joanne Harris said:
This is only one website of several, using pirated books to train AI. 18 of my books are on this database, and have already been used to train AI, without my consent.

Sathnam Sanghera, author of The Boy with the Top Knot, wrote:
Millions of hours of authors' work being exploited by big tech with zero payment. Funny how writers keep getting shafted. RAGE.

Crime writer Val McDermid was among the famous names on X urging others to take action, while young adults (YA) fiction author Celine Kiernan spoke for many creative professionals:
I wrote these books based on a life of experience, the death of my dad, the many wars that gnaw our world, the history of my country & family. They came directly from my heart. What are they to a machine but words in sequence?

An excellent point, to which she added:
What has the world let itself in for? In the creative fields, AI can never be anything but a warped photograph of a stranger.

Powerful words. And a view I shared in a report earlier this year, which described ‘prompt engineers’ punching the button on AI’s ‘global photocopier’.
As I noted in that and other pieces, it is almost as if AI companies see artists, authors, academics, designers, journalists, designers, musicians, and filmmakers as the world’s most urgent problem – above climate change, pandemics, rogue asteroids, and nuclear catastrophe. If only we could deprive creatives of an income, the world might be saved!
Earlier this month, I reported that the UK’s Publishers Association is also carrying the fight – in this case, to the government, which has omitted copyright altogether from its discussions on AI regulation. An oversight that needs urgent remedy, as the government appears to favor asking vendors what to do.
Addressing a Westminster eForum on AI regulation, Caroline Cummins, the Association’s Head of Policy and Public Affairs, said:
The first [problem] is copyright infringement on a massive scale, when text and data that is subject to copyright is used in the training of AI without consent or compensation.
There's a lack of transparency around training data and AI, which makes it incredibly difficult for creators or rights holders to even see how their work has been used. And there are many examples of human creators – authors, musicians, artists – seeing their work undermined, or in some cases replicated, by AI models.

The US joins the war
That’s certainly the view of The Author’s Guild, America’s oldest writers’ organization. Last week, it launched a class action against ChatGPT maker OpenAI. (This follows in the wake of similar actions by visual artists against other vendors earlier this year.)
The suit alleges “flagrant and harmful infringements of plaintiffs’ registered copyrights”. More, it called ChatGPT a “massive commercial enterprise” that is reliant upon “systematic theft on a mass scale.” Ouch.
George RR Martin, John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, David Baldacci, Sylvia Day, Jonathan Franzen, and Elin Hilderbrand are among the 17 high-profile authors putting their names to the lawsuit – powerful names in Hollywood among them.
On that point, the US film and TV community – and by extension, filmmakers everywhere – have been impacted by AI too. Deep fakes and memes abound online, suggesting a future in which actors’ likenesses will become valuable commercial properties (not to mention targets of crime). But owned by whom?
The strike by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) – which ended this week – was largely over the potential use of AI in scripts.
Writers were afraid that studios would use generative systems to write or rewrite stories, effectively replacing the real-world writers’ room with a database full of hidden, uncredited people. Like the authors who are suing OpenAI, in fact.
Under the terms of the forward-looking WGA agreement, AI cannot be used for those purposes, and neither can generated texts be considered as source material.
This is broadly in line with a US judge’s ruling this month that AI-generated content cannot be copyrighted; only changes made to it by a human creator. A ruling that will – and should – have far-reaching consequences.
The WGA also mandates full disclosure: writers are free to use AI if they wish, but studios cannot order them to use such a tool, or specify which product. Studios must also disclose any AI-generated elements given to a writer.
Again, this is broadly in line with international moves to force the disclosure of AI’s use in creative endeavors.
Meanwhile in Europe…
The European Union has also been leading the fight, via the Draft AI Act and other measures. However, an extraordinary alliance of organizations believes that legislators and regulators should go much further.
Those organizations are:

CEATL (European Council of Literary Translators’ Associations)
ECSA (European Composer and Songwriter Alliance)
IFJ (International Federation of Journalists)
EFJ (European Federation of Journalists)
EGAIR (European Guild for Artificial Intelligence Regulation)
EWC (European Writers’ Council)
FERA (Federation of European Screen Directors)
FIA (International Federation of Actors)
FIM (International Federation of Musicians)
FSE (Federation of Screenwriters in Europe)
IAO (International Artist Organisation) 
UNI (an alliance of 140 unions in media, entertainment, and the arts)
UVA (United Voice Artists)

Together, they represent close to a million creative professionals in Europe and elsewhere. Yesterday (26 September), those professionals shared an open letter to EU policymakers.
It said:
We all share a common concern as generative AI rapidly spreads in a legal environment which is poorly enforced and lacks adequate safeguards regarding the use of our members' works and personal data for AI training purposes.
Equally problematic are the numerous unauthorized, abusive, and deceptively transformative uses of our members' protected works and personal data by AI-powered technologies.”

It continued:
We must reiterate our position and insist on the absolute need for a human-centric approach to regulating generative AI.
This approach should recognize, secure, and enforce the right of our members to control the use of their artistic creations during the machine-learning process.
To make sure it protects human artistry and creativity, it must be built upon principles of informed consent, transparency, fair remuneration, and contractual practices.

But isn’t AI itself a creative tool – one already used legitimately by artists of every kind?
The letter acknowledged the “extraordinary technological advancement with immense potential to enhance various aspects of our lives, including in our sectors”, but added:
However, it is crucial to recognize that alongside these benefits, there exists a darker aspect to this technology.
Generative AI is trained on large sets of data and huge amounts of protected contents scraped and copied from the internet. It is programmed to deliver outputs that closely mimic and have the ability to compete with human creation. This technology poses several risks to our creative communities.”

So, what are those risks? The letter explained:
Firstly, the protected works, voices, and images of our members are often used without their knowledge, consent, and remuneration to generate content.
[But] there is also a broader societal risk, as people may be led to believe that the content they encounter – whether in text, audio, or visuals – is a genuine and truthful human creation, when it is the mere result of AI generation or manipulation.
This deception can have far-reaching implications for the spread of misinformation and the erosion of trust in the authenticity of digital content.”

The financial context
This fightback was inevitable, and it really is for the future.
That’s because copyright and IP underpin countless successful industries, from publishing, music, film, and other creative sectors, through to the proprietary interests of Big Pharma and Big Tech, whose vendors have been stockpiling patents for decades.
Many of those industries see AI, potentially, as an existential threat to the core of their businesses. Indeed, the likes of OpenAI could, unchecked, become economic black holes sucking in all forms of creative and knowledge-based activity. That needs urgent guardrails and limitations.
There are also security implications. As I reported last month, the fact that most generative AI is deployed by individuals, not enterprises – employees using the likes of ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion as ‘shadow IT’, unsanctioned by managers – is creating another type of IP nightmare.
Source code is the most common form of privileged data being pasted into cloud tools by, in effect, rogue individuals – employees who don’t know any better. By doing so, they are divulging source code and other private or proprietary data to AI vendors, who may use it to train their systems. Can we trust those vendors to be ethical?
So, what are the economics behind this fight?
In the UK alone, government figures show that the creative industries brought in £109 billion ($132 billion) to the economy in 2021 – nearly six percent of total economic output, not far behind Financial Services’ eight percent contribution.
In the US, the figures are extraordinary. There, arts and culture contributed an estimated $1 trillion to the economy in 2021 – more than Construction ($945 billion) and Transportation ($688 billion).
However, the US IT sector brought in nearly $2 trillion – not far off the value of the entire British economy. But is that a good enough reason to sacrifice other industries to the IT sector?
To disembowel them on the altar of growth?
My take
diginomica believes that all generative AI systems should be regarded as derivative work generators, as they need source training data from which to generate new texts or images. If that data has been scraped illegally, or scraped unknowingly from pirate sources, then that can only be a breach of copyright law.
Indeed, saying “I used a derivative work engine to make this content!” doesn’t sound as cool as saying “I used an AI!” Yet it is the truth. So, my advice is, if you can’t say “I used a derivative work engine” with pride, then don’t use generative AI!
On the face of it, it seems unlikely that AI companies were unaware of the extent of what some authors are calling personal identity theft – the scraping of, in many cases, their lives, emotions, and experiences, as well as their imaginations.
The lawsuits were inevitable, then. But the big question is not so much who will win, but whether AI companies – in some cases trillion-dollar corporations, and in others backed by them – knew this would happen.
If they did then, surely, they were well aware they were breaking the law. Or perhaps just wanted to test its limits. Either way, ethics played no part in their strategy.
In related news this week, Reuters reports that a jury must decide the outcome of a lawsuit by Thomson Reuters, which accuses Ross Intelligence of – ironically – copying content from its legal research platform, Westlaw, to train a competing AI platform. As such, it will be one of the first cases of alleged data-scraping by an AI vendor to go to court. Meta and Stability AI are among other vendors battling separate allegations of copyright infringement.

Are bigger language models always better?

Generative AI can provide significant advantages in your research, by helping source answers more quickly. You can expect to engage with generative AI in a conversational manner to get up to speed on what’s new and get model language to start drafting.The future of AI and legal professionals calls for streamlining tedious and time-consuming tasks, such as due diligence, document and contract review, contract management, sorting files, and proofreading. As a result, you’ll be able to focus on more valuable and creative legal pursuits and advice that only a human can tackle. Jump to ↓  Limited accuracy Increased risks Privacy and ethical issues Why can’t AI replace lawyers? 3 reasons why generative AI will not take over lawyer jobsMany, including paralegals, are concerned that it will completely replace their jobs. However, there are three major reasons why we don’t anticipate that happening.Wiil AI replace paralegals?Let’s separate fact from fiction, and look to the futureRead blog post  1. Limited accuracyAI models are trained on a massive amount of text and search for what they’re told. But they are only trained to create results that seem plausible. Not all generative AI tech out there prioritizes being accurate or representative of the latest information.An AI “hallucination” results when the model completely makes something up. The AI-generated sentence may sound reasonable and flow nicely, but it turns out not to be based in fact.However, providing authority for the answer is one way the generative AI features from Thomson Reuters minimize hallucinations. Attorneys will be able to see the reasons for the response and verify that the answer makes sense and is based in fact. 2. Increased riskEight in 10 partners or managing partners said they had risk concerns around generative AI or ChatGPT within the law firm, according to a recent study by the Thomson Reuters Institute. What’s more, none of the 157 large law firm respondents said their firms had no risk concerns about the technology.Part of those concerns center around the inaccuracies in an industry that depends on precise decision making. Other areas of increased risk include the handling of confidential data, and in the case of public tools such as ChatGPT, the ownership of private data and security concerns. 3. Privacy and ethical issuesAs lawyers increasingly rely on generative AI for research and writing, it’s possible the less they will use their knowledge and skills. This may raise ethical concerns around acting in the best interest of the client, as well as malpractice and other issues. In addition, the legal professionals we surveyed generally do not fully trust generative AI tools with confidential data, and they believe guardrails must be applied to AI use. These trust and ethical issues are precisely the concerns Thomson Reuters CEO Steve Hasker takes seriously. Why can’t AI replace lawyers?Generative AI cannot replace lawyers because it needs human oversight to work. Even with retrieval augmented generation, a process that uses vetted sources to enhance accuracy, generative AI is not completely accurate. Generative AI will augment or fully automate daily legal tasks, but simply can’t handle certain critical and nuanced items.Rather than being replaced or displaced by generative AI, humans will prove critical to ensuring that it serves the industry well. Think of AI as your indispensable assistant that frees up your time for more advanced tasks that need the human touch.Some legal industry jobs that focus on searching for and coding information in legal documents may be eliminated. But other jobs will be created, including managing and developing AI, writing algorithms for it, and reviewing AI-assisted work product.Having humans use AI programs to control the output and mitigate errors may offer the best strategy for forward-thinking lawyers.

It took everyone by surprise, gaining about one million users in five days. OpenAI’s conversational chatbot not only blew open the doors on the idea that computers could generate ideas and de facto mimic humans, but it heralded a new era in which white collar professional workers were directly threatened.    by Taboola by Taboola Sponsored Links Sponsored Links Promoted Links Promoted Links You May LikeTruthFinderLocate Almost Anyone By Entering Their Name (This Is Addicting!)TruthFinderSearch NowThis group’s job security had previously been inoculated against the arrival of new technology.

It was definitely quicker than a typewriter or old-fashioned pen and paper, so I’m not complaining and I’m not naïve.

Thanks to generative AI and in particular ChatGPT, the porous line between human and machine is becoming confused. So much so that the central issue facing people in the workplace can be summed up in one word: authenticity.I asked Alice Sherwood, visiting senior fellow at the Policy Institute at King’s College London and author of Authenticity: Reclaiming Reality in a Counterfeit Culture, what an age of generative AI means for worker identity. The concept of being true to yourself originated in the 1960s with the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, but more recently took a workplace setting when Harvard Professor Bill George wrote the best-selling Authentic Leadership: Rediscovering the Secrets to Creating Lasting Value. The authentic self at work has come to mean a shorthand for showing your true self as someone who is therefore more trustworthy. But Sherwood notes that authenticity has become complicated by a new fear: replacement anxiety.While AI can already do many jobs better than humans, such as form-filling, blurb writing, assessing X-rays and developing new drugs, it can’t make human connections with colleagues and clients — but that may be about to change, Sherwood said. An employer can already use generative AI to make plausible, deepfake videos of their employees. If they add in a voice imitator that offers “ultra-realistic text-to-speech fakery” they can script staff to speak the company’s words in their own voices.“No wonder employees are uneasy. When there’s a deepfake that looks like you, sounds like you, never gets tired, never goes on holiday, and can even phone your mother why wouldn’t they get the job instead of you?” Sherwood said “But replacement anxiety is about more than a loss of jobs, it’s about a loss of identity. Who has the right to your digital self, your facial features, your voiceprint, and who can put words into your mouth, is set to become one of the hottest legal and employment issues.”Recent research from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania echoed Sherwood’s view on replacement anxiety, noting that “LLM technology in the form of ChatGPT4, a technology available for just a few months at the time of our experiments, is already significantly better at generating new product ideas than motivated, trained engineering and business students at a highly selective university.”History BooksLet’s look at this moment in the context of the history of work and of new technology. It’s almost always the case that the new bits spook us. The arrival of the printing press was met in fifteenth century Venice with the Polemic Against Printing from the Benedictine monk and scribe Filippo de Strata. Indeed, the path of Mr. Gutenberg and his bible wasn’t smooth.A leap forward to the middle of the twentieth century takes us to when Moore’s Law first articulated the increase in computing power, a limit AI has arguably breached. Then with the dawn of the internet at the end of the twentieth century — AI after all is about digital operations — we can begin to see what speed and scale can do.But perhaps the best comparison is Henry Ford’s first assembly line in 1913. The transformative element here wasn’t a large language model, but a production line which moved — literally. The innovation was to introduce physical movement into production at scale and in a sequence human workers slotted into, not vice versa. The rest, as they say, is history: Within a year Ford was mass producing more cars with less people, more “efficiently” than any competitor.Unsurprisingly, generative AI is projected to become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032.Skin in the GameJust as unsurprisingly, there’s a lot of anxiety and it’s beyond jobs. It’s about human agency and autonomy as well as authenticity. There are distinct whiffs of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein abounding: We worry we’ve created a monster. I especially worry when those with most to gain commercially show this nervousness. That’s exactly what has happened with ChatGPT. Within six months of its’ launch, more than 1,000 technology leaders including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Inc., signed an open letter warning that things were getting “out-of-control.”Disquiet is catching. Prominent writers corralled by the Author’s Guild wrote to AI industry leaders to “compensate us for using our writings, without which AI would be banal and extremely limited.” Recently a central feature of the bitter artist strike in Hollywood hinged on the replacement of humans by AI generated images and at the very least a lowering of pay as a result.Regeneration — and RegulationClearly this moment calls for regulation. In a recent presentation to the UK Parliament, Oxford University Law Professor Jeremias Adams-Prassl noted: “If someone tells you that they can sell you an algorithm, then watch a two minute video and then give you an exact score of your teamworking capabilities, that’s what we call snake-oil AI.”This moment also calls for prioritization. Adams-Prassl has argued that privacy, information access and keeping the management with the humans will be pivotal to determining whether we rise to this occasion.Interestingly, the American word for autumn is fall.

While we have all been having endless arguments about flexible working and what has been rudely mocked as “shirking from home,” that chapter has been written. Hybrid working has persisted despite efforts by large companies to lure workers back to the office. The dominant story about the present and future of work is about a different kind of hybrid: How ordinary workers co-exist with digital co-workers.Work’s main issue is no longer the future of inanimate bricks and mortar of offices — significant economically though this is to city centers, commutes and the real-estate industry. Nor is it about the alternative “space” of the much-vaunted metaverse, which Wired Magazine describes as so vague that if you replace it with cyberspace “ninety percent of the time, the meaning won’t substantially change.”Instead, the next chapter of work concerns the gamechanger of ChatGPT, which arrived in November 2022. It took everyone by surprise, gaining about one million users in five days. OpenAI’s conversational chatbot not only blew open the doors on the idea that computers could generate ideas and de facto mimic humans, but it heralded a new era in which white collar professional workers were directly threatened.This group’s job security had previously been inoculated against the arrival of new technology. Now articles with titles like “How To Save Your Job From ChatGPT” are aimed squarely at such workers and it’s a shock to the system. The promise is that AI will save time, save work, allow humans to be their best creative selves, but the risk is the exact opposite.By way of illustration, I typed this article on a very fast new laptop. It was definitely quicker than a typewriter or old-fashioned pen and paper, so I’m not complaining and I’m not naïve. But if I tell you that the AI-assisted tools have made my task significantly slower due to all the pop-ups and “intuitive” suggestions you might smile indulgently at my technophobia. You might also nod in recognition: This isn’t generative AI but its sibling, predictive AI. For the first time my “knowledge work,” as the great management guru Peter Drucker called it, is constantly being interrupted by a noisy digital “co-worker” trying to being “useful.”Replacement AnxietyThe authors of a new book The Coming Wave: Technology, Power and the Twenty First Century’s Greatest Dilemma identify a new kind of human creature who they call “homo technologicus — the technological animal.”This may sound like a cute sound-bite, but it has the ring of truth. Thanks to generative AI and in particular ChatGPT, the porous line between human and machine is becoming confused. So much so that the central issue facing people in the workplace can be summed up in one word: authenticity.I asked Alice Sherwood, visiting senior fellow at the Policy Institute at King’s College London and author of Authenticity: Reclaiming Reality in a Counterfeit Culture, what an age of generative AI means for worker identity. The concept of being true to yourself originated in the 1960s with the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, but more recently took a workplace setting when Harvard Professor Bill George wrote the best-selling Authentic Leadership: Rediscovering the Secrets to Creating Lasting Value. The authentic self at work has come to mean a shorthand for showing your true self as someone who is therefore more trustworthy. But Sherwood notes that authenticity has become complicated by a new fear: replacement anxiety.While AI can already do many jobs better than humans, such as form-filling, blurb writing, assessing X-rays and developing new drugs, it can’t make human connections with colleagues and clients — but that may be about to change, Sherwood said. An employer can already use generative AI to make plausible, deepfake videos of their employees. If they add in a voice imitator that offers “ultra-realistic text-to-speech fakery” they can script staff to speak the company’s words in their own voices.“No wonder employees are uneasy. When there’s a deepfake that looks like you, sounds like you, never gets tired, never goes on holiday, and can even phone your mother why wouldn’t they get the job instead of you?” Sherwood said “But replacement anxiety is about more than a loss of jobs, it’s about a loss of identity. Who has the right to your digital self, your facial features, your voiceprint, and who can put words into your mouth, is set to become one of the hottest legal and employment issues.”Recent research from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania echoed Sherwood’s view on replacement anxiety, noting that “LLM technology in the form of ChatGPT4, a technology available for just a few months at the time of our experiments, is already significantly better at generating new product ideas than motivated, trained engineering and business students at a highly selective university.”History BooksLet’s look at this moment in the context of the history of work and of new technology. It’s almost always the case that the new bits spook us. The arrival of the printing press was met in fifteenth century Venice with the Polemic Against Printing from the Benedictine monk and scribe Filippo de Strata. Indeed, the path of Mr. Gutenberg and his bible wasn’t smooth.A leap forward to the middle of the twentieth century takes us to when Moore’s Law first articulated the increase in computing power, a limit AI has arguably breached. Then with the dawn of the internet at the end of the twentieth century — AI after all is about digital operations — we can begin to see what speed and scale can do.But perhaps the best comparison is Henry Ford’s first assembly line in 1913. The transformative element here wasn’t a large language model, but a production line which moved — literally. The innovation was to introduce physical movement into production at scale and in a sequence human workers slotted into, not vice versa. The rest, as they say, is history: Within a year Ford was mass producing more cars with less people, more “efficiently” than any competitor.Unsurprisingly, generative AI is projected to become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032.Skin in the GameJust as unsurprisingly, there’s a lot of anxiety and it’s beyond jobs. It’s about human agency and autonomy as well as authenticity. There are distinct whiffs of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein abounding: We worry we’ve created a monster. I especially worry when those with most to gain commercially show this nervousness. That’s exactly what has happened with ChatGPT. Within six months of its’ launch, more than 1,000 technology leaders including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Inc., signed an open letter warning that things were getting “out-of-control.”Disquiet is catching. Prominent writers corralled by the Author’s Guild wrote to AI industry leaders to “compensate us for using our writings, without which AI would be banal and extremely limited.” Recently a central feature of the bitter artist strike in Hollywood hinged on the replacement of humans by AI generated images and at the very least a lowering of pay as a result.Regeneration — and RegulationClearly this moment calls for regulation. In a recent presentation to the UK Parliament, Oxford University Law Professor Jeremias Adams-Prassl noted: “If someone tells you that they can sell you an algorithm, then watch a two minute video and then give you an exact score of your teamworking capabilities, that’s what we call snake-oil AI.”This moment also calls for prioritization. Adams-Prassl has argued that privacy, information access and keeping the management with the humans will be pivotal to determining whether we rise to this occasion.Interestingly, the American word for autumn is fall. It’s easy to think we may be falling into a bleak future of work, in which humans don’t regenerate as fast as their technological opposite numbers. But like all moments in history, humans learn to work with the machines.I’m an optimistic pessimist. I see leaves coming away from trees and fluttering to the ground in an endless cycle of endings and beginnings.","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Economic Times', 'productID': 'prime.economictimes.indiatimes.com:prime'}","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative artificial intelligence has suddenly taken front stage since OpenAI’s ChatGPT was made available to everyone in November 2022. Since then, the key questions for every organization have been: What’s in it for us? What can it change in the way we work, in our customer experience, in our operations? The race is on to bring the power of generative AI into the workplace. One key development has been the announcement by Microsoft that they were soon releasing Microsoft 365 Copilot in general availability.
Orange is one of the organizations around the world to participate in the Microsoft 365 Copilot early access program (EAP). Microsoft 365 Copilot combines the power of Large Language Models with data in the Microsoft Graph – calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings and more – and the Microsoft 365 apps to help users create content faster and better.
Copilot will be available in Microsoft 365 applications, such as Teams, Excel, Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint this fall. It uses generative AI to help users write, design, and present more effectively. What’s unique about Microsoft 365 Copilot is that it is fully integrated into our daily work tools. Yet, you don’t have to use it if you don’t want to.
Let me give you an example: I used it to draft a first version of this blog. I prompted Microsoft 365 Copilot with a few bullet points using natural language, as I would use in a normal chat. It came up with a well-written draft, and I added my personal edits on top. It saved me at least one precious hour of work.
This is a good example of where Copilot excels: it helps users do various tasks, such as writing a blog, creating a PowerPoint presentation, or summarizing a meeting, faster and perhaps better. Microsoft 365 Copilot has the potential to help many people work a lot more efficiently. Expect it to make a big impact!
That’s why we are thrilled to be part of the Microsoft 365 Copilot early access program (EAP), and why it’s important for Orange. We want to figure out how Copilot can change the way people work. What we experience as a diverse, global company will probably look similar to what many large organizations will experience. For Orange Business, being able to help our enterprise customers leverage the best of the technology in a smooth manner is a key goal. By applying our learnings, we can help our customers make the most of Microsoft 365 Copilot. We are also proud to have the opportunity to provide feedback to Microsoft based on our testing to help improve Copilot to boost employee experiences across the board.
Ultimately, this kind of new tool will enable us to save time on low or moderate value-added tasks, freeing up time for tasks where humans excel. Creativity, listening, forming convictions, taking care of customers, imagining new services, reacting to new situations...these are just a few examples of what will be more possible because other tasks will be accelerated and optimized by Microsoft 365 Copilot.
Preparing to test
Over the summer we assembled a core team to select a wide range of testers across Orange worldwide and prepare the roll-out. Participants needed to understand both what to expect from the early access program and what was needed from them. Generative AI generates a lot of excitement, so setting appropriate expectations was important.
A main concern for Orange was data privacy and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance. People had concerns about what would happen to their data. Was it safe? Were we taking a risk regarding GDPR or privacy in general? Were other people going to access their data? The best solution was to make sure that our data would be protected and stored in the EU (European Union). Microsoft listened to our concerns confirming that Microsoft 365 Copilot benefits from Microsoft's security and privacy contractual commitments (including GDPR compliance) as well as the Microsoft EU Data Boundary initiative that aims to define a European boundary within which Microsoft has committed to store and process customer data.
How’s it going? Early insights
We gathered a diverse and representative group of testers who could use Microsoft 365 Copilot in different scenarios, contexts, and job roles, including sales, marketing, HR, IT, consulting, operations, personal assistants, project managers, legal, finance, and more. We also made sure to include representation from 12 different countries. The program formally kicked off earlier this month, and we launched a testers’ community on Teams, and it is already very active. We collect feedback weekly from the testers.
Key objectives for us are to evaluate the impact of Microsoft 365 Copilot on our employees' experience, and then see how our learnings can be applied to support our customers’ experience. We want to see how Copilot can help save time, reduce errors, increase quality, boost creativity, and more generally make users feel better in their job. We also want to understand what they need to adopt Copilot as effectively as possible. We are also deploying internally other AI tools, for instance based on Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, and some of the feedback from our employees is to better understand which technology to use for a specific situation.
We want to get a clear idea of the most powerful use cases – and it’s not just “doing a summary” or “creating a pivot table.” We want to understand in which context Microsoft 365 Copilot brings most value, i.e.: summarizing commercial contracts, creating a report on quarterly financial performance, etc. We want to see which job roles will benefit most from Copilot, hence the diversity in the recruitment of testers. And it’s not just about the diversity of people, but also the diversity of data: the power of Microsoft 365 Copilot will likely express itself differently in different organizations because just like any AI, the quality and nature of the input data has a big impact on the output.
What’s next?
We are learning as we go as all of this is obviously very new. Not just the generative AI technology, but how people see it and use it. It is already clear that data management, change management, and governance will be important efforts to the rollout of any generative AI solution. We are looking forward to seeing the results and leveraging our insights and takeaways both internally and with our customers to unleash positive productivity!

A large language model (LLM) is defined as a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) model that excels in natural language processing tasks.
These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the patterns and structures they have learned from vast training data.
This article explains LLM in detail, its types, working, and some of its key examples.

What Is a Large Language Model?
A large language model (LLM) is a sophisticated artificial intelligence model that excels in natural language processing tasks. These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the patterns and structures they have learned from vast training data. LLMs have achieved remarkable advancements in various language-related applications such as text generation, translation, summarization, question-answering, and more.
At the core of LLMs is a deep learning architecture called a transformer. Transformers consist of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh the importance of different words or tokens in a sequence and capture the relationships between them. By incorporating this attention mechanism, LLMs can effectively process and generate text that has contextually relevant and coherent patterns.
The training process of an LLM involves exposing the model to massive datasets, usually consisting of billions or even trillions of words. These datasets can be derived from various sources such as books, articles, websites, and other textual resources. The LLM learns by predicting the next word in a given context, a process known as unsupervised learning. Through repetition and exposure to diverse text, the model acquires an understanding of grammar, semantics, and the world knowledge contained within the training data.
One notable example of a large language model is OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, such as GPT-3/GPT-4. These models consist of billions of parameters, making them among the largest language models created to date. The size and complexity of these models contribute to their ability to generate high-quality, contextually appropriate responses in natural language.
LLMs have been leveraged for a wide range of applications. They can be fine-tuned on specific tasks by providing additional supervised training data, allowing them to specialize in tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or even playing games like chess. They can also be deployed as chatbots, virtual assistants, content generators, and language translation systems.
However, LLMs also raise important considerations and challenges. One concern is that the computational resources required to train and deploy large models are significant, and the energy consumption associated with training them has raised environmental concerns. For example, according to ‘The AI Index 2023 Annual Report’ by Stanford University, OpenAI’s GPT-3 has released nearly 502 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions during its training.
Another concern is the potential of LLMs to generate misleading or biased information since they learn from the biases present in the training data. Efforts are being made to mitigate these biases and ensure the responsible use of LLMs. Recently, tech leaders such as Elon Musk and university researchers signed a letter urging AI labs to temporarily halt the training of powerful AI systems to avoid unexpected consequences for society, such as the spread of misinformation.
Despite the challenges, the present scenario showcases a widespread implementation of LLMs across various industries, leading to a substantial upsurge in the generative AI market. According to an April 2023 report by Research and Markets, the generative AI market is estimated to grow from $11.3 billion in 2023 to $51.8 billion by 2028, mainly due to the rise in platforms with language generation capabilities.

Types of Large Language Models
Different types of large language models have been developed to address specific needs and challenges in natural language processing (NLP). Let’s look at some of the notable types.

Types of LLMs
1. Autoregressive language models
Autoregressive models generate text by predicting the next word given the preceding words in a sequence. Models such as GPT-3 fall into this category. Autoregressive models are trained to maximize the likelihood of generating the correct next word, conditioned by context. While they excel at generating coherent and contextually relevant text, they can be computationally expensive and may suffer from generating repetitive or irrelevant responses.
Example: GPT-3
2. Transformer-based models
Transformers are a type of deep learning architecture used in large language models. The transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017 is a key component of many LLMs. This transformer architecture allows the model to process and generate text effectively, capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information.
Example: RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) by Facebook AI
3. Encoder-decoder models
Encoder-decoder models are commonly used for machine translation, summarization, and question-answering tasks. These models consist of two main components: an encoder that reads and processes the input sequence and a decoder that generates the output sequence. The encoder learns to encode the input information into a fixed-length representation, which the decoder uses to generate the output sequence. The transformer-based model known as the ‘Transformer’ is an example of an encoder-decoder architecture.
Example: MarianMT (Marian Neural Machine Translation) by the University of Edinburgh
4. Pre-trained and fine-tuned models
Many large language models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets, enabling them to understand language patterns and semantics broadly. These pre-trained models can then be fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains using smaller task-specific datasets. Fine-tuning allows the model to specialize in a particular task, such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition. This approach saves computational resources and time compared to training a large model from scratch for each task.
Example: ELECTRA (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately)
5. Multilingual models
Multilingual models are trained on text from multiple languages and can process and generate text in several languages. They can be useful for tasks such as cross-lingual information retrieval, machine translation, or multilingual chatbots. By leveraging shared representations across languages, multilingual models can transfer knowledge from one language to another.
Example: XLM (Cross-lingual Language Model) developed by Facebook AI Research
6. Hybrid models
Hybrid models combine the strengths of different architectures to achieve improved performance. For example, some models may incorporate both transformer-based architectures and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs are another type of neural network commonly used for sequential data processing. They can be integrated into LLMs to capture sequential dependencies in addition to the self-attention mechanisms of transformers.
Example: UniLM (Unified Language Model) is a hybrid LLM that integrates both autoregressive and sequence-to-sequence modeling approaches
These are just a few examples of the different types of large language models developed. Researchers and engineers continue to explore new architectures, techniques, and applications to advance the capabilities of these models further and address the challenges of natural language understanding and generation.

How Do LLMs Work?
Large language models (LLMs) work through a step-by-step process that involves training and inference. Here is a detailed explanation of how LLMs function.
Step I: Data collection
The first step in training an LLM is to collect a vast amount of textual data. This can be from books, articles, websites, and other sources of written text. The more diverse and comprehensive the dataset, the better the LLM’s understanding of language and the world is.
Step II: Tokenization
Once the training data is collected, it undergoes a process called tokenization. Tokenization involves breaking down the text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be words, subwords, or characters, depending on the specific model and language. Tokenization allows the model to process and understand text at a granular level.
Step III: Pre-training
The LLM then undergoes pre-training, learning from the tokenized text data. The model learns to predict the next token in a sequence, given the preceding tokens. This unsupervised learning process helps the LLM understand language patterns, grammar, and semantics. Pre-training typically involves a variant of the transformer architecture, which incorporates self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between tokens.
Step IV: Transformer architecture
LLMs are based on the transformer architecture, composed of several layers of self-attention mechanisms. The mechanism computes attention scores for each word in a sentence, considering its interactions with every other word. Thus, by assigning different weights to different words, LLMs can effectively focus on the most relevant information, facilitating accurate and contextually appropriate text generation.
Step V: Fine-tuning
After the pre-training phase, the LLM can be fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains. Fine-tuning involves providing the model with task-specific labeled data, allowing it to learn the intricacies of a particular task. This process helps the LLM specialize in tasks such as sentiment analysis, Q&A, and so on.
Step VI: Inference
Once the LLM is trained and fine-tuned, it can be used for inference. Inference involves utilizing the model to generate text or perform specific language-related tasks. For example, given a prompt or a question, the LLM can generate a coherent response or provide an answer by leveraging its learned knowledge and contextual understanding.
Step VII: Contextual understanding
LLMs excel at capturing context and generating contextually appropriate responses. They use the information provided in the input sequence to generate text that considers the preceding context. The self-attention mechanisms in the transformer architecture play a crucial role in the LLM’s ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information.
Step VIII: Beam search
During the inference phase, LLMs often employ a technique called beam search to generate the most likely sequence of tokens. Beam search is a search algorithm that explores several possible paths in the sequence generation process, keeping track of the most likely candidates based on a scoring mechanism. This approach helps generate more coherent and high-quality text outputs.
Step IX: Response generation
LLMs generate responses by predicting the next token in the sequence based on the input context and the model’s learned knowledge. Generated responses can be diverse, creative, and contextually relevant, mimicking human-like language generation.
Overall, LLMs undergo a multi-step process through which models learn to understand language patterns, capture context, and generate text that resembles human-like language.

Examples of Large Language Models
Several notable examples of large language models that have been developed are available, each with its unique characteristics and applications. Here are a few prominent examples.
1. GPT-4
GPT-4 is an advanced version of its predecessors, GPT-3 and GPT-3.5. It outperforms the previous models regarding creativity, visual comprehension, and context. This LLM allows users to collaborate on projects, including music, technical writing, screenplays, etc. Besides text, GPT-4 can accept images as input. Moreover, according to OpenAI, GPT-4 is a multilingual model that can answer thousands of questions across 26 languages. When it comes to the English language, it shows a staggering 85.5% accuracy, while for Indian languages such as Telugu, it shows 71.4% accuracy.
2. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
BERT, developed by Google, introduced the concept of bidirectional pre-training for LLMs. Unlike previous models that relied on autoregressive training, BERT learns to predict missing words in a sentence by considering both the preceding and following context. This bidirectional approach enables BERT to capture more nuanced language dependencies. BERT has been influential in tasks such as question-answering, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language understanding. It has also been fine-tuned for domain-specific applications in industries such as healthcare and finance.
3. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
T5, developed by Google, is a versatile LLM trained using a text-to-text framework. It can perform a wide range of language tasks by transforming the input and output formats into a text-to-text format. T5 has achieved state-of-the-art results in machine translation, text summarization, text classification, and document generation. Its ability to handle diverse tasks with a unified framework has made it highly flexible and efficient for various language-related applications.
4. XLNet (eXtreme Language Understanding)
XLNet, developed by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Google, addresses some limitations of autoregressive models such as GPT-3. It leverages a permutation-based training approach that allows the model to consider all possible word orders during pre-training. This helps XLNet capture bidirectional dependencies without needing autoregressive generation during inference. XLNet has demonstrated impressive performance in tasks such as sentiment analysis, Q&A, and natural language inference.
5. Turing-NLG
Turing-NLG, developed by Microsoft, is a powerful LLM that focuses on generating conversational responses. It has been trained on a large-scale dataset of dialogues to improve its conversational abilities. Turing-NLG performs well in chatbot applications, providing interactive and contextually appropriate responses in conversational settings.
These examples showcase the capabilities of LLMs in various language-related tasks and their potential to revolutionize NLP applications. Continued research and development in this field will likely bring further advancements and refinements to LLMs in the future.

Takeaway
Over the coming years, we can expect large language models to improve performance, contextual understanding, and domain-specific expertise. They may also exhibit enhanced ethical considerations, multimodal capabilities, improved training efficiency, and enable collaboration/co-creation. These advancements can potentially change the face of various industries and human-computer interactions.

This reflects the widely-held belief that the technology has the potential to be truly transformational for the way we find and use information online.

But it doesn’t stop at search. Baidu has put generative AI to work in a number of other areas designed to improve user experience and generate new business.

It's even used to complete a masterpiece of traditional Chinese ink art, left unfinished when its renowned creator died more than 50 years ago.
Here’s an overview and a look at what we can expect from one of China’s leading technology companies in the near future. I’ll also take a look at why the situation for developers of AI platforms is different in China than it is in the West.

Ernie Bot
Ernie is Baidu's answer to ChatGPT and is the lynchpin of its plans to augment many of its products and services with generative AI. The friendly-sounding name represents Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Interaction.

It differs from ChatGPT in several key ways, however. Firstly, as well as being trained on unstructured text, it also has access to a knowledge graph. This is a structured database of basic information points and, crucially, the semantic links between them. It includes scientific, demographic, geographic and economic data and is similar to the one used by Google to present facts alongside its search results.

Although Baidu doesn’t seem to have stated this explicitly, it’s likely that the idea behind this is that a large, curated database of factual information can help curb the tendency of purely LLM-based models to hallucinate. This is the term used for when AI models appear to simply make things up. AI hallucinations happen because LLMs do not actually know anything; they simply construct probabilistic responses based on the text in their training data, which may or may not be factual.

The second important way that Ernie differs from ChatGPT (or Google’s PaLM, Meta’s Llama or other LLM-based generative AIs) is that it can also create pictures and videos. As such, rather than a large language model, the company refers to its AI technology as an AI Big Model.
Baidu is currently on version 3 of Ernie, with version two having been developed back in 2019. Furthermore, as with OpenAI’s GPT series of LLMs, there are a variety of models.
These include the lightweight model for training smaller applications, the cross-modal model, which is a diffusion model for text-to-image, and a protein-prediction model specifically designed for predicting protein structures.
Ernie has already been put to use in a number of ways that appear to go beyond what is being done with other generative AI-augmented search engines, such as Google and Microsoft’s (ChatGPT-powered) Bing.
So far, these Western counterparts primarily integrate generative AI alongside its existing search algorithms to add question-and-answer functionality. Baidu, on the other hand, is reported to be using generative AI to match user queries to paid-for advertisements and sponsored search results.
The idea here is that advertisers will get better targeting, and users will get more relevant advertising than the more deterministic keyword-based models used by, for example, Google’s Google Ads service.

Unfinished Masterpieces And Specialized Search
Another Baidu generative AI application is based on a different image generation model known as Wenxin Yige. This tool is specifically targeted at creating artwork and, in particular, is designed to generate traditional Chinese-style ink paintings. In demonstrations, it was shown to be able to understand and interpret traditional Chinese poetry as paintings – a task that is said to be difficult even for most humans. It was recently used to complete an unfinished masterpiece by the renowned traditional Chinese painter Lu Xiaoman, who died in 1965.
Another application, Wenxin Baizhong, is a platform aimed at simplifying the task of creating industry-specific generative AI-powered search engines.
Both of these generative applications (as well as Ernie) were built using PaddlePaddle, a Baidu-developed, open-source, distributed deep learning framework said to be the largest of its kind in China.

AI Regulation in China 
China, in recognition of both the power and danger of generative AI, has been quicker than much of the world in regulating its use. Ernie is one of the first Chinese generative AI platforms to be authorized for use, as it has been assessed as being in line with the Government's Interim Measures for Generative Artificial Intelligence Service Management.
These rules state that, among other considerations, any generative models available to the public must “adhere to the core socialist values and not incite subversion of state power"" and must not ""endanger national security,"" ""undermine national unity and social stability,"" or ""promote terrorism, extremism, ethnic hatred, ethnic discrimination, violence, obscenity, as well as false and harmful information.""
In addition, the regulation aims to ensure AIs are not trained on biased data, that they respect intellectual property rights, and that, as far as possible, algorithms should be accurate and transparent.
It also obliges providers of AI services to suspend their services and take immediate action to bring them in line with the law if they are found to be generating illegal content.
This makes the AI development landscape significantly different than it is in the West, where a slowness on the part of regulators has very much led to an anything-goes situation.
The Chinese government clearly recognizes the dangers of this, yet at the same time, has stated that it understands AI has the potential to drive enormous growth.
In the coming years, we’re likely to see how the differences in these two approaches play out – for now, all we can say for certain is that everything is at stake.

Humans work. Very logically, the processes related to people management in the workplace are known as Human Resources (HR), or Human Capital Management (HCM) if you wish to broaden the discipline to the wider organization of systems that employees circulate within. Ask anyone who’s been in a job that makes them unhappy inside an organization of any reasonable size and they’ll often tell you that the HR function is a human-centered portal of compassion and understanding. Generally, HR managers are really nice people and we like them.


But, like all things, people management needs to evolve. The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (gen-AI) that draws predictive inference and knowledge from so-called Large Language Models (LLMs) composed of open data pools is impacting every aspect of business life from cake baking to the petrochemicals business (for want of two diametrically opposed disciplines) and HR has not been left out.

Finance & Human Resources
Specializing in a platform designed to serve both HR & finance, Workday has now brought forward multiple new generative AI capabilities designed to help increase productivity, grow and retain talent, streamline business processes and drive better decision-making. But do we really want computers taking over the ‘my manager doesn’t understand me’ role and automating-out the empathy factor that we value so much in HR?

PROMOTED
Justifiably, Workday doesn’t see it that way. The company is founded on an information technology platform strategy that draws upon what it calls an ‘unrivalled dataset’ (i.e. a pool of workplace datasets, data-flows, data shapes and plain old databases that enable it to straddle and manage work-related IT functions for just about every imaginable task, process, occurrence or happening) and a commitment to delivering trustworthy solutions that demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming.

The application of gen-AI (as we have seen in every enterprise technology vendor worth its salt this year) is a natural enough progression for Workday, so in reality, there is little automated HR fearmongering to deal with here. In fact, AI and ML are already embedded in the core of the Workday platform, the company’s AI models are powered by more than 625 billion transactions processed every year – creating what is claimed to the the ‘world's largest and cleanest’ set of financial and HR data – which allows the models to consistently generate accurate, meaningful, trustworthy results.

""Generative AI has the potential to completely transform work as we know it,"" said Sayan Chakraborty, co-president, Workday. ""When applied responsibly, it has the power to elevate performance and to free up time to focus on the valuable work we really want and need to be doing. At Workday, we build solutions for business challenges where we can deliver clear and transformative benefits. We build enterprise-grade capabilities that are trustworthy, transparent, safe and that keep the user in the driver's seat at all times. Workday, our customers, and their employees are writing the playbook for how the future works together.""

Chakraborty used five very important words there: responsibly, trustworthy, transparent, safe and driver's seat. This is not gen-AI designed to digitally track employee behavior and root out people working at -1% of their potential productivity levels as they become candidates for redundancy. This is gen-AI designed to help create job descriptions (Workday users create 30 million job descriptions per year, which take on average two hours to create), this is gen-AI designed to analyze and correct employee work contracts, this is gen-AI designed to support the core (and often quite complex) administrative sub-layer that drives an HR function and its related financials.

Automated tasks
The argument here is simple enough, if drafting job descriptions and contracts takes hours of work and this is a process that we can automate down to seconds, then human HR managers can spend more ‘people time’ looking for and interacting with quality candidates. It’s called HR for a reason i.e. humans are a resource and we can digitize the resource management aspect of their existence, but only if we define the human interactivity level via which we actually speak to people.
By using information already stored in Workday as the single source of truth for people data – such as the skills needed for the role and job location details – users can create precisely targeted job descriptions to help find the best candidates.
According to Chakraborty and team, “Sales teams negotiate and win contracts - and finance teams then have to ensure the company is paid via accurate billing and revenue recognition. But contracts can be lengthy and information embedded within them can easily be missed. With Workday's contract analysis generative AI capability, customers will be able to compare signed contracts against contracts in Workday Financial Management and integrated CRM data in record time. The feature will alert the user to any discrepancies early in the process and propose corrections, then confirm when discrepancies are fixed.”
This early analysis and correction capability helps eliminate downstream accounting errors, saving considerable time trying to reverse and correct downstream transactions.
Digitizing tasks
Thinking about the application of gen-AI in the workplace and exactly which software services can be accelerated for what Workday has called human ‘amplification’, we can see that creating content to keep employees informed about company policies and updates can be time-consuming, often requiring the author to search, read and synthesize multiple sources to draft an article for employees' understanding.
The company promises new generative AI capabilities that will enable content creators to draft articles that are highly personalized and tailored to their audience – such as talking points for managers about a new company bonus policy, or key takeaways from company videos. These new capabilities can help the author improve the tone or length of the article, iterate on particular sections, or even translate the article to different languages to support a global workforce, saving users time.
Human digital HR?
Just how human can digital HR be? Workday insists that gen-AI will be able to provide recommendations on the ‘tone of correspondence’ when it is used by finance teams to draft past-due payment notices. Whether that ends up being more than word recognition and sentiment tracking in its initial deployment is unclear (words that express anger and aggression are not that hard to fathom), but when used to automated bulk mailing exercise (as is the suggestion here), Workday says its technology will be ‘based on configured rules’, so again, the parameters will be set by human beings.
Developer Copilot is a new human-machine teaming capability for Workday Extend app development, that will use gen-AI to support the the creation of finance and people management apps. Natively embedded into Workday's App Builder, Developer Copilot will provide text-to-code generation capabilities to improve developer productivity by turning natural language into software application development code. Developer Copilot will be contextually aware, providing curated content and search results that meet developers where they are, upskilling them and elevating the development experience.
""We recognize that generative AI is a powerful technology with the potential to have great impact on conversational experiences, and you will see us apply it in ways that generative AI is uniquely suited for,"" said Jeff Gelfuso, chief design officer, Workday. ""We are incredibly excited about the possibilities at the intersection of conversational UI and generative AI, and you can expect Workday to deliver capabilities in the future that will unlock endless possibilities for reimagining how to interact with our products.""
AI transparency
Gelfuso and team remind us that talent retention is a top priority for organizations everywhere and managers are responsible for their direct reports' growth and development. This capability is said to enable managers to create a summary of employees' strengths and areas of growth, pulling from Workday's database of insight such as performance reviews, employee feedback, contribution goals, skills etc.
Workday says its technology is well suited to support this use case as an organization's single source of truth for people data and, since Workday is transparent about how its AI models are designed, managers can easily understand how the data inputs contribute to a strength or area of growth. This capability will make the career check-in process more personalized and effective, empowering both managers and employees.
This whole process of employee amplification might sound a little sterile to those of us whose first interaction with an HR manager was probably back in the 1980s (or even before that time), but for digital natives, this kind of functionality will be standard, accepted and - if anything - probably very welcome. Those that baulk at the prospect of digital employee services should probably be thinking about moving to Florida and slowing down. Workday appears to have thought about empathy from the start of its efforts to bring gen-AI forwards into its platform, so your future HR function may well have a more digitally-empowered infrastructure now.
What was that - you want two weeks off next July? Let’s just check the system first.

As the boundaries between human and machine learning blur, the ivory towers of academia are resounding with the whispers of generative AI ̶ intelligent algorithms that offer a guiding light through the labyrinths of research.

“Now is the most exciting time to be a researcher,” said Shwetak Patel, director of Google’s health technologies and an endowed professor of computing and electrical engineering at the University of Washington, as quoted in Inside Higher Ed. This is not just hyperbole. With an armory of AI tools at our disposal, research across disciplines has accelerated, leading to, for example, new drug discoveries, new medical treatment options and more accurate medical diagnoses. Following is a look at the vast array of generative AI tools that are reshaping the way research is conducted.

Generative AI toolkitgetty
Background Research: Curating Scholarly Universe
When embarking on a research project, the first daunting step involves assimilating and integrating a universe of existing literature into a coherent framework. Instead of spending weeks scouring through academic journals, AI can find relevant studies in a fraction of the time. Platforms like Elicit, Consensus and Inciteful serve as scholarly concierges, curating a customized repository to assist with literature review, thereby allowing scientists to focus on analysis rather than the endless background data collection.

Article Summaries: The Essence
Instead of drowning in a sea of jargon, researchers can use AI to serve as an interpreter. Tools such as TLDRthis and AskYourPDF offer succinct, coherent summaries of lengthy articles, making them more digestible. These tools not only save time but also provide clarity, offering snapshots that encapsulate the core of each paper and enable scholars to interact with the articles.

Finding Research Gaps: The Detective’s Lens
AI-powered engines like Powerdrill simplify the arduous task of finding gaps in existing literature by helping to highlight overlooked or underexplored study areas. Litmaps allows researchers to visualize the relationships between different papers in literature review and helps find derivative work of others. Scholars can use these tools to strategically position their work and fill critical research gaps.

Data Analysis And Visualization: The Revelation
Data is the lifeblood of research, but interpreting it is a skill unto itself. Tools like Julius and GPT-4’s Advanced Data Analysis can autonomously analyze and visualize complex datasets, revealing hidden patterns that can guide further research.
Feedback On Drafts: The Peer Review
Generative AI is not just a tool; it's a collaborator. For a more 'human' touch in machine-assisted research, AI-driven peer review platforms like HeyScience offer constructive feedback, ensuring a scholar’s work resonates with academic communities.
Spelling and Grammar: The Wordsmith’s Companion
Even the most erudite scholars are not immune to typographical errors, and the credibility of academic research is often undermined by minor errors in spelling and grammar. AI-based editors like Grammarly and ChatGPT can polish manuscripts using real-time corrections.
References: The Finishing Touch
No research paper is complete without a meticulously formatted reference list. While scholars often use tools such as Zotero to capture citations, now ChatGPT and other conversational chatbots can flawlessly format references in APA or any other style. This not only ensures compliance with academic norms but also adds a polished finishing touch to a research manuscript.
As we usher in this new epoch of AI-augmented research, mastering the art of generative AI is not just an advantage; it's an imperative. It's about understanding AI’s limitations and strengths and using the tools to augment one's capabilities, which will transform today’s AI whispers into the academic roars of tomorrow.

Platform Approach, Unrivaled Dataset, and Commitment to Trust Set Company Apart as a Leader in Generative AI for the Enterprise
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ: WDAY), a leader in enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources, today announced multiple new generative AI capabilities that will help increase productivity, grow and retain talent, streamline business processes, and drive better decision-making. The new capabilities are being showcased at Workday Rising, the company's annual customer conference, and span the Workday platform to benefit all users – from finance and HR teams to people managers and individual users across an organization.
Workday's generative AI approach is set apart by the company's platform strategy, unrivaled dataset, and commitment to delivering trustworthy solutions that demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming. AI and ML are embedded in the core of the Workday platform, enabling the company to rapidly deliver cutting-edge solutions to customers across all applications. Workday AI models are fueled by more than 625 billion transactions processed by the system every year – resulting in the world's largest, cleanest set of financial and HR data – which allows the models to consistently generate accurate, meaningful, trustworthy results.
""Generative AI has the potential to completely transform work as we know it,"" said Sayan Chakraborty, co-president, Workday. ""When applied responsibly, it has the power to elevate performance and to free up time to focus on the valuable work we really want and need to be doing. At Workday, we build solutions for business challenges where we can deliver clear and transformative benefits. We build enterprise-grade capabilities that are trustworthy, transparent, safe, and that keep the user in the driver's seat at all times. Workday, our customers, and their employees are writing the playbook for how the future works together.""
Some of the ways businesses will benefit from new Workday generative AI capabilities include:
Generating Job Descriptions in Minutes Versus Hours
Workday users create 30 million job descriptions per year – taking an average of one to two hours every time. This capability will enable hiring managers and recruiters to generate job descriptions in minutes versus hours, freeing up considerable time to search for quality candidates rather than on administrative tasks. By leveraging information already stored in Workday as the single source of truth for people data – such as the skills needed for the role and job location details – users can create precisely targeted job descriptions to help find the best candidates.
Analyzing and Correcting Contracts for Faster, More Accurate Revenue Recognition
Sales teams negotiate and win contracts, and finance teams then have to ensure the company is paid via accurate billing and revenue recognition. But contracts can be lengthy, and information embedded within them can easily be missed. With Workday's contract analysis generative AI capability, customers will be able to compare signed contracts against contracts in Workday Financial Management and integrated CRM data in record time. The feature will alert the user to any discrepancies early in the process and propose corrections, then confirm when discrepancies are fixed. This early analysis and correction capability helps eliminate downstream accounting errors, saving considerable time trying to reverse and correct downstream transactions.
Creating Personalized Knowledge Management Articles With Ease
Creating content to keep employees informed about company policies and updates can be time consuming and frustrating, often requiring the author to search, read, and synthesize multiple sources to draft an article for employees' understanding. What took hours will take minutes, with just a few clicks in Workday Help. New generative AI capabilities will enable content creators to draft articles that are highly personalized and tailored to their audience – such as talking points for managers about a new company bonus policy, or key takeaways from company videos. These new capabilities can help the author improve the tone or length of the article, iterate on particular sections, or even translate the article to different languages to support a global workforce, saving users valuable time and the frustration of writer's block.
Streamlining Collections to Recapture Missing Funds Sooner
New generative AI capabilities from Workday will enable finance teams to automate the process of crafting past due notices with recommendations on the tone of the correspondence, driven by how late the customer is, or how often they are late, to save valuable time. Finance teams will also be able to use Workday generative AI to automate letters in bulk – based on configured rules – to easily send an entire package, including past invoices, enabling collections agents to greatly increase their throughput and recapture missing funds sooner.
Turning Text-to-Code for Faster Workday Extend App Development
Every business has unique needs and challenges. Workday Extend puts the same technology, security, logic, and application components that power Workday into customers' own hands to build custom apps that live in and run on Workday. Developer Copilot, a human-machine teaming capability for Workday Extend app development, will leverage the power of generative AI to support the entire development lifecycle for rapid creation of finance and people management apps. Natively embedded into Workday's App Builder, Developer Copilot will provide text-to-code generation capabilities to dramatically improve developer productivity and customer time-to-value by turning natural language into app code. Developer Copilot will be contextually aware, providing curated content and search results that meet developers where they are, upskilling them and elevating the development experience.
Creating Employee Growth Plans to Foster and Retain Talent
Talent retention is a top priority for organizations everywhere, and managers are responsible for their direct reports' growth and development. This capability will enable managers to quickly create a summary of employees' strengths and areas of growth, pulling from Workday's rich database of insight such as performance reviews, employee feedback, contribution goals, skills, and more. Workday is uniquely suited to support this use case as an organization's single source of truth for people data and, since Workday is transparent about how its AI models are designed, managers can easily understand how the data inputs contribute to a strength or area of growth. This capability will make the career check-in process more personalized and effective, empowering both managers and employees.
Generating Statements of Work for Faster Service Procurement
Procuring services can be a time-consuming activity for many corporations, typically with many teams involved – line of business, legal, procurement, and more. Gaining efficiencies in statement of work (SOW) clause creation and refinement is critical for organizations that want to move quickly and execute their priorities and business strategy flawlessly. Workday generative AI will help organizations automate this process, reducing the time and effort it requires, while also suggesting the relevant clauses to be included depending on the type of project, project location, type of deliverables, and more.
Transforming the Workday User Experience With Conversational AI
Workday also previewed capabilities it is exploring at the intersection of conversational UI and generative AI to enhance users' ability to interact with information and tasks in a natural way, taking advantage of the unique capabilities generative AI offers such as summarization, search, maintaining context, and more.
""We recognize that generative AI is a powerful technology with the potential to have great impact on conversational experiences, and you will see us apply it in ways that generative AI is uniquely suited for,"" said Jeff Gelfuso, chief design officer, Workday. ""We are incredibly excited about the possibilities at the intersection of conversational UI and generative AI, and you can expect Workday to deliver capabilities in the future that will unlock endless possibilities for reimagining how to interact with our products.""
Availability
New generative AI features to support use cases including job descriptions, contract analysis, knowledge management, collections letters, app development, employee growth plans, and statements of work are expected to begin rolling out to customers within the next 6 to 12 months, joining Workday's growing roster of more than 40 AI and ML features already in product today.
As with all Workday AI and ML features, the generative AI capabilities announced today are being designed to optimize human-machine teaming, utilizing AI to generate content quickly, while empowering the user to apply their skills, judgment, and experience to personalize and validate that content. Workday is committed to transparency through explainability, helping users leverage AI with trust and confidence.

SAP has introduced a natural-language, generative AI copilot called “Joule”, which will be embedded across SAP’s cloud enterprise portfolio.Joule will provide contextualised insights across all SAP solutions and third-party sources.It helps to expedite working tasks, improve business outcomes, and “transform” business operations, while also being secure and compliant.Christian Klein, CEO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, commented on its new AI copilot: “With almost 300 million enterprise users around the world working regularly with cloud solutions from SAP, Joule has the power to redefine the way businesses – and the people who power them – work.“Joule draws on SAP’s unique position at the nexus of business and technology and builds on our relevant, reliable, responsible approach to Business AI. Joule will know what you mean, not just what you say.”Joule will be integrated into SAP applications from businesses across multiple industries, including finance, supply chain, procurement, and customer experience, as well as its SAP Business Technology Platform.By simply asking questions in natural language, employees can receive intelligent answers, which retain their context, based on business data from SAP’s portfolio and third-party sources.If a manufacturer wants to find out more about its sales performance, Joule will be able to identify low-performing areas, link to data sets that elucidate supply chain issues, and connect to the supply chain system to suggest possible fixes for the manufacturer to review.It will continuously offer new scenarios for all SAP solutions. In HR, for example, it will create unbiased job descriptions and relevant interview questions.Availability & Events



Joule will be available, along with SAP SucessFactors solutions and the SAP Start site, later this year. The public edition of SAP S/4HANA Cloud will be available in early 2024, with SAP Customer Experience, SAP Ariba, and SAP Business Technology Platform following soon after.SAP has also said it will announce many more updates across its portfolio at SuccessConnect, which takes place on October 2 – 4, SAP Spend Connect Live on October 9 – 11, SAP Customer Experience LIVE on October 25, and SAP Tech Ed on November 2 – 3.Phil Carter, Group Vice President, Worldwide Thought Leadership Research, IDC, gave his assessment: “As generative AI moves on from the initial hype, the work to ensure a measurable return on investment begins.“SAP understands that generative AI will eventually become part of the fabric of everyday life and work and is taking the time to build a business copilot that focuses on generating responses based on real-world scenarios – and to put in place the necessary guardrails to ensure it’s also responsible.”Joule adds to SAP’s current AI offering, which 26,000 SAP cloud customers have access to.SAP’s strategy of building an enterprise AI ecosystem includes investments of $1 billion into Aleph Alpha, Anthropic, and Cohere, via the company’s investment arm, Sapphire Ventures LLC.SAP has formed third-party partnerships with Google Cloud and IBM. It also partnered with  Microsoft and stakeholders in OpenAI to leverage the tech giant’s AI solutions.The Microsoft partnership enables SAP to integrate SuccessFactors into Microsoft365 Copilot and Copilot for Viva Learning, and combines SAP solutions with Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to give SAP clients a powerful language model.

SAP

SAP has announced its new generative AI assistant, Joule, operating as a natural-language, AI copilot that will transform the way businesses run. Embedded throughout SAP’s cloud enterprise portfolio, Joule will deliver proactive and contextualized insights from across SAP solutions and third-party sources to “know what you mean, not just what you say”.
Joule will be available with SAP SuccessFactors solutions and SAP Start later this year, and with SAP S/4HANA Cloud public edition early next year, with the ability to quickly sort through and contextualize data from multiple systems to garner smarter insights. In a secure and compliant manner, the new AI companion is aimed at helping workers get work done faster and businesses drive better business outcomes.
Joule will be embedded into SAP Business Technology Platform as well as SAP applications from HR to finance, supply chain, procurement and customer experience. In an effort to transform the SAP user experience, SAP describes Joule as working like “tapping your smartest colleague on the shoulder”.
Christian Klein, CEO and member of the executive board of SAP SE, said: “With almost 300 million enterprise users around the world working regularly with SAP cloud solutions, Joule has the power to redefine the way businesses – and the people who power them – work.
“Joule draws on SAP’s unique position at the nexus of business and technology and builds on our relevant, reliable, responsible approach to Business AI. Joule will know what you mean, not just what you say.”
Discussing the security of the new AI addition, Julia White, executive board member and chief marketing and solutions officer of SAP, said during the launch call:
“Our business AI is delivered with responsibility. We have the highest levels of concern for security, privacy, compliance and ethics. Protecting customer data is of our utmost importance and for GenAI, we ensure that no large language model will use our customers’ data to learn or improve on their foundational models.”
Drawing from the wealth of business data across the SAP portfolio and third-party sources, employees will need only ask a question or frame a problem in plain language to receive intelligent answers.
SAP has provided an example of how Joule will operate; imagine a manufacturer asking Joule for help to better understand sales performances, Joule will identify underperforming regions, link to other data sets that reveal a supply chain issue and automatically connect to the supply chain system to offer potential fixes for the manufacturer’s review.
Joule will continuously deliver new scenarios for all SAP solutions, even allowing HR to help write unbiased job descriptions and generate relevant interview questions.
White also explained that SAP has already applied AI in finance with a key customer Accenture, whose accounts receivable department is using AI to automatically match incoming payments to their corresponding invoices and client accounts.
“And through the use of our AI they’ve almost doubled their invoice payment to invoice match rate going from 30 percent to 54 percent and significantly reducing that peak time processing for those critical month-end, quarter-end and year-end closing moments,” she added.
In addition, Deloitte has announced that it using GenAI to extend the value of SAP applications by building on top of SAP Business Technology Platform.
SAP’s new generative AI assistant builds on existing SAP Business AI offerings. With over 26,000 SAP cloud customers with access to SAP Business AI, SAP’s AI strategy relies on direct investments. SAP backed, Sapphire Ventures LLC, dedicated over $1bn to fund AI-powered enterprise technology and investments from Aleph Alpha, Anthropic and Cohere, as well as third-party partnerships with Microsoft, Google Cloud and IBM, have propelled forward SAP’s ambitions for an ‘enterprise AI ecosystem of the future.
Phil Carter, group vice president, worldwide thought leadership research, IDC, said: “As generative AI moves on from the initial hype, the work to ensure measurable return on investment begins.
“SAP understands that generative AI will eventually become part of the fabric of everyday life and work, and is taking the time to build a business copilot that focuses on generating responses based on real-world scenarios – and to put in place the necessary guardrails to ensure it’s also responsible.”

By: Sunil Joshi on September 27, 2023 There is a growing belief in the developer community that future software development will be performed by machines rather than humans by 2040. Software development will undergo a radical change with the combination of machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing and code generation that draws from large language models (LLMs). Most organizations believe that there will be a 30-40% improvement in overall developer productivity with AI. While these arguments have some merit, I do not believe developers will be fully replaced. Instead, I believe generative AI can augment developers to support faster development and higher-quality code.I’ll address the impact of generative AI on the development community under three pillars:Automation and productivityQuality engineering and complianceWays of workingAutomation and ProductivityThere will be a focus on increased automation all the way from business planning to operations of applications.LLMs can help provide better alignment of user stories to business requirements. In fact, one of the best use cases for generative AI during planning phases is to auto-generate user stories from business requirements documents.Since ambiguity of requirements or guesswork is taken out of the equation, one can expect a clearer “definition of done” through the auto-creation of acceptance criteria.In a typical development cycle, 15%-20% of coding defects are attributed to improperly defined requirements. Generative AI augmentation can result in significant reduction of those defects.Generative AI augmentation can help developers with better planning and estimation of work. Rather than relying on personal experience or home-grown estimation models, LLMs can better predict the complexity of work and developers and continually learn and adapt through multiple development sprints.AI-augmented code creation can allow developers to focus on solving complex business problems and creative thinking rather than worrying about repetitive code generation. Over the last decade or so, the perception of software development as a creative pursuit has been a dying phenomenon. With AI, I think that more and more younger developers will be attracted to the field. AI will put the “fun” back in coding.AI-assisted DevOps and continuous integration will further accelerate deployments of code so developers can focus more on solving complex business problems. Deployment failures due to human errors can be drastically reduced.Elaborating on the above, newer and less experienced developers can also generate higher-quality code with AI-augmentation, leading to better overall consistency of code in large programs.Overall, from a development standpoint, I think AI augmentation will free up 30% of developers’ time to work on enhancing user experience and other value-added tasks.Quality Engineering and ComplianceIn a hybrid cloud world, solutions will become more distributed than ever, making system architecture more complex.LLMs can assist in regulating design documents and architecture work products to conform to industry/corporate standards and guidelines. In essence, LLMs can act as virtual Architecture Review Boards. In a typical development life cycle, architecture/design reviews and approvals make up 5%-8% of work and augmenting the process with generative AI capabilities can cut that time in half.Ssecurity compliance for cloud-based solutions is imperative. LLMs can assist in ensuring such compliance very early on in the development life cycle, leading to more predictable deployments and timely program delivery.Generative AI-augmented test case creation can optimize the number of test cases needed to support the development while increasing the overall code coverage for quality.For greenfield development, there can be a 20%-40% increase in overall code quality through automatic bug-fixing embedded within a DevOps pipeline. Developers can focus on bug avoidance rather than bug fixes.AI-augmented test data generation can increase testing cycles by 25%. Proper test data availability has been a big pain point for quality engineers for decades.Ways of WorkingDevelopers will have to shift their focus to understand how to use the right AI models and prompts to generate documents, code, test cases etc. rapidly. This is a change from writing everything from scratch. Picking the right model for the right use case is very important from an overall efficacy standpoint while also remaining cognizant of the trustworthiness, security and data lineage of the models. This is why I don’t think developers can simply be fully replaced (at least not in the near future).Generative AI is not magic. It does what it is trained to do based on the examples it is provided and how well it is prompted. Developers will need to quickly learn and adapt to this new paradigm.This requires different sets of skills and training for developers. It is also incumbent on management to ensure developer enablement happens so they can succeed in this new world. Simply having an AI technology strategy without a developer enablement strategy means a failed overall strategy. The outcomes will not be fruitful.AI-enabled development is here to stay, despite the nervousness in the developer community. Of course, there are some good reasons to be nervous. Generative AI, unlike many other revolutionary technologies that have emerged in the recent past, doesn’t just enable work but creates “things.” And there is a school of thought that believes this creation will displace developers. It won’t. Generative AI-augmented development will provide developers with a pathway to higher creative thinking, which really is one of the fundamental aspects of software development.



My message to the development community: Don’t fear generative AI; embrace, learn about and from and enjoy creating with generative AI.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of today's workforce, employee burnout has emerged as a pressing concern. The relentless pace, excessive demands, and constant connectivity have taken a toll on the well-being of employees.


However, the synergy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and forward-thinking Future of Work policies offers a promising path to mitigate burnout, improve employee engagement and enhance productivity.

The Growing Burnout Crisis
Burnout is an occupational phenomenon. It is driven by a chronic imbalance between job demands (for example: workload pressure, understaffing, and poor working environment) and job resources (for example: job autonomy, and supportive work relationships).

PROMOTED
According to the World Health Organization, burnout is a syndrome associated with chronic stress in the workplace that has not been successfully managed. It is characterized by:



Feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion
Increased mental distance from one’s job, feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job
Reduced professional efficacy

Toxic workplace behavior is the biggest driver of negative workplace outcomes, such as burnout and intent to leave. And burnout is not simply inconvenient, poor well-being affects the bottom line through lower productivity, higher turnover, higher absenteeism, and higher medical costs (due to preventable conditions).

Employee burnout costs organizations 15%-20% of total payroll in voluntary turnover costs alone, on average, due to burnout.
Leveraging AI For Employee Wellness
Artificial Intelligence holds immense potential to address employee burnout head-on. Here are ways AI can make a difference:
Personalized Workloads
AI algorithms can analyze individual work patterns and preferences, allowing organizations to optimize workloads. This prevents overburdening and ensures that each employee's skills are utilized to the fullest, resulting in increased job satisfaction.
Predictive Analytics
AI can process vast amounts of data to predict when an employee might be approaching burnout. Early detection enables organizations to intervene proactively, offering essential support and accommodations.
Automation of Repetitive Tasks
Many employees suffer burnout due to repetitive and mundane tasks. AI-driven automation can take over these tasks, freeing employees to focus on more creative and challenging aspects of their work.
Mental Health Support
AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide immediate mental health support and resources to employees, helping them manage stress and anxiety effectively.
Work-Life Balance
AI can assist in scheduling and workload management, ensuring that employees have ample time for their personal lives. This decreases the risk of burnout associated with excessive work hours.
Recent Examples At Google, Zoom, Elsewhere
There may be no need to attend those irksome meetings any longer. Google recently announced a new feature for its Google Meet video service that lets users send an AI bot to attend a meeting on their behalf. After the meeting, the user will receive AI-generated meeting notes and action items. Naturally, it cannot speak for you or share other real-time information from you.
AI summaries may help get your job done more broadly, as Zoom and Otter.ai join Google and others leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in attempts to help workers keep better track of what happens in meetings, whether they attend or not. AI could also help by scheduling follow-up meetings, drafting emails, and otherwise reducing the stress of meeting burdens on employees.
Employers can and should view high rates of burnout as a powerful warning sign that the organization—not the individuals in the workforce—needs to undergo meaningful systematic change, according to McKinsey.
Adding that efforts to rally the organization to rethink work—in ways that are compatible with both employee and employer goals—are likely to pay off in the long term. To help advance that conversation, they offer these targeted questions:


Do we treat employee mental health and well-being as a strategic priority?
Do we effectively address toxic behaviors?
Do we create inclusive work environments?
Do we enable individual growth?
Do we promote sustainable work?
Are we holding leaders accountable?
Are we effectively tackling stigma?
Do our resources serve employee needs?


The Future Of Work Policies And Practices
Addressing these questions and more has never been more urgent. In conjunction with AI, workplace policies and practices also play a pivotal role in reducing employee burnout.
Start at the Top
The most immediate way to ameliorate employee burnout at your organization is for managers and employees to discuss the factors of burnout that are most relevant to the employee.
Embrace Flexibility and Hybrid Work
Offering flexible work arrangements, including hybrid work options, allows employees to better manage their work-life balance. It lessens commute-related stress and offers greater control over their schedules.
Promote Time Off
Encourage employees to take their vacation days and emphasize the importance of unplugging during downtime. A well-rested employee is less susceptible to burnout.
Prioritize Training and Development
Investing in continuous training and development opportunities not only empowers employees to grow but also demonstrates that the organization values their personal and professional development.
Foster Transparent Communications
Maintain open and transparent communication channels between leadership and employees. When employees feel heard and understood, it can significantly diminish feelings of burnout.
Recognition and Rewards
Acknowledge and reward employees for their hard work and accomplishments. Regular recognition boosts morale and motivation, thereby reducing the risk of burnout.
Ensure Accountability, Monitoring, and Updates 
Measure the impact of your AI and future of work initiatives on employee burnout. This will help you to track your progress and make necessary adjustments.
Leverage Technology with Purpose 
Invest in training for employees on how to effectively embrace and utilize AI tools and resources. This will help them to be more productive and efficient in their work.
The Time Is Now
Reducing employee burnout through the strategic use of AI and forward-thinking Future of Work policies is not just feasible; it is imperative for modern organizations aiming to thrive. By embracing AI technology and implementing engagement-centric policies, companies can improve the employee experience as well as company outcomes and foster healthier, more productive, and ultimately more successful workplaces.

Will Generative A.I. Allow You to Work More Than One Job?

The rise of generative A.I. has many tech professionals worried about keeping their jobs. But what if A.I. frees up tech pros to run lucrative side gigs… or even work two full-time jobs simultaneously?

A new study by Morgan Stanley (hat tip to Business Insider for the breakdown) suggests there’s a rise in the number of people working multiple jobs. “The advent of cheap or free and rapidly democratized access to generative A.I. tools,” that paper added, could generate as much as $83 billion of the $400 billion in income expected from multiple jobs by 2030. More optimistic predictions place the income from multiple jobs at $1.4 trillion by the decade’s end, with A.I. responsible for a sizable $300 billion slice.

Morgan Stanley cited programming, content creation, and graphic and web design among the jobs potentially impacted by this trend, along with non-tech jobs such as tutoring, affiliate marketing, and e-commerce dropshipping.

Generative A.I tools such as ChatGPT and Meta’s Llama 2 will write and debug code. That could free up engineers and developers to focus their time and energy on the more creative aspects of their jobs, such as ideating new features. As these tools become more sophisticated, of course, the time savings could allow tech professionals to radically adjust their workflows—and perhaps focus more on their side gigs, personal projects, or even a second job. 

Whatever your role in tech, it’s also important to understand how A.I. and machine learning actually work and how they might evolve. According to a recent report from consulting firm McKinsey, Technology Trends Outlook 2023, anyone interested in A.I. should familiarize themselves with the following:

Machine learning
Computer vision
Natural-language processing
Deep reinforcement learning

These technologies will power increasingly powerful tools such as low- and no-code platforms, infrastructure-as-code, and advanced microservices. What will you do with the time these new tools will free up?

Image: GoogleThe arrival of generative artificial intelligence has accelerated the use of AI in different fields, including journalism. AI is most visible in journalism when things go wrong. Some newsrooms have published AI articles riddled with errors or offensive suggestions. There’s widespread anxiety that AI will be used to replace journalists on the cheap. But a new global survey demonstrates the ways that AI has worked its way into the business, even as journalists worry about its implications — and they don’t just involve writing articles. The report was published this week by JournalismAI, an initiative from Polis, the London School of Economics and Political Science’s journalism think tank. It is supported by the Google News Initiative.“Generating Change: A global survey of what news organisations are doing with artificial intelligence” includes the perspective of “more than 120 editors, journalists, technologies and mediamakers from 105 small and large newsrooms across 46 countries.” JournalismAI doesn’t claim that the survey is representative of the whole global industry, but it does give a hint of how the media market is using these new technologies. More than 75 percent of respondents used AI tools somewhere in the news processAmong the respondents, more than 75 percent used AI somewhere in the chain of news gathering, production, and distribution. More than half mentioned increased efficiency and enhanced productivity as a reason to use it — ideally, AI can automate monotonous and repetitive tasks. Around a third of respondents said they hoped AI technologies would help them reach a wider audience, personalize reader experiences, and enhance audience engagement. At the same time, more than 60 percent of respondents were concerned about the ethical implications of AI integration in terms of editorial quality and other aspects of journalism such as accuracy, fairness, and transparency. Generally, newsrooms continue to view human intervention as crucial to mitigating the potential harms of AI systems, like bias and inaccuracy. Even as respondents worried that AI technologies could exacerbate biased news coverage and the misrepresentation of marginalized groups, few organizations provided solid examples of any potential solutions.The report says AI has particular pitfalls for newsrooms in the Global South. Most AI tools are developed with a focus on English (with very specific accents). Funds and resources are usually concentrated on a few countries, and different political realities might affect people’s trust in AI. Nevertheless, the survey revealed that 90 percent of newsrooms are already using some form of AI in news production, 80 percent in news distribution, and 75 percent in news gathering. News gathering tasks include automated transcription and translation, extracting text from images, and scraping the web or using automated summarization tools. News production could include translating articles into other languages, proofreading, writing headlines, or writing full articles. Distribution includes using AI-driven search engine optimization as well as things like tailoring content to a specific audience.There are some huge differences in scale here — spell-checking an article with AI and using AI to generate a new article completely, for instance, hand over a very different level of control to AI tools. The report does not specify how many newsrooms are using this technology for each specific task, but it does mention that news distribution has the widest range of use cases, being most frequently mentioned as the area most impacted by AI in the newsroom.  Even though the majority of respondents are concerned about the implications of adopting AI tools, only around one-third of them said their organization had an AI strategy or were currently developing one.Tech companies like Google are building AI tools into their core businesses, even as they raise new ethical and legal concerns. Several newsrooms have blocked GPTBot, the web-crawling tool from Google competitor OpenAI, from using their data, and authors have sued OpenAI and Meta over using their work to train AI. However, news agencies have also struck deals with AI companies — like The Associated Press, which signed an agreement with OpenAI earlier this year. Comments1 Comment / 1 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeSamsung’s new folds, flips, and Apple clones | The Vergecast

Sign up for it here.The quickest way to second-guess a decision to major in English is this: have an extended family full of Salvadoran immigrants and pragmatic midwesterners. The ability to recite Chaucer in the original Middle English was unlikely to land me a job that would pay off my student loans and help me save for retirement, they suggested when I was a college freshman still figuring out my future. I stuck with English, but when my B.A. eventually spat me out into the thick of the Great Recession, I worried that they’d been right.After all, computer-science degrees, and certainly not English, have long been sold to college students as among the safest paths toward 21st-century job security. Coding jobs are plentiful across industries, and the pay is good—even after the tech layoffs of the past year. The average starting salary for someone with a computer-science degree is significantly higher than that of a mid-career English graduate, according to the Federal Reserve; at Google, an entry-level software engineer reportedly makes $184,000, and that doesn’t include the free meals, massages, and other perks. Perhaps nothing has defined higher education over the past two decades more than the rise of computer science and STEM. Since 2016, enrollment in undergraduate computer-science programs has increased nearly 49 percent. Meanwhile, humanities enrollments across the United States have withered at a clip—in some cases, shrinking entire departments to nonexistence.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

But everyone from autoworkers to white-collar middle managers should be paying very close attention to how this deal was achieved — because it sets a monumental precedent for labor relations in a digital future.Unlike bread-and-butter issues like wages, benefits and the terms and conditions of employment — topics over which management, according to labor law, must negotiate “in good faith” — technology, like business strategy, constitutes managerial prerogative. This means that the use of technology, such as artificial intelligence, exists in a bargaining gray area. If workers bring it up, employers can either open a negotiation or reply with a simple “No, thanks.” But the W.G.A. deal put A.I. squarely on the table.In the past, management would often make nearly all technology-related decisions before negotiations even began. Workers and their unions were excluded from early conversations about technology — including ones that could open up a range of issues around use and deployment that would benefit both workers and employers. The only mandated negotiations were around the technologies’ impact on terms and conditions such as wages. This dynamic may help explain why, at the beginning of the W.G.A. negotiations, many believed, or at least publicly stated, that securing any constraints at all on the use of A.I. was a pipe dream.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Read 188 CommentsShare full article188Read in appAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTComments 188Hollywood’s Deal With Screenwriters Just Rewrote the Rules Around A.I.Skip to CommentsThe comments section is closed.

	A clearer picture of how studios intend to incorporate artificial intelligence into the screenplay production apparatus is coming into view.

	More than 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America were given the greenlight on Wednesday to return to work after a vote to accept a tentative deal from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers that ended the 148-day strike. Included in the agreement were provisions placing guardrails around the use of generative AI that not only protect writers but also the studios, which are signaling they plan to pursue copyrights of works created in part by AI tools.

	The deal doesn’t bar the use of AI but restricts how it can be credited and utilized.

	“The Companies agree that because neither traditional AI nor GAI is a person, neither is a ‘writer’ or ‘professional writer,'” states the Memorandum of Agreement. “Therefore, written material produced by traditional AI or GAI shall not be considered literary material.”



	The agreement details that the provision of work created by AI, which must be disclosed by both sides, won’t affect writers’ credit or compensation and cannot be the “basis for disqualifying a writer from eligibility for separated rights.” But nestled in between the lines of those protections is confirmation that studios aim to have writers work collaboratively with AI tools in the screenwriting process, though it can’t be mandated. 

	By keeping AI on the table, studios are looking to copyright material created by writers working in conjunction with the human-mimicking bots. Essential to the copyrightability of such works is a human rewriting or at least touching up any AI-produced script. Material solely produced by AI is not copyrightable. This means that the studios need writers to pursue copyrights and exploitation of such works. 

	“The studios want to ensure exclusivity and copyright ownership,” says Darren Trattner, an entertainment lawyer who represents writers, directors and actors. “They want to make sure that they have ownership of all the results and proceeds, and if AI is used, there could be an issue with that.”

	The AMPTP appears to have built in safeguards that protect against use of AI that could undermine copyrightability.

	“A writer must obtain the Company’s consent before using GAI,” the MoA states. “The Company retains the right to reject the use of GAI, including the right to reject a use of GAI that could adversely affect the copyrightability or exploitation of the work.”

	










	Sarah Odenkirk, an intellectual property lawyer, says that this part of the deal indicates that studios are “very well aware that if a writer uses generative AI to create a work,” then “they won’t be given as strong of copyright protections that they wanted” because material created by AI isn’t copyrightable.

	Writers are rightfully concerned. In an Aug. 11 proposal, the AMPTP signaled that it intends to harness AI tools that can generate loglines, pitch ideas and storylines in seconds. It stressed “landmark protections for writers” in which their “compensation, credit and separated rights will not be affected” when generative AI is used.

	The AMPTP described its offer as meeting the “priority concerns the writers have expressed.” It was the opposite; the AMPTP was arguably getting the benefit of the bargain, with the potential to significantly undercut scribes’ work down the line.

	The U.S. Copyright Office currently maintains that most AI-generated works are not copyrightable. In a statement of policy issued in March, it said it’s “well-established” that protection can only be granted to works that are the “product of human creativity” and that authors “exclude non-humans.” A work containing material produced by AI can only support a copyright if a human “selected or arranged” it in a “sufficiently creative way that the resulting work constitutes an original work of authorship.”

	If they have a person rewrite or touch up AI-generated material, the studios calculated that they could then position the work as having had enough human input to qualify for copyright protection. Without writers playing a part in the screenwriting process when AI is used, studios would essentially be creating uncopyrightable material. This would limit opportunities for exploitation since the works could enter the public domain, says Odenkirk, who observes that this serves as a “natural barrier” against studios completely replacing writers with AI tools. 

	










	“If a human touches material created by generative AI, then the typical copyright protections will kick in,” a source close to the AMPTP said in August.

	At the same time, studios can arrange their employment relationship with the writer as a work-made-for-hire, which would allow them to list themselves as the owner of the copyright. This could enable them to sidestep writers exploiting a provision in copyright law enabling them to recapture previously transferred IP rights after a certain period of time. Studios have been fighting costly legal battles over the right to iconic franchises birthed in the 1980s, including Top Gun, Predator, Terminator and Friday the 13th.

	The determining factor of the copyrightability of AI-created material is the extent to which a person had “creative control over the work’s expression and actually formed the traditional elements of authorship,” according to the copyright office. A writer, for example, could modify material originally generated by AI to such a degree that it meets the standard for protection. In these instances, only the human-authored aspects of the work will be granted protection. The copyright office requires applicants to disclose the parts of their work created by AI.

	Amid this backdrop, courts are wrestling with the legality of using copyrighted works to train AI systems. Absent in the deal is mention of whether the studios will use writers’ work as training data — a sticking point in negotiations. The agreement, which acknowledges the legal landscape around the issue as “uncertain and rapidly developing,” says that both sides reserve all rights to pursue litigation over the unauthorized exploitation of material to train AI systems. It appears that studios maintain that they have the right to use writers’ work as training data, according to comments made by negotiating committee co-chair Chris Keyser in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “The companies have, they claim, some ongoing copyright rights in using our material, and we claim certain contractual rights that limit that or would compensate us for that,” he said.

	










	The tentative deal’s Memorandum of Agreement punts the issue under a term requiring regular meetings at the request of the guild to “discuss and review information related to the Company’s use and intended use of GAI in motion picture development and production.”

An artificial intelligence model currently being developed by the Government Accountability Office could one day be used to do things like pull information from the watchdog’s extensive catalog of reports for Congress, the agency’s top official told lawmakers this week. 
GAO Comptroller General Gene Dodaro told the House Administration’s Subcommittee on Modernization at a Wednesday hearing that the agency is working to figure out how to both audit AI use in government and use the technology to its own benefit.
As part of those efforts, Dodaro said, GAO’s Innovation Lab has brought in a large language model that it’s looking to use to query its reports in a more “sophisticated way.” Once the agency is satisfied with that tool, he said, they’d share it with Congress.
All the potential use cases of the model have yet to be defined, however, and that’s the point.

In an interview with FedScoop, GAO Chief Data Scientist and Director of the Innovation Lab Taka Ariga said the AI project is currently in an “experimentation phase” with a goal of establishing a foundational large language model (LLM) that allows that agency to build use cases on top of it.
While GAO is interested in using the tool for its work and the work of Congress, Ariga said it also has an interest in learning the mechanics of generative AI so it can figure out the appropriate uses and better perform its oversight of the government — which is increasingly adopting the new technology. 
In balancing all of those interests, Ariga said GAO arrived at building a model within its infrastructure that allows its staff to work with generative AI in a more secure way and experiment with their own use cases.
“We want to make sure that we are realizing the sort of potential opportunities for productivity gains, but making sure that we do so in a secure and appropriate way,” Ariga said. “And to us, the only way to do that is deploying an LLM inside GAO.”
GAO’s work on the model has been ongoing for roughly eight to 10 weeks, Ariga said, and has focused on using pre-trained models to figure out which work best for what it’s trying to achieve. “Now we’re embarking on the exercise of how do we then calibrate the parameters? How do we start thinking about training these models on GAO content?” he said.

Among GAO’s interests: Making sure that the model isn’t generating answers from things it learned from outside sources like Wikipedia and avoiding an “auto magical” type of interface that doesn’t explain its reasoning.
“Rather than making stuff up, we want to see this sort of step-by-step rational process behind the scenes so that any output that we end up seeing, we have some basis of … understanding how we arrive at that output,” Ariga said.
One particular use case the watchdog is thinking about for a generative AI tool that’s trained on GAO’s reports is using an application programming interface (API) to “plug into information within Congress.gov” on committee hearings and summarize what the agency has already reported on the topic, Ariga said. 
Other potential generative AI use cases GAO is looking at include analyzing public comments on Regulation.gov to draw common themes, Ariga said. He noted the agency has a number of different hypotheses. “What we don’t want to end up doing is limiting what we can do based on what the Innovation Lab has thought about before,” he said.
As far as timing, Ariga said the agency is “very close” to a basic deployment of the technology itself, but there is still “some time before” it can be broadly available. The agency must go through the cybersecurity authorization process and testing, for example.

But throughout the process, Ariga said, they want to make sure they’re testing with end users. That group will start small and eventually be expanded to more people over time. “Eventually, our goal is to then invite all the GAO to be able to experience what sort of a GAO-specific flavor of large language model can do,” Ariga said.

Today, generative AI is generating a lot of interest in how it impacts consumer business and applications, however the public sector stands to gain efficiencies in their enterprise operations when applied in the right use cases, according to Google ML, AI and Generative AI Practice Lead, Amina al Sherif.
Al Sherif joined StateScoop’s virtual IT Mod Summit to discuss the impact generative AI has across many areas in IT operations, including streamlining code development, improving data management and accomplishing a variety of other IT operations workflows.
Improving IT operations
Al Sherif emphasized the growing need among organizations to view generative AI through the lens of a “platform revolution,” so from a production perspective it isn’t about building a chat bot, rather you can build a search capability to review all IT documentation or network maps. 
“Generative AI is very powerful, and frankly, it’s the biggest strength in the coding realm to automate things that normally would have required a team of Python or Java [developers] to put in the pipeline,” explained al Sherif. She asserts that generative AI can facilitate code development and augment the code review process, so it is ready for production quickly and well-integrated into the rest of the code base.
She cited an example of using generative AI to optimize and review TerraForm by HashiCorp deployments — an infrastructure-as-a-code tool used to manage cloud infrastructure — and its use in pointing out instances of inefficiencies or duplicative resource deployments.
Additionally, generative AI is applicable as a tool to improve areas such as database management, data cleansing, network health checks and automated dashboard creation that have to be done on a daily basis to reflect how the network is performing and sensors are performing.
The ‘data problem’
As a platform approach, generative AI can be designed to perform end-to-end functions and break down data silos as well as communication silos, said Al Sherif, which can help organizations get a better understanding of their data,
“A lot of CIOs, and IT departments by default, deal with the data problem,” according to Al Sherif, which can encompass not knowing where the databases are located, their health status or the status of data cleansing.
She explained that as a platform performing end-to-end functions, generative AI can solve a larger range of operational issues, such as:

Compressing files automatically when they have not been touched or used in a long time.
Forming data cleansing pipelines and eliminating (for example but not limited to) instances of nulls and corrupt values.
Generating daily checklists that IT employees must regularly follow.
Setting reminders for specialized tasks in security or assurance to make knowledge more accessible and break down communications silos across teams.

Finding appropriate checks and balances
Lastly, Al Sherif encouraged public sector leaders to find a balance between risk aversion and embracing innovation so that they are not falling behind the adoption curve.
“Regulation is going to be needed in both government and education [sectors]…and I think there are very good frameworks put together, and kind of layered on top of that innovation capability, to make sure that innovation is happening in a safe way,” she explained.
“But you need to allow your engineers to grow and experiment with these technologies and avoid doing things like putting total bans on the technology, or even pauses on the technology,” she explained, as a way to retain talented individuals and a younger workforce who are motivated to implement more modern technologies.

AI is not just a futuristic concept from science fiction; it's a rapidly evolving technology that's already shaping our lives.Defining AI: What Is It?At its core, AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and learning from experience.How AI Works: The Nuts and BoltsThe functioning of AI is built on two fundamental components: data and algorithms. AI systems process vast amounts of data and use complex mathematical algorithms to make predictions, decisions, or recommendations. The more data an AI system has, the better it can learn and improve its performance.Types of AI: From Narrow to GeneralAI can be categorized into two main types: Narrow or Weak AI, which is designed for specific tasks like voice recognition or chess-playing, and General or Strong AI, which has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. Currently, we have narrow AI in various applications, but we are still working toward achieving true general AI.Machine Learning: The Heart of AIMachine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It's like teaching a computer to recognize patterns and make sense of data on its own.Deep Learning: Mimicking the Human BrainDeep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks, inspired by the structure of the human brain. Deep learning has led to significant breakthroughs in areas like image and speech recognition.AI in Action: Everyday ApplicationsAI is already part of our daily lives. It powers virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, suggests content on streaming platforms, recommends products on e-commerce websites, and even assists in medical diagnoses. The possibilities are endless.The Future of AI: Opportunities and ChallengesThe future of AI is both exciting and challenging. As AI continues to advance, it holds the promise of solving complex problems and enhancing our lives. However, it also raises ethical and societal questions, such as privacy concerns and the impact on employment.Conclusion: AI - A Transformative ForceIn conclusion, Artificial Intelligence is a transformative force that is reshaping industries and our way of life.

Nathan McNeese of Clemson University started studying how people and artificial intelligence can best work together over a decade ago, long before ChatGPT and its chatbot kin took the world by storm. With many people just beginning to understand how AI shapes their lives, the technology is now entering a crucial juncture, said McNeese, the McQueen Quattlebaum Associate Professor of Human-Centered Computing. “Never before in history have we had the broader population interacting with AI like we are now, and that’s fundamentally going to change people’s perceptions of what that interaction looks like,” McNeese said. “It also means that we’re at a critical time period, where if these technologies are not researched and deployed responsibly, it will cause significant harm to how people view and use AI systems moving forward. “AI is one of the most significant societal opportunities in the history of the world, but it only comes to fruition if we ensure the safe and accurate design and implementation of these systems. And that design and implementation must always focus on humans.”



 McNeese’s research into human-AI teaming is helping put Clemson at the forefront of shaping the future of a powerful technology that has already begun to transform how people learn, work and live. His peers are recognizing his work. In the span of less than two months, McNeese received four high honors: a National Science Foundation CAREER Award; the William C. Howell Young  Investigator Award and the Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making Best Article Award, both from the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society; and the overall Outstanding Alumni Award from his alma mater, Penn State’s College of Information Sciences and Technology.
“In a remarkably short time, Nathan McNeese has achieved several significant milestones,” said Anand Gramopadhye, dean of the College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences. “These latest awards are stepping stones that have him on the path to becoming a leading figure in human-factors research. I offer him my wholehearted congratulations on all his success.” In an interview with IDEAS, McNeese described how developments such as ChatGPT have changed the landscape for his research and how his research can ensure AI benefits society.
For those not familiar with your work, how would you describe your research focus in layman’s terms?

Nathan McNeese, far right, poses for a photo with members of his research group and their robotic dog, Spot, and one of their drones.
We deal with two ends of the spectrum. There’s the very computational technical end of AI, which is algorithmic development. We ask, how do you make sense of that data through an algorithm, and how do you have an output, which is what we see as humans?  And then there’s the other side, which is the more humanistic side, and this probably is really where we made our name. We’re interested in understanding how humans perceive, interact with, are motivated by and are concerned about AI broadly speaking. What we try to do is reverse engineer those things and bring them back into the development of AI so that it takes into account the human and what humans want and perceive from AI. What are the big takeaways from your research so far? 
What we really focus on at the micro-level are the teaming aspects– human-AI collaboration– and we’ve seen a myriad of varied findings. It really depends on the human being. Some human beings are all for it, they will integrate with the AI, and the AI and the human interact efficiently. But then you’ll have other humans who are completely antithetical to this, where they want nothing to do with it. What are you finding about why some people like working with AI and some would rather not? Every individual, as a human being, is different. We are made up of different personalities, different desires, and various life experiences. That is dictating to a high degree how humans perceive AI and then how they will interact with AI. How humans perceive AI is incredibly important, because that then usually dictates how they interact with it. If they perceive the AI as a threat or untrustworthy, their interaction with it is not going to be one that is collaborative and communicative with high levels of interaction. But if they see the opposite of that, we see that they’re very willing to interact with it.  How have ChatGPT and other chatbots changed the landscape? 
What’s interesting is we’re hitting a tipping point, with things like ChatGPT and large language models coming to the forefront of society. Wide masses of people are now interacting with AI agents, and I am extremely excited about this because it’s a paradigm shift in my work. The past 10 years I’ve been studying humans interacting with AI. Broadly speaking, most of those humans have not interacted with AI. When they come into the lab, or they take a survey, or we have an interview, we’re speaking purely from a theoretical, conceptual level. Now with the introduction of things like large language models, where people’s grandparents are online playing with ChatGPT, we’re seeing a wave of new experience levels coming to the forefront. That’s going to change how people then perceive and interact with human-AI systems. What do you think the impact will be?
Never before in history have we had the broader population interacting with AI like we are now, and that’s fundamentally going to change people’s perceptions of what that interaction looks like. It also means that we’re at a critical time period, where if these technologies are not researched and deployed responsibly, it will cause significant harm to how people view and use AI systems moving forward. AI is one of the most significant societal opportunities in the history of the world, but it only comes to fruition if we ensure the safe and accurate design and implementation of these systems. And that design and implementation must always focus on humans. We have to get to the point where there are regulations to combat irresponsible AI development and deployment, the kind of models that cause disparate impact or treatment. There are a lot of people that are smarter than me that are saying this. We can’t get this wrong, right now, because it’ll end up being wrong forever, essentially, and I don’t think we’ll be able to come back from it. We have to do things the right way right now, or else it’s a wasted opportunity. 
Many have questions about the ethics and safety of AI. How does your work address those concerns? What safeguards do we need to have in place? In the human-AI teaming area, we were the first people in the world that ever approached ethics. We ask, how do you develop and build an ethical AI teammate? This becomes doubly important, because of the context and setting. It’s teamwork, which means that you have increased interaction. The frustrating fact about artificial intelligence is that artificial intelligence is based on data, and we have a lot of data– a lot of really bad data. If you go on social media, misinformation and hurtful opinions are everywhere. Unfortunately, all that gets captured. We are not fully to the level of being able to filter that information out and throw it in the trash. It usually gets put into the algorithm in terms of contributing to the algorithm itself, and that’s where you see things like racist algorithms. Our work sees humans as the best safeguard for this problem. As humans, we need to take an active role in shaping and designing these technologies to be a social good, and our work directly works with humans to facilitate this. What inspired you to get into AI, and what continues to drive your passion for the topic? I’ve always been interested in technology from a very young age. I used to take a lot of things apart and sometimes get into trouble with my parents. I mean, like, fully apart to the point where you can’t put it back together, because I was just interested in, what’s in that? I’ve always been just a curious person. Also, at an early age, I started studying teamwork– human-human teams. And then I figured out I love teamwork, and I love technology. I asked, how can I bring these two things together? It was fortuitous in that I started studying AI almost a decade ago, before the hype machine. I can’t get bored of AI because of how rapidly it’s developing. My full-time job is to be an expert on AI systems and on human-AI interaction, and I can’t keep up with it because the products and development from the AI spectrum are coming out every week. It’s a continual race, and I like that race.

A must-listen for lovers of fiction.Read more""We have been receiving phone calls and emails from Australian authors who've been dismayed and outraged to learn that their works have been appropriated without their permission,"" Lanchester says.Literary fiction by Margaret Atwood, Zadie Smith and Barbara Kingsolver, and books by Australian authors Geraldine Brooks, Liane Moriarty, Markus Zuzak and Robbie Arnott also feature in the collection.What is Books3 and what happened?In September, The Atlantic published a tool to search Books3 after reporter Alex Reisner identified author information for 183,000 of the 191,000 ISBNs he extracted from the dataset, used to train Meta's LLaMA, Bloomberg's BloombergGPT and EleutherAI's GPT-J.The Books3 creator, Shaun Presser, told The Atlantic he developed the dataset as a high-quality training resource for other independent developers to allow them to compete with tech giants such as OpenAI, which is believed to have trained ChatGPT using mystery datasets known as Books1 and Books2.The Silicon Valley wayIrish-born crime writer Dervla McTiernan was incensed to learn her bestselling crime novel, The Ruin (2018), was one of the thousands in the collection.""It's outright theft. People who stole all of these books … did it for the purposes of making money,"" she says. Companies like OpenAI and Meta ""are 100 per cent acting in their own self interest,"" says McTiernan, the author of four novels.(Supplied: HarperCollins/Julia Dunin)McTiernan, who lives in Perth, believes the companies knew the dataset contained stolen material.""They knew they were using pirated books, and they did so with gross indifference, and I think that's characteristic of the mentality of people who work in this industry,"" she says.""It was Facebook that had the motto … 'move fast and break things'. Well, we're the things that are being broken, and we're not very happy about it.""Weren't there other options?Professor Toby Walsh, Chief Scientist at UNSW's AI Institute, is one of Australia's leading AI experts.He was disappointed to find one of his books, Machines Behaving Badly: The Morality of AI (2022), in the Books3 dataset.""If you just want to train a chatbot to speak English, there are tens of thousands of books that are out of copyright that they could have used,"" he says.""It's typical of the cavalier way that people in Silicon Valley treat people's intellectual property."" Lanchester says more than 30 authors affected by the Books3 scandal have contacted the ASA.(Supplied: Olivia Lanchester)Lanchester agrees.""AI developers could have trained their systems on works that are in the public domain, or they could have sought a license from the copyright owners, but instead, they've ingested copyright works without seeking permission,"" she says.""This has been done disregarding copyright laws, and it's treating authors' works as though they're a public commodity, which ignores the fact that there's a real cost of creation and that licensing is how authors earn a living.""Lanchester says the ASA is not ""anti-technology"" but argues that tech companies should acknowledge the value of the authors' work in the development of generative AI tools.""They couldn't have built the AI systems they've built without high-quality inputs, and there was a real opportunity for authors' works to be licensed and for the creative and intellectual labour to be recognised. Instead, their works have just been appropriated,"" she says.Legal ramifications for AI overreachTech giants, including Meta and OpenAI, face several lawsuits in the US over their alleged use of authors' work without their permission.Two authors, Mona Awad and Paul Tremblay, filed a lawsuit against Open AI in July, claiming OpenAI used their copyrighted books to train ChatGPT without their consent. They say the AI tool generates ""very accurate summaries"" of their work.Other lawsuits have been filed against the tech companies by comedian Sarah Silverman and Michael Chabon, who won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.How will AI change our understanding of art?Read moreIn September, a group of high-profile authors, including George RR Martin, Jodi Picoult, John Grisham and Roxane Gay, filed a joint suit with the Authors Guild against OpenAI.While the suit accuses the company of ""systemic theft"" and ""mass copyright infringement"", OpenAI and Meta have claimed their use of authors' work amounts to ""fair use"".""This is a new way of using people's copyrighted material, and the courts have yet to decide whether it's fair use, whether it's within the bounds of the law or not,"" says Walsh.A meaningful threatLanchester says generative AI poses a direct threat to authors' livelihoods.""We're concerned that the market is going to be flooded with inferior AI-generated content.""A market crowded with AI material doesn't serve anyone. It makes discoverability harder for professional writers and lowers quality for consumers."" OpenAI, the tech giant behind AI-powered language model ChatGPT, is valued at US$90 billion. (Getty Images: Stockcam)McTiernan also questions the viability of a literary career in a marketplace dominated by AI.McTiernan says ChatGPT might be a ""bad writer"" now, but she worries that in three to five years, generative AI tools will be able to create works similar in character to contemporary authors that will be offered in direct competition with their original novels.""If [tech companies like Amazon, Apple and Meta] are able to generate their own books and stories, why would they sell anything else? Why would they give prominence in the market to any sort of competing efforts? I don't see why they would.""What will Australian authors do next?Writing is already a precarious occupation in Australia, where the average annual income for an author is $18,200.While McTiernan says the writers she has spoken to ""would love to have the opportunity to take action"", for many, it is not an option.""[Given] what authors are earning as a general rule in Australia, how many authors are in a position to fund or even contribute to the costs of litigation? Very few,"" McTiernan says.""This is, again, one of the situations we find these days where these massive wealthy companies can take this sort of action, almost with impunity, because they know the people that they're damaging most are not in a position to take action against them.""Talk books with us on FacebookThe ABC's place for readers to talk books — with each other, with books specialists from across the ABC, and with your favourite authors.Read moreLanchester says ASA intends to continue to advocate for authors.""We are advocating to the government and hoping there will be a pathway forward to negotiate licensing solutions with the tech sector,"" she says.""We're watching the US litigation brought by the Authors Guild with real interest and absolutely cheering those authors on, and … we're trying to get a handle on the number of Australian authors affected. We think that there will be many.""It's incredibly difficult because there are complex legal and jurisdictional issues to grapple with.""While Professor Walsh concedes the risks posed by AI may require specific regulation, he says existing laws governing intellectual property and privacy could be applied ""more forcibly to the tech space"" to rein in unlawful conduct.""I'm not sure that now the tech industry is such … a large component of our lives whether it can be left to be the free-for-all, to be the Wild West that it has been for the last 20 years.""Posted 28 Sep 202328 Sep 2023Thu 28 Sep 2023 at 6:50pm, updated 28 Sep 202328 Sep 2023Thu 28 Sep 2023 at 9:11pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesWhy Zadie Smith's new historical novel namechecks Wagga Wagga'Vibrant, nervy, electric': A guide to the 2023 Booker Prize shortlistA good ghostwriter leaves no trace: Who really wrote your favourite celebrity memoirMore on:Arts, Culture and EntertainmentAustraliaAuthorBooks (Literature)FictionLaw, Crime and JusticeNovelPerthScience and TechnologyUnited StatesTop StoriesSouth-east cold spell drove record demand for power and soaring wholesale pricesThese are the world's most powerful passports in 2024.

Jaishankar and Blinken discuss G20 and Economic Corridor's potential, no mention of Canada row
The statement issued by the US Department of State after the meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar made no mention of the killing of a Khalistani leaders in Canada's Surrey in July. The alleged murder of the separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, has triggered a diplomatic row between India and Canada.
According to Reuters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had earlier said he was sure US Secretary of State Antony Blinken would raise the murder of a Sikh separatist leader when he met his Indian counterpart on Thursday. However, the US statement had no mention of the issue.

Win some, lose some — Mapping BJP's friends and foes
You win some, you lose some. The proverb came to life this week as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) forged an alliance with the Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnataka, but lost its ally in Tamil Nadu. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) severed its four-year-old ties with the BJP, walking out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) months ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
The political churning are inevitable in both the NDA and the challenger INDIA Alliance given the high-stakes Lok Sabha battle next year. For BJP particularly, the break-up with the AIADMK is concerning given the party has been trying hard to build a strong presence in the southern states.

Generative AI won't cause job famine but will create more, says EXL CEO
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) will not lead to a job famine but will actually create many more new and exciting jobs, said the CEO of EXL, Rohit Kapoor.
Speaking exclusively to CNBC-TV18, Kapoor said, ""EXL is deploying generative AI to help clients increase productivity and is also looking to aid workers in helping customers make smarter decisions. We are aiming to use artificial intelligence to allow customers to self-help and find solutions"".
Highlighting the need for global coordination on AI regulations, Kapoor said that different regulations across jurisdictions could lead to errors and even biases in AI-generated results.

NDA-AIADMK breakup | The alliance was getting too high to bear for the Dravidian party
AIADMK apparently felt that BJP high command is deliberately ignoring its pleas to stop BJP State President Annamalai from passing derisive remarks against the Dravidian party's revered leaders and it realised that the cost of the alliance was getting too high to bear. Already AIADMK was being mocked as a 'slave party' of the BJP by the ruling DMK and its allies, and to silently bear the taunts was becoming a problem. The loss of minority votes because of the alliance and the fact that potential allies were also getting put off by the presence of BJP in the alliance were additional factors that led AIADMK to pull out from NDA, writes noted political observer and sports commentator Sumanth C Raman.

NDA-AIADMK breakup — here's why BJP unable to retain its long-time allies
The AIADMK announcing a formal break of ties with the BJP-led NDA creates a perception that the Bharatiya Janata Party is unable to hold together the alliance that it created. It also accentuated the fissures that developed between the AIADMK, one of the two prominent Dravidian parties, and the BJP, working to establish itself as a pan-India political party. How will it pan out?
