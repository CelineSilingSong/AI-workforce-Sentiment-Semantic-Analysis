Artificial Intelligence (AI) is disrupting businesses and job roles in every industry, causing concerns about long-term job security for low-skill manual jobs and management roles alike.
To prepare for this AI-driven economy, many experienced managers and seasoned executives are turning to MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) to upskill in foundational data analytics and AI. This trend is unlikely to slow down anytime soon: The global MOOC market is expected to grow from $3.9 billion in 2018 to $20.8 billion by 2023, a CAGR of 40.1 percent.
Business and technology-related courses make up 40 percent of these online courses. Many universities have also joined the drive to fill the AI leadership gap by offering high-touch executive education programs.
While upskilling programs are easily accessible, many executives are unsure how to leverage their newfound skills to advance their careers. Becoming an AI “practitioner” may not be the right option for some given the high technical bar for these roles. Others may rule out “juniorizing,” which could take them a few steps back in their career.
[ Learn how leaders are embracing enterprise-wide IT automation: Taking the lead on IT Automation. ]
3 ways to advance your career in AI
Organizational leaders who complete such programs commonly have three questions:

Can I transition into a technology leadership role spearheading organizational initiatives in AI?
How do I combine my functional leadership experience with my newly acquired AI skills?
What new roles are being created in today’s AI economy that I can pivot into mid-career?

These aren’t simple questions to answer, and mid-career transformations are never easy. Based on my experience mentoring individuals and helping companies embrace AI-related technologies, here are three strategies leaders can adopt to reshape their careers.
1. Pivot into a technology role leading AI across the organization
Enterprises are carving out AI Centers of Excellence and adding emerging senior roles such as Chief Data Officer (CDO) or Chief Analytics Officer (CAO) to spearhead data and analytics. Gartner found that digital transformation at 72 percent of organizations surveyed was led or heavily influenced by data executives such as CDO. Senior executives who have acquired AI skills can reinvent their careers, shifting into a technology-centric role by leading AI initiatives within the organization.
These organizational transformations require leaders who can envision and strategize how to infuse analytics into the core of a business. They also need excellent execution abilities to build data and analytics teams, ensure fair and ethical use of AI, and help promote data-driven decisions. Overall, the role calls for a good mix of thought leadership, emotional intelligence, and conflict resolution skills.
NewVantage Partners found that 49 percent of companies preferred staffing such emerging data-centric leadership roles from within, utilizing people who can act as internal change agents.
2. Raise your functional expertise by leveraging AI’s capabilities
Enterprises are implementing AI widely in both customer-facing offerings and internal operations. As companies become more analytics-driven, they need leaders who can champion AI-driven strategic initiatives within their function, promote collaboration across teams, and drive adoption by managing change. A critical differentiating attribute of these “AI orchestrators” is deep functional experience and a strong understanding of how to apply AI to generate business value.
When it comes to AI, most enterprises focus primarily on senior technology roles such as principal data scientist, AI manager, or chief analytics officer. However, success with AI is impossible without strong functional leadership. This lopsided focus could help explain one of the biggest challenges in AI today: While over 95 percent of organizations have invested in AI, only 26 percent report creating a data-driven organization. Business leaders must take the lead in selling their vision for AI, ensure collaboration across teams, and own the adoption of AI solutions in their business.
3. Think outside the box to create new organizational roles
Accenture’s global study of more than 1,000 large companies points to the emergence of three new categories of AI-related jobs:

Trainers work with machines and teach AI systems to work effectively and accurately.
Explainers provide clarity and bridge the gap between AI specialists and business leaders.
Sustainers help keep operations going by avoiding unintended consequences of AI-enabled automation. Managers and leaders with deep industry experience will be well poised for the emerging roles of explainers and sustainers.

Let’s take the example of a traditional loan manager whose primary job is to examine, evaluate, and process lines of credit. The rise of online loan origination platforms like Rocket Mortgage could make loan managers obsolete. However, the credit and lending regulatory framework in the U.S. is currently not structured to enforce fair AI.
These loan managers can complement their existing knowledge to become “loan explainers” or “loan ethics managers” – people who can explain why a customer’s loan was denied by a “black-box” machine learning algorithm, for example. Similarly, this role can help lenders avoid potential discrimination issues and ensure compliance with the fast-evolving regulatory guidelines around the use of AI.
Putting the strategies to work
Picking the appropriate strategy from the three described above depends on a number of factors – your career aspirations, opportunities at hand, and your appetite for risk. Senior managers and executives must get creative by fusing their current strengths with newly acquired AI skills to lead in the age of AI.
It’s worth noting that leaders needn’t be constrained by opportunities that exist within an organization; they can pursue entrepreneurial opportunities in their industry. Right in the middle of the pandemic, venture capital funds have globally invested a record $268B in 2021. Startups can be an attractive proposition for experienced managers who combine a deep understanding of the industry’s under-served needs and customer pain points with the new possibilities unlocked by AI.
Power your AI career transformation by bolstering your credibility
Today, career transformations are facilitated by easy access to upskilling programs, abundant social platforms to network with peers, and accessible ways to build a strong personal identity.

Leaders are often advised to build a personal brand through LinkedIn presence, news bytes in articles, and event participation. And while an engaging personal brand might make your profile attractive and get you more likes on social media posts, strong personal credibility will help connect deeply with people who believe in your work.
To boost your credibility, network with an intent to add value, develop a strong point of view on the application of AI to business, and be able to articulate your ideas in a compelling way. For example, the AI space is nascent and yet to see heavy regulations (though it badly needs them). If you have an opinion on how organizations and the community can responsibly adopt AI, share it. Engage in participatory regulations on the use of AI in your industry.
Building personal credibility takes time and effort. Ensure you learn continuously, engage consistently, and establish a coherent footprint. This can lead to better career options and a more fulfilling career.

What Is Super AI?
Artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a form of AI that is capable of surpassing human intelligence by manifesting cognitive skills and developing thinking skills of its own.
Also known as super AI, artificial superintelligence is considered the most advanced, powerful, and intelligent type of AI that transcends the intelligence of some of the brightest minds, such as Albert Einstein.
Human-like Capabilities of Super AI
Machines with superintelligence are self-aware and can think of abstractions and interpretations that humans cannot. This is because the human brain’s thinking ability is limited to a set of a few billion neurons. Apart from replicating multi-faceted human behavioral intelligence, ASI can also understand and interpret human emotions and experiences. ASI develops emotional understanding, beliefs, and desires of its own, based on the comprehension capability of the AI.
ASI finds application in virtually all domains of human interests, be it math, science, arts, sports, medicine, marketing, or even emotional relations. An ASI system can perform all the tasks humans can, from defining a new mathematical theorem for a problem to exploring physics law while venturing into outer space.
ASI systems can quickly understand, analyze, and process circumstances to stimulate actions. As a result, the decision-making and problem-solving capabilities of super-intelligent machines are expected to be more precise than humans.
Currently, superintelligence is a theoretical possibility rather than a practical reality as most of the development today in computer science, and AI is inclined toward artificial narrow intelligence (ANI). This implies that AI programs are designed to solve only specific problems. 
Machine learning and deep learning algorithms are further advancing such programs by utilizing neural networks as the algorithms learn from the results to iterate and improve upon themselves. Thus, such algorithms process data more effectively than previous AI versions. However, despite the advancements in neural nets, these models can only solve problems at hand, unlike human intelligence.
Engineers, AI researchers, and practitioners are developing technology and machines with artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is expected to pave the way for ASI development. Although there have been significant developments in the area, such as IBM’s Watson supercomputer and Apple’s Siri, today’s computers cannot fully simulate and achieve an average human’s cognitive abilities and capabilities.

Typical characteristics of ASI
Luminaries in AI are still skeptical about the progression and sustainability of ASI in the long run. According to a recent study published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research in January 2021, researchers from premier institutes such as the Max Planck Institute concluded that it would be almost impossible for humans to contain super AIs.
The team of researchers explored the recent developments in machine learning, computational capabilities, and self-aware algorithms to map out the true potential of super-intelligent AI. They then performed experiments to test the system against some known theorems to evaluate whether containing it is feasible, if at all possible.
Nevertheless, if accomplished, superintelligence will usher a new era in technology with the potential to initiate another industrial revolution at a jaw-dropping pace. Some of the typical characteristics of ASI that will set it apart from other technologies and forms of intelligence include:

ASI will be one of the finest and possibly the last inventions that humans would ever need to make as it will constantly evolve to become more intelligent.
Superintelligence will accelerate technological progress across various fields such as AI programming, space research, discovery and development of medicines, academics, and plenty others.
ASI may further mature and develop advanced forms of superintelligence that may even enable artificial minds to be copied.
ASI, in the future, may also lead to technological singularity.

Potential Threats of Super AI Systems
While artificial superintelligence has numerous followers and supporters, many theorists and technological researchers have cautioned on the idea of machines surpassing human intelligence. They believe that such an advanced form of intelligence could lead to a global catastrophe, as shown in several Hollywood movies such as Star Trek and Matrix. Moreover, even technology experts such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk are apprehensive about ASI and consider it a threat to humanity.
Here are some of the potential threats of superintelligence.
Potential Threats of Super AI
1. Loss of control and understanding
One potential danger of superintelligence that has received a lot of attention from experts worldwide is that ASI systems could use their power and capabilities to carry out unforeseen actions, outperform human intellect, and eventually become unstoppable. Advanced computer science, cognitive science, nanotechnology, and brain emulations have achieved greater-than-human machine intelligence. 
If something goes wrong with any one of these systems, we won’t be in a position to contain them once they emerge. Moreover, predicting the system’s response to our requests will be very difficult. Loss of control and understanding can thus lead to the destruction of the human race altogether.
2. The weaponization of super AI
Today, it seems logical enough to think that highly advanced AI systems could potentially be used for social control or weaponization. Governments around the world are already using AI to strengthen their military operations. However, the addition of weaponized and conscious superintelligence could only transform and impact warfare negatively. 
Additionally, if such systems are unregulated, they could have dire consequences. Superhuman capabilities in programming, research & development, strategic planning, social influence, and cybersecurity could self-evolve and take positions that could become detrimental to humans.
3. Failure to align human and AI goals
Super AI can be programmed to our advantage; however, there lies a non-zero probability of super AI developing a destructive method to achieve its goals. Such a situation may arise when we fail to align our AI goals. For example, if you give a command to an intelligent car to drive you to the airport as fast as possible, it might get you to the destination but may use its own route to comply with the time constraint.
Similarly, if a super AI system is assigned a critical geoengineering project, it may disturb the overall ecosystem while completing the project. Moreover, any human attempt to stop the super AI system may be viewed by it as a threat to achieving its goals, which wouldn’t be an ideal situation to be in.
4. Malevolent superintelligence
The successful and safe development of AGI and superintelligence can be ensured by teaching it the aspects of human morality. However, ASI systems can be exploited by governments, corporations, and even sociopaths for various reasons, such as oppressing certain societal groups. Thus, superintelligence in the wrong hands can be devastating.
5. The danger of nuclear attacks
With ASI, autonomous weapons, drones, and robots could acquire significant power. The danger of nuclear attacks is another potential threat of superintelligence. Enemy nations can attack countries with technological supremacy in AGI or superintelligence with advanced and autonomous nuclear weapons, ultimately leading to destruction.
6. Ethical implications
Super-intelligent AI systems are programmed with a predetermined set of moral considerations. The problem is humanity has never agreed upon a standard moral code and has lacked an all-encompassing ethical theory. As a result, teaching human ethics and values to ASI systems can be quite complex.
Super-intelligent AI can have serious ethical complications, especially if AI exceeds the human intellect but is not programmed with the moral and ethical values that coincide with human society.

Potential Advantages of Super AI
Artificial superintelligence is an emerging technology that simulates human reasoning, emotions, and experiences in AI systems. Although detractors continue to debate the existential risks of super AI, the technology seems to be very beneficial as it can revolutionize any professional sector.
Let’s look at the potential advantages of super AI.
Potential Advantages of Super AI
1. Reduction in human error
It’s human to make errors. Computers, or machines, when appropriately programmed, can considerably reduce the instances of these mistakes. Consider the field of programming and development. Programming is a time- and resource-consuming process that demands logical, critical, and innovative thinking. 
Human programmers and developers often encounter syntactical, logical, arithmetic, and resource errors. Super AI can be helpful here as it can access millions of programs, build logic from the available data on its own, compile and debug programs, and at the same time, keep programming errors to a minimum.
2. Replace humans to accomplish risky tasks 
One of the most significant advantages of super AI is that the risk limitations of humans can be overcome by deploying super-intelligent robots to accomplish dangerous tasks. These can include defusing a bomb, exploring the deepest parts of the oceans, coal and oil mining, or even dealing with the consequences of natural or human-induced disasters.
Consider the Chernobyl nuclear disaster that occurred in 1986. At the time, AI-powered robots were not yet invented. The nuclear power plant’s radiation was so intense that it could kill any human who went close to the core in a matter of minutes. Authorities were forced to use helicopters to pour sand and boron from a distance above. 
However, with significant technological advancements, superintelligent robots can be deployed in such situations where salvage operations can be carried out without any human intervention.
3. 24×7 Availability
Although most humans work for 6 to 8 hours a day, we need some time out to recuperate and get ready for work the very next day. We also need weekly offs to keep a healthy work-life balance. However, using super AI, we can program machines to work 24×7 without any breaks.
For example, educational institutes have helpline centers that receive several queries daily. This can be effectively handled using super AI, providing query-specific solutions round the clock. Super AI can also offer subjective student counseling sessions to academic institutions.
4. Explore new science frontiers
Super AI can facilitate space exploration, as the technical challenges in developing a city on Mars, interstellar space travel, and even interplanetary travel can be addressed by the problem-solving capabilities of advanced AI systems. 
With a thinking ability of its own, super AI can be effectively used to test and estimate the success probabilities of many equations, theories, researches, rocket launches, and space missions. Organizations such as NASA, SpaceX, ISRO, and others are already using AI-powered systems and supercomputers such as the Pleiades to expand their space research efforts.
5. Medical advances
The development of super AI can also benefit the healthcare industry vertical significantly. It can play a pivotal role in drug discovery, vaccine development, and drug delivery. A 2020 research paper by Nature revealed the design and use of miniaturized intelligent nanobots for intracellular drug delivery. 
AI applications in healthcare for vaccine and drug delivery are already a reality today. Moreover, with the addition of conscious superintelligence, the discovery and delivery of new strains of medicines will become much more effective.

5 Key Trends for Super AI Advancements in 2022
Post-pandemic, we have witnessed accelerated adoption of AI and ML across industries. Moreover, automation, coupled with AI hardware and software developments, further pushes the super AI envelope. Although ASI is still in its infancy stage, recent AI trends will almost certainly lay the foundation for advanced AI systems in the future.
Let’s look at the five key AI trends that will speed up super AI advancements in 2022.
2022 Trends for Super AI Advancements
1. Development of large language models (LLMs)
Language models use NLP techniques and algorithms to predict the occurrence of a sequence of words in a sentence. Such models are expert systems that can summarize textual data and create visual charts from those very texts.
LLM models are trained on massive datasets. Popular examples of LLMs include OpenAIs GPT-2 and GPT-3 and Google’s BERT. Similarly, Naver, a South Korean company, has built a comprehensive AI-based Korean language model, HyperCLOVA. These models can generate simple essays, develop next-generation conversation AI tools, and even design complex financial models for corporations.
2. Advancements in multimodal AI
Deep learning algorithms have trained the underlying models on a single data source. For example, an NLP model is trained on the text data source, while a computer vision model is trained on an image dataset. Similarly, an acoustic model uses wake word detection and noise cancellation parameters to handle speech. The type of ML employed here is a single modal AI as the model outcome is mapped to one source of data type—text, images, and speech.
On the other hand, Multimodal AI combines visual and speech modalities to create scenarios that match human perception. DALL-E from OpenAI is a recent example of multimodal AI-generated images from texts. Google’s multimodal AI – multitask unified model (MUM) – helps enhance the user search experience since the search results are shortlisted by considering contextual information mined from 75 different languages. Another example is NVIDIA’s GauGAN2 model, which generates photo-realistic images from text inputs. It uses text-to-image generation to develop the finest photorealistic art.
3. AI-driven programming
There has been significant development in AI-driven programming in the last couple of years. Several tools such as Amazon CodeGuru have provided relevant recommendations to improve overall code quality by determining the application’s costly code. Moreover, recently, GitHub and OpenAI launched ‘Github Copilot’ as an ‘AI pair programmer’ to help programmers and developers write efficient code. Another example comes from Salesforce, where CodeT5 has been launched as an open-source project to assist programmers with AI-powered coding.
Thus, advancements in LLMs and wider availability of open source code will promote intelligent code generation, which will be compact and high quality. Additionally, such systems will also translate code from one language to another, opening up an application’s code to a broader community. 
4. Vertical integration of AI solutions
Top AI vendors such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft now commercialize their AI-based products. Amazon Connect and Google Contact Center AI are efforts for better contact center management. Both products leverage ML capabilities that offer automated assistance to contact center agents and drive conversations through bots. 
Moreover, Microsoft’s Azure Percept provides computer vision and conversational AI capabilities at the edge. It is based on IoT, AI, and edge computing services on Azure. The convergence of all these technologies, cutting-edge research in LLMs, and conversational and multimodal AIs will make the development of super AI possible in 2022.
5. AI-generated inventions
AI is already powering inventions in almost every domain, from creating music, art, and literature to developing scientific theories. Recently, DABUS, an artificial inventive machine, came up with ideas for two patentable inventions. While the first invention relates to a device that attracts attention and is helpful in search and rescue operations, the second is a type of beverage container. 
Moreover, it has been observed that the DABUS machine also has an emotional appreciation for whatever ideas it conceives. With advanced AI systems in place, the number of such inventions that solve complex problems can considerably increase over the coming years.
Progress in multimodal AI will give rise to the next wave in ‘creative AI,’ where AI-generated images, infographics, and even videos will be realized.

Takeaway
Although the scope of artificial superintelligence is yet to be fully realized, it has garnered immense attention from researchers worldwide. ASI brings numerous risks to the table, yet AI practitioners feel achieving it will be a significant accomplishment for humanity, as it may allow us to unravel the fascinating mysteries of the universe and beyond.
Today, the future of super AI looks extremely bright, despite the uncertainty and fear revolving around its unpredictable nature and the dire consequences that malevolent superintelligence may throw at us. The coming decades will reveal the true nature of superintelligence and whether it will prove to be a boon or bane to humanity.

Women's day and Women's History Month are especially meaningful to me as a proud father of a daughter. I want my daughter to understand how wonderful and invaluable she is, not only to me and her mother, but also to everyone else in the world. Second, I want her to be exposed to amazing women who are accomplishing great things on a daily basis. I live, work and breathe AI and Technology. Through my work and research, I have encountered the work of countless amazing women in this sector. This month, I'd like to introduce you to nine incredible women who are making a difference in AI and Technology, as well as what barriers we all still face. During International Women's History Month, it is our pleasure to highlight and honor 9 women who are pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence and ensuring that technology advancements contribute to the greater good. 


The following is the first of ten articles in this series. This piece will center on the nine women I've spoken with over the last few weeks and their suggestions for other female professionals, young women, and girls who want to pursue a career in artificial intelligence, as well as what changes they see that must be addressed for true equality in the AI and technology field. The subsequent nine articles will feature the in-depth conversations we had.

If we truly believe that gender diversity positively affects outcomes in the tech industry, which I believe to be true, then I think the right thing to do is to focus on fixing the supply chain of women into these roles. We must start from very early education, and encourage little girls and young women to consider jobs in technology and national security as potential career options.

I see people who care about gender diversity, and they try to include women on panels, or they make an effort to hire women into certain jobs. But the issue is that there are not enough qualified candidates to go around. That's where we need to put our attention. We need to make sure that the supply chain is fixed, that we have a diverse set of talented individuals with whom we can collaborate.

I think what is women-specific is the need to have mentors, make connections, and see leaders in that role that look like them. We need to build up girls' confidence that these jobs are attainable, build their capabilities starting from a young age, and encourage them to pursue places where they belong.

What I want for my girls is to have the freedom of choice. Ultimately I want them to be aware of the opportunities available to them and to have the skills and the confidence to take advantage of those opportunities. I want them to be in touch with their talents and passions, to pursue those options that reflect their capabilities and interests. I want them to be able to do so free of societal expectations, be it around careers that may be deemed appropriate or inappropriate or about choices they make in their personal lives. I want them to be treated fairly and respectfully in the workplace and society.

To quote an old veteran in the space, there’s no other choice but to ‘lean in’. And while we’re making progress, the technology space has more room to evolve.
We have talented women everywhere, women who have worked really hard to perfect their craft, and sometimes they get faulted for prioritizing perfection over progress, sometimes they get reminded to stay in their swim lane, and sometimes their boldness is considered a fault vs virtue. While my experience may not align with all women in tech and their journey, what I have witnessed is, the way we’re able to lean in and lead is because we had that 1 leader, that 1 sponsor, and/or 1 person with influence to create a runway for us. And with that came opportunity, then success and then awareness of the talent.
So my 1st advice to women would be, know who you are and choose if you want to be a thermometer or thermostat? Are your aspirations to read the temperature in the room, or to create the temperature in the room? Because if it's the latter, be prepared for pushback. As this space requires a special backbone and not a wishbone. Change is hard, if it was easy it would have happened by now. So it requires a certain level of confidence and conviction to lead and you need to be prepared.
My 2nd advice would be … get comfortable with being uncomfortable. You lean in, you trip, you fall, you learn. That's okay. With each step forward you learn, the ‘ups and downs’ are the majority of the journey.
My 3rd advice would be, find that 1 person that believes in you! And co-create the opportunity and the aspirations together. You need that guardian on your side.
My 4th advice would be … if you get an opportunity to perfect your public speaking skills, take advantage of it. Get over that fear because once you do, that’s where the opportunities become boundaryless. I've seen some phenomenal women leaders who just aren't afraid to just get in there. I’ve followed their lead, and it’s opened up more doors than I can count.
 “Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. You lean in, you trip, you fall, you learn. That's okay. With each step forward you learn, the ‘ups and downs’ are the majority of the journey.” Sol Rashidi

Atti Riazi, Senior Vice President and CIO, DigITs Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer CenterAtefeh (Atti) Riazi CIO at Memorial Sloan KetteringAtti Riazi
A senior executive and philanthropist, Atefeh (Atti) Riazi has served in both the public and private sectors as a CIO, managing large‐scale technology projects and initiatives. She is presently the CIO at Memorial Sloan Kettering, which she joined in 2020. Prior to this role, she was appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to serve as the Assistant Secretary-General and Chief Information Technology Officer of the UN. 
Today we have 82 percent men and 18 percent women in the tech sector.
Getting girls and women to shift from being consumers of tech to contributors is critical. The sector is lopsided, and therefore does not fully understand its consumer base, nor does it take women’s views or perspectives into account in the design and operation of what it creates. Moreover, the digital gender divide leaves girls behind—and minority girls in particular. Those without access to training in tech will increasingly be forced to opt out of the global economy, leaving them walled-off in the informal sector and poverty.
There are three fundamental factors that must be countered to attract more women to the tech world: 1)We raise girls and boys differently from birth—we have girls play with dolls, while boys build things with Legos; 2) There is a very dry approach in teaching math and sciences, causing girls to lose interest early on; and 3) The geek mythology promoted by media seriously influences women’s views of the sector. I have two daughters and have witnessed all the social and media pressures on them that could negatively impact their views of all STEM fields. And so we can start with reorienting the family and the schools. Media behavior may follow accordingly. (And further along, we can, say, better support women’s global entrepreneurship by shifting from microfinancing to macro-financing).
Women care immensely about the impact and experience of tech. They want to use technology to improve education and healthcare globally and close the gender gap. They long for clean air, oceans, and rivers. They want to ensure wealth equity. Women care about peace and security, accessibility, and food security. We can use artificial intelligence and machine learning to help achieve many of these goals.
We can also use AI to end humanity. This new world will pose many new questions, possibilities, and risks that we must collectively prepare for, and so a balanced view and perspective is essential. We need women to become engaged, get involved, and participate in the new world we are creating.
“Our education system doesn't support girls who favor math or like engineering. And the way the media portrays girls and boys in technology is completely skewed. We have so many fundamental issues - the education sector, the family pressures, the media. We need to begin to address every one of them.” Atti Riazi

Increasing female representation in tech is essential for equality. Women have historically been underrepresented in STEM fields, and still are today. It’s a problem for many reasons. Women are not an equal part of creating the technology that increasingly shapes our lives, and are being left behind in the job market. But other than that, it’s also about creating better tech! The world needs more brains, more creativity and more perspectives in the development of the technology of tomorrow. We can’t afford missing out on so much female brain power!
I can’t stress enough the importance of encouraging more women to pursue a career in AI. I believe it is crucial that more women enter the field, both in technical and non-technical roles. I always claim that “responsible AI is better AI”. In the same way, diverse AI is better AI. Diversity in AI teams, and diverse perspectives in the development of AI is key to address challenges like algorithmic bias. A multitude of perspectives also opens up for a multitude of new ideas.

Dr. Vivienne Ming explores maximizing human capacity as a theoretical neuroscientist, delusional inventor, and demented author. Over her career she’s founded 6 startups, been chief scientist at 2 others, and launched the “mad science incubator”, Socos Labs, where she explores seemingly intractable problems—from a lone child’s disability to global economic inclusion—for free. As the co-founder and Chief Scientist of Dionysus Health she applies machine learning to lessen the corrosive health effects of chronic stress in communities.
We're all human, and being human means we're biased and we make mistakes and we fail. For that matter, being a thinking thing, including any kind of machine learning in any relevant domain also means it's biased and it has failure.
I've had a lot of transformations in my life. I've seen what it's like to be a man and a woman. I have been homeless and I've founded companies. Those don't seem like they go together, but they're my personal experience. My son had type 1 diabetes, and I was shocked that it was still handwritten notes and doctors squinting. Not that I appreciated it at the time, but I built the first AI to treat diabetes by hacking his equipment. Part of what that gives me is this very, maybe irrational, this absurd notion that I can change the world. We are not one thing and we don't have to be that thing

Linda is the strategic voice, and visionary for data and analytics at Verizon, focused on using the power of data and AI across the enterprise. Linda joined Verizon in September 2019 and has grown the AI & Data organization to approaching 1,000 contributors by the end of 2021, including teams dedicated to Data Governance, Data Architecture and Engineering, and an AI Center, covering a broad range of disciplines from AI Ethics to Industrialization and Digital Twins.
I’ve been involved in many efforts and interventions to bring more women into STEM and advance their careers. But, while we have managed to move the needle over a 50 year period– according to the last U.S. Census, women now represent 27% of the STEM workforce, up from 8% in 1970– the underrepresentation is still pretty vast, with women now representing approximately half of the workforce.
But, at the end of the day, the right incentives need to be there for a change. Without leaders having real accountability– the kind of accountability that impacts compensation and advancement– it will continue to be difficult to affect workplace cultural changes that make STEM attractive to women.
Unfortunately, we continue to see news reports of women experiencing hostile work environments in the technology field. This is very real. I know women who have altered their career courses because of the hostility they faced at their respective workplaces. And, frankly, the time commitments in this field can be brutal to meet deadlines and create the optics to appear dedicated.
We all see a profound thinning of the ranks of women as the STEM roles become more senior. It’s known that this is partially due to the demands on women as caretakers increasing and they're opting out of careers that don’t provide enough flexibility for them to manage their lives in full. But, I also believe there is the perception that women are not living up to some unwritten ideal that allows men to move up in their careers. And this elusive ideal causes women to be uncomfortable in bringing their authentic selves into the workplace. And, that is not an attractive proposition for anyone.
But, interestingly enough, I have some strong optimism coming out of the flexible work arrangements that have emerged during our pandemic lockdowns. Homelife and work-life have become more integrated, making a world of difference to the many women facing the demands of being the primary caretaker.
Our tolerance of home life entering the professional frame has changed enormously. I think that with the kids climbing on our laps and the dogs barking, and the leaf blowers in the background, we’ve all been forced towards greater authenticity and more 3-D views of each other. And, with often both spouses at home, there have been some shifts in the division of household labor.
So, I am optimistic about positive change here in the STEM workplace culture– possibly enough to tip the balance if we don’t let go of it.

The lack of women in technology has been a challenge for several decades, and in a way, we have inherited that problem with AI. Fortunately, the good news is unlike traditional software engineering roles where you need to know coding, AI has opened up plenty of critical roles that do not need coding. Good AI is not built just by data scientists and data engineers – they need a robust team of subject matter experts with domain knowledge leading and helping throughout the process – from ideation to design, development, and scaling.
AI actually, not only provides more pathways than any other technology but also provides tools and solutions to increase diversity. And we need to raise awareness amongst women in the workforce currently and also, those who are still in schools and colleges – about the myriad of pathways to become a part of AI teams. Yes, there will always be a need for data scientists and engineers, but there is also increasing demand for the other skill sets. If we do this right, I truly believe that we can get more women in AI.

Women always are inspired or motivated by not only challenges but also by consternation. I keep teaching this to my fellow women colleagues, and then my team, and also to my children. I teach how to stand up and walk again after a fall.
This is the main principle, in Silicon Valley specifically, that you could fail. It's okay to fail. You could fail many times, but then you dust off to get up again, and you try again, and you become resilient. You become a better version of yourself, and add to your experiences, and eventually, you succeed. It doesn't matter what age, or which stage of life. But you will succeed if you have the perseverance.

The first thing that women should be doing is exploring roles outside of pure computer science or data science. Look at all the fields that are impacted by technology or that can be impacted by advancements in technology and AI.
Women are doing amazing things combining arts, design, and AI. For example, there are women at the center for collaborative arts at Yale doing incredible work in creative arts and understanding how the brain works using data visualization. There is so much more to AI and technology. Do some research and find those women working in interdisciplinary roles and learn about their journeys.
“I encourage women to look at all aspects of technology, beyond computer science. For example, there is amazing work happening at MIT media lab and the center for collaborative arts at Yale. Women are doing amazing work in combining the arts, design, and STEM fields to make technology effective and accessible to the world. Find a field that really interests you and discover how it applies to technology, you’ll be pleasantly surprised!” Andrea Gallego
These words of guidance are tremendous for not only women and girls, but boys and grown men. We should all lean in, listen, and think about what was said. Only then can we strive to be a part of the future rather than cling to the past ways. I look forward to sharing the in-depth conversations I had with all of these women throughout Women’s History Month. In a very short time, I have learned a tremendous deal from these women, and I hope you will as well.

Prompts: The painter/A photograph/The future of art — made on Dream“You don’t take a photograph, you make it.”— Ansel AdamsPhotography wasn’t considered an art in the beginning. It was promptly embraced by the general public but was perceived as a mechanistic way to record the fleeting moments of life. It was a skill, a matter of technical ability, not an art.Yet it changed our relationship with art as we knew it. It liberated painters from the task of capturing reality as it is. It allowed them to move, free of ties, in the vast latent space that art offers. They could focus on the abstract, on painting ideas to transmit feelings that photos fail to catch. They could break the rules and explore the limits of what’s possible, finding meaning in questions that only exist within us.Photography also democratized the access to paintings — as taking a snapshot of reality was suddenly a matter of minutes and not days. At the same time, at least in the view of the elites, it cheapened the unique talent-based beauty of hand-made paintings. Not everyone was happy, but technology always finds a way. Photography came to stay and most will now agree with Adams’ quote above: Photography is art.",http://schema.org,,NewsArticle,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-artists-are-redefining-art-with-generative-ai-38b0a620e6d3,How Artists Are Redefining Art with Generative AI - Towards Data Science,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*sVfkq0MpV-2S0CtMq57FQA.jpeg'],2022-03-10T18:42:38.125Z,2022-03-12T02:45:42.945Z,False,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Alberto Romero', 'url': 'https://albertoromgar.medium.com'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Towards Data Science', 'url': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 192, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:384/1*cFFKn8rFH4ZndmaYeAs6iQ.png'}}",https://towardsdatascience.com/how-artists-are-redefining-art-with-generative-ai-38b0a620e6d3,,How Artists Are Redefining Art with Generative AI - Towards Data Science,,2022-03-10T18:42:38.125Z,38b0a620e6d3,['Alberto Romero'],"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.meteredContent'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And yes, they considered the ethical concerns.Photograph: Brownie Harris/Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveBack in 1982, Andy Warhol was, somewhat infamously, turned into a robot. The machine was made by a Disney Imagineering veteran for a project that never really took off, but Warhol liked his animatronic self. “Machines have less problems,” he once said. “I’d like to be a machine, wouldn’t you?” The artist, who died in 1987, was a master of his own cult of personality, and the robot was practically a manifestation of how the world perceived him: meticulously crafted, if a bit rigid and monotone in his conversational style.SynthesisAre These the Hidden Deepfakes in the Anthony Bourdain Movie?Tom SimoniteI, TruffautAI Made a Movie—and the Results Are Horrifyingly EncouragingLauren GoodeMona LisaDeepfakes Are Getting Better, But They're Still Easy to SpotGregory BarberAndrew Rossi knows this. It’s part of the reason the filmmaker felt OK letting an artificially intelligent machine speak for Warhol in his new documentary series for Netflix. Based on a book of the same name, the six-part documentary The Andy Warhol Diaries is partially narrated by an AI reading the stories that the artist told diarist Pat Hackett. The voice sounds just like Warhol—and then you remember the voice the world knew was always a flat and robotic one. Warhol’s work is about questioning iconography and surface-level appeal. He kept his voice flat to maintain that image, to belie how much heart he actually put into it, Rossi says, adding “when he spoke, he continued this superficial performance that was also part of the way he dressed and the way he made art.”Even still, using an AI voice to speak for a beloved cultural figure—or anyone, really—isn’t without ethical quandaries. Rossi was already editing The Andy Warhol Diaries last summer when controversy erupted around director Morgan Neville using AI to recreate the voice of Anthony Bourdain for his doc Roadrunner. Rossi had been in consultation with the Andy Warhol Foundation about the AI recreation, and the Bourdain doc inspired a disclaimer that now appears a few minutes into Diaries stating that the voice was created with the Foundation’s permission. “When Andrew shared the idea of using an AI voice, I thought, ‘Wow, this is as bold as it is smart,’” says Michael Dayton Hermann, the foundation’s head of licensing.The Andy Warhol Diaries debuts Wednesday on Netflix.
Courtesy of NetflixBy being upfront, Rossi’s documentary avoids one of the big issues Roadrunner faced. Viewers know from the start that what they’re hearing is computer-generated; whereas a lot of the backlash Neville faced came because his deepfake wasn’t initially disclosed. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t still many unanswered questions about when it is and isn’t acceptable to recreate someone’s voice with a machine. In the Bourdain documentary, the words the AI speaks were actually written by the late chef, but there aren’t real recordings of him saying them. For Diaries, Warhol did once speak all the things the AI Andy says—he told them to Hackett—but they weren’t recorded at the time. Do these caveats make a difference? Both of those documentaries used AI because their subjects were deceased. Presumably, there would be a different set of ethical concerns if they were living. What if it wasn’t just the voices that were recreated? What if their likenesses were, too? AI and other technologies are improving to a point where digital effects can practically create whole performances. The question soon will be whether they should.Trending NowResearcher Explains Deepfake VideosZohaib Ahmed thinks about these things a lot. The CEO of Resemble AI, he’s the one Rossi turned to in order to create Warhol’s voice. But before Ahmed even signed on to the project, he made sure the Warhol Foundation had given consent. Generally, Resemble AI works with the voices of people who are still alive—largely making automated voice responses for call centers and the like—but the company says it remains strict about guidelines. “[Warhol’s] diaries are written in a really interesting way, almost like they’re meant to be read aloud. They’re in his voice,” Ahmed says. “It’s almost like this was an extension of Andy’s work, so we weren’t creating something that was an ethical dilemma for us.”So the project for the pair felt ethical, but not easy. For one, there was that voice Warhol crafted for himself—a monotone built from his Pittsburgh upbringing and years in the New York City art scene. For another, Ahmed and his team didn’t have a lot of that voice to work with. When the company started, it only had about 3 minutes and 12 seconds of audio data—and needed to create a voice that could read about 30 pages of text. To do that, Resemble’s AI engine used the characteristics—or phonemes—of Warhol’s voice that were in that dataset to predict the phonemes that weren’t in order to create a fairly full voice. That voice was then loaded into the company’s web platform, where users—in this case, Rossi—could type in what they want the voice to say and then ask the AI to make adjustments until it sounds the way they want it to. Being able to have that human involvement, Ahmed says, is “really powerful.” It even allowed Rossi to shift the emotion or have Warhol say words that required an accent—like, for example, the name of his friend and collaborator Jean-Michel Basquiat.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyGearThe 209 Best Prime Day Deals, Tested and Tracked By Our TeamBy Scott GilbertsonPoliticsThe Right Is Blaming Women and DEI for the Secret Service’s Failure in Trump ShootingBy David GilbertSecurityHackers Claim to Have Leaked 1.1 TB of Disney Slack MessagesBy Lily Hay NewmanAdvertisementUltimately, the AI didn’t do quite everything based on just those few minutes. Along the way, Rossi brought in actor Bill Irwin to record some lines in a Warhol voice to help the machine learn the proper delivery. “We tried models combining 80 to 75 percent of the AI voices and 20 to 15 percent of Bill’s performance,” Rossi says. “In the end, Andy’s voice throughout the series presents a variation of ranges on this interpolated model.” Some words—“quaalude,” for example, or “Rorschach test” needed more pitch modulation, and sometimes Rossi inserted sounds into the algorithm phonetically, forcing the AI to say things a certain way through creative spelling. “Bear in mind,” the director says, “this is for Andy, who has a Pittsburgh accent but is delivering names and locations over the phone as a veteran New Yorker.”The Andy Warhol Diaries, then, serves as a reminder of what could be possible. It doesn’t fully answer all the questions currently swirling around the ethics of using AI to bring back long-lost luminaries—but it does demonstrate how close the technology can get to recreating the past while also being transparent about what exactly it is. “When I first heard the AI-created voice,” Hermann says, “I felt confident it was going to be an incredibly effective way to bring Warhol’s diaries to life and humanize the enigmatic artist.” Maybe, in other words, a robot can help us understand him better than anything.More Great WIRED Stories📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!They were “calling to help.” Then they stole thousandsThe pandemic tanked rates of childhood vaccinationThe most intriguing launches at MWC 2022Elden Ring is the game of the yearToday's startups are flush with cash—and frugal👁️ Explore AI like never before with our new database🎧 Things not sounding right?

He kept his voice flat to maintain that image, to belie how much heart he actually put into it, Rossi says, adding “when he spoke, he continued this superficial performance that was also part of the way he dressed and the way he made art.”
Even still, using an AI voice to speak for a beloved cultural figure—or anyone, really—isn’t without ethical quandaries. Rossi was already editing The Andy Warhol Diaries last summer when controversy erupted around director Morgan Neville using AI to recreate the voice of Anthony Bourdain for his doc Roadrunner. Rossi had been in consultation with the Andy Warhol Foundation about the AI recreation, and the Bourdain doc inspired a disclaimer that now appears a few minutes into Diaries stating that the voice was created with the Foundation’s permission. “When Andrew shared the idea of using an AI voice, I thought, ‘Wow, this is as bold as it is smart,’” says Michael Dayton Hermann, the foundation’s head of licensing.
By being upfront, Rossi’s documentary avoids one of the big issues Roadrunner faced. Viewers know from the start that what they’re hearing is computer-generated; whereas a lot of the backlash Neville faced came because his deepfake wasn’t initially disclosed. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t still many unanswered questions about when it is and isn’t acceptable to recreate someone’s voice with a machine. In the Bourdain documentary, the words the AI speaks were actually written by the late chef, but there aren’t real recordings of him saying them. For Diaries, Warhol did once speak all the things the AI Andy says—he told them to Hackett—but they weren’t recorded at the time. Do these caveats make a difference? Both of those documentaries used AI because their subjects were deceased. Presumably, there would be a different set of ethical concerns if they were living. What if it wasn’t just the voices that were recreated? What if their likenesses were, too? AI and other technologies are improving to a point where digital effects can practically create whole performances. The question soon will be whether they should.
Zohaib Ahmed thinks about these things a lot. The CEO of Resemble AI, he’s the one Rossi turned to in order to create Warhol’s voice. But before Ahmed even signed on to the project, he made sure the Warhol Foundation had given consent. Generally, Resemble AI works with the voices of people who are still alive—largely making automated voice responses for call centers and the like—but the company says it remains strict about guidelines. “[Warhol’s] diaries are written in a really interesting way, almost like they’re meant to be read aloud. They’re in his voice,” Ahmed says. “It’s almost like this was an extension of Andy’s work, so we weren’t creating something that was an ethical dilemma for us.”
So the project for the pair felt ethical, but not easy. For one, there was that voice Warhol crafted for himself—a monotone built from his Pittsburgh upbringing and years in the New York City art scene. For another, Ahmed and his team didn’t have a lot of that voice to work with. When the company started, it only had about 3 minutes and 12 seconds of audio data—and needed to create a voice that could read about 30 pages of text. To do that, Resemble’s AI engine used the characteristics—or phonemes—of Warhol’s voice that were in that dataset to predict the phonemes that weren’t in order to create a fairly full voice. That voice was then loaded into the company’s web platform, where users—in this case, Rossi—could type in what they want the voice to say and then ask the AI to make adjustments until it sounds the way they want it to. Being able to have that human involvement, Ahmed says, is “really powerful.” It even allowed Rossi to shift the emotion or have Warhol say words that required an accent—like, for example, the name of his friend and collaborator Jean-Michel Basquiat.
Ultimately, the AI didn’t do quite everything based on just those few minutes. Along the way, Rossi brought in actor Bill Irwin to record some lines in a Warhol voice to help the machine learn the proper delivery. “We tried models combining 80 to 75 percent of the AI voices and 20 to 15 percent of Bill’s performance,” Rossi says. “In the end, Andy’s voice throughout the series presents a variation of ranges on this interpolated model.” Some words—“quaalude,” for example, or “Rorschach test” needed more pitch modulation, and sometimes Rossi inserted sounds into the algorithm phonetically, forcing the AI to say things a certain way through creative spelling. “Bear in mind,” the director says, “this is for Andy, who has a Pittsburgh accent but is delivering names and locations over the phone as a veteran New Yorker.”
The Andy Warhol Diaries, then, serves as a reminder of what could be possible. It doesn’t fully answer all the questions currently swirling around the ethics of using AI to bring back long-lost luminaries—but it does demonstrate how close the technology can get to recreating the past while also being transparent about what exactly it is. “When I first heard the AI-created voice,” Hermann says, “I felt confident it was going to be an incredibly effective way to bring Warhol’s diaries to life and humanize the enigmatic artist.” Maybe, in other words, a robot can help us understand him better than anything.

This March 8, on the occasion of International Women’s Day 2022, a virtual panel discussion will be held from 5-6pm to explore the unique opportunities and challenges that AI presents for women’s working lives. The discussion will be based on the new joint report by UNESCO, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), entitled “The Effects of AI on Women’s Working Lives.”
Globally, studies show that working women are paid less, hold fewer leadership positions, and participate less in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.                        In engineering and digital schools, women make up an average of 20 percent of enrollment and hold only 29 percent of data science and AI positions, according to a 2019 Unesco report. That same year, 80% of AI professors were men and 12% of AI researchers were women.            Algorithms are therefore mostly programmed by male developers and automatically reproduce their more or less conscious gender stereotypes before they are widely disseminated. The data that feeds them reflect the inequalities of our societies and the disinterest of young girls for STEM or ICT can only amplify them.
Online event: ‘The effects of AI on women’s working lives’.
The discussion will be based on the new joint UNESCO, OECD and IDB report “The Effects of AI on Women’s Working Lives” and will focus on the three main themes highlighted in the report:

Changing skill needs in the labor market;
The effects of AI on women entering the labor market;

AI’s impacts on women’s work environment and career progression.
 Keynote Address:


Tawfik Jelassi ,  Assistant Director-General, UNESCO,
Ulrik Vestergaard Knudsen ,  Deputy Secretary-General, OECD.

Confirmed panelists :


Dorothy Gordon, Chair of the Information for All Programme and Board Member of the Institute for Information Technologies in Education, UNESCO
Tamara Dancheva, Senior Director of International Relations, GSMA
Dirk Meyer, Head of the Directorate General for Global Health, Private Sector, Trade and Rural Development, German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development
Marta Ochoa, Youth Director and Senior Equal Opportunities Coordinator, UNI Global Union
Livia Gouvea Gomes, Labour Market Expert, IDB.

This panel will be moderated by Gina Neff, Executive Director of the Minderoo Center for Technology & Democracy at the University of Cambridge and Professor of Technology and Society at the University of Oxford, a member of the Women4AI Daring Circle, co-author of the report. On March 3, she published an article on the OECD website, “AI must not make women’s working lives worse.”
AI to close the gender gap.

While AI algorithms have replicated our society’s biases, it’s not too late to bend their impacts for women’s work lives with reliable, socially representative data.
AI for job search.

One of the key challenges for employment services is to facilitate the matching of skills required in job vacancies with those available to job seekers. A BID report “Artificial Intelligence for Job Search “from 2020 focuses on how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used as a tool to improve the matching approach, as far as considering existing relationships in various occupations, which can include more information in the analysis of job applicants’ profiles.
Today, artificial intelligence powers many job search engines, online job postings, and referrals and is used to automate parts of the hiring process for large companies.
However it is the employers who choose the data on which Artificial Intelligence selects future employees, so the algorithms incorporate their biases. For example, in 2015, Amazon had acknowledged that its algorithmic recruiting evaluated candidates for developer positions in a gender-biased way.
On the other hand, AI algorithms based on successful past hires in the tech sector, where women are underrepresented, may perpetuate bias in the future, thus exacerbating gender inequality in the sector.
Women’s digital skills.

In 2020, UNESCO published a study explaining the role that gender-responsive education can play in ending gender-based conceptions of technology and ensuring gender equality in digital education.                                The paper highlighted the paradox of ICT: countries with the highest levels of gender equality, such as Europe, also have the lowest rates of women pursuing higher education leading to employment in the technology sector.
The study also drew attention to the fact that digital assistants are almost all feminized. While industrial robots have mostly male names, personal assistants whose main function is to serve, listen and serve have female voices and are called Siri or Alexa.
The research that will serve as the basis for discussion in this panel shows that women in the workforce today are in fewer leadership positions, are less likely to have science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) skills, are in more precarious jobs, and, on average, are paid less for the same work than their male counterparts.
Conclusions.
Studies have found that teams with mixed AI projects are the most successful. Women’s place in the AI world is therefore strategic, and encouraging careers in the science and digital world is essential to increasing women’s representation.
Governments and civil society have a role to play in ensuring that women thrive in an AI-based future. Developers must ensure transparency and accountability, as well as share research and data. This will allow governments, organizations, academics, and others to monitor and mitigate gender bias in AI systems.

GIANT FREAKIN ROBOT > Science See The Terrifying Video Of Artificial Intelligence Generating Infinite Killer Clowns See these terrifying killer clowns generated in an infinite loop by artificial intelligence, and think about the future. 

By Nathan Kamal

This article is more than 2 years old







In the previous century, also known as the 20th, there once was a prevailing thought that technology would be used to bring the world to a utopian state. The entire premise of The Jetsons was based on this. It was also thought that the advent of artificial intelligence could bring about either a benevolently super-efficient world system or doom us all to the thrall of machine overlords. But it probably never would have occurred to the futurists of the 20th century, not even in their wildest dream, that once artificial intelligence was developed, it would almost immediately be put to use to create nightmare landscapes of killer clowns. Behold:








Once you have stopped shivering and maybe sit down and thought some calming thoughts, let us go through the video above. That relentlessly psychologically damaging one-minute video is the work of artificial intelligence, namely an upscale-interpolation machine learning neural network models. That essentially means a machine that can resize and re-pixelate images and create new ones that it learns along the way, developing a kind of infinite loop of unique images based on the same initial building blocks. Based on the horrific, bizarrely toothy killer clowns populating that trip of a video, someone fed this AI a copy of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and a book about three-ring circuses, and then walked away. 





But all terrifying looping journeys through an endless chasm of auto-generating killer clowns aside, the concept of artificial intelligence-generated art is causing all sorts of issues to spring up. Just recently, the U.S. Copyright Office determined that AI-generated art cannot be copyrighted, ruling that “human authorship is a prerequisite to copyright protection.” While that decision is being appealed and brought to federal court (and it would be surprising if that or some similar case were not eventually before the Supreme Court), it shows the unexpected legal questions generated like so many killer clowns in your dreams. 
As one might be expected, even without the benefit of creating your very own unique killer clown, the idea of artificial intelligence-generated art is taking off as a form of commerce. Non-fungible tokens of killer clowns are available to be generated by the AI as seen in the video above, and apps are available to auto-create the kind of artwork of your choice. What ultimate effect this has on the massive killer clown art market of the world is yet to be seen, but it is sure to be strange. On the other hand, there are people in the world that are still pursuing more traditional avenues of technological development, like the development of standard-issue killer robots. Or if that is not good enough for you, there are also killer robot cheetahs. And if still not good enough, as a species, we have also come up with the sterling idea of killer robot dogs who also are guns. But really, why do we need an artificial intelligence to create killer clowns, when we already have their perfected form?

During the past decade, China has made rapid advances in technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and emerged as a leader in many high-tech fields such as artificial intelligence. To continue supporting the burgeoning AI industry, the Chinese government has been devoting huge efforts to nurturing the next-generation AI workforce, implementing AI education programs not only at the post-secondary level but also at the K-12 level, with a model that features robust public-private partnership. China has made significant progress in terms of integrating and instituting AI education in its centrally planned, locally implemented school curriculums. Researchers at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada (APF Canada) have recently examined the current state of AI development across APEC member economies, including China, and the ongoing social momentum to include AI in education curriculums around the world. The team has also conducted a comparative study of Canada’s and South Korea’s diverging experience of introducing AI education at the K-12 level, while highlighting the need to continue drawing lessons from good practices across the region. To complement these analyses, this short report looks at China’s primary and secondary AI education to determine its unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. 
China’s Public Education System
China’s public education system is the world’s largest, with 282 million students and over 17 million teachers in about 530,000 schools (excluding extracurricular educational institutions) in total.[1] The Ministry of Education (MOE) administers the macro-level planning, curriculum standards, policy guidance, and budget allocation for China’s primarily state-run education system, with relatively little private sector involvement.[2] Under the MOE, there are provincial-level education departments and city-/county-level education bureaus that are responsible for localizing and implementing the centrally formulated overarching guidelines. 
In China, people conventionally refer to “basic education” as the nine years of state-funded, compulsory primary and junior high school education. Starting with a stark literacy rate of 20 per cent in 1949, public school enrolment rates have jumped in the past decades, particularly following a series of reforms in the 1980s, catching up with the levels in high-income countries. The net enrolment rate in primary education and the gross enrolment rate for junior high schools reached 99.94 per cent and 102.6 per cent, respectively, in 2019,[3] and the literacy rate reached 97 per cent in 2018.[4] The education system also underwent significant changes in 2001 with the launch of the landmark New Curriculum Reform policy, which decentralized policy decisions in curriculum management to encourage flexibility and needs-based diversification at the local level. [5]
Notwithstanding significant achievements in internet user penetration in China, urban-rural disparities remain a hurdle in the country’s education system. For information and communications technology (ICT) education such as coding, robotics, and AI, the remaining gap in internet penetration rates across China – with nearly 80 per cent in urban regions versus 59 per cent in rural villages[6] – constantly poses a challenge to education. Ensuring education equality for rural and migrant children (from rural families that are temporarily working and living in urban areas) remains one of the MOE’s top priorities. 
Initiatives by the Ministry of Education
The teaching of artificial intelligence is a relatively recent addition to the information technology curriculum of China’s K-12 education. In 2017, the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan was issued by the State Council as the guiding document of the country’s pursuit of becoming “the world’s primary AI innovation center” by 2030.[7] One of the key areas of this plan is to enhance people’s awareness and use of AI technologies through the promotion of universal AI education – meaning that it is intended to be available to every single student going through the public school system. In particular, the plan proposed the offering of “AI-related courses in primary and secondary schools,” as well as the “construction and improvement of AI public education infrastructure.”[8] Following this country-wide policy, MOE drafted the Artificial Intelligence Action Plan for Institutions of Higher Education in April 2018, listing the “construction of a multi-layer AI education program including that at the primary and secondary school levels”[9] as a major policy action in the effort of nurturing AI talent. Another MOE document released around the same time, the Education Informatization 2.0 Action Plan, also included plans for the “substantiation of IT curriculum with content on AI and coding,” so as to “better adapt to the needs of development in the information era.”[10]
To implement these policies, MOE initiated the Primary and Secondary AI Education Program in September 2018 to work together with city-level science academies, schools, and private sector partners to design top-level AI courses for K-12 students. The program provided schemes to distribute AI teaching equipment to schools as well as guidance on curriculum planning. According to the latest Curriculum Standards for Information Technology (IT) in Ordinary High Schools to be fully implemented by the fall 2022 semester, “primary concepts of artificial intelligence” will become one of the six “optional compulsory modules”[11] in senior high schools. The IT education standards for high schools also stipulate that students have a basic understanding of the “concepts and core algorithms of AI,” familiarity with the “basic AI applications using open-source frameworks,” and “ethical and security challenges in an intelligent society.”[12]

A brief timeline of major national policies on primary and secondary AI education in China.

Cities and schools selected to launch pilot AI courses have been given considerable flexibility and autonomy on their curriculum design and choice of textbook. As in the case of IT education, the MOE encourages local education authorities to co-ordinate “the writing and adoption of a textbook that suits the local condition and school schedules.”[13] Since 2018, several versions of AI textbooks have been released – in most cases co-authored by experts in education paired with AI industry practitioners – usually distinguished from one another by their target audience, content focus, and relation to the broader teachings of IT.
Partnerships Between the Private Sector and Academic Institutions
China’s private sector plays an active and instrumental role in complementing the state-run AI education policies. AI and tech companies have functioned as “technical partners” for schools and regional education authorities, co-designing curriculums and textbooks for AI courses at primary and secondary schools. They also provide partner schools with the necessary tools and platforms for teaching and learning AI skills. 
Since the Development Plan was announced in 2017, a number of Chinese tech and AI unicorns have been actively channelling their strengths and resources into public education. Among the first movers in this field was Hong Kong-based AI company SenseTime, who collaborated with the Massive Open Online Course Center (MOOC Center) at East China Normal University to publish the Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (High School Edition), said to be the world’s first AI textbook, in 2018. The company later established a separate subsidiary called SenseTime Edu to support the offering of an integrated, “whole package of AI education solutions.”[14] This includes initiatives such as providing learning platforms, labs, and educational robots leveraging its proprietary technologies; compiling a K-12 all-age textbook series; and offering teacher training and certification programs.[15]
Meanwhile, iFlytek, a Chinese intelligent speech/AI leader and established name in smart education, partnered with Northwest Normal University and the National Center for Educational Technology in 2018 to create the first junior high school AI textbook. The textbook includes the exclusive use of an online practice kit developed by iFlytek. The company has also organized teacher training sessions and robotics contests for the K-12 audience.
While companies provide the technical side of curricular design, top universities in China, such as the aforementioned East China Normal University and Northwest Normal University, have mainly been supporting these initiatives by providing pedagogical support for the drafting of AI textbooks and curriculums. East China Normal University prioritized work in the intersection of AI and education by founding the Shanghai Institute for AI Education (iAIE) in 2020.[16] Although its current focus is on using AI technologies to empower education, the institute will be well positioned and endowed to generate resources for teaching AI as a subject down the road. 
In addition, some institutions and associations are playing more of a convening role, bringing stakeholders together to discuss issues related to AI education. One recent example is the AI Education Conference for Primary & Secondary Schools[17] co-organized in July 2021 by the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence, the High School Affiliated to Renmin University, and a number of business partners, including Future Gene, iFlytek, and Walnut Programming. Experiences from some of the earliest and most successful pilot programs were shared during the sessions.
Strengths and Weaknesses of China’s AI Education at the Primary and Secondary Level
China’s successful integration of AI education at the K-12 level can be attributed to several factors. The Chinese government views domestic research, application, and innovation in artificial intelligence as a matter of strategic importance, for which developing an AI talent pool and pipeline is critical. Although the MOE has shifted from “direct control to macro-level monitoring of the education system,”[18] it still wields unilateral power in the country’s broad education agenda-setting and decision-making processes. While the MOE takes the lead in setting up overarching frameworks and providing the jump-start, these centrally directed initiatives have been quickly followed by implementation at the local level by practitioners. Backed by the policy commitment at the state level, AI education for K-12 has attracted the interest of private sector stakeholders and created hype in the market. 
The teaching of AI also benefited from the rapid development of China’s AI industry itself and by the wealth of experience accumulated in recent decades from the many existing school-industry partnerships on IT education. China’s generation Z (born between the late 1990s and the early 2010s) grew up in the midst of the country’s fastest economic expansion and modernization, and they have been exposed to digital technologies since birth. Even before AI became part of their school curriculum, many of them gained some exposure to AI through the internet, TV, and print media. Placing a high value on the learning of science and technologies, students’ familiarity and interest are important foundations for AI education to be well received in schools. 
More broadly speaking, China nowadays is likely deploying AI and other emerging digital technologies more than most other AI powers do. Both policy-makers and the public are more readily accepting of experimenting with and installing new technologies that they deem to enhance the efficiency and convenience of their work and life. Therefore, there are already a variety of options available, not just in IT and sciences but also in linguistics, psychology, and social studies, for the students’ learning and practising of AI technologies through hands-on, real-life applications. It is also in this context that cutting-edge innovations, including artificial intelligence, are seen as promising occupations in the eyes of students and parents, and thus are appealing in the early stages of education.
On the flip side, the most salient weak spot in China’s current public school education on AI is the lack of a clearly defined, systematic standard for what should be taught at each level.[19] The existing AI curriculums and textbooks, for instance, usually differ in their content arrangements and day-to-day approaches, some of which may not fit students’ cognitive ability and level of knowledge in science and mathematics, and may not adequately prepare students for their deeper dive at the post-secondary level.[20] Another limitation lies in the shortage of qualified, experienced teachers for this relatively new subject – only 35.2 per cent of teachers surveyed, most of whom work at more advanced coastal-region demonstration schools where pilot programs are usually rolled out first, had some experience teaching AI-related content. About a third of these teachers further expressed a lack of confidence in their qualification to teach AI courses.[21] 
In addition, much work remains to be done on building the supporting infrastructure for AI education. The majority of schools that have launched AI courses so far did not build a dedicated AI lab, but instead have used their existing IT labs, which are often not adequately equipped for AI teaching.[22] Students in rural areas will continue to be more severely challenged in their access to IT and tech resources. The fact that AI education is currently more of a privilege for the developed regions and schools – where pilot courses first get rolled out – could potentially further exacerbate the problems of regional disparity and the digital divide. Recent survey results indicate that 85.2 per cent of students enrolled in demonstration schools, compared to 67.3 per cent in regular public schools, have some understanding of AI,[23] and this figure would likely go down even further for the rural population. Bridging the gap related to exposure to AI – especially putting in place the necessary facilities and resources to give children an equal footing in learning AI – remains a huge task for the MOE, schools, and their partners.
Conclusion
In building its AI industry, the Chinese government has very much played a macro-level direction-setting and investor-like role, and it is now acting similarly on the AI education front. Even though China’s national education authority operates in a more decentralized manner now than it did decades ago, its decisions remain powerful and are taken very seriously by local education practitioners and the private sector. Public-private partnerships on AI education take shape differently in each country, but China’s powerful state actor ensures that these partnerships have somewhat an equal presence and role to play for the pedagogical and technical sides. 
Although still in the early stages of implementation, China’s AI education model offers an alternative for AI educators in Canada to look at – despite different education systems, many end goals are shared, and some of the existing challenges are in fact quite common. It is hoped that educators in Canada will recognize the importance of nurturing the next-generation AI talents earlier in schooling and can draw inspiration from the Chinese experience in terms of initiating its own model that orchestrates private and public efforts and attracts all kinds of partners for the much-needed co-ordination.

China’s public education system is the world’s largest, with 282 million students and over 17 million teachers in about 530,000 schools (excluding extracurricular educational institutions) in total.[1] The Ministry of Education (MOE) administers the macro-level planning, curriculum standards, policy guidance, and budget allocation for China’s primarily state-run education system, with relatively little private sector involvement.[2] Under the MOE, there are provincial-level education departments and city-/county-level education bureaus that are responsible for localizing and implementing the centrally formulated overarching guidelines. 

In China, people conventionally refer to “basic education” as the nine years of state-funded, compulsory primary and junior high school education. Starting with a stark literacy rate of 20 per cent in 1949, public school enrolment rates have jumped in the past decades, particularly following a series of reforms in the 1980s, catching up with the levels in high-income countries. The net enrolment rate in primary education and the gross enrolment rate for junior high schools reached 99.94 per cent and 102.6 per cent, respectively, in 2019,[3] and the literacy rate reached 97 per cent in 2018.[4] The education system also underwent significant changes in 2001 with the launch of the landmark New Curriculum Reform policy, which decentralized policy decisions in curriculum management to encourage flexibility and needs-based diversification at the local level. [5]

Notwithstanding significant achievements in internet user penetration in China, urban-rural disparities remain a hurdle in the country’s education system. For information and communications technology (ICT) education such as coding, robotics, and AI, the remaining gap in internet penetration rates across China – with nearly 80 per cent in urban regions versus 59 per cent in rural villages[6] – constantly poses a challenge to education. Ensuring education equality for rural and migrant children (from rural families that are temporarily working and living in urban areas) remains one of the MOE’s top priorities. 

Initiatives by the Ministry of Education

The teaching of artificial intelligence is a relatively recent addition to the information technology curriculum of China’s K-12 education. In 2017, the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan was issued by the State Council as the guiding document of the country’s pursuit of becoming “the world’s primary AI innovation center” by 2030.[7] One of the key areas of this plan is to enhance people’s awareness and use of AI technologies through the promotion of universal AI education – meaning that it is intended to be available to every single student going through the public school system. In particular, the plan proposed the offering of “AI-related courses in primary and secondary schools,” as well as the “construction and improvement of AI public education infrastructure.”[8] Following this country-wide policy, MOE drafted the Artificial Intelligence Action Plan for Institutions of Higher Education in April 2018, listing the “construction of a multi-layer AI education program including that at the primary and secondary school levels”[9] as a major policy action in the effort of nurturing AI talent. Another MOE document released around the same time, the Education Informatization 2.0 Action Plan, also included plans for the “substantiation of IT curriculum with content on AI and coding,” so as to “better adapt to the needs of development in the information era.”[10]

To implement these policies, MOE initiated the Primary and Secondary AI Education Program in September 2018 to work together with city-level science academies, schools, and private sector partners to design top-level AI courses for K-12 students. The program provided schemes to distribute AI teaching equipment to schools as well as guidance on curriculum planning. According to the latest Curriculum Standards for Information Technology (IT) in Ordinary High Schools to be fully implemented by the fall 2022 semester, “primary concepts of artificial intelligence” will become one of the six “optional compulsory modules”[11] in senior high schools. The IT education standards for high schools also stipulate that students have a basic understanding of the “concepts and core algorithms of AI,” familiarity with the “basic AI applications using open-source frameworks,” and “ethical and security challenges in an intelligent society.”[12]

Cities and schools selected to launch pilot AI courses have been given considerable flexibility and autonomy on their curriculum design and choice of textbook. As in the case of IT education, the MOE encourages local education authorities to co-ordinate “the writing and adoption of a textbook that suits the local condition and school schedules.”[13] Since 2018, several versions of AI textbooks have been released – in most cases co-authored by experts in education paired with AI industry practitioners – usually distinguished from one another by their target audience, content focus, and relation to the broader teachings of IT.

Partnerships Between the Private Sector and Academic Institutions

China’s private sector plays an active and instrumental role in complementing the state-run AI education policies. AI and tech companies have functioned as “technical partners” for schools and regional education authorities, co-designing curriculums and textbooks for AI courses at primary and secondary schools. They also provide partner schools with the necessary tools and platforms for teaching and learning AI skills. 

Since the Development Plan was announced in 2017, a number of Chinese tech and AI unicorns have been actively channelling their strengths and resources into public education. Among the first movers in this field was Hong Kong-based AI company SenseTime, who collaborated with the Massive Open Online Course Center (MOOC Center) at East China Normal University to publish the Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (High School Edition), said to be the world’s first AI textbook, in 2018. The company later established a separate subsidiary called SenseTime Edu to support the offering of an integrated, “whole package of AI education solutions.”[14] This includes initiatives such as providing learning platforms, labs, and educational robots leveraging its proprietary technologies; compiling a K-12 all-age textbook series; and offering teacher training and certification programs.[15]

Meanwhile, iFlytek, a Chinese intelligent speech/AI leader and established name in smart education, partnered with Northwest Normal University and the National Center for Educational Technology in 2018 to create the first junior high school AI textbook. The textbook includes the exclusive use of an online practice kit developed by iFlytek. The company has also organized teacher training sessions and robotics contests for the K-12 audience.

While companies provide the technical side of curricular design, top universities in China, such as the aforementioned East China Normal University and Northwest Normal University, have mainly been supporting these initiatives by providing pedagogical support for the drafting of AI textbooks and curriculums. East China Normal University prioritized work in the intersection of AI and education by founding the Shanghai Institute for AI Education (iAIE) in 2020.[16] Although its current focus is on using AI technologies to empower education, the institute will be well positioned and endowed to generate resources for teaching AI as a subject down the road. 

In addition, some institutions and associations are playing more of a convening role, bringing stakeholders together to discuss issues related to AI education. One recent example is the AI Education Conference for Primary &amp; Secondary Schools[17] co-organized in July 2021 by the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence, the High School Affiliated to Renmin University, and a number of business partners, including Future Gene, iFlytek, and Walnut Programming. Experiences from some of the earliest and most successful pilot programs were shared during the sessions.

Strengths and Weaknesses of China’s AI Education at the Primary and Secondary Level

China’s successful integration of AI education at the K-12 level can be attributed to several factors. The Chinese government views domestic research, application, and innovation in artificial intelligence as a matter of strategic importance, for which developing an AI talent pool and pipeline is critical. Although the MOE has shifted from “direct control to macro-level monitoring of the education system,”[18] it still wields unilateral power in the country’s broad education agenda-setting and decision-making processes. While the MOE takes the lead in setting up overarching frameworks and providing the jump-start, these centrally directed initiatives have been quickly followed by implementation at the local level by practitioners. Backed by the policy commitment at the state level, AI education for K-12 has attracted the interest of private sector stakeholders and created hype in the market. 

The teaching of AI also benefited from the rapid development of China’s AI industry itself and by the wealth of experience accumulated in recent decades from the many existing school-industry partnerships on IT education. China’s generation Z (born between the late 1990s and the early 2010s) grew up in the midst of the country’s fastest economic expansion and modernization, and they have been exposed to digital technologies since birth. Even before AI became part of their school curriculum, many of them gained some exposure to AI through the internet, TV, and print media. Placing a high value on the learning of science and technologies, students’ familiarity and interest are important foundations for AI education to be well received in schools. 

More broadly speaking, China nowadays is likely deploying AI and other emerging digital technologies more than most other AI powers do. Both policy-makers and the public are more readily accepting of experimenting with and installing new technologies that they deem to enhance the efficiency and convenience of their work and life. Therefore, there are already a variety of options available, not just in IT and sciences but also in linguistics, psychology, and social studies, for the students’ learning and practising of AI technologies through hands-on, real-life applications. It is also in this context that cutting-edge innovations, including artificial intelligence, are seen as promising occupations in the eyes of students and parents, and thus are appealing in the early stages of education.

On the flip side, the most salient weak spot in China’s current public school education on AI is the lack of a clearly defined, systematic standard for what should be taught at each level.[19] The existing AI curriculums and textbooks, for instance, usually differ in their content arrangements and day-to-day approaches, some of which may not fit students’ cognitive ability and level of knowledge in science and mathematics, and may not adequately prepare students for their deeper dive at the post-secondary level.[20] Another limitation lies in the shortage of qualified, experienced teachers for this relatively new subject – only 35.2 per cent of teachers surveyed, most of whom work at more advanced coastal-region demonstration schools where pilot programs are usually rolled out first, had some experience teaching AI-related content. About a third of these teachers further expressed a lack of confidence in their qualification to teach AI courses.[21] 

In addition, much work remains to be done on building the supporting infrastructure for AI education. The majority of schools that have launched AI courses so far did not build a dedicated AI lab, but instead have used their existing IT labs, which are often not adequately equipped for AI teaching.[22] Students in rural areas will continue to be more severely challenged in their access to IT and tech resources. The fact that AI education is currently more of a privilege for the developed regions and schools – where pilot courses first get rolled out – could potentially further exacerbate the problems of regional disparity and the digital divide. Recent survey results indicate that 85.2 per cent of students enrolled in demonstration schools, compared to 67.3 per cent in regular public schools, have some understanding of AI,[23] and this figure would likely go down even further for the rural population. Bridging the gap related to exposure to AI – especially putting in place the necessary facilities and resources to give children an equal footing in learning AI – remains a huge task for the MOE, schools, and their partners.

Conclusion

In building its AI industry, the Chinese government has very much played a macro-level direction-setting and investor-like role, and it is now acting similarly on the AI education front. Even though China’s national education authority operates in a more decentralized manner now than it did decades ago, its decisions remain powerful and are taken very seriously by local education practitioners and the private sector. Public-private partnerships on AI education take shape differently in each country, but China’s powerful state actor ensures that these partnerships have somewhat an equal presence and role to play for the pedagogical and technical sides. 

Although still in the early stages of implementation, China’s AI education model offers an alternative for AI educators in Canada to look at – despite different education systems, many end goals are shared, and some of the existing challenges are in fact quite common. It is hoped that educators in Canada will recognize the importance of nurturing the next-generation AI talents earlier in schooling and can draw inspiration from the Chinese experience in terms of initiating its own model that orchestrates private and public efforts and attracts all kinds of partners for the much-needed co-ordination.

[11] “Optional compulsory modules” (选择性必修课程 xuanzexing bixiu kecheng) are extensions from the required modules of a subject. These are determined by the MOE and their content do not vary as much as the elective modules. Since IT is not a subject that is tested in the college entrance exam, some of its optional compulsory modules will be tested in the senior high school academic proficiency exams that students have to pass to graduate, while others (including the AI module) will not be tested but will be included as part of the evaluation for students who take the module.

In the post-COVID era, where everyone is concerned about social distancing, technology is fast seeping into our lives, to make our lives better. Artificial Intelligence is reaching new levels of achievement. From grocery, to office work, to healthcare and education &ndash; there is no sector which is not left untouched by AI. With the development of AI and machine learning skills, automation is at its best play in every field.The pace at which technology is seeping into our lives, and the way most of the business platforms are choosing to take the tech route to find solutions to problems, and with the emergence of the online digital skills, the day is not far when machines will replace manual jobs. Automation will add to the work culture and there is a high possibility that some workforces will subtract human duties in certain jobs.Amidst all this, the only thing that is expected to remain unaffected by technology is interpersonal skills that can never be replaced by robots or machines. And this takes away all the limelight from AI and technology. So, what will the future world of work be dependent on?Let&rsquo;s explore the big battle between the man and the machine!Employees are dependent upon their managers and their team leaders to assign them tasks. The development of Artificial Intelligence has enabled some of the mobile apps and computer tools to use virtual assistants for simple tasks. This means that the growing technology will replace the need for human assistance with machines. Technology can not replace individual, interpersonal skills such as empathy, tech management, content creation, communication, strategy, and creativity. The blog also says that the development of AI technology is going to affect careers but they do not have the power to displace interpersonal skills based on the human brain.Artificial Intelligence is leading in many markets viz-a-viz human skills. It was predicted years ago that most of the tasks being carried out by the human brain will be replaced by the AI and technology. And this is now a reality. There are sectors where humans would soon be replaced by machines. So, the big AI intervention has, to a large extent, replaced humans, especially in some sectors.But at the same time, none can deny the fact that as dependence on Artificial Intelligence is growing, the progress of emotional intelligence is evident too. Many reports suggest that the first skill that makes a human being different from a machine is emotions. Emotions are deeply rooted in human minds and they can be changed or transformed according to the human brain only. So, the jobs that require human emotions like doctors and psychologists can not be replaced by machines.Creativity is another aspect that can be bettered by machines but not replaced by them. It is a complex process and varies from person to person. This skill can not be modified and fed into computers and other devices. Fields needing content and creativity like content writing and video creation etc., need imagination, while visualisation can be managed by a device or machine.Similarly, employee r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are built in a certain way, highlighting the skills like decision-making and problem solving which are not possible by artificial robots. The word artificial itself means something that is not original or a formation from the original. This is why interpersonal skills are focused upon. Employees should work upon the skills like creativity and the power of knowledge to show the capacity of their intelligence. A study shows that 93% of people are hired because of skills including critical thinking and clear communication techniques.The same review mentions that the development of soft skills should be a part of the school curriculums. Also, many of the tutoring platforms are imparting coding skills to understand machine languages. And this shows that technology and humans go hand-in-hand. Artificial Intelligence is expanding with emotional intelligence. Management and utilisation are skills that are impossible to replace. As machines are being widely used in place of humans. But, to operate and monitor the working of concerned devices. Even if we replace human jobs with machines, errors might occur, and to deal with these errors, we need the assistance of human problem-solvers. The conclusion of whether robots will replace your jobs is a difficult question but there are certain human skills that automation will never be able to match.Similarly, jobs of HR managers that need convincing skills cannot be reproduced by machines. Writers also have skills that produce original ideas for writing and these can never be machine-oriented. Leadership skills for the chief executive officer, smart intelligence of a lawyer, next-level usage of the brain by scientists, clergymen, psychiatrists, software developers, PR managers, and graphic designers cannot be compared to artificial intelligence at all.It is said that robots will take away 40% of human jobs in the upcoming fifteen years. But there is no comparison with human productivity, strategic thinking, and leadership qualities. Talking about the jobs that can be restored by machines, the one that tops is the job of customer service executive. It is being replaced by chatbot preloaded messages that are fixed in the system. It doesn&rsquo;t need a high sense of knowledge. Answers to FAQs are pre-feed in the devices according to the questions.Database jobs can also be operated by Artificial Intelligence. The receptionist job is also quite easy to be managed by machines and robots. Proofreading is a task that requires checking spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and punctuations. Manufacturing and retail services surely need advanced data analysis. People are working on providing robot services for these tasks as well. Robotic treatments are being developed too. Other than that, robot soldiers, taxi drivers and bus drivers are being developed in various countries. Market research and development and courier services are also included in jobs replaceable by machines in the future.The future technology is being developed to be superfast in the race, but they can never beat humans.
