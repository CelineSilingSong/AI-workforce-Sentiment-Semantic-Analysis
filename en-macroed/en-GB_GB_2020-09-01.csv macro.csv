The painting, named Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, ended up selling for a cool $432,500, but more importantly, it demonstrated how intelligent machines are now perfectly capable of creating artwork.
3 Predictions For The Role Of Artificial Intelligence In Art And DesignAdobe Stock

It was only a matter of time, I suppose. Thanks to AI, machines have been able to learn more and more human functions, including the ability to “see” (think facial recognition technology), speak and write (chatbots being a prime example). Learning to create is a logical step on from mastering the basic human abilities. But will intelligent machines really rival humans’ remarkable capacity for creativity and design? To answer that question, here are my top three predictions for the role of AI in art and design.

1. Machines will be used to enhance human creativity (enhance being the key word)

Until we can fully understand the brain’s creative thought processes, it’s unlikely machines will learn to replicate them. As yet, there’s still much we don’t understand about human creativity. Those inspired ideas that pop into our brain seemingly out of nowhere. The “eureka!” moments of clarity that stop us in our tracks. Much of that thought process remains a mystery, which makes it difficult to replicate the same creative spark in machines.

PROMOTED
Typically, then, machines have to be “told” what to create before they can produce the desired end result. The AI painting that sold at auction? It was created by an algorithm that had been trained on 15,000 pre-20th century portraits, and was programmed to compare its own work with those paintings.

The takeaway from this is that AI will largely be used to enhance human creativity, not replicate or replace it – a process known as “co-creativity."" As an example of AI improving the creative process, IBM's Watson AI platform was used to create the first-ever AI-generated movie trailer, for the horror film Morgan. Watson analyzed visuals, sound, and composition from hundreds of other horror movie trailers before selecting appropriate scenes from Morgan for human editors to compile into a trailer. This reduced a process that usually takes weeks down to one day.

2. AI could help to overcome the limits of human creativity
Humans may excel at making sophisticated decisions and pulling ideas seemingly out of thin air, but human creativity does have its limitations. Most notably, we’re not great at producing a vast number of possible options and ideas to choose from. In fact, as a species, we tend to get overwhelmed and less decisive the more options we’re faced with! This is a problem for creativity because, as American chemist Linus Pauling – the only person to have won two unshared Nobel Prizes – put it, “You can’t have good ideas unless you have lots of ideas.” This is where AI can be of huge benefit.

Intelligent machines have no problem coming up with infinite possible solutions and permutations, and then narrowing the field down to the most suitable options – the ones that best fit the human creative’s “vision”. In this way, machines could help us come up with new creative solutions that we couldn’t possibly have come up with on our own.

For example, award-winning choreographer Wayne McGregor has collaborated with Google Arts & Culture Lab to come up with new, AI-driven choreography. An AI algorithm was trained on thousands of hours of McGregor’s videos, spanning 25 years of his career – and as a result, the program came up with 400,000 McGregor-like sequences. In McGregor’s words, the tool “gives you all of these new possibilities you couldn’t have imagined.”
3. Generative design is one area to watch
Much like in the creative arts, the world of design will likely shift towards greater collaboration between humans and AI. This brings us to generative design – a cutting-edge field that uses intelligent software to enhance the work of human designers and engineers.
Very simply, the human designer inputs their design goals, specifications, and other requirements, and the software takes over to explore all possible designs that meet those criteria. Generative design could be utterly transformative for many industries, including architecture, construction, engineering, manufacturing, and consumer product design.
In one exciting example of generative design, renowned designer Philippe Starck collaborated with software company Autodesk to create a new chair design. Starck and his team set out the overarching vision for the chair and fed the AI system questions like, ""Do you know how we can rest our bodies using the least amount of material?"" From there, the software came up with multiple suitable designs to choose from. The final design – an award-winning chair named ""AI"" – debuted at Milan Design Week in 2019.

Machine co-creativity is just one of 25 technology trends that I believe will transform our society. Read more about these key trends – including plenty of real-world examples – in my new books, Tech Trends in Practice: The 25 Technologies That Are Driving The 4th Industrial Revolution and The Intelligence Revolution: Transforming Your Business With AI.

Privacy NoticeEngineering giant Rolls-Royce has said it has made breakthroughs which it believes will help gain society’s trust of the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The firm’s data innovation business, called R2 Data Labs, has been spearheading the research and believes that its latest findings around the ethics of AI will help towards the acceptance of the technology, which Rolls-Royce believes will accelerate the next generation of industrialisation. Rolls-Royce, which has its civil aerospace division in Derby, has been using AI for the last 20 years to monitor its aero engines in service in real time. Its latest breakthroughs have been achieved as a part of the firm’s work to apply AI throughout its business, including the use of robotic inspections on critical components. The first breakthrough is an “AI ethics framework”, which is a method that any organisation can use to ensure the decisions it takes to use AI in critical and non-critical applications are ethical.

 The second is the first step-by-step process for ensuring the outcomes of AI algorithms can be trusted. This involves a five-layer checking system, which can prevent biases from developing undetected, with results being constantly monitored to ensure they are trustworthy. According to Rolls-Royce, its ethics framework and its trust process have been peer reviewed by experts in several big tech firms, as well as experts in the automotive, pharmaceutical, academic and government sectors. All of Rolls-Royce’s recent AI work will be published later this year. In a keynote speech at London Tech Week’s AI Summit, Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East, said: “By publishing our findings we want to move the AI ethics conversation forwards from discussing concepts and guidelines, to accelerating the process of applying it ethically. “There is no practical reason why trust in AI cannot be created now. And it’s only with the acceptance and permission of our society –based on that trust – that the full benefits of AI can be realised, and it can take its place as a partner in our lives and work.

 “As a business we are open to collaborative innovation and we will continue to talk to key stakeholders, customers, counterparts and technology leaders to share our work in detail to see how we can help each other progress for the greater growth, wealth and health of our world.” Caroline Gorski, global director at R2 Data Labs, said: “Rolls-Royce's AI capabilities are embedded deeply into other companies' products and services and so aren’t widely known. “Rolls-Royce’s AI doesn't often feature in a consumers' understanding of how the digital world is changing their lives.

“The current debate about the use of AI is focused on the consumer and the treatment of consumer and personal data. “But we believe that what we have created – by dealing with a challenge rooted squarely in the industrial application of AI – will help not only with the application of AI in other industries but far more widely. “There is much more still to do. We haven’t solved all of AI’s challenges but we hope that when we make this work freely available, it can help organisations large and small around the world grow using AI for good, ethical

In particular, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence are opening completely new horizons. In their film about AI, Tilman Wolff and Ranga Yogeshwar examine the role AI plays in the spread of fake news. They also consider a future with robots and the risks and ethical questions posed by the development of autonomous weapons. To address these issues, they travel the globe to speak with leading experts. AI can generate perfectly forged sound and videos, making it effective for purveying fake news. Discerning the truth from fiction will become increasingly difficult. Technology will streamline work, making some jobs surplus to requirements. Software will pilot self-driving cars and aerial drones. AI is rapidly opening up new vistas, but turning blind corners at speed can be risky. How sensible is this type of progress, and at which point should society step in and set limits to its development?

Robots and humans: the challenge of automation and work

 Let’s do an experiment: try writing “robots and jobs” in a search engine. In the summer of 2020, something like this comes out first. It mentions 51 million workers, in Europe alone, who risk their jobs within 10 years due to competition from robots. The source is a report by the consulting firm McKinsey published in mid-June, on the combined effects of automation and Covid-19 on the European labor market.
Just scroll through the search results, though, and you’ll find a different prediction just below. This time, it says that by 2037 automation and robotics will cancel 7 million jobs, but will also create 7.2 million new ones, for a total gain of 200,000 jobs. That sounds much better, you may say. But it depends on where your work is. If it's in manufacturing, and if you trust another Oxford Economics research from last year which you find a little further down in the search results, more jobs will disappear (20 million), and faster (by 2030).
We could go on, or do this experiment again in six months with different results. When it comes to predicting the future impact of robotics and artificial intelligence on the job market, choices abound: if this month's prediction seems too gloomy, all you have to do is wait for a better one next month.


“
    It’s Difficult to Make Predictions, Especially About the Future

    Niels Bohr


 A couple of years ago, the MIT Technology Review compiled a table with all the studies published on the subject, putting in a column the jobs to be destroyed and on another the jobs to be created according to each study (). The results range from the catastrophism of foreseeing 2 billion places destroyed worldwide by 2030, to the more optimistic but decidedly partisan vision of the International Federation of Robotics, that instead foresees 3.5 million places created thanks to robots by 2021. In between, all possible intermediate degrees of disruption.

Making predictions is hard, especially about the future, to quote a well-known aphorism often attributed to Niels Bohr (who in fact had at best borrowed it from someone else - in fact establishing true authorship of that phrase is even more difficult than predicting the future). If the future you are trying to predict concerns the economic and social impact of a new technology, it becomes even harder, and those who have tried in the past have mostly been proven wrong.
At the origin of the forecasts
The social relevance of this topic, however, is such that this field of study cannot be dismissed with a shrug. Artificial intelligence and robotics (especially the former) are progressing at a pace that seemed unthinkable a couple of decades ago, surpassing human performance in many areas. The possible consequences, should this progress result in mass unemployment, would threaten the very foundation of democracies. Studying future scenarios is necessary, in order to provide politicians with the elements to mitigate those consequences. But it's important to understand where data comes from, how scenarios are calculated, how credible they are.
In fact, the most-cited numbers come from three studies.
The study from Carl Frey and Michael Osborne
The first one is a 2013 study from the University of Oxford, by Carl Frey and Michael Osborne. It initially circulated as an internal document of the University and was published four years later, in a slightly revised form, in the journal Technological Forecasting and Change. 
The most concise and most often cited result from this study is that ""47 percent of jobs in the United States are at high risk of automation"", and comes from the table below, which appeared in many news stories about the study:
 






 Each point of the table is a job (hairdresser, journalist, orchestra conductor, whatever), which can belong to one among 12 macro-sectors, identified by colors. Jobs on the left-hand side are less at risk, while those on the right hand side are more at risk. The height of the colored area tells you how many people are employed in that job according to the US statistical office. 33 percent of American workers therefore have jobs with a low risk of being replaced by a computer, 19 percent are at medium risk, while as many as 47 percent are at high risk of being replaced by an algorithm within a decade or two (and because the first study was from 2013, the first decade is already almost gone). The administrative, sales and services sectors are more at risk; health, finance and maintenance and installation of devices are safer.
Let's open the black box and see how the two researchers obtained their data. The first step was a workshop at the University of Oxford with the participation of ""machine learning experts"". We do not know how many or who they were, the paper does not say it and there is no trace of the workshop online (it must have taken place almost ten years ago, since the first study was in 2013). At any rate, Frey and Osborne gave to the workshop participants a list of 70 professions accompanied by an extended description. They took the information from O * net, an American database that encodes and standardizes information on occupations for statistical purposes.
For each of the 70 professions, Frey and Osborne asked the experts to answer the question: ""Can the tasks required by this job be specified clearly enough to be performed by a computer?"" In short, can you transform that job into an algorithm? The experts had to answer 0 if they considered that job not automatable, 1 if definitely automatable. The 70 jobs had been chosen in such a way that the answer was easy: surgeon, event organizer, stylist (all 0); dishwasher, telemarketing operator, court clerk (all 1). The two authors had also asked the experts about the main bottlenecks that artificial intelligence and robotics have yet to overcome, concluding that there are three of them: perception and manipulation, creative intelligence, social intelligence.


“
    If a job requires these 9 high-grade skills, it's harder to automate

    Carl Frey and Michael Osborne


 Second step: the two authors took the complete description of those 70 jobs in the O * net database, which for each job also includes a long list of cognitive and manual skills and knowledge needed to do it, and an index that says how much you have to be good at that thing to do that job. Then, among the dozens and dozens of variables that the database lists, they chose 9 that in their opinion best describe those three bottlenecks seen above: persuasion, negotiation, social sensitivity, originality, ability to deal with others, knowledge of fine arts, manual dexterity, ability to work in a cramped environment. The idea of ​​the two authors is: if a job requires these 9 skills to a high degree, it is more difficult to automate.
Finally, Frey and Osborne used... an algorithm, of all things, to do a piece of work for them, and learn to estimate the probability of automation of a job starting from the importance that the O* net database assigns to those nine skills. They used the 70 jobs analysed in the workshop as a training set, to extract correlations between the probability of automation of a job and the scores it has on those 9 parameters. Then they extended the calculation to all 702 jobs of the complete list, obtaining for each a value between 0 and 1. In practice, they used the 70 ""easy"" jobs to teach the algorithm to predict how much a job can be automated based on how much requires those 9 skills, and then they made it calculate the risk for the other 630 jobs, the less easy ones. The complete data consists of a ranking of all occupations according to their automation risk, on a scale between 0 and 1. At the bottom, with the highest risk, you find jobs as a watch repairer, insurance agent, sewer, telemarketing operator, all with a score of 0.99. At the top, recreational therapist, mechanical machinery installers and maintainers, director of emergency procedures, all below 0.003.
From the ""occupation-based"" to the ""task-based"" approach: the OECD study
Frey and Osborne's process is ingenious, but also subjective and arbitrary. The choice of experts to be invited to the workshop is arbitrary; the choice of the 70 works to be submitted for their evaluation is arbitrary; the evaluation by those experts of which jobs are more or less automatable is subjective; the choice of those 9 skills, among the dozens required for a job, as those that best represent technological bottlenecks is extremely arbitrary.
The method is also very hard to replicate: anyone who, a few years after the original study, wished to update it should convene another workshop. And because it is not known who participated in the first one, the results would probably be different.
Another well-known study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) from 2016, as an explicit response Frey and Osborne’s catastrophism. And indeed, the conclusion here is less alarming: just 9 per cent of the jobs in the organisation's member countries are described as automatable, although with important regional differences: for example 6 percent of jobs in South Korea are automatable, contrasted with 12 percent in Austria.
In contrast with Frey’s and Osborne’ ""occupation-based"" approach, the OECD uses a ""task -based ” one, where the tasks actually performed by individual workers are at the center of the analysis, rather than the whole occupation. Jobs are bundle of tasks, and if some of the crucial tasks in a job are purely ""human"", and if it is difficult to separate them from the others, in fact the employer will not be able to replace the worker with an algorithm, even though the rest of the tasks could be done by a robot. It is this subtlety that Frey and Osborne ignore and that the authors of the OECD report want to describe. To do this, they start from another statistical resource, the PIAAC database, a survey conducted in all OECD countries to measure the basic skills of the adult population between 16 and 65 years. The PIAAC survey uses cognitive tests and a questionnaire that documents education and training paths, professional history, employment status, skills used for one's job.
The OECD study uses a rather complex statistical method. Briefly, let's just say that the authors start from the automation risk assigned by Frey and Osborne to each occupation. they proceed to associate that number to each individual present in the PIAAC census, based on his declared occupation. They then use a probabilistic method to determine how much each of the actual tasks and skills described by the workers contribute to that risk. Assigning a weight to every single task, they recalculate everything, worker by worker, arriving at a very different result. In practice, the OECD study replaces those 9 variables used by Frey and Osborne to calculate the automation risk with a much longer and more complete list, and develops an algorithm that calculates the risk for each individual worker, and not for an abstract list of occupations. Unfortunately, this study, like the previous one, does not make all the data available to try to replicate the calculations.






 
Half of the tasks are automatable: the McKinsey study
A third highly cited study is from 2017, and comes from McKinsey. This firm has produced several reports on automation and the future of work over the years, but the methodology is more or less always the same, inaugurated in ""A future that works"" (https://www.mckinsey.it/idee/harnessing-automation-for-a-future-that- works). McKinsey too, like the OECD study, chooses not to look at the jobs, but rather at the different activities that make them up. “For example,” the report writes “a salesperson will spend a certain amount of time interacting with customers, filling the shelves, recording sales. Each activity is different and requires different skills to be completed”.
McKinsey analysts also rely on the O *net database to break down existing professions into a list of 2,000 businesses. Then, always adapting the categories used by O * net, they draw up a list of 18 “requirements” (divided between sensory, cognitive, linguistic, social, physical capacities), and define each activity as a combination in different degrees of those 18 requirements. The diagram below may help:






 For each activity in the central column, the authors assign a score from 0 to 3 to each of the 18 requirements in the right-hand column, which expresses how important that capability is in order to carry out that activity. Finally, they estimate the technological feasibility of those 18 capabilities (that is, whether machines today possess them at levels comparable to humans, or if they will be able to have them in the near future) and go backward with the calculations. If an activity mostly requires capabilities that are still unattainable for machines, it is less automatable, otherwise it is more. This is more or less the Frey and Osborne method, but with more variables (18 instead of 9) and focusing not on the professions as a whole but on the activities of which they are composed (as recommended by the OECD). The results are more complex and nuanced than those of the other two studies.
According to McKinsey, almost half of the activities that make up today's jobs, worldwide, are potentially automatable. Less than 5 percent of professions are fully automatable, about 60 percent are composed of at least 30 percent of automatable activities. The automatable activities concern 1.2 billion workers worldwide and 14.6 million billion dollars in wages.

Poor clarity
The problem is that we know very little about how McKinsey's analysts went through each step. In the study there is not even a complete list of the 2000 ""activities"" used in the analysis, and we do not know who and how determined whether, for example, the activity ""demonstrating product characteristics"" requires creativity or not, and whether it requires it in grade 1, 2 or 3. As for the core of the analysis, ie the estimation of how much machines can compete with humans on those 18 abilities, the authors just tell us that:
“We used survey findings, extrapolation of metrics, and other predictors of technical advances. We conducted interviews with industry leaders and academic experts. We also looked at some recent commercial successes showcasing capabilities, as well as historic trajectory of capabilities. We then adjusted the result using some identified constraints that could limit the progression of certain capabilities. 
To improve accuracy, we looked at other predictors, including from the press, companies, research groups, and relevant industries. These predictors include research and technological breakthroughs, trends in publications, and patents as a measure of research potential. 
Based on the assessment, we projected the reasonable expected time frames to reach the next level of performance for each capability”. 
All rather ... opaque, and hardly anyone could try to replicate the data. When we read the very interesting scenarios on the future of work designed by McKinsey in this and other subsequent reports, we must basically trust them. All of this is perfectly understandable for a private company that is not required to publish all the details of its work and indeed maintains a degree of industrial secrecy. The McKinsey report is not an academic paper, it must not provide the means to replicate the experiment. The problem is that academic or institutional studies are only slightly more transparent, do not make all the data available and are based on arbitrary and subjective evaluations.
In short, to date it is very difficult to indicate an authentically scientific study, which links current employment data with the state of the art of robotics and artificial intelligence and which allows anyone to verify and replicate the data.

								JAIC needs enhanced authorities to coordinate DOD AI efforts, Bob Work says

Former Deputy Secretary of Defense and artificial intelligence evangelist Bob Work says the DOD is at risk of losing the AI race and needs to rethink its departmentwide development model.
Work thinks that the Pentagon’s Joint AI Center needs stronger authorities over all of DOD’s projects to coordinate better between services and components. He said Wednesday at the AFCEA DC AI and ML Technology Summit that right now the military has a “one thousand flowers blooming” approach to its AI projects, with too many disparate ideas that won’t yield collective results fast enough. Instead, the JAIC should be a standards-setter and centralized architecture lead for AI across the DOD.
Within that enhanced JAIC, Work also suggested its scope could be broadened as well. He proposed the center add another “A” to its name, making it the Joint Automation and Artificial Intelligence Center, or JAAIC.
Work’s suggested strategy of centralizing requirements setting and decision-making reflects a historical precedent.

“I would recommend that we adopt a naval reactors-type model,” said Work, who is currently vice-chairman of the National Security Council on AI and the owner of TeamWork, LLC, .
The Navy harnessed nuclear power for its submarines and ships when Adm. Hyman Rickover took the reigns as “the Father of the Nuclear Navy.” The department was able to rapidly field the emerging source of power with the centralized zeal from Rickover. It’s a story Work says he wants to see with AI, giving the JAIC a Rickover-type authority.
His analogy gained some support, with the former head of the JAIC, retired Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan, tweeting that the idea is “apt in some ways.”
“But that was [a] singular focus on one issue,” Shanahan added. “AI [is] much more like electricity or networks…an enabling capability.”
The application of AI in warfare Work most wants to see is AI-powered networks of information that can be paired with human operators to rapidly make battlefield decisions. It’s the core pillar of his “Third Offset Strategy,” a document Work authored during his tenure with the DOD. With a more “muscular” JAIC acting as both standards-setter and motivator for all DOD AI programs, Work thinks the nascent idea of Joint All-Domain Command and Control, the military’s network-of-networks concept, can become a reality much faster.

“We’re all saying the right things. AI is absolutely important. It’s going to give us an advantage on the battlefield for years to come,” Work said.
To amplify the power of the JAIC, the DOD needs a solidified public-private partnership as a means to compete with the Chinese civil-military fusion, Work added. The idea would be to create a bridge between the sectors, driving change for easy collaboration. In specific, Work said, the DOD should prioritize testing and evaluation with some setup akin to a national consortium for companies and academic institutions to help DOD test new algorithms.
“We may be losing the race due to our own lack of urgency,” he said

Welcome back to my page! In my last post I was explaining about a simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and survival prediction on Titanic dataset. Check it out now if you haven’t already!Titanic Survival Dataset Part 1/2: Exploratory Data AnalysisFinding out important (and probably interesting) information in the dataset.becominghuman.aiTitanic Survival Dataset Part 2/2: Logistic RegressionPredicting whether a passenger survived.becominghuman.aiInstead of working with a structured dataset again, here I decided to deal with the unstructured one: NLP (Natural Language Processing). To be more precise, in this project I wanna create a neural network architecture which is expected to be able to classify news topics based on its content. The main idea here is to employ LSTM cell thanks to its ability to recognize pattern on sequential data (e.g. signals, texts, etc.)The dataset that I use for this project is taken from here. If you open the webpage, there will be several download links, and I decided to take the one highlighted in yellow.Where I download the dataset. Source: http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/.It should not take long to download the file since the size of that dataset is only around 14 MB. Now after extracting the compressed file, we should get the following folders:The dataset is grouped by its labels.We can see here that there are 20 different classes available in the dataset. However though, in this project I only wanna use 4 of those for the sake of simplicity (the folders that I highlighted in green.)In total, there are 3732 files in those 4 classes that we use, where each of the first 3 (computer graphics, motorcycles and medical science) consists of approximately 970 samples while the last one (politics) contains around 700 texts.Artificial Intelligence JobsI do share the final code of this project in the end of this article in Python format (.py). I do recommend you to run it using Jupyter Notebook so that you know exactly what’s actually done at each line. Also, before we go any further, it’s important to ensure that your Python environment is already installed with the following modules:import osimport reimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as sns; sns.set()from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenizefrom nltk.corpus import stopwordsfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoderfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_splitfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrixfrom keras.preprocessing import sequencefrom keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizerfrom keras.models import Sequentialfrom keras.layers import Dense, LSTMfrom keras.layers.embeddings import EmbeddingIf there’s no error appears after running those imports above, we should ready to go!By the way, I divided this article to several chapters:Text preprocessingLabel preprocessingModel trainingModel evaluationText preprocessingThe next thing to do after importing all modules is to load the dataset. I am going to create a function called read_file() to make things tidier. This function is pretty simple though. The input is just a path to the text files, while the output is a list in which each of the index holds the content of each file.# Don't forget to include slash at the end of the pathdef read_files(path):    file_contents = list()    filenames = os.listdir(path)        for i in range(len(filenames)):        with open(path+filenames[i]) as f:            file_contents.append(f.read())        return file_contentsNow we will directly use the function above to read all texts in our dataset like this:class_0 = read_files('20news-18828/comp.graphics/')class_1 = read_files('20news-18828/rec.motorcycles/')class_2 = read_files('20news-18828/sci.med/')class_3 = read_files('20news-18828/talk.politics.misc/')Keep in mind that the variables of class_0, class_1, class_2 and class_3 represent computer graphics, motorcycles, medical science and politics labels repsectively. I will also create a labels list which stores each of those class names.labels = ['comp.graphics', 'rec.motorcycles', 'sci.med', 'talk.politics.misc']If you wanna check whether our dataset has been loaded successfully, we can print them out. Here I want to print the first article in class_0 by running print(class_0[0]). The output is going to look something like this:The content of class_0[0] (the first computer graphics article).Since all texts are still stored in different array (class_0, class_1, class_2, class_3), we are going to put them all into a single array to simplify our next processes. Here I use np.append() function several times to store everything in all_texts array.all_texts = np.append(class_0, class_1)all_texts = np.append(all_texts, class_2)all_texts = np.append(all_texts, class_3)Now if we run len(all_texts), then the output will be 3732, in which this value is the total number of files that we are going to work with in this project. However though, it’s important to keep in mind that all these 3732 files are still messy. Thus we need to clean those up using clean() function that I define manually. I also create a stop_words set which contains all stop words in English which I will use them to eliminate all stop words in our dataset.stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))def clean(text):    # Lowering letters    text = text.lower()    # Removing html tags    text = re.sub('<[^>]*>', '', text)    # Removing emails    text = re.sub('\S*@\S*\s?', '', text)    # Removing urls    text = re.sub('https?://[A-Za-z0-9]','',text)    # Removing numbers    text = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]',' ',text)    word_tokens = word_tokenize(text)        filtered_sentence = []    for word_token in word_tokens:        if word_token not in stop_words:            filtered_sentence.append(word_token)        # Joining words    text = (' '.join(filtered_sentence))    return textThere are several steps done in the code above. First, the function accepts a raw text as its input. Next, all characters in this raw text is going to be converted into lowercase. This step is very necessary since the exact same words will be interpreted as different words just because one is using lowercase while the other one uses uppercase. HTML tags, email addresses, URLs and numbers are also removed because I think those words are just not quite informative. By the way I use re (Regular Expression) module to get rid of that.Trending AI Articles:1. Microsoft Azure Machine Learning x Udacity — Lesson 4 Notes2. Fundamentals of AI, ML and Deep Learning for Product Managers3. Roadmap to Data Science4. Work on Artificial Intelligence ProjectsAfterwards, this text is then tokenized using word_tokenize() function taken from NLTK module. What’s essentially done at this tokenization process is that each of the words in the text is going to be put in an array while at the same time all spaces and escape characters (i.e. \t, \n, etc.) are just dropped before eventually the cleaned text is returned.Now as the clean() function has been created, we are gonna clean all texts and store the result directly to all_cleaned_texts array.all_cleaned_texts = np.array([clean(text) for text in all_texts])You may try to run print(all_cleaned_texts[0]) if you wanna see how the cleaned version of our data looks like.This is the cleaned version of the text in the previous figure.That’s not all of the text preprocessing though! Still we need to encode all those cleaned texts into numbers because we know that all machine learning/deep learning algorithms can only work with numerical data. In order to do that, we are going to employ Tokenizer() object taken from Keras module and use it to create a word-to-number mapping.tokenizer = Tokenizer()tokenizer.fit_on_texts(all_cleaned_texts)We can check how the mapping looks like by taking the word_index attribute of tokenizer object like this:tokenizer.word_indexOutput of tokenizer.word_indexIt essentially tells us that the word subject is going to be encoded to 1, writes will be 2, and so on. Also, if we try to print out the length of this word_index, then the result will be 35362, where this value represents the number of unique words in our dataset. In this stage, we haven’t actually convert those texts into sequence of numbers. To do that, we still need to run the code below. By the way, I will directly convert that into Numpy array to make future computation easier.all_encoded_texts = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(all_cleaned_texts)all_encoded_texts = np.array(all_encoded_texts)Now that all the texts have been converted into sequence of numbers which is stored in all_encoded_texts array. Here’s how the encoded version of our first news article looks like.This is the encoded version of our first text.But again, the text preprocessing step hasn’t finished yet! Notice that all files are having different lengths. We can either check it by opening the files manually or using a simple code like this:for i in range(5):    print('Length of file', i, ':', len(all_encoded_texts[i]))Length of the first 5 files in our dataset.In order for machine learning algorithms to work, we need to modify those files such that all of those are having the exact same length. My approach here is to employ pad_sequences() function taken from Keras module. Also, in this project I decided to limit each data sample to 500 words. Zero padding will be added to the beginning of the file which contains less than 500 words.all_encoded_texts = sequence.pad_sequences(all_encoded_texts, maxlen=500)Now if we try to print the shape of all_encoded_texts, we are going to obtain the following output:(3732, 500)It essentially tells us that we are now having 3732 data samples in which each of those consists of 500 words in length. Finally, that’s all of the text preprocessing! Now that this all_encoded_texts array is going to be our features (X data).Label preprocessingWe have already got our X data for the training process in the previous stage. Now in this part, we need to define our ground truth — or, also known as label. The idea here is that I wanna create another array which has the exact same length as our X data, yet this one stores the class name of each sample. For the sake of simplicity, we are just going to encode the class name manually, where computer graphics, motorcycles, medical science and politics will be encoded as 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.labels_0 = np.array([0] * len(class_0))labels_1 = np.array([1] * len(class_1))labels_2 = np.array([2] * len(class_2))labels_3 = np.array([3] * len(class_3))Also, we will concatenate all those separated labels into a single array using np.append() — exactly the same as what we’ve done to concatenate the actual texts.all_labels = np.append(labels_0, labels_1)all_labels = np.append(all_labels, labels_2)all_labels = np.append(all_labels, labels_3)If we check the shape of this all_labels variable, then we are going to obtain the value of 3732 — which is also exactly the same as the number of X data.Furthermore, we still need to convert those labels into one-hot representation. This step is done because that’s just what a neural network expect in multi class classification task. For those who are still not familiar with one-hot, it’s essentially looks like this:How one-hot representation looks like.In order to convert our labels to be in such form, we can simply use OneHotEncoder() object. Notice the code below that I use np.newaxis to create a new axis before fitting the one-hot encoder. Well, this is done just because OneHotEncoder() works with that additional axis.all_labels = all_labels[:, np.newaxis]one_hot_encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)all_labels = one_hot_encoder.fit_transform(all_labels)Now if you print all_labels, the result is gonna look something like the following figure.Labels which are already converted into one-hot representation.That pretty much it about label preprocessing stage! Keep in mind that all_labels array is going to be our y data. We are going to use both X and y in the next stage — well, certainly :)Model trainingThere are several things to do in the model training stage. First, we need to split the data into train/test. This is pretty important to find out whether our model is overfitting during the training process. Luckily, we got a train_test_split() function which is taken from Scikit-Learn module. In this case I decided to use 20% of samples in the dataset as the test data while the rest is going to be used for training. Additionally, it’s good to know that when we use this train_test_split() function we no longer need to shuffle the data since the function does it automatically for us.X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(all_encoded_texts, all_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=11)Now, let’s begin to construct the neural network by defining a Sequential() model which then followed by adding 3 layers.model = Sequential()model.add(Embedding(input_dim=35362, output_dim=32, input_length=500))model.add(LSTM(100))model.add(Dense(4, activation='sigmoid'))The first layer that we put in the neural network model is an embedding layer. The arguments of that layer are vocabulary size (as the input_dim), vector size (as the output_dim) and input length respectively. In this case, we can take the vocabulary size from the length of tokenizer.word_index, which shows that we got 35362 unique words in our dictionary. The vector size itself is free to choose, here I decided to represent each word in 32 dimensions — well this is essentially the main purpose of using an embedding layer. The last argument I think is pretty straightforward — it’s the number of words of each text sample. Here’s an article if you wanna read more about embedding layer.The second layer to add consists of 100 LSTM cells. This type of neuron is commonly used to perform classification on sequential data. This is because an LSTM cell does not treat every data point (in this case a data point is a word) as an uncorrelated sample. Instead, input in the previous time steps will also be taken into account to update cell state and the next output value. Well, that’s just an LSTM explanation in a nutshell. If you are interested to understand the underlying math I suggest you to read it from this article.Lastly, we will connect this LSTM layer with a fully-connected layer which contains 4 neurons where each of those are used to represent a single class name.Now before the training process begin we need to compile the model like this:model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',               optimizer='adam',               metrics=['accuracy'])In this case, I use categorical cross entropy loss function in which its values is going to be minimized using Adam optimizer. This loss function is chosen because this classification task has more than 2 classes. To the optimizer itself, I choose Adam since in many cases it just works better than any other optimizers. Below is the summary of our model looks like:Summary of our neural network model.Now as the neural network has been compiled, we can start the training process. Notice that I store the learning history in history variable.history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=12, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))Here is how my training progress goes:Train on 2985 samples, validate on 747 samplesEpoch 1/122985/2985 [==============================] - 75s 25ms/step - loss: 1.3544 - accuracy: 0.3652 - val_loss: 1.2647 - val_accuracy: 0.6466...Epoch 5/122985/2985 [==============================] - 48s 16ms/step - loss: 0.4278 - accuracy: 0.9196 - val_loss: 0.4589 - val_accuracy: 0.8768...Epoch 9/122985/2985 [==============================] - 49s 16ms/step - loss: 0.1058 - accuracy: 0.9759 - val_loss: 0.1859 - val_accuracy: 0.9438...Epoch 12/122985/2985 [==============================] - 49s 16ms/step - loss: 0.0253 - accuracy: 0.9966 - val_loss: 0.1499 - val_accuracy: 0.9625For the sake of simplicity, I decided to delete several epochs. But don’t worry, you can still see the training process history using the following code (both accuracy and loss value).plt.figure(figsize=(9,7))plt.title('Accuracy score')plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'])plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'])plt.legend(['accuracy', 'val_accuracy'])plt.show()plt.figure(figsize=(9,7))plt.title('Loss value')plt.plot(history.history['loss'])plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'])plt.legend(['loss', 'val_loss'])plt.show()Accuracy score improvement.Loss value decrease.According to the 2 graphs above, we can see that the performance of our neural network classifier is pretty good. The model achieves 99.7% of accuracy on training data and 96.3% on test data. In fact, I’ve tried to increase the number of epochs to see whether the performance can still be improved. However, somehow the accuracy on both data are just fluctuating randomly at around 90% to 97%. So then I decided to restart the training and stop at epoch 12.Model evaluationNow we are going to get deeper into the model evaluation. To me, understanding the accuracy and loss value graphs is not enough. I do prefer to construct a confusion matrix and see which class causes the neural net classifier getting confused.To do that, let’s begin with predicting our X_test data. The first line of the code below returns something like a probability value — yet it’s important to keep in mind that it’s actually not a probability since our output layer is using sigmoid activation function, not a softmax. But still, the idea is to take the highest value as the predicted class, which is done in the second line of the code below.predictions = model.predict(X_test)predictions = one_hot_encoder.inverse_transform(predictions)The next thing to do is to convert our labels back from one-hot format. My approach here is to use np.argmax() function and store the non-one-hot format in y_test_evaluate array.y_test_evaluate = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)Now as the values of predictions and ground truth are already comparable, so we can directly use confusion_matrix() function taken from Sklearn module. Remember that the arguments of this confusion matrix are the actual value and the predicted value respectively.cm = confusion_matrix(y_test_evaluate, predictions)Finally, we can just draw the confusion matrix by passing cm variable as the argument of heatmap() function. We can see the result below that strangely most of the errors here are in the politics texts. It shows that there are 21 politics-related news which are misclassified as medical science text.plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))plt.title('Confusion matrix on test data')sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', xticklabels=labels, yticklabels=labels,             cmap=plt.cm.Blues, cbar=False, annot_kws={'size':14})plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')plt.ylabel('True Label')plt.show()Confusion matrix on test data.Now what if we got a new string and we want to find out which class should this text belong to? There are several steps required to do so. First lemme create a string like this:string = 'I just purchased a new motorcycle, I feel like it is a lot better than cars'We know that the text is actually pretty clean. However, notice that there are still several stop words in which may not be important in the text above. Hence, we will pass this text into our clean() function that we defined in the earlier part of this writing.cleaned_string = clean(string)How our string looks like after being cleaned.The next thing to do is to encode those texts into numbers and store the result in encoded_string variable.encoded_string = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([cleaned_string])How our string looks like after being encoded into numbers.Now, remember that the encoded text above only consists of 8 words. We can not directly feed this into our neural network since it takes exactly 500 words in order to work. Thus, we are going to add zeros in front of this text such that there will be 500 encoded values in the string. We can simply do this using pad_sequences() function and set the maxlen argument to 500.encoded_string = sequence.pad_sequences(encoded_string, maxlen=500)I don’t wanna display the screenshot of the encoded_string here because it takes plenty of space. Just print that out yourself and you’ll see how it looks like.As the string has been at the exact same size as our trained model input, we can now start doing the prediction and store the probability-like value to the string_predict variable. Lastly we can take the argmax of string_predict value to find out the prediction made by our neural network model on our own data.string_predict = model.predict(encoded_string)np.argmax(string_predict)The prediction of our neural network on new data.We can see here that the prediction is right! The string that we are using to test this sample is highly related to motorcycle, and our neural net predicts it correctly.That’s pretty much about today’s article.

Algorithms work in the background at Facebook to do things like prescribe recommend new connections to Facebook users, to introduce content that matches a user's interest, and to block spam..However, the organization is beginning to utilize machine learning in further advanced ways, for example, for facial recognition on pictures presented on the site. Subsequent to identifying an individual in a photograph, the new Moments application can even recommend to a user that she shares it with that individual..In a recent report, a group of researchers from different German companies and colleges has highlighted the difficulties of assessing the performance of deep learning in processing visual data. In their paper, named, &quot;The Notorious Difficulty of Comparing Human and Machine Perception,&quot; the researchers highlight the issues in current methods that compare deep neural networks and the human vision system..In their study, the researcher led a series of examinations that dig underneath the surface of deep learning results and compare them with the operations of the human visual framework. Their discoveries are a reminder that we should be wary when comparing AI with people, regardless of whether it shows equivalent or better performance on a similar task..The vision of making machines that can think and act like people has evolved from film fiction to real-world facts. We have since quite a while ago endeavored to acquire Intelligence in Machines to facilitate our work. There are bots, humanoids, robots, and digital people that either outflank people or facilitate with us in many ways. These AI-driven applications have a higher speed of execution, have higher operational capacity and precision, while likewise exceptionally critical in dull and monotonous jobs compared to humans..Unexpectedly, Human Intelligence relates to adaptive learning and experience. It doesn't generally rely upon pre-fed data like the ones required for AI. Human memory, its computing power, and the human body as an element may appear to be irrelevant compared to the machine's hardware and software infrastructure. In any case, the profundity and layers present in our minds are unmistakably more complex and refined, that machines despite everything can't beat in the near future..Well AI is ending up being an important device, and an intelligent work process will be the labor-saving norm within just a few years,&quot; said Scott Robinson, a SharePoint and business intelligence expert based in Louisville, Ky. In any case, business processes include smart ideas and intelligent behavior. Artificial intelligence is extraordinary at replicating intelligent behavior, however, intelligent thought is another issue. We don't completely see how intelligent human thoughts grow, so we're not going to manufacture machines that can have them anytime soon..Deep learning (DL), a subset of AI utilizes the idea of Neural Networks that is fundamentally the same as the human nervous system and brain. Our Intelligence lies in adapted learning and in realizing how to apply the information in real-world situations. In deep learning,  we copy the ability of human brains to learn in various stages. We take care of complex issues by separating them into levels of information. Wonder how well you read a long anecdotal book a long time back and still can recall your favourite character and the famous quotes?.Apparently, in the interminable quest to reconstruct human perception, the field that has become known as computer vision, deep learning has so far yielded the greatest outcomes. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), an architecture regularly utilized in computer vision deep learning algorithms, are achieving tasks that were extremely difficult with traditional software..In any case, comparing neural networks to human perception remains a challenge. Furthermore, this is partly in light of the fact that we despite everything have a long way to learn about the human vision system and the human brain all in all. The complex functions of deep learning frameworks additionally intensify the issue. Deep neural networks work in convoluted manners that frequently confound their own makers..Going with the current data and our AI-progressions, language processing, vision, Image processing, and common sense is as yet a challenge to machines and require human mediations. Since AI is still in its advancement stage, the future lies in how well we people govern AI applications with the goal that they maintain human values and security measures. As Nick Burns, SQL Services Data Scientist clarified: &quot;Regardless of how great your models are, they are just on a par with your data.&quot;.As our AI frameworks become more intricate, we should grow more complex techniques to test them. Past work in the field shows that many of the famous benchmarks used to measure the accuracy of computer vision systems are deceiving. The work by the German researchers is one of the numerous endeavors that try to measure artificial intelligence and better measure the differences between AI and human intelligence. What's more, they reach conclusions that can give headings to future AI research..The general challenge in comparison studies between humans and machines is by all means the strong internal human interpretation bias. &quot;Proper analysis tools and extensive cross-checks –, for example, varieties in the network architecture, alignment of experimental procedures, generalization tests, adversarial examples and tests with constrained networks– help to justify the interpretation of findings and put this inner bias into point of view. All things considered, care must be taken to not force our systematic bias when comparing human and machine perception..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
