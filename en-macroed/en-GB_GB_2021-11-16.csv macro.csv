The pace of AI adoption has accelerated during the Covid crisis but the increased rate of adoption is likely to place significant extra demand on computing resources and supporting infrastructure.Appen’s recent State of AI report found that 55 percent of companies had accelerated their AI adoption in 2020 and 67 percent expected to ramp it up further this year. As AI adoption intensifies, overhead costs will become a major consideration and there is a risk these costs could snowball if organizations do not plan ahead. Top of mindThe trend was reinforced by IDC group vice president for AI and Automation Research Ritu Jyoti who said the pandemic had “pushed AI to the top of the corporate agenda, empowering business resilience and relevance.”

AI in the data center; still a work in progress for all but the hyperscalers


While the hyperscalers have the scale and technical nous, deploying AI en masse is still an ongoing effort for most data center operators




He added: “We have now entered the domain of AI-augmented work and decision across all the functional areas of a business. Responsible creation and use of AI solutions that can sense, predict, respond and adapt at speed is an important business imperative.”Jyoti’s comments accompanied publication of IDC estimates that the global AI market will increase by 15.2 percent this year to a value of $341.8 billion. The market is expected to surpass $500 billion by 2024.When it comes to infrastructure, businesses have to adapt and be flexible. This need for flexibility is making cloud, particularly hybrid cloud, the foundation of AI, especially as the need for substantial amounts of data ratchet up. Using hybrid cloud, companies can meet the technology demands of AI at the right cost level for their businesses and their workloads.Infrastructure-as-a–Service (IaaS) gives organizations the ability to use, develop and implement AI without sacrificing performance. But there are a number of infrastructure elements that organizations need to bear in mind when evaluating potential IaaS providers.1 Computing performanceBusinesses need access to significant performance computing resources, including CPUs and GPUs, to fully take advantage of the opportunities presented by AI. Machine learning algorithms require speed and performance to transact a huge number of calculations. While a CPU-based environment can handle basic AI workloads, deep learning involves multiple large data sets and the capability to deploy scalable neural network algorithms.CPU-based computing might not be able to meet those objectives and GPUs could be a better option. The greater performance provided by GPUs can significantly accelerate deep learning compared to CPUs. But that speed comes at a higher cost and in some instances it may not be cost-effective to switch from CPU to GPU. It is important to get the right balance for the required tasks.2 Storage capacityThe ability to scale storage as data volumes grow is fundamental for many businesses. Organizations need to ascertain what types of storage they need and there are a number of factors to consider, including the level of AI they plan to use and whether they need to make real-time decisions. For example, a FinTech company using AI systems for real-time trading decisions may need fast all-flash storage technology, while other companies could be better served by larger capacity but less rapid storage. Businesses need to calculate how much data their AI applications will generate because AI applications make better decisions when they are exposed to more data. Databases grow over time so companies need to monitor their storage capacity and plan properly for expansion. 3 Networking infrastructureNetworking is another key component of AI infrastructure. Good, fast and reliable networks are essential to maximise the delivery of results. Deep learning algorithms are highly dependent on communications, so networks need to keep pace with demand as AI efforts expand. Scalability is a high priority and AI requires a high-bandwidth, low-latency network. It is important to ensure the service wrap and technology stack are consistent for all regions.  4 SecurityAI can involve handling sensitive data such as patient records, financial information and personal data, so it is imperative the infrastructure is secured end-to-end with state-of-the-art technology. It goes without saying that a data breach would be a disaster for any organization but with AI any infusion of bad data could cause the system to make incorrect inferences, leading to flawed decisions.5 Keep it cost-effectiveAs AI models become more complex, they become more expensive to run, so it’s critical to get extra performance from the infrastructure to keep costs under control. As companies increase their use of AI, they will place heavier burdens on the network, server and storage infrastructures.  Businesses need to make careful choices and identify IaaS providers that can offer cost-effective dedicated servers as a means to boost performance and to enable them to continue investing in AI without increasing their budget.What IaaS providers can doOrganizations looking to deploy AI services must ensure they have the right foundations in place to support them. Any IaaS provider needs to be able to deliver the right infrastructure for customers building their services on AI.The onus is on IaaS providers to:constantly investigate and invest in the latest CPU and GPU technology because this is key to deploying successful AI workloads;improve networks for greater speed and delivery;use automation to deliver a large percentage of their service to speed up the time to action for clients;improve performance by utilising automation tools to monitor their system and to use the most efficient routes.

“Do you think you know me better?”This is the question British artist Gillian Wearing asks at the end of her five-minute-long video work Wearing, Gillian (2018), produced in collaboration with the advertising agency Wieden + Kennedy. To create the work, Wearing used an artificial intelligence (AI) technique known as deepfaking to superimpose her face onto those of actors, essentially using her likeness as a mask.Deepfaking is an AI technology that aims at synthesizing videos of faces by transferring the speech of one subject into the facial animation of another. This is achieved by separating the facial appearance from the lip movements and facial expressions associated with the spoken words in video. One of the earliest plausible examples was a fake video of President Barack Obama, created by researchers at the University of Washington in 2017. Wearing employed deepfake technology to explore the masquerade of identity and selfhood, and to highlight the potentially concerning impacts of AI, namely the spread of disinformation and the increasing inability to trust the authenticity of what we see.While Wearing’s practice does not center on technology in itself, Wearing, Gillian is an example of how AI can be used to create art—something with which more artists have been experimenting. But even when deepfaking is not the specific technique used, this question of identity and authenticity comes up time and again when we consider what the future could be like when AI contributes more significantly to the generation of content.Since the development of the first digital computer in the 1940s, scientists have pushed the limits of what computers can do. Capable of carrying out complex undertakings, computer technology is now being infused with various abilities—such as learning, perception, language use, and reasoning (known collectively as AI)—that facilitate the automation of tasks that were once only accomplishable by humans.Now that AI capabilities are permeating areas previously exclusive to human creativity, such as art, music, and cinematography, it is natural to ask: What will be the future of art in an AI-driven society? This is something that artists such as Trevor Paglen, whose work focuses on looking at parts of the world that are otherwise out of sight, have begun to investigate in depth through their practice. “Over the last ten years or so, powerful algorithms and artificial intelligence networks have enabled computers to ‘see’ autonomously,” Paglen wrote in 2017. “What does it mean that ‘seeing’ no longer requires a human ‘seer’ in the loop?”Most AI tools come pretrained and preloaded with tens of thousands of images, videos, and sounds, and because AI programs are developed by humans, they are inevitably impacted by biases that have developed from our assumptions, expectations, and societal norms. This is where the question of identity and authenticity comes into play for artists who are experimenting with the technology. If an artist’s work is influenced by anything other than their own creative process, is their artistic identity compromised? How can the individuality of the artists come through when more than one artist is using the same AI technology? And if the AI is already trained with certain imagery, is the artist’s role reduced to curating the outcomes of such AI?Understanding the role of the artist is fundamental in accepting AI as an artistic medium. A similar issue appeared in art history before, in the late 19th century with the emergence of photography. In his book Art and Photography (1968), Aaron Scharf highlights a French court case from 1861, brought by photographers Léopold Mayer and Pierre-Louis Pierson against other photographers pirating their prints, that explored whether photography can be protected by copyright as art. Scharf comments, “For photography to be considered an art it became necessary to settle the question of whether or not it was possible for the photographer to manipulate his medium in the way that a painter could his.”Does an AI program preloaded with content ultimately permit an artist to manipulate the medium in a way that allows the expression of their individual identity? There have been incidents in which artists from opposite sides of the globe, using the same AI program, generated almost exactly the same works and disputed their attribution. In my work at Playform, an AI tool designed for making art, I’ve found that this is the most significant concern artists have around incorporating AI into their practice.What’s more, the AI could have generated the same exact result randomly without the artist. At Rutgers University’s Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, we developed AICAN, an AI program with enough knowledge of artistic styles and aesthetics to generate its own images. AICAN’s works have been exhibited globally and have even sold at auctions. A study that my colleagues and I conducted several years ago found that people could not distinguish artworks created by AI from those created by contemporary artists. Seventy-five percent of the time, people thought that works by AICAN had been produced by humans.Fortunately, with advances in AI, it is now possible to use AI as a creative tool without preloaded content restricting artistic expression. Some artist-centered platforms, such as Playform, allow users to train their own AI from scratch, making the case of their individual identity unquestionable. Due to the nature of the medium itself, however, there will always remain biases that we may never fully understand.As for how AI will ultimately shape the future of art-making—we’ll have to wait and see.See Wearing’s work in the exhibition Gillian Wearing: Wearing Masks, on view at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, through April 4, 2022.

In the three years since, Google has stayed true to his word. The company has built a significant line of business atop deep relationships with defense and intelligence agencies, including a series of contracts that haven’t drawn the same scrutiny or outcry as Project Maven.
Google’s thriving defense portfolio includes a project detecting corrosion on Navy vessels by applying machine learning to drone imagery and another supporting aircraft maintenance for the Air Force. Google also supplies cloud security technology to the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit, set up to help the agency work more closely with tech companies. In November 2020, Google won a piece of a large CIA cloud contract. And in May, it jointly won a $1.3 billion deal with Amazon to supply cloud services to the Israeli government, including its defense agencies.
Events this month suggest there may be more big defense deals in Google’s future. Two weeks ago the company said it had received a Pentagon security certification allowing it to handle “controlled” government information. The same day, The New York Times reported that Google was preparing a bid for the Pentagon’s most significant cloud contract yet, the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability. Not long after, Google launched a webpage touting its contracts and support for the “critical missions of [its] military and national security personnel,” and its cloud chief Thomas Kurian was photographed, beaming, with the Army’s chief information officer. In a blog post Friday, Kurian confirmed his interest in the warfighter cloud project, saying Google will serve “proudly” if selected and will adhere to its AI principles.
The Pentagon likes what it sees. Mike Brown, director of the Defense Innovation Unit, said this month that a vocal minority of protesters caught Google “flat footed” a few years ago, but management had since made clear “they want to pursue business” with the Department of Defense. “Personally I think we need Google,” he said. “I’m glad to see the change.”
Google declined to comment and referred WIRED to Kurian’s blog post. He has led Google’s cloud unit since 2019 and previously had a long tenure at Oracle, known for a sales-driven culture and comfort with US defense and intelligence agencies—the CIA was its first customer.
Some Google employees distrust their bosses’ increasingly open embrace of defense and intelligence work. Around 700 signed a letter sent to Kurian and Pichai in October asking them to abandon the deal with the Israeli government, because it would contribute to surveillance and unlawful data collection on Palestinians. Some Amazon workers wrote to their own bosses; employees from both companies penned an opinion piece in the Guardian.
One Google employee who works in AI research and signed the letter feared that a contract with a close US ally could help Google make sales to the Pentagon and other agencies. The employee says the Israeli deal, known as Project Nimbus, was a “bellwether” for Google's ability to cement military contracts. Such contracts make it “inevitable our technology will be used to harm or surveil our own users because we’re a global company,” the employee says.
The Googler would prefer Google abandon military work altogether and takes little comfort from its AI principles. The Israeli finance ministry has said the contract bars companies from denying services to specific parts of the government. “Google has shown very little transparency around any of the details of these contracts or the AI principles reviews they supposedly undergo,” the employee says.
It would be challenging for any employee protest to achieve the scale or impact of the Maven protests. Google’s legendarily freewheeling internal culture has become more locked down since then, for example by tightening access to information about projects in development. Some leaders of protests against Maven and other causes at Google have complained of retaliation and left the company. The company is fighting charges from the US National Labor Relations Board that it inappropriately monitored, interrogated, or fired several workers involved in labor organizing or protesting a cloud contract with Customs and Border Protection. In the past year, prominent AI researchers Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell were forced out after managers objected to a paper urging caution with software that processes text.
Google has worked with the US military since long before it sold cloud computing. The Federal Procurement Data System shows the Coast Guard bought licenses to Google Earth in 2005; the Army did the same in 2007. The Pentagon had a sympathetic ear at the top. In 2016, Eric Schmidt, formerly Google’s CEO and then Alphabet’s executive chair, became chair of the department’s Defense Innovation Advisory Board, which promoted tech industry collaboration with the agency.
Google won the Maven contract in late 2017, just before Schmidt stepped down as Alphabet’s chair. There were Googlers who disagreed with the project from the start. Early in 2018, Bloomberg later reported, a group of nine workers unhappy with Maven delayed plans to deploy a security feature called an “air gap” needed for Pentagon certifications. The project continued, but the Maven protests burst noisily into the open, prompting management to let the contract expire and announce the AI principles. Google says it has internal review processes to enforce those guidelines that have turned away some commercial business.
It now appears that while the Maven protests slowed Google down, they didn’t significantly trim its ambitions in national security.
Jack Poulson, a former Googler who is now executive director of nonprofit Tech Inquiry, says the air gap and Maven protesters deserve credit for hindering the company’s plans and forcing it to introduce some AI oversight. But he says the broad exceptions built into the AI principles and Google’s permissive interpretation makes them into a shield used to deflect scrutiny rather than a meaningful moral compass. “I think they just want plausible deniability,” Poulson says. He quit Google in late 2018 over a project that would have adapted search technology to comply with Chinese internet censorship.
Alphabet Workers’ Union, which represents a small minority of Google employees, tweeted Monday that although Google’s AI principles say the technology should always be “socially beneficial,” Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability would “modernize the DOD's tools of war & lead to the extrajudicial killing of people around the globe.”
Google remains far behind Amazon and Microsoft in competing for both commercial cloud computing deals and for government and defense contracts. Both have higher security certifications than Google, allowing them to handle classified information. And both are more openly supportive of working with the US government on national security.
Amazon has deals with many parts of the Pentagon, including one with Special Operations Command using AI to analyze media seized by US troops. Microsoft’s contracts include an Army project equipping soldiers with augmented reality headsets. It drew employee protests but not at the scale of those at Google. A spokesperson for Amazon said the company’s commitment to “ensuring that our warfighters and defense partners have access to the best technology at the best price is stronger than ever.” Microsoft declined to comment; the company says its Office of Responsible AI reviews “sensitive” uses of its technology.
Google’s chance to compete for the sweeping Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability contract came after the Pentagon in July nixed the original version, named JEDI and worth up to $10 billion, which was awarded to Microsoft. Amazon and Oracle had claimed in lawsuits the award process was unfair.
JWCC has a different format that will see work shared among multiple companies. The Pentagon has said Amazon and Microsoft are pre-qualified to bid and that it will consider inviting IBM, Oracle, and Google.
That structure could be good for Google. The company said in late 2018 that it would not bid for JEDI because it might breach its AI principles and—significantly—it lacked security certifications. Kurian said in his blog post Friday that missing certificates had been the “foremost” reason but that Google now had additional certificates. He said JWCC’s format would allow Google to pick contracts within the scope of its AI principles, leaving more fraught work to others.
Jerry McGinn, executive director of the Center for Government Contracting at George Mason University, expects multi-cloud contracts to become common as federal cloud spending grows. That could help Google negotiate the constraints of its AI principles and its lack of certifications.
Modular contracts reduce the risk of legal challenges like that which sunk JEDI and add competition that improves value for the Pentagon, McGinn says.
Bloomberg Government estimated that in 2020 the federal government spent $6.6 billion on cloud contracts, with defense agencies nearly a third of that total, and that cloud spending was increasing around 10 percent a year. In 2019 the Pentagon released an AI strategy that calls for adoption of the technology in every aspect of the US military, underpinned by cloud computing.
What exactly JWCC contractors will be asked to do is not yet known. The program’s name suggests some work could be directly related to armed conflict. The Pentagon’s chief information officer said in July that JWCC would offer better support than JEDI to AI projects—Google’s specialty—including a program developing algorithms to help commanders identify targets. The Pentagon is expected to release the formal request for proposals in coming weeks and aims to award contracts by April 2022.

Davis·FollowPublished inDataDrivenInvestor·6 min read·Nov 17, 2021142ListenShareImage by the Author from CanvaArtificial intelligence is one of the most exciting technologies to emerge in recent years. It’s still early days, but there are already lots of applications that are adding value to our lives and we can expect many more developments in the coming months and years.Here are just a few reasons to be excited about this technology:1. AI will make existing products betterAI will not replace human workers; instead, it will help organizations and employees run their businesses and maximize productivity. For example, Google recently improved its search function by installing an AI system called RankBrain which helps match relevant web pages with user queries.This has improved the accuracy of searches for highly complex or technical terms or when users use colloquial language or spelling errors.AI could also help Amazon warehouse employees sort packages more quickly by telling them which box to grab next. AI systems have been developed that can predict a person’s movements and interactions with products in a store, allowing for faster processing of customer orders.In the legal field, AI systems are being designed to sift through documents and summarize relevant information for lawyers so they don’t have to spend hours reading through large volumes of material.2. AI will produce new types of jobsAI has the potential to solve a lot of our problems — from diagnosing illness and driving cars safely to performing high-level tasks like financial analysis or management consulting.But when we think about this technology, it is easy to get caught up in the negative aspects of job loss.One study suggests that about 47% of U.S. employment is at risk from AI and other forms of automation, but this shouldn’t give us cause for alarm because it also creates the opportunity to develop new technologies and service industries which will generate lots of new jobs.In fact, a recent paper found that only 5% of jobs will be fully replaced by technology like AI while the rest will be either augmented or complemented by it. Already we see people who are training themselves to become data scientists to take advantage of all the opportunities that exist in analyzing large amounts…A Day In The Life Of A Copywriter. Here’s What It Looks LikeIn this article you’ll find out what a typical day is like for a copywriter — from finding inspiration for blog posts…jamesjdavis.medium.com3. It can help us solve crimesOne area where AI has already been successfully implemented is in catching criminals.In the United States, the Los Angeles Police Department has been working with Palantir Technologies to analyze large data sets in order to discover patterns and identify individuals who could be engaged in criminal activity.This is based on software that was initially designed for counter-terrorism operations but can be applied much more widely to help fight crime.For example, it can be used to detect fraudulent activities by employees at a company or predict where crimes are most likely to occur so that police officers can patrol those areas.4. It will enable us to explore space more efficientlyAI systems are also being used in aerospace engineering and research into new materials, including for use in building spacecraft that will enable us to explore Earth’s orbit.These AI systems are helping to find new planets beyond our solar system, enabling scientists to gain a better understanding of the origins of life. They are also being used to investigate materials that can be used in building space elevators that will transport material into space at a fraction of today’s costs.5. AI can be applied to almost anythingThe technology involved in AI is basically the ability for computers to learn from data so they can make sense of it and reason about it without any human input or specific programming.This means AI possibilities are endless because there is so much data available today — whether it’s medical records, financial information, social media posts or online shopping habits — and we haven’t even come close to maximizing its potential yet.Many companies have been successful in applying AI to a range of different tasks, from making movie recommendations to predicting energy consumption.6. It can help us design more effective drugsPharmaceutical companies are working on combining machine learning with molecular simulations to create new molecules that could potentially be used as the basis for drug development.The hope is this will enable them to develop more effective and economical medicines because they will have a better understanding of what makes the most promising candidates work so they can quickly narrow down their options and save time and resources.7. It could lead to breakthroughs in many different fieldsIn addition to all these practical applications, the possibilities of AI extend into all sorts of other areas such as art, education and healthcare. For example, there are researchers who are using AI to make paintings based on data sets.It could also be used in educational settings, such as providing personalized learning paths for students, helping them learn faster and more efficiently, receiving instant feedback on their progress and enabling them to work at their own pace.And AI can also help doctors treat patients by providing an early warning system for medical conditions that may not yet present symptoms or diagnosing diseases by scanning patient records for anomalies.8. We can expect even more exciting things from AIThe field of artificial intelligence is growing fast with big strides being made each year so it’s important to remind ourselves that this isn’t just about doing the same things faster — it’s about doing new things that were previously impossible which will have a huge impact on our lives.We can expect even more exciting things from AI as the technology progresses and becomes more widespread so there’s no doubt it will continue to be part of our everyday lives in the future.9. AI can help you write texts and headlines for your articlesImage by the Author from JarvisI’m sure I’ve told you guys about my successful attempt at using AI to write articles and headlines for me.I used a program called “Jarvis Conversion AI” and it was pretty easy to use. You just paste in what you want to be written and then tell the software what genre the text is and how formal it should be.It also has a section where you can specify what type of people the article is targeting, which is really helpful if you do SEO (search engine optimization).Anyway, so I told it I wanted it to be within the “-ing” genre with a formal writing style for an audience of professionals. You can have it written in multiple genres and styles too if you need some variety.I also asked Jarvis to rank itself on certain keywords like “Artificial Intelligence” and “Future Technology”. Then, let the program do its work!When I checked back 5 minutes later, it had written all kinds of content that was pretty interesting to read!It’s easy to think of AI as a futuristic technology that we can’t wait to see, but it’s already right in front of us. It’s almost as if it has been hiding in plain sight all this time.There are many reasons to be excited for the future of AI and here are just a few- from helping fight crime more efficiently, enabling exploration into space with less effort, being able to apply it across different industries or even making breakthroughs in healthcare.As companies continue developing smarter algorithms and building on what they’ve learned so far about how best to leverage the power of artificial intelligence systems, there is no doubt that our lives will change dramatically because of them.If you’re interested in learning more about how these cognitive neuroscience principles may be able to help you become more persuasive, check out the free persuasion guide here.If you want to support my writing, become a Medium member.

Elizabeth Bondi ’16 (imaging science) 
Faculty: Carl Salvaggio




Elizabeth Bondi explored a range of technical and research skills during her years as an imaging science student at RIT. She used those skills to develop an algorithm that aided in preventing poaching in South Africa, and now she’s pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Harvard University.












“Seeing how different technologies apply in the real world is very inspiring to me.”
Elizabeth Bondi ’16 explored a range of technical and research skills during her years as an imaging science student at RIT. The Innovative Freshman Experience piqued her curiosity, taught her how to ask good questions and how to push through obstacles that came up often in research. And she’s never looked back. Today, she’s continuing her research as a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Harvard University.
Before arriving at RIT as a student, Elizabeth was able to try out the imaging science program through the Imaging Science Summer High School Intern Program. As a high school intern, she used Yarbus software in eye tracking research and conducted experiments using mobile and stationary eye trackers. After enrolling at RIT, Elizabeth took full advantage of the work and research opportunities available. She started as an Imaging Science Research Assistant, processing historical manuscript images using ENVI 5.0 Classic and IDL. Elizabeth earned a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF, now called SURE!) and automated this process during that time. In 2014 she traveled to Italy to image manuscripts at the Museo del Tesoro del Duomo in Vercelli.
Elizabeth also secured two co-ops while at RIT. She worked in NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Mars Rover where she used images and ArcGIS Desktop to characterize possible landing sites for the Perseverance and InSight missions to Mars. As an image science intern with L3Harris, Elizabeth created a feature matching algorithm that used both spatial and spectral information.
Thanks to the broad exposure to programming, image processing, and automation in the image science coursework, research, and internship opportunities, Elizabeth was confident she wanted to pursue computer vision and artificial intelligence further. She enrolled in the Computer Science Ph.D. program at the University of Southern California and worked as a Graduate Student Research Assistant. Her research focused on developing an algorithm to aid in efforts to prevent poaching in South Africa. The algorithm would suggest unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight locations and interventions based on estimates of the number of animals and distance to various park features like boundaries, rivers, and roads. Park rangers could also choose flight locations based on their prior knowledge. Then they used thermal infrared (8-10 μm), UAV-based imagery to automatically detect humans and animals during the flight.
After transferring to the Computer Science Ph.D. program at Harvard University, Elizabeth continued to work in computer vision and deep learning, remote sensing, and multi-agent systems, especially applied to conservation and sustainability. Compared to her peers, Elizabeth feels she brings a new perspective to problem-solving and interdisciplinary research. For example, she was able to demonstrate that we should consider the uncertainty in predictions based on thermal images.
Elizabeth also founded a non-profit organization called Try AI that seeks to increase diversity in the field of artificial intelligence. The organization connects high school and college students with research opportunities in AI, especially as it applies to society.
Through it all, Elizabeth has found that perseverance, curiosity, and a willingness to ask questions were essential skills to do her work. She advised, “To do research it helps to be curious about what will or won’t work, and to want to find those answers, even through the ups and downs. Make sure to take the time to ask questions of yourself, your data, your collaborators, your professors, your users, and people otherwise affected by your work.”
Elizabeth recommends that high school students consider the Imaging Science Summer High School Intern Program. She also encourages all students to try things early to see if they like them. Elizabeth found her passion and path through the many research and work opportunities she took advantage of at RIT. She hopes to become a professor or a research scientist in industry in the future.

We sat down with April19 founder Dr. Suran Goonatilake to talk about the merging of the two.While we had a lot of fantastic conversations at the largest psychedelic medical conference of all time last week, it’s fair to say we found ourselves picking up our jaws from the floor at Microdose Miami as we learned about April19’s results so far. But first, just so you can wrap your head around Goonatilake’s work before April19, he is a visiting professor at the University College London Centre for Artificial Intelligence. He has already founded companies in the AI space and had successful exits. Goonatilake got his Ph.D. in machine learning and co-founded Searchspace for the finance sector. He is the co-editor of the books “Intelligent Systems for Finance and Business” and “Intelligent Hybrid Systems.” He was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2005.“AI does the work so humans can be on the beach. That’s the general gist of it,” Goonatilake told L.A. Weekly. Essentially, April19 taught the AI the work of Alexander Shulgin. Shulgin is the godfather of modern psychedelic science and most notably invented MDMA among an array of other beneficial substances he would sample with his wife before bringing them to dinner parties with friends. April19 told the AI to go nuts. In the process, the AI identified 17 new compounds that have the potential to provide healing benefits. But it gets crazier. With the DEA’s approval of an increase in the psychedelic research supply chain, there is going to be tons of data for the AI to process over the next 24 months as more psilocybin and MDMA is eventually divided up between researchers across the nation. The AI will be able to use any kind of human data it’s able to get its hands on moving forward to make its process even more refined. “What we’ll show today is that you can use the power of evolution. So this is a particular style of AI called evolution machines to discover new psychedelic components,” Goonatilake said. “Evolution is arguably the most powerful problem-solving issue we know. That’s why we’re all here. And that’s what we’re trying to harness. That’s what we have harnessed. So the starting point for the work that we presented today was that the Godfather of psychedelics.”Goonatilake took a minute to go heavy on the Shulgin praise given most of the psychedelic compounds of the last 50 years were discovered by him. He argues the entire industry is built on top of a foundation built by Shulgin. April19 would start its work with the same four compounds that were known at the start of Shulgin’s work. They are DMT, LSD, psilocybin and mescaline.“We started with those four compounds and then we applied this evolutionary approach called evolution machines, which effectively combines different parts of the molecule into different novel ways,” Goonatilake explains. “And in this case, we can test whether those things are good enough based on how well it fits into your receptor – in this particular case, this receptor – and you’ll let this run continuously producing better and better campaigns.”The AI allows the April19 team to replicate decades’ worth of lab work rapidly. And the machine learning process never stops. As I type this, as you read it, the machine is hunting down new compounds regardless of water and food. “Then we let it run further. We let it run longer,” says Goonatilake. “And then we have 21 AI modules that test whether those molecules are any good or not.”The modules check things like whether the compound will be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier or be toxic to your heart. “After all that testing they get to potential candidate molecules that you can take orally as opposed to injections because the injections are a pain in the neck and it looks like a central nervous system drug,” Goonatilake notes. “And then we come up with a whole bunch of new molecules which were never known before that we’re now ready to license.”So far, 17 molecules have checked all the boxes when reviewed by the AI modules. Each one, separately, is considered very promising for its potential. And now that Goonatilake and the team at April19 have done the cutting edge part, they can push their work into a more traditional biopharma model to capitalize on it in hopes of eventually getting these compounds to consumers down the line. The next step for April19? New substances that work on even more receptors in the brain. “Turn on not one but many other receptors as well,” Goonatilake explains. “And some of them partially, not fully. I think that’s going to be one area where future blockbuster drugs are going to be and another area that people are very excited about. It is about psychedelics that are not hallucinogenic.”Advertising disclosure: We may receive compensation for some of the links in our stories.

Do not forget to check these crucial AI ethical questions..Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly shaping modern life. From choosing TV shows to making business decisions, AI is practically everywhere. But despite all these remarkable possibilities, there is also the potential that AI might cause more harm than good — sometimes inadvertently, as in the case when AI makes biased predictions, or sometimes intentionally when it is used to manufacture misinformation or convincing deepfakes. To get a job in the field of artificial intelligence, then you need to prepare for the crucial questions for the AI interview. Every interview is indeed different as per the job profiles. Companies are offering various opportunities to tech-enthusiasts. If you are looking for crucial questions for an AI interview, Analytics Insight presents the top ten usually asked AI ethical questions in interviews. And they are as follows:.What happens if AI replaces humans in the workplace?.As machines have taken on more and more monotonous and dangerous types of work, and people have been able to switch to more interesting mental work. This is one of the crucial AI Ethical questions usually asked in an interview..How do we protect access to AI from bad actors?.As AI becomes more powerful in society, it will also become more dangerous as a weapon. It is possible to imagine a scary scenario where a bad actor takes over the artificial intelligence model that controls a city's water supply, power grid, or traffic signals. Cybersecurity will become more crucial than ever..How will machines affect human interactions?.This is one of the most sensitive AI ethical questions asked in an interview where your presence of mind is tested, and the way you answer this question will decide your position in the company. An interesting ethical dilemma of artificial intelligence is the decline in human interaction. Now more than any time in history it is possible to entertain yourself at home, alone..Artificial intelligence simply being a codification of existing biases, what is your opinion about it?.Bias is a well-established facet of AI (or of human intelligence, for that matter). AI takes on the biases of the dataset it learns from. This means that if researchers train an AI on data that are skewed for the race, gender, education, wealth, or any other point of bias, Artificial Intelligence will learn that bias. This is also one of the most important questions for an AI interview..WHAT BUSINESS &amp; ACCOUNTING SCHOOLS SHOULD TEACH ABOUT AITOP EDGE AI COMPANIES TO KNOW AND WATCH OUT IN 2021 FOR SURETOP PROS AND CONS OF AI IN CLOUD COMPUTING FOR YOU TO KNOW.What is ethical artificial intelligence, and why is it important?.Ethical AI ensures that the AI initiatives of the organization or entity maintain human dignity and do not in any way cause harm to people. That encompasses many things, such as fairness, anti-weaponization, and liability, such as in the case of self-driving cars that encounter accidents..How do we protect against unintended consequences?.What if artificial intelligence itself turned against humans? This does not mean turning &quot;evil&quot; in the way a human might or the way AI disasters are depicted in Hollywood movies. Rather, we can imagine an advanced AI system as a &quot;genie in a bottle&quot; that can fulfill wishes but with terrible unforeseen consequences..How do we stay in control of a complex intelligent system?.Here an interviewer wants to see your knowledge about the technology and the complex intelligent system. The reason humans are on top of the food chain is not down to sharp teeth or strong muscles. Human dominance is almost entirely due to our ingenuity and intelligence..How do we define the humane treatment of AI?.As neuroscientists are working on unlocking the secrets of conscious experience, people understand more about the basic mechanisms of reward and aversion. This question is one of the widely asked AI Ethical questions in a job interview..How can we guard against mistakes made by artificial intelligence?.When you look for crucial questions for an AI interview, you will definitely come across this question. Intelligence comes from learning, whether you are human or machine. Systems usually have a training phase in which they &quot;learn&quot; to detect the right patterns and act according to their input..Do you think AI can or should have rights?.Now you have come to the part where the ethical concern is whether AI can or should have rights. As a piece of computer code, it is tempting to think that artificially intelligent systems cannot have feelings. You can get angry with Siri or Alexa without hurting their feelings. However, consciousness and intelligence operate on a system of reward and aversion..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
