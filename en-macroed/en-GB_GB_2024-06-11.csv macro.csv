Artificial Intelligence (AI) Employment Discrimination Laws Proposed in Six States: What Employers Need to Know (US)
By Gabrielle Martin on June 11, 2024 Posted in Artificial Intelligence, California, Colorado, Discrimination, Hiring, Illinois, State Law Updates, Washington



We recently wrote about Colorado’s historic law aimed at protecting, among others, employees and employment applicants from harm arising out of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Although Colorado is the first state to pass legislation addressing AI-based discrimination, similar bills have been proposed in at least six other states as well as at the federal level, with a recent Executive Order discussing a wide range of issues arising from the private-sector use of AI systems, including discrimination in the employment context. All US employers should take note of this trend and prepare for the possibility of new compliance obligations resulting from employer use of AI systems.
States with proposed legislation addressing algorithmic discrimination

In 2024, legislators in California, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, and Washington proposed bills aimed at regulating the use of AI systems to make, or to assist an employer in making, employment decisions. More specifically, these bills seek to mitigate the risk of algorithmic discrimination arising from an employer’s use of an AI system.
 “Algorithmic discrimination” means any condition in which the use of an AI system results in differential treatment or impact that disfavors an individual on the basis of protected characteristics (e.g., age, color, ethnicity, disability, national origin, race, religion, veteran status, and sex).
Each of the proposed bills would impose similar obligations onto employers that use an AI system or an automated decision tool (ADT) in making employment-related decisions. ADT means a system that uses AI and has been specifically developed to make, or contribute to making, consequential decisions, including employment decisions.
In general, these proposed bills impose a duty of reasonable care on employers to mitigate and assess the risk of algorithmic discrimination arising from their use of AI systems. There are significant affirmative reporting requirements, including direct notifications to individuals who are the subject of a decision made by an AI system. In some cases, the bills also provide individuals with the chance to correct data input into the AI system and appeal adverse consequential decisions, which may require human review. The specifics of each state’s proposed bill are discussed further below.
California: AB 2930

The bill would (i) prohibit employers from using ADTs in a discriminatory manner; (ii) require employers to perform annual impact assessments of its use of an ADT; and (iii) require employers to provide notice to applicants and employees that are subject to the use of an ADT.
The law provides a narrow exception for employers with fewer than 25 employees.
If passed, the bill will go into effect on January 1, 2026.

Georgia: H.B. 890

The bill would (i) expand existing anti-discrimination laws to prohibit discrimination resulting from the use of or reliance upon AI or ADTs, and (ii) preclude employers from relying upon the use of AI or ADTs as a defense to an allegation of discrimination.
The proposed bill does not provide an effective date.

Hawaii: H.B. 1607

The bill would (i) prohibit employers from using ADTs in a discriminatory manner; (ii) require employers to perform annual impact assessments of its use of an ADT; and (iii) require employers to provide notice to applicants and employees that are subject to the use of an ADT.
The law provides a narrow exception for employers with fewer than 50 employees.
The proposed bill does not provide an effective date.

Illinois: H.B. 5322

The Illinois Commercial Algorithmic Impact Assessments Act would require annual impact assessments by employers that use AI systems.
The law provides a narrow exception for employers with fewer than 50 employees.
If passed, the bill will go into effect on January 1, 2026.

Washington: H.B. 1951

The bill would (i) prohibit employers from using ADTs in a discriminatory manner; (ii) require employers to perform annual impact assessments of its use of an ADT; and (iii) require employers to provide notice to applicants and employees that are subject to the use of an ADT.
The law provides a narrow exception for employers with fewer than 50 employees.
If passed, the bill will go into effect on January 1, 2025.

In California and Washington, legislation aimed at addressing algorithmic discrimination previously failed in 2023. However, in both states, the currently-proposed bills now carry the support of several large, influential technology-based employers.
What federal regulations addressing algorithmic discrimination could contain

No federal legislation addressing AI-based discrimination in employment has been proposed at this time. That said, however, the President’s recent Executive Order indicates that issues arising from the use of AI systems also are being considered at the federal level. When Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act (“CAIA”) into law, he expressed his opinion that “the important work of protecting consumers from discrimination” arising from the use of AI systems “is better considered and applied by the federal government[.]”[1] Governor Polis also suggested that there is a chance that the federal government preempts CAIA “with a needed cohesive federal approach.”[2]
In his Executive Order, President Biden directs the federal government to “enforce existing consumer protection laws and principles and enact appropriate safeguards against…unintended bias, discrimination…and other harms from AI.” In addition, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division was required to meet with the head of the federal government’s civil rights office to discuss comprehensive use of their respective authorities to prevent and address algorithmic discrimination in the use of AI systems.
Should the federal government pass regulations on employers’ use of AI systems, the requirements will likely mirror legislation addressing the same issue at a state level. Thus, federal regulation could impose on employers affirmative reporting requirements related to the use of an AI system and a duty of reasonable care to mitigate the risk of algorithmic discrimination when using AI systems to make employment decisions.
What all US employers need to know

Although state legislatures and the federal government only recently began to tackle issues arising from the use of AI, including by employers to make employment related decisions, the sheer number of proposals addressing the issue suggests that the trend towards regulation of AI systems will continue moving forward and moving fast. Beyond the scope of this blog, legislators across the nation have also proposed various bills addressing other issues arising from the use of AI, such as pornographic deepfakes and the use of AI chat bots.
Colorado still is the only US jurisdiction that currently regulates an employer’s use of AI systems. However, employers outside of Colorado should take note of how regulation at the federal level and at the state level could impact their use of an AI system or ADTs.
Our team will continue to monitor these and other state employment law developments. If you have questions or need guidance on your use of an AI system, please contact your Squire Patton Boggs lawyer.

Unlike “traditional” AI that relies on predetermined rules and patterns, generative AI is able to produce novel content – like text, video, images, and music. In a way, unlike old AI, generative AI can think outside the box. Its implications are profound and sprawling, with the potential to reshape virtually every branch of society. 
Conversations about AI often turn on whether it will be a net positive or negative for society, but our new research as part of an international team suggests that acknowledging AI’s apparent paradoxes can help us develop a clearer picture about its risks and potential benefits. We focused on four major areas of society: information, work, education and healthcare.
Work
Digital technologies have a history of skewed benefits. More educated workers benefit while less-educated workers are displaced through automation – a trend known as “skill-biased technological change”. By contrast, generative AI promises to enhance rather than replace human capabilities, potentially reversing this adverse trend. Studies have shown that AI tools like chat assistants and programming aids can significantly boost productivity and job satisfaction, especially for less-skilled workers.
Nonetheless, uneven access to AI technologies could worsen existing inequalities as those lacking necessary digital infrastructure or skills get left behind. For example, generative AI is unlikely to have much direct impact on the global south in the near future, due to insufficient investment in the prerequisite digital infrastructure and skills. 
School
Generative AI can enhance personal support and adaptability in learning. Chatbot tutors, for instance, are set to transform educational settings by providing real-time, personalised instruction and support. This technology can realise the dream of dynamic, skill-adaptive teaching methods that directly respond to student needs without constant teacher intervention.

Yet, it must be carefully implemented to avoid perpetuating or introducing biases, not only in terms of the information that is fed into AIs but also how they are used. For instance, a study revealed that female students report using ChatGPT less frequently than their male counterparts. This disparity in technology usage could not only have immediate effects on academic achievement, but also contribute to a future gender gap in the workforce.
Healthcare
Generative AI could help doctors make better choices. But it could also drive them to make worse ones. 
Generative AI could augment human capacities in the practice of medicine by guiding practitioners during diagnosis, screening, prognosis and triaging. It could reduce workloads, thereby making medical care more accessible and affordable. One study found that the integration of human and AI judgment led to superior performance compared to either alone, showing just how well humans and AI can work together.
That said, the diagnostic performance of some expert physicians may not be improved by AI. Another study focusing on radiology found that AI can in fact cause incorrect diagnoses in situations that otherwise would have been correctly assessed. This highlights the need for balanced integration that supplements rather than replaces humans.
Disinformation
Will generative AI exacerbate the spread of misinformation or reduce it? Generative AI promises personalised online content, potentially enhancing and customising a user experience. It can also broaden access to content – for instance, via instant language translations or by making it easier for people with disabilities to access content.
However, it also has the potential to be a powerful tool for “surveillance capitalism”. AI may collect massive amounts of personal data that can then be exploited for corporate gain, including by leveraging people’s biases or vulnerabilities.
We’re already seeing the spread of misinformation through advanced and personalised “deepfakes”, and we may soon see AI being used to micro-target voters with persuasive fake content that could significantly affect elections.
Yet, there is also hope that AI can help with these problems. One study found that entering into a dialogue with generative AI significantly reduces conspiracy beliefs among conspiracy believers. The AI appears to be able to answer conspiracy believers’ complex questions about potential conspiracies in a way that no human can.
How should governments respond?
When we looked at how the EU, UK and US were attempting to build regulatory frameworks around these issues, our main observation was that they are falling into the trap of overlooking the potential for AI to aggravate socioeconomic inequalities. 
Policy-making should balance AI innovation with social equity and consumer protection. Future regulatory improvements should include equitable tax structures, empowering workers, controlling consumer information, supporting human-complementary AI research, and implementing robust measures against AI-generated misinformation. 
We find ourselves at a critical historical crossroads, where today’s decisions will have global consequences for generations to come. It’s an exciting yet daunting moment to be alive, charged with heavy responsibilities. Each of us plays a crucial role as architects of the future. We can all contribute to driving the course towards the positive use of what could be humanity’s greatest innovation, or its worst.

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Learning Management Systems (LMS) marks a significant shift towards more personalised and efficient workplace learning. This trend holds the potential to reshape employee training and revolutionise how learners interact with their learning materials. By leveraging AI, training becomes more accessible and adaptable to individual needs.
 
Introduction to AI in Learning Management Systems
 
At its core, AI in LMS uses machine learning and natural language processing to automate and enhance various aspects of the learning process. From creating personalised learning paths to providing actionable insights into learner performance, AI is setting a new standard for what technology can achieve in workplace learning. 
Using an AI-powered learning platform, L&D teams can gain a deeper understanding of learning outcomes, provide real-time feedback, and even predict potential learning roadblocks. This not only improves the overall learning experience but also helps ensure that no learner gets left behind.
 
Personalised Learning Paths
 
One of the most significant advantages of AI integration is the ability to create personalised learning experiences. AI algorithms analyse a learner’s performance, preferences, and learning pace to tailor the course content accordingly. This means that each learner can have a unique learning path that adapts to their strengths and addresses their weaknesses, making learning more effective and enjoyable.
 
Automated Administrative Tasks
 
AI also streamlines administrative duties, such as grading assignments and managing schedules, freeing educators to focus more on training and less on paperwork. This automation not only reduces the workload for L&D teams but also minimises human error, ensuring a smoother operation of learning programmes.

Crafting the Future: The Center for Sustainable Development Leads Global AI Initiative to Empower Local and Global Talent, and Build Tomorrow’s AI-Enhanced Workforce.













Overview/Summary
In the next decade, the landscape of various professions is expected to undergo radical transformation due to the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this context, a new collaboration between Columbia University and Future Investment Initiative Institute was formed to bring together key stakeholders, spanning the private, public sectors, government, civil society and educational institutions. The Collaboration’s goal is to envision the evolution of each profession by 2050, considering the current and anticipated capabilities of AI. Several Task Forces have been created to look into specific key topics, such as Education, Health or Ethics. Through the work of these Task Forces, the project will develop tailored curricula for universities (starting with Columbia University), ensuring that students today are equipped with skills relevant to the evolving job market. The emphasis is on preventing the emergence of workers in 2024/2025 who could become obsolete by 2030, necessitating significant retraining. 
The FII PRIORITY Compass finds that 40% of the world’s population perceive Generative AI as a threat to society with strong potential for job destruction, and that less than half of the Global North feels prepared for the digital age. One key component of this project is to use the network of Columbia Global Centers to work with LMIC universities to work towards preventing a divide between High Incomes Countries (HICs) and Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries (LMICs). In January 2024, the IMF reported that 40% of jobs in emerging markets could experience a negative impact from AI because of a digital divide (between the Global North and Global South) brought about by AI, and our initiative will aim to prevent this.
Objectives of the Initiative
As AI has become the fastest growing topic of interest since 2023, several groups worldwide are interested in the impact of AI on the Future of Work.
The partnership between FII Institute and Columbia University has the following objectives:
Identify Potential Impacts: Members of the Initiative have created several Task Forces and will discuss and identify the potential impacts of AI on various aspects of the Future of Work, including skill shifts, poverty and inequalities, impact on Emerging and Developing Economies (EDMEs) among many others. The Initiative will aim to understand the opportunities and challenges that AI presents for different stakeholders, and the critical role played by a university such as Columbia.
	 
Share Knowledge and Insights: The Initiative will facilitate knowledge sharing and exchange of insights among stakeholders from all regions of the world about current trends, research findings, and best practices related to AI and the Future of Work.
	 
Discuss Policy and Regulatory Considerations: Engage stakeholders, in the various specific Task Forces, in a discussion about the policy and regulatory considerations necessary to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating potential risks and challenges.
	 
Foster Collaboration and Partnerships: The Initiative, which benefits from the expertise of colleagues and collaborators from every continent, will foster collaboration and partnerships among stakeholders to address common goals and challenges related to AI and the Future of Work. Through the Task Force and general meetings, the Initiative will encourage dialogue and networking opportunities to facilitate the exchange of ideas, resources, and opportunities for collaboration on research projects, pilot initiatives, and policy advocacy efforts.
Task Forces
Macroeconomics, Poverty and inequity: Delve into the macroeconomic implications of AI adoption and its effects on workforce development strategies. Explore innovative approaches to tackle challenges and capitalize on opportunities presented by AI in the swiftly evolving job market.
	 
Application of AI in Healthcare: Explore cutting-edge applications of AI in healthcare, elucidating how AI technologies are transforming patient care, medical research and opportunities for healthcare workers and patients in Emerging and Developing Economies (EDMEs)
	 
Application of AI in Education: With the opportunity to provide personalized learning experiences and improve teachers and professors’ pedagogy, applications of AI in Education could revolutionize the field. But are there redlines to define when it comes to how and what AI will teach to our children?
	 
Ethics: Explore all the ethical questions, opportunities and challenges raised by the integration of Artificial Intelligence in the Future of Work, society and Research, ensuring that tools developed are for the benefit of mankind and the planet.
	 
A fifth Task Force will convene all members from EDMEs from the other Task Forces to strategically think about linkages with their countries and universities.
AI and Future of Work in EDMEs: Create an environment of dialogue and exchange with universities in Emerging and Developing Economies (EDMEs), and strategize on effective dissemination of information concerning AI and the Future of Work in LMICs, ensuring equitable access to knowledge and opportunities for all.
 








Launch Details
High level summary
The launch of the ""Artificial Intelligence and Future of Work” initiative took place in March 2024 at Columbia University in New York. It marked the inaugural event spearheaded by the Center for Sustainable Development (CSD) in partnership with the Future Investment Initiative Institute (FII Institute). Over 40 academicians from diverse Columbia University Schools and international universities as well as representatives of government agencies and the private sector convened to deliberate on the impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Future of Work.
The Center for Sustainable Development unveiled an important initiative at Columbia University aimed at preparing the workforce for future challenges posed by advancements in AI. This initiative, which is integrated into Columbia University’s overall efforts on Artificial Intelligence, seeks to revolutionize educational curricula to create a workforce adept in AI and equipped to tackle the sectoral transformations expected by 2030. Emphasizing a collaborative effort, the Center’s Executive Director Prof. Yanis Ben Amor highlighted plans to extend educational advancements globally, especially to Emerging and Developing Economies (EDMEs), which face the risk of being marginalized by the AI revolution. The approach involves leveraging Columbia’s extensive network through its Global Centers to mitigate the educational and opportunity disparities highlighted by a recent IMF report release in Davos in early 2024
Keynote speaker Prof. Jeffrey Sachs drew parallels between AI and major technological revolutions, emphasizing AI’s potential to reshape societal and economic landscapes. Prof. Sachs pointed out the lack of models to predict AI’s long-term impacts on global economies and underscored the importance of ethical considerations in AI development. He advocated for international collaboration to harness AI’s benefits across sectors while addressing the ethical dilemmas and inequality it might exacerbate.
Four Task Forces (Macroeconomics, Education, Health and Ethics) were established to explore AI’s impacts across various domains, stressing the importance of interdisciplinary efforts to address the challenges and opportunities AI presents.
Presentations from international universities, government agencies and the private sector illustrated diverse approaches to integrating AI in education, research, and practical applications such as bid proposal writing. These discussions emphasized the need for ethical, inclusive, and sustainable AI development.
The task force discussions further delved into specific areas like healthcare, macroeconomics, and education, highlighting the critical need for strategic planning to ensure AI positively transforms society, not only in the Global North, but also in the Global South. The outcomes of these task forces aim to contribute to a broader understanding and effective governance of AI technologies, ensuring they serve the global good while preparing individuals for an AI-integrated future.
The event concluded with the official launching of the four Task Forces (and an additional cross cutting fifth Task Force focusing on Emerging and Developing Economies) and the Global Initiative.

92% of knowledge workers in Indonesia already use generative AI at work, surpassing global (75%) and Asia Pacific (83%) averages. 


92% of Indonesian business leaders stress the importance of AI adoption to stay competitive, yet 48% worry their organizational leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement it. 


Leaders must channel AI experimentation into business transformation. 

Jakarta, 11 June 2024 – Today, Microsoft and LinkedIn released data specific to Indonesia from the global 2024 Work Trend Index, focusing on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace. The findings reveal a high percentage of knowledge workers in Indonesia using generative AI and a strong belief among business leaders in the necessity of AI adoption for maintaining competitiveness, both surpassing regional and global figures. This underscores Indonesia’s enthusiasm for leveraging AI to drive business impact and suggests the potential emergence of a new, AI-driven workplace culture in the country. 
“We are in an era where AI is transforming our ability to create and innovate at an unprecedented pace. Indonesia’s swift adaptation and growth in this era signal that we are on the right path to realizing our digital economic potential and creating greater positive impacts for society at large. The key now is to channel this enthusiasm into tangible AI business transformations by doing three things: identifying business problems and integrating AI into solutions, adopting a top-down and bottom-up approach, and prioritizing AI skills training for everyone,” said Dharma Simorangkir, President Director of Microsoft Indonesia.

This report, titled “AI at Work is Here. Now Comes the Hard Part,” is based on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, including Indonesia, labor and hiring trends on LinkedIn, trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals, and research with Fortune 500 customers. 
In tandem with the report, Microsoft announced new capabilities in Copilot for Microsoft 365, while LinkedIn introduced over 50 free learning courses for LinkedIn Premium members to empower professionals at all levels to enhance their AI skills. 
“As AI brings transformative changes to the workplace, companies need new guidelines for recruiting talent,” said Rohit Kalsy, Indonesia Country Lead, LinkedIn. “With the rapidly evolving workforce ecosystem, leaders who prioritize flexibility and invest in developing AI-ready skills will gain a competitive edge. In Indonesia, 69% of business leaders say they won’t hire someone without AI skills. This highlights the urgency for professionals to focus on AI skill enhancement through training. Meanwhile, data also reveals a 65% increase in number of learning hours to study top 100 AI/generative AI courses between 2022 – 2023 on LinkedIn Learning. The participant record for those joining top LinkedIn courses on AI since January 2023 are held by Southeast Asia, Australia, and India.

The 2024 Work Trend Index highlights three key insights for leaders and professionals in Indonesia about AI’s impact on work and the labor market in the year ahead: 
Employees want AI at work – and won’t wait for companies to catch up 

As many as 92% of knowledge workers in Indonesia are already using generative AI at work. This figure is higher than the global (75%) and Asia Pacific (83%) average. 


Around 92% of leaders in Indonesia believe in the need to adopt AI to stay competitive, higher than the global (79%) and Asia Pacific (84%) averages. However, 48% worry that their organization’s leadership lacks a vision and plan for implementing AI within the company, lower than the global (60%) and Asia Pacific (61%) averages. 


As a result, 76% of employees in Indonesia are bringing their own AI tools or solutions to work (Bring Your Own AI/BYOAI)- missing out on the benefits that come from strategic AI use at scale and putting company data at risk. Therefore, the task for company leaders in the near future is to consider how to implement AI on a large scale in the company while maximizing return on investment (ROI).

For employees, AI raises the bar and breaks the career ceiling 

As many as 69% of leaders in Indonesia say they will not hire someone without AI skills. Additionally, 76% of leaders say they would rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them. 


Learning from global data, many professionals are taking the initiative to skill up on their own. There has been a 142x increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles and a 160% increase in non-technical professionals using LinkedIn Learning courses to build their AI aptitude. 


AI mentions in LinkedIn job posts drive a 17% bump in application growth. Hence, the impact of AI is undeniable: organizations that empower employees with AI tools and training will attract the best talent, while professionals who skill up will have the edge. 

The rise of the AI Power Users – and what they reveal about the future of work 

Four types of AI users emerged in this research — from skeptics who rarely use AI, to novices and explorers who are somewhat familiar with and frequently use AI, to power users who use it extensively. 


AI power users have reoriented their workdays in fundamental ways: 93% of power users in Indonesia use it to start their workday and 94% use it to prepare for the next day (higher than the global average of 85% and Asia Pacific at 88%). 


As many as 73% of power users in Indonesia are also more inclined to experiment with AI, higher than the global average (68%) and Asia Pacific (51%). 

In Indonesia, various organizations across scales and industries have integrated generative AI tools like Copilot for Microsoft 365 into their daily workflows to boost productivity. These include Indosat Ooredoo Hutchinson (Indosat or IOH). Copilot for Microsoft 365 has become part of the productivity enhancements for Indosat employees in managing their work. The integration of Copilot for Microsoft 365 capabilities has been carried out across various functions at Indosat, from digital, Human Resource, Business-to-Business, to Network. This is a testatement to Indosat’s commitment to transforming from a telecommunications company to an AI Native TechCo and revolutionizing the digital landscape in Indonesia. 
Enriching Work Experience with New Features in Copilot for Microsoft 365 
Understanding the benefits of generative AI in the workplace, Microsoft also announced innovations in Copilot for Microsoft 365 to help people create more with AI: 

A new auto-complete feature is coming to the prompt box. Copilot will now help people who have the start of a prompt by offering to complete it, suggesting a more a detailed prompt based on what is being typed, to deliver a stronger result. 


A new rewrite feature in Copilot will help users who know what they want but may not have the right words to describe it, transforming basic prompts into richer ones with the click of a button. 


Catch Up is a new chat interface that surfaces personal insights based on recent activities and provides responsive recommendations. 


New capabilities in Copilot Lab will enable people to create, publish, and manage prompts tailored to them, and to their specific teams, roles, and functions.

More than four in 10 workers in a massive, global survey said they’re threatened by the increasing presence of artificial intelligence (AI) in their workplace.
Responses to an ADP survey from nearly 35,000 workers in 18 countries explored new challenges and technologies reshaping the labor market. Among the top concerns:  AI, with 42% citing it as a job threat.
Data and an evaluation of the results by ADP focused on how workers’ priorities, expectations and feelings have shifted, including their sense of job security and how the implementation of AI in the workplace impacts that shift. The details are included in ADP’s recently released “People At Work 2024: A Global Workforce View” annual report.
 
 
 













 
 

Eighty-five percent of workers believe AI will impact their job in the next two to three years, ADP’s survey found. Among workers who say AI will help them every day, 70% say they have the skills they need to advance their career to the next level within three years. Of those who say AI will replace most of their existing functions, only 45% think they have the skills they need.

ADP
Workers in some ways have remained constant in their priorities; they still put great value on financial compensation and job security, for example. In other ways, however, they feel under siege from technology, stress, and changing workplace norms.  ADP’s report this year focused on a “Great Transition” from a “troubled, pandemic-driven economy to a post-pandemic world.”
Overall, people feel better about their job security than they did a year ago, but they’re now worried by the increasing presence of AI.
 
 
 













 
 

The survey results are backed by financial services market predictions that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. According to a 2023 report by investment bank Goldman Sachs, two-thirds of all jobs could be partially automated by AI. “If generative AI delivers on its promised capabilities, the labor market could face significant disruption,” Goldman reported. “And… generative AI could substitute up to one-fourth of current work.”
In the US, office and administrative support jobs face the highest risks, with 46% of those jobs facing automation by AI, according to Goldman Sachs. That figure is 44% for legal work and 37% for tasks within architecture and engineering.
“The good news is that worker displacement from automation has historically been offset by creation of new jobs, and the emergence of new occupations following technological innovations accounts for the vast majority of long-run employment growth,” Goldman Sachs noted. “The combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation, and higher productivity for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a productivity boom that raises economic growth substantially, although the timing of such a boom is hard to predict.”
 
 
 













 
 

Goldman Sachs
Goldman’s report suggested genAI could raise annual US labor productivity growth by just under 1.5% over a 10-year period after widespread adoption, although the boost could be much smaller or larger depending on the difficulty level of tasks AI will be able to perform and how many jobs are automated.
Of the ADP survey respondents, 17% said AI has the power to make their work easier and were less likely to feel insecure about losing their jobs. And 43% think having AI on the job will be a good thing. 
While most (60%) agree they have the skills needed to advance their career in the next three years, less than half (47%) feel their employer invests in the skills they need to grow professionally. As workers grow less confident in their employers’ willingness or ability to invest in them, however, they grow more concerned about AI muscling in on their jobs. Workers who most fear AI have the least confidence (45%) that they have the skills they’ll need.
 
 
 













 
 

A widening IT skills shortage is dogging organizations in all industries and across all regions, IDC research shows. But far from eliminating most jobs, AI is expected to boost the productivity of the existing workforce and help to create new roles.
IDC
“For all the concern about job loss…, many AI-based changes to work have led to new job opportunities, including enabling workers to focus on more engaging and innovative tasks,” IDC’ said. “AI use cases are creating new opportunities for content creation, education, entertainment, and content generation, provoking a shift in thinking about the role of AI on jobs and roles.
IDC data indicates that 32% of business and IT leaders now expect advancing AI constructs such as genAI to save time and improve productivity. For example, genAI tools support greater access to diverse knowledge resources by enabling employees to conversationally access them using natural language queries.
 
 
 













 
 

“GenAI and skills are increasingly tightly related: Organizations spanning all industries and geographies face a widening shortage of all IT tech skills, regardless of those skills relating to security, cloud, IT service management, or AI itself,” IDC said. “GenAI tools used in conjunction with or inside of tech training platforms can and do accelerate training.”
Nearly two-thirds (62%) of about 1,100 IT leaders surveyed earlier this year told IDC that a lack of skills has resulted in missed revenue growth objectives — and more than 60% say it has led to quality problems and a loss of customer satisfaction. IDC predicts that by 2026, more than 90% of organizations worldwide will feel similar pain, amounting to some $5.5 trillion in losses caused by product delays, impaired competitiveness, and loss of business.
“There is no escaping it: The time to plan for AI skills and roles is now. …The question is not whether enterprises must skill up employees for the age of AI, but when and how they will do it,” IDC wrote in its report.
 
 
 













 
 

At the same time, many organizations are still asking whether the rapidly evolving technology will profoundly change jobs and skills development at a fundamental level. “Automation has long impacted human activities, most notably during the industrial era when machines rapidly replaced the manual work of humans,” IDC said.
The impact of AI and genAI varies by profession and industry, with creative and engagement-based skill sets and work being affected first. Marketers, customer support teams, web designers, professional services groups, healthcare roles, and many other positions are already seeing changes in their work practices from AI.
The same IDC data shows that 29% of business and IT leaders expect AI and genAI to enable faster decision timing for back-office centers of leadership like HR, operations, and finance. As compared to two years ago, businesses are changing their narratives around AI enablement to see what it can do for the business and its workforce rather than worrying about what uncontrollable challenges it could pose.

Abstract

Objectives – To understand how many undergraduate and graduate students use generative AI as part of their academic work, how often they use it, and for what tasks they use it. We also sought to identify how trustworthy students find generative AI and how they would feel about a locally maintained generative AI tool. Finally, we explored student interest in trainings related to using generative AI in academic work.  This survey will help librarians better understand the rate at which generative AI is being adopted by university students and the need for librarians to incorporate generative AI into their work.
Methods – A team of three library staff members and one student intern created, executed, and analyzed a survey of 360 undergraduate and graduate students at Harvard University. The survey was distributed via email lists and at cafes and libraries throughout campus. Data were collected and analyzed using Qualtrics.
Results – We found that nearly 65% of respondents have used or plan to use generative AI chatbots for academic work, even though most respondents (65%) do not find their outputs trustworthy enough for academic work. The findings show that students actively use these tools but desire guidance around effectively using them.
Conclusion – This research shows students are engaging with generative AI for academic work but do not fully trust the information that it produces. Librarians must be at the forefront of understanding the significant impact this technology will have on information-seeking behaviors and research habits. To effectively support students, librarians must know how to use these tools to advise students on how to critically evaluate AI output and effectively incorporate it into their research.

This fresh area pledges to upheave the way we associate ourselves with technology thus resulting in people being equipped with all types of work whose existence has not been identified. .At this point where technology picking and job consuming is at a critical point, it is mandatory for us to investigate forthcoming jobs for generations..This article probes into the impact of the AI workforce and its impact on job markets. This comprises the skills required for future employment and the stages individuals and teams can look to align with this digital development..AI Job Automation.Automation through artificial intelligence is now becoming a new frontier of employment. It promises an unprecedented revolution in how we deal with technology, the facts necessary for a world that does not exist yet, and the ways of preparing for AI future jobs that do not exist. .At present, we stand in front of an important crossroads in technology alphabetization and AI job automation. Thus, there is no doubt that an attempt should be made to splice the kinds of careers that will be available to all individuals in society in the future.. What does this all point to in the life of the common citizen? What changes and solutions can you employ today that will prepare your children for a world where they may never find a conventional job? What steps or measures can be taken to develop your personal or team competence in such a way that can align with this age of digital evolution? Before getting into the questions, they are all important to know. .Hence, let’s explore how artificial intelligence is shifting society and how one might better position oneself for success, much less survival, in the economy of tomorrow..The New Generation of AI Workforce is constantly increasing pressure for efficiency and productivity at the workplace. This means companies are increasingly leaning towards using artificial intelligence in order to handle jobs that used to be done by people. For instance, in relation to Watson by IBM, this is a machine that can be employed to perform functions like data processing or providing solutions. .Even with the drastic release of 900 customer support job positions over at Discovery Communications, this was made possible through the capabilities of Watson in daily operations..Today, it’s clear that advanced AI technology is going to revolutionize our existence in ways that were absolutely unthinkable only a few decades ago. According to the forecasters, AI will cause major changes in our technological application, the importance of different skills in the future, and proper approaches to the preparation of jobs with no idea conceived at the time. .If these predictions are accurate, then we are at a crossroads in humanity where the majority of the workforce will be replaced by these intelligent and enhancing robots, i.e., the AI workforce. This also means that professionals in these areas should begin weighing what kind of work they might find in the coming years..The Emergence of Artificial Intelligence and Transition of Employment.AI is a buzzword that has brought significant changes to our workplace. Talking about the increasing proportion of positions that can be robotized, it might be interesting to turn to the tendencies of employment and new professions' appearance. .Which implication does this bear for you? How do you prepare them to take a course that will have little hope in the traditional labor market upon its completion? Also, how can you build better or grow the team to be ready for this shift happening in the digital age?.These are, of course, questions worthy of consideration. Here is how artificial intelligence is going to change our lives, and it wants to provide some insights on how one can prepare not just for a job but for more value in the economy of the future..We are now at an interesting moment in the evolution of the human race – that the main activities of human labor are mechanized. Artificial intelligence can be defined as an emerging technology system that is capable of influencing the way we lead our lives, the nature of the jobs we do, and how human beings interact with machines. .AI is one of the most formidable issues in the modern world. It could change the way we perceive technological advancement, delineate employment skill gaps, and define the overall AI workforce prospects. This means understanding the ways companies are going to continue to change the manner in which they work.This post is the first one in the given series, and it will be devoted to how AI will influence the economy. Scholars and the general public often think that AI entails job loss rather than creating new opportunities. However, there are many such roles in many different areas that do not exist because no one has yet created them. These positions can be created by information technology, automation, and artificial intelligence in the future.For example, CognitionX deals with cognitive computing for export tax preparation firms, including Jackson Hewitt Tax Services, which manages over 4 million tax returns yearly. This service helps Jackson Hewitt employees to stay focused on the more important work, such as data analysis, audit appraisal, audacity on legislative amendments, and offering relevant recommendations on the new laws..It also has the capacity to produce more jobs than harm by releasing human work from repetitive chores, which means people can work on higher levels of productivity, like decision-making. .That is why AI is estimated to increase productivity while at the same time creating new occupations where people will work with these machines rather than being replaced by them if only we have the right to reconstruct human capital. .Thus, AI is expected to enhance efficiency but also open new positions where humans will manage these technologies rather than become replaced by them if only we have the necessary skill set..New employment opportunities.Since the subject of discussion is artificial intelligence, there will likely be a drastic change in the requisite AI skills in the job market. This change is brought by the fact that AI tends to give many employees new roles or tasks that do not exist in the previous organizational structure. .To illustrate the above, it is still unattainable to train the newly developed artificial intelligence to negotiate on your behalf or to be a practicing physician. Thus, the so-called employment opportunities mentioned above may well be displaced by robots. However, with it, there would be a newly created employment increase as well..Which careers are secure?.Artificial intelligence is growing. As it becomes more pervasive and developed by artificial intelligence, the question is: What careers are safe? The truth is that all professions may not be left out of the AI ravage. .However, there are some careers that offer some form of security. You probably won’t end up jobless if your occupation is not easy to computerize. Careers requiring decision-making capabilities, creativity, and emotional intelligence will still be there amidst the increased presence of AI up to a certain extent..For example, consider a creative writer working for a company. Even though there is some experimental software is already in existence, they can still maintain their positions as writers since writing has not been entirely automated. Similarly, pharmacists and doctors are professions that demand emotional intelligence, implying that they will be able to retain their jobs more easily than others..Conclusion.In conclusion, Artificial intelligence is set to change the roles played in jobs and give them new meaning. While some traditional roles may be done by machines, this also comes with chances of doing more work and different jobs. .People wanting to succeed must equip themselves with the qualifications required for such an eventuality by gaining relevant skills and accepting new technologies. We can guarantee a successful shift to tomorrow's AI-driven economy by starting to work today, where cooperation with smart devices would be common and not rare..FAQs.1. What skills are essential for the AI-driven future job market?.Understanding AI basics, data literacy, and adaptability are key skills for future jobs..2. &nbsp;How can educational institutions prepare students for future AI jobs?.Incorporating AI and technology-focused curriculums can help students with relevant skills..3. &nbsp;What are the ethical considerations of AI in the workforce?.Addressing bias, privacy, and job displacement are crucial ethical aspects to consider..4. How will AI change current jobs?.AI is expected to automate routine tasks, allowing humans to focus on creative and strategic work..5. What industries will be transformed by AI?.Healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and technology sectors are likely to see significant AI integration.","{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.analyticsinsight.net/artificial-intelligence/ai-workforce-preparing-for-jobs-that-dont-yet-exist', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://media.assettype.com/analyticsinsight/2024-06/7b28d2c9-e229-4448-a272-6d8aff9463a1/AI_Workforce_Preparing_for_Jobs_That_Don_t_Yet_Exist.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675'}}",Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,

N.C. PSI Platform Director for Resilient Agriculture Chris Reberg-Horton and Esleyther Henriquez, field team leader for NC State's precision sustainable agriculture lab, with BenchBot 3.0, which will take hundreds of thousands of plant photos for what will be the world's largest agricultural image repository.



At NC State University, the N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative is leading efforts aimed at helping producers put artificial intelligence to work for increased yields, efficiency and sustainability.
Two new tools will propel its work in AI for agriculture forward: A robot named BenchBot 3.0 has taken its place on an empty field adjacent to the Plant Sciences Building on NC State’s Centennial Campus. It’s just one of the data-gathering devices that will be tied into the power of N.C. PSI’s newly acquired supercomputer, the NVIDIA Grace Hopper 200, to create AI for agricultural applications.
One of the Grace Hopper’s first tasks will be to begin making sense of the half million plant photos that BenchBot will take as it passes repeatedly over 500 pots of different plant species.
The Grace Hopper … gives us the capability to train even larger-scale models to become more accurate and more predictive in nature and come up with solutions to more complicated challenges.
Those photos, along with ones taken by earlier versions of the BenchBot, will help feed what N.C. PSI Platform Director for Resilient Agriculture Chris Reberg-Horton says will be the world’s largest open-source agricultural image repository.
Reberg-Horton and his colleagues in the Precision Sustainable Agriculture network will use the collected photos to develop software and tools that can help farmers make all kinds of decisions about their crops: when and where to harvest, spray for weeds or insects, fertilize and more.
Getting from photos to those applications will take powerful AI, and the NVIDIA Grace Hopper, with its ability to handle five terabytes of data per second, is just the right tool, says Jevon Smith, N.C. PSI’s research computing manager.
The most powerful computer of its kind on NC State’s campus, the machine enables teams working on interdisciplinary plant sciences research to take on large datasets, like the image repository, to make more complex models and come up with solutions faster than ever.
Step One: Telling Apples From Oranges
Getting computers to recognize plants, weeds and other stressors is the first step toward getting machines to detect problems or map performance, says Reberg-Horton, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina Foundation/W.K. Kellogg Distinguished Professor in Sustainable Community-Based Food Systems in the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences.
He likens what he and his colleagues are doing to build the image repository and create grower decision tools to what car companies have done to make self-driving cars a reality.
In a lot of economic sectors, we have literally millions of images labeled so that we can train computers on tasks like driving around a city. We don’t have that in agriculture.
“If you’ve got a company that is trying out some new technology for self-driving cars, the first thing they have got to do is to train computers to understand and recognize the things a car sees, and so if you’ve ever done the CAPTCHA stuff — identify the bicycles, identify the pedestrians — you’re basically helping train AI because you’re labeling images so that computers can learn to recognize, ‘That’s a person. Don’t hit the gas now,’” he says.
And it’s not just self-driving cars that use such image-based AI.
“In a lot of economic sectors, we have literally millions of images labeled so that we can train computers on tasks like driving around a city,” he says. “We don’t have that in agriculture.”
Mark Funderburk, a hardware design engineer in the precision sustainable agriculture lab, guided efforts to build the BenchBot’s hardware.
The agricultural image repository is designed to help technology developers fill that gap. Ag technology companies large and small will have access, as will anyone who uses the internet.
Already, with earlier versions of the BenchBot, Reberg-Horton says the team “has tackled about 30 of the most common weed species in North America. For cash crops, we have imaged corn, soybeans, cotton, wheat, rye, barley and oats.”
“In theory we can do about 1,000 plant pots per day, but we will test logistics slowly before going that big,” Reberg-Horton adds. “This summer will be just weeds. From October to March, we will image winter cover crop species.”
Meanwhile, two other BenchBots are being deployed to add images from different locations. One is at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, while a  third will be deployed soon at College Station, home of Texas A&M University.
Achieving Precision Agriculture’s Promises
The images the BenchBots collect will help overcome a bottleneck in fully realizing the concept of precision farming, Reberg-Horton notes.
In precision farming, producers deliver exactly what a plant needs, precisely when and where and in what amounts it’s needed. For example, rather than spraying an entire field for insects, which would be expensive, they could spray just the areas where they are a problem. That would protect crops, limit chemical use and safeguard the environment from excess application.
Applications in the agriculture sector include increasing yields, reducing waste, helping reduce carbon emissions, and more.
Thanks to information technology, the concept of precision farming, forged in the 1980s, has taken off since the 2000s.
Smith says that while AI has become controversial, its rapid development is pushing precision farming technology ahead faster than ever.
“You can’t turn on the TV without hearing two letters — AI,” Smith says. “There are so many bad stories about AI out there, but the applications in the agriculture sector include increasing yields, reducing waste, helping reduce carbon emissions, and more. It can be used for great good.”
And it already is.
There are self-driving tractors and combines, and some are equipped with variable rate equipment that can sense where to apply chemicals and where to plant seeds — and do those tasks. Artificial intelligence is also used in farming for water management, crop rotation, harvest timing, optimal planting and more.
“We’ve been talking about precision agriculture for decades,” Reberg-Horton says. “It’s really been aspirational for the most part because we have to have lots of knowledge about a field to be able to manage each piece of the field optimally. The smart equipment is available now to apply most of our inputs variably. But we have been stuck on creating enough intelligence to tell that equipment what to do.
“Computer vision is the technology that can do it, and we will start seeing cameras on all of our agricultural machinery.”
What’s Happening With AI at the N.C. PSI
The N.C. PSI has made significant headway in applying AI in agriculture. For example, to allow growers to know precisely when to plant soybeans and how to manage soybeans in counties across the state, Rachel Vann — has worked alongside computer engineering experts to lead a team developing an AI-powered web application that will be released this fall. Vann is an NC State Extension soybean specialist, assistant professor in the Department of crop and Soil Sciences and N.C. PSI platform director for extension outreach and engagement.
Her colleague, Cranos Williams — N.C. PSI’s platform director for data analytics and Goodnight Distinguished Professor of Agricultural Analytics in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering — is among the leaders of N.C. PSI’s Sweet-APPS team. The team is working to reduce labor in the post-harvest handling of sweetpotatoes by helping producers use sensors and machines to sort and grade the vegetables by size, shape and other characteristics.
And to increase soybean resilience to climate change, N.C. PSI’s Ross Sozzani, professor in the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology and platform director for plant improvement, is working with U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist Anna Locke, as well as colleagues at the VIB, a life sciences institute in Belgium. The team is marrying machine learning, crop physiology and phosphoproteomics to evaluate the plant’s temperature stress regulators and develop a test to rapidly screen soybean genetics for temperature tolerance. The data they generate will allow the breeders to identify temperature-tolerant soybean varieties more efficiently.
More Tools From Reberg-Horton
Meanwhile, crop scientist Reberg-Horton is making progress with several AI-powered tools, some that rely on images in the repository he’s helping build. One tool uses cameras and AI-trained software to allow growers to map where they have herbicide-resistant weeds, such as the notoriously noxious palmer amaranth.
He calls the weed “sticky” because it tends to come back to the same area where it’s grown the previous year. Having a map of where palmer amaranth grew one year would help the farmer know where to use pesticides or rotate crops in the following year.
“It may sound trivial, but you’ve got to remember that the farmers that I deal with — big row crop farmers — might have 5,000 acres spread over multiple counties,” he says. “Given the growth that’s occurred in the size of farms, thinking they know where everything is at and where the bad spots are is just not true anymore.”
We’ve been talking about precision agriculture for decades. … The AI revolution has been a missing piece.
Another tool Reberg-Horton’s working on is designed for those who grow cover crops, which are planted in the off-season on land where cash crops are grown. They help manage soil quality, fertility, erosion and pests such as weeds and insects. Because cover crops have environmental benefits, the federal government offers incentives for planting them.
“Increasingly the Natural Resources Conservation Service is encouraging mixtures of species. So you might have a legume and a grass in a mix. Sometimes we even see complicated mixes where you might have five or six species,” he says.
“Applying the right amount of the fertilizer nitrogen onto crops like corn is already tricky because soils are not uniform across a field,” he explains. “Cover crop mixtures can amplify that variation because legumes in the mix will supply nitrogen to the corn, while other cover crops in the mix will not. We have to map the growth of each species to account for that. In essence, we are asking AI to recognize plant species.”
Using that information to reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizer saves money for farmers and reduces the environmental impact: Nitrates are lead contaminants of groundwater, where they can cause drinking water problems, and can run into surface water, where they can cause algal blooms. 
Putting More Power in the Interdisciplinary Mix
In supporting the development of smart tools for agriculture, the Grace Hopper will give the N.C. PSI an advantage. The computer is named for a computer programming pioneer who began her U.S. Navy career during World War II.
To secure and deploy the Grace Hopper, N.C. PSI has partnered with Cambridge Computing, an NVIDIA reseller that specializes in consulting with universities and research institutions. N.C. PSI secured one of 50 university seed grants to get the supercomputer.
Jevon Smith with the Grace Hopper supercomputer in the Plant Sciences Building at NC State.
“We already have two machine learning systems, and the Grace Hopper is a new tool on a level we haven’t had before,” Smith says. “It gives us the capability to train even larger-scale models to become more accurate and more predictive in nature and come up with solutions to more complicated challenges.”
One of the top challenges has meaning for farmers and consumers alike. “Growers are faced with needing to meet a growing population’s need for more food at the same time that climate change is altering growing conditions,” Smith says.
U.S. farmers are also facing serious labor shortages. While one of the fears surrounding AI is that it’ll take away jobs, supporters say it may hold promise for easing agricultural worker shortages, especially with the labor-intensive crops that North Carolina is known for — sweetpotatoes and tobacco, for starters.
As Reberg-Horton notes, “We’ve been talking about precision agriculture for decades. We know what we want, but it’s hard to get there. The AI revolution has been a missing piece that’ll help us get there.”

With the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace, Spokeo wanted to understand how professionals feel about utilizing this technology. Are they using AI in their current role? Do they think it will impact their industry? And do they have any concerns about it?Surveying 1,027 respondents active in the workplace uncovered a range of perceptions – both positive and negative – about AI at work.Key Findings74.8% are concerned AI will impact their industry18-24 year olds were least concerned about AI's impact on the industry (66%) and over 65's were most concerned (80.8%)78.1% believe AI could reduce some of the stresses of the job, either now or in the future  Industries thought to be positively impacted by AI: Technology, Agriculture, and Manufacturing66.6% believe AI could do their job 76.7% think AI will reduce the number of working days in the week for the average American74.8% are concerned AI will impact their industryThree quarters of survey participants (74.8%) had concerns about AI impacting their industry.

Only 7.7% of those surveyed felt the new technology was of no benefit at all.

The majority of Americans seem to agree. In fact, three quarters of respondents (76.7%) believed that AI could help them work fewer days in the future.Despite some concerns about the impact of AI on their industry, 62.8% of people said they would be for AI if they could receive the same income and the technology could reduce the number of working days in the week.Additionally, people think AI could help not only reduce the amount of work they do, but it could also reduce the stress of their existing job and workload. 78.1% of respondents felt AI could reduce their work-related stress overall, concluding an overwhelming majority who do also see numerous personal benefits to incorporating AI in its current form and as it continues to improve.Overall, the study suggests that although Americans are wary of the potential consequences of AI technology, with the right training by employers, most people also see the potential benefits that the technology may reap in the workplace – both professionally and for their own personal well-being.MethodologyUsing Amazon's survey platform, Spokeo surveyed 1,097 Americans in October 2023 about topics relating to AI and its impact on their industry.The breakdown of the people surveyed was as follows:Age ranges:18-24 – 4.58%25-34 – 32.6%35-44 – 44.1%45-54 – 11.7%55-64 – 4.5%65+ – 2.5%Gender:Female – 50.6%Male – 47.5%Non-binary – 1.7%Prefer not to say – 0.2%This story was produced by Spokeo and reviewed and distributed by Stacker Media.© Stacker Media, LLC.This story was originally published June 11, 2024, 10:30 AM.",NewsArticle,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article289188759.html'}",AI at work: The impact of artificial intelligence in the workplace,https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/fn60zm/picture289188594/alternates/FREE_1140/93e74325-3296-45d7-9807-78f2cb9b82d1,2024-06-11T10:30:00-05:00,2024-06-11T14:45:01-05:00,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Jean Lin '}]","{'name': 'Kansas City Star', '@type': 'Organization', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.kansascity.com/wps/build/images/kansascity/logo-lg.png'}}",,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article289188759.html,,"['Stacker', 'Jean Lin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/fn60zm/picture289188594/alternates/FREE_1140/93e74325-3296-45d7-9807-78f2cb9b82d1,,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'kansascity', 'productID': 'kansascity.com:AllKCM-5012'}",Business,,https://www.spokeo.com/compass/ai-in-the-workplace/,False,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.paywalled'}",,,,,,,,

Copy.ai
Best for Beating Writer’s Block
Copy.ai is an artificial intelligence writing tool designed to help marketers, business owners, and copywriters create various forms of content, including website copy, sales landing pages, email, and social media and blog posts. A boon to content marketers, Copy.ai can automatically conduct SEO research and produce content briefs for writers, streamlining the production process and giving writers guidance.
Another distinctive feature is the thought leadership tool, which automatically turns raw transcripts from interviews with experts into a variety of content assets, including blog posts, social media posts, and newsletters. This dramatically reduces the time it takes to manage content repurposing. The AI writing tool also lets you easily generate copy that aligns with your organization’s persona.
Copy.ai’s in-platform AI chatbot acts as a writing assistant to help beat writer’s block by aiding with brainstorming. For example, I asked it to give me 10 Instagram post ideas for fashion week—it delivered 10 useable ideas I could use as the basis for my social posts. These features enable your team to create and distribute more high-quality content at a lower cost than before.

Rytr
Best for Copywriters
Rytr is an AI-powered writing tool capable of producing copywriting content on various topics. It’s one of the best AI writing tools for commercial copywriting jobs, where copywriters can use it to automate the creation of post and caption ideas, paragraph content, SEO meta titles, emails, call to actions, replies, and other less complex copywriting assets.
The platform also supports more than 40 other use cases, including generating blog ideas and creating job descriptions. In addition, paid users can create their own use cases by training Rytr for their specific needs.
I tested Rytr out for copywriting and asked it to write me a call-to-action for “A knee pad that protects middle-aged gardeners from hurting themselves.” In response to my prompt, it provided the following two variants:

“Safeguard your knees, garden with ease.”
“Safeguard your knees, garden in comfort.”

When I changed the tone from “convincing” to “humorous,” it generated two more options that were not useable out-of-the-box but were still useful for ideation:

“Kneel with confidence, gardenlords!”
“Unleash your inner knee-jerk green thumb!”

Overall, Rytr its a useful AI writing tool for copywriters who want to streamline their writing process and come up with more ideas for a variety of content types.

QuillBot
Best for Paraphrasing
QuillBot is an AI-powered writing assistant that, unlike most AI writing tools, focuses on helping you paraphrase and summarize texts. This makes it great for content marketers who often have to write repetitive copy with slight variations across their different content assets or even within the same blog post. For example, instead of writing “automate your administrative accounting tasks” five times, they could use QuillBot to spin that into five different variations.
It also functions as a citation generation tool, making it somewhat useful for academics—but it may not be the best tool for writing essays and research papers, as its output doesn’t consistently pass AI detection tools.
One of QuillBot’s standout features is the ability to choose from nine modes of paraphrased output. You can select from natural, academic, simple, creative, shortened, expanded, and more. As an example, when I prompted it with “The shift to agriculture took thousands of years” in academic mode, the output read, “The transition to an agrarian society spanned several millennia.”
Overall, I found the tool helpful for the outwardly simple but cognitively-taxing task of coming up with new ways to express your ideas in writing.

Frase’s keyword optimization feature will identify important keywords while you write, make suggestions about how frequently to use them, and track how often they are used in the copy. In addition to keyword tips, it also tells you the ideal number of headings, words, links, and images your articles should have to outrank the competition.
Many of the SEO managers I’ve worked with have used Frase, and I’ve found it especially helpful for optimizing articles for SEO. Watching the SEO “topic score” go up as I make edits is motivating and lets me know I’m on the right track.

Anyword
Best for Copywriting Performance Analysis
Anyword is an AI writing tool that uses machine learning algorithms to generate content and analyze the performance of your copy across various channels. What distinguishes the tool is its Copy Intelligence functionality, which analyzes all of your previously published content to determine which messaging works best on your website, ads, socials, and email channels while clueing you into opportunities to improve your copy.
Its Target Audience feature lets copywriters and marketers define their ideal readers down to their key problems and desires. The AI writing tool will then take this into account when creating and analyzing content.
I found Anyword’s templates extremely helpful for prompting the AI writer to create content that fit my needs. In addition, its self-guided wizards walked me through the information I needed to provide the tool for it to write a blog post or ad campaign for my needs.

I’ve found Grammarly’s free version to be extremely useful as an AI editing tool. When I use it to run a final grammar and spelling check on a finished article, it inevitably catches mistakes and offers solutions to fix them. I also use it when writing emails to get the tone right. For example, when emailing a new client, I like to make sure the tone is confident and upbeat—Grammarly’s tone detector helps me achieve that goal.

Hemingway Editor
Best for Content Readability Measurement
Named after a writer known for his concise and simple prose, Hemingway Editor is a writing tool that helps you enhance the clarity, grammar, and readability of your written work. It analyzes text and provides various readability suggestions while highlighting lengthy, complex sentences, excessive adverbs, passive voice, and hard-to-read phrases.
It also assigns a readability score based on the grade level required to understand the text. If the score is too high, content writers can tweak the highlighted sentences to lower the grade level. It is available both as a web-based application and as a desktop app.
I’ve used Hemingway in various capacities and I find that it does its main job of measuring content readability extremely well. Its passive voice detector is my favorite part of the tool.
That said, one of the risks of using an AI editing tool like Hemingway is that, if you follow its suggestions without thinking, you may edit all the rhythm, flow, and personality out of your writing, leaving you with text that’s plain, lifeless, and stilted and suited for a grade level well below your target. Overall, though, I’ve found it a useful tool for making sure blog content is clear and easy to understand while streamlining the editing process.

AI Writer
Best for High-Output Bloggers
AI Writer is designed to generate full-length articles in minutes, making it great for high-output bloggers, affiliate marketers, and other people who need articles fast. The platform lets you tailor the AI’s writing to your specific needs by selecting from a long list of recommended keywords for your topic or by manually inputting your chosen keywords. It also suggests sub-topics for your article and helps you structure your content with headings. The tool even cites its sources, displaying journalistic responsibility.
Significantly, it helps you choose topics about which to write. While exploring the platform, I found its topic generator helpful for coming up with article topics using a seed keyword—after prompting with “cold calling,” for example, I received a long list of article keywords and their associated traffic. I then selected Research and Write, a one-click article feature for Cold Calling Leads, and within minutes, I had a basis for a new 600-word article on the topic.
Compared to other AI writing tools, AI Writer’s blog content creation was incredibly quick. However, a note on quality—although AI Writer’s articles are typically well-written, SEO-friendly, and factually correct, they could benefit from a writer’s touch. When I took another pass to add personality, anecdotes, actionable insights, and personal experiences to the copy, it became more appealing to readers and search engines.

The use of generative AI would be most helpful with one-liner NPCs, as a lot of time and energy goes into specifically going through each character, which usually bottlenecks the development process. Larian Studios faced a similar roadblock during the making of Baldur’s Gate 3. This made Swen Vincke, the founder and director of Larian Studios, more open to the idea of working with AI in the future.
Swen Vincke shares his thoughts on the future of AI
Vincke has a grounded approach toward the use of AI in the video game industry, but he sure is open-minded about finding the right balance between human effort and AI for a collaboration to take place between the two without making AI the boss.

Distinguished speakers: (From left) Bigar, Lian, Yap, Danze and Brewer after providing insights on the impact of AI on the job market. They were speaking at an event organised by Star Media Group.





PETALING JAYA: The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is set to replace or make some jobs obsolete, but it could also mean new job opportunities in other areas. Speakers in a forum organised by Star Media Group Bhd’s Leaders Council Power Breakfast yesterday said that there were pertinent concerns among the incoming workforce, who are mostly students now, about potential job losses from the wider adoption of generative AI, which is a much more advanced form of AI.The forum was titled “Shaping the Digital Future of Malaysia”. Fabian Bigar, chief executive officer of MyDigital Corp, a government agency under the Digital Ministry, said the advent of generative AI is similar to another industrial revolution which is likely to shake up the job market. The present sentiment towards AI appears to be more pessimistic with regards to potential job losses but Fabian noted there could be upside opportunities from this development. This was also echoed by other panelists at the forum.

 “AI has been there a long time, but the development of generative AI feels like there is a revolution, as within a short span of time things have been transformed. “There is a change in how we interact with the rest of the world or machines and it can generate new things,” Bigar said. “In the past AI needed to be trained and programmed to do specific tasks. Right now, with generative AI, it can come out with new things by itself. It is self-learning and is able to create new things. That’s why it’s important to fact-check as the system can ‘hallucinate’, but if it is fed with enough accurate information it can actually give a reliable output,” he added.

 Bigar cited previous technological developments, such as when automobiles became more widespread, which meant makers of horse-drawn carriages became obsolete. However, it also led to a new types of jobs such as mechanics and engineers. “Generative AI could mean the displacement of menial or repetitive jobs that can be done by the technology. But then to maintain these systems still requires human intervention and judgement. IBM Asean’s general manager and group technology leader Catherine Lian said that generative AI had already replaced jobs related to expense claims within the group. “IBM has got about 450,000 employees globally. Jobs related to processing claims for things like travel expenses have been repurposed. We have taken away 5,000 such jobs worldwide as there is a 100% replacement here by generative AI at IBM. “The jobs have been lost but the people have been repurposed to other roles such as marketing and human resources. A repetitive task is a 100% replaceable by generative AI,” Lian said. Meanwhile, Siemens Malaysia’s president and chief executive officer Tindaro Danze said it is quite likely jobs in computer programming or coding would become obsolete within the next ten years. “In 10 years from now, any person can programme a machine and coding is going to be obsolete,” Danze said. Generative AI could also change the way education is carried out eventually, said MyDigital’s Bigar. “The schooling experience may be a little bit different, I don’t think it will be about knowledge any more, but rather about asking the right questions,” he added. Pos Malaysia Bhd’s group chief executive Charles Brewer said he sees generative AI as an exciting development that’s anticipated to change many different parts of its business. “Generative AI is a huge opportunity and super exciting. We know of 642 use cases where it would add significant value to our employees, customers and business. On the flipside, we have to think of the jobs that would no longer exist, and we would need to reskill these people and create new business units,” Brewer told StarBiz. Danze said the situation in the job market and the impact of generative AI is still playing out, and is difficult to predict what new jobs or industries would come about. “Ten years ago, no one would’ve thought that ride hailing would be such a huge job market. As the application of new technologies increases, the opportunities of new jobs will increase at the same pace,” he said. Melissa Yap, chief of staff for Deloitte’s SEA Consulting Office, was the moderator of the event. The Leaders Council Power Breakfast is a satellite event to kick off the Leaders Council Summit.

Jobs requiring AI skills are still 'extremely rare' in Australia, according to SEEK data. Image: Shutterstock







An analysis by a federal assistant minister and an economist has found the number of advertisements for jobs involving artificial intelligence skills have dropped in Australia since 2021, and such roles remained “extremely rare”.
Compiled by economist Matt Cowgill and the assistant minister for competition, charities, treasury and employment, Andrew Leigh, the analysis uses Australian data collected by job site SEEK.
It found AI jobs made up “a tiny share of all advertised positions” in Australia, accounting for only 0.17 per cent of job postings, or 1 in every 588 advertised roles.
The pair also found that while workers in roles involving AI skills were generally paid more, there was some evidence that their wage premium had dropped over the past seven years.
The findings were delivered in a speech by Leigh to the Bureau of Statistics and Reserve Bank’s joint conference Human Capital in Sydney on Tuesday.
The report comes after AI experts criticised the level of AI investment in the federal government’s latest budget, which pledged $39.9 million over five years for the development of AI policies and capabilities.

AI jobs decline
Leigh and Cowgill’s analysis found that while ads for jobs in Australia involving AI skills increased as a share of overall job postings between 2017 and 2022, they have since declined.
However, the report also found demand for AI skills in Australia had still “clearly grown substantially, approximately tripling since 2017”. 
Only 0.06 per cent of advertisements in 2017 were for AI jobs — a figure which peaked at 0.2 per cent in 2021, before falling to 0.17 per cent in early 2024.
Similarly, job ads containing the phrase “artificial intelligence” have also dropped, with around 1 in 1,000 advertised roles containing that phrase in 2024.
“The share of job advertisements that mention ‘artificial intelligence’ rose six-fold from 2017 to 2022, but fell by one-third from 2022 to 2024,” the report said.
Source: Andrew Leigh and Matt Cowgill's 'Artificial Intelligence at Work: Changing Demand for AI Skills in Job Advertisements'

In a statement to Information Age, Leigh said while many Australians were using AI in their everyday lives, AI specialists were ""thin on the ground"".
“The drop in AI jobs from 2022 to 2024 likely reflected the general downturn in hiring in the IT sector,” he said.
“Interestingly, AI jobs held up better than general coding jobs over this period.
“The government’s AI strategy is focused on ensuring that we maximise the productivity benefits from AI, both as producers and consumers of the technology.”
Leigh and Cowgill admitted that ads for AI jobs which did not explicitly mention AI-related skills in the text of the job advertisement would not be considered AI jobs by their analysis.
They also were not trying to identify roles made redundant by the emergence of AI.
Half of the 1,000 Australians surveyed for market research company Ipsos’ latest AI Monitor report said they believed AI was “somewhat"" or “very” likely to change how they did their current job in the next five years.

Only 26 per cent of Australians said they felt it was “somewhat” or “very” likely that AI would completely replace their job in the next five years.
Australia’s largest telecommunications company, Telstra, announced in May that it would cut 2,800 employees this year amid an AI-driven “reset” of its enterprise arm.
Higher wages for AI jobs 
Leigh and Cowgill's analysis found AI jobs have received higher wages than non-AI jobs for years, but things were beginning to balance out.
In the 12 months to March 2024, they found the average advertised salary for an AI job was $121,275 — 31 per cent higher than the average for non-AI jobs.
However, the authors also found AI jobs were ""over-represented in occupations that tend to pay well regardless of whether AI skills are mentioned in the job ad”.
After altering their calculations to account for this, they estimated the pay premium for AI jobs was 11 per cent in 2017.
""Over the ensuing years, the pay gap between AI jobs and other jobs in the same state and occupational category steadily fell,” they said.
“In 2023 and 2024, the final years of our sample, the pay premium for AI jobs was just 4 per cent.
“Averaged across the entire period 2017 to 2024 (and controlling for state, time and occupation fixed effects), the pay premium for AI jobs was 6 per cent.”

Source: Andrew Leigh and Matt Cowgill's 'Artificial Intelligence at Work: Changing Demand for AI Skills in Job Advertisements'
In the 12 months to April 2024, AI jobs were found to be most prevalent in science, technology and research roles, with the largest share (6.3 per cent) among mathematical science professionals, which includes data scientists.
The retail, real estate, community services and construction industries were found to have the lowest prevalence of AI jobs.
“Some may be surprised to learn that ‘Nurse educators and researchers’, ‘Music professionals’ and ‘Social professionals’ are among the top ten occupations for their share of AI jobs,” the report added.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative force that is reshaping societies worldwide. AI has the potential to disrupt industries, create new job categories, and alter work, with countries leading in AI innovation potentially gaining economic advantages.
Ad powered by advergic.com
The race for AI dominance in geopolitics raises concerns about arms races, technological espionage, and power imbalances. AI integration into military systems raises ethical and strategic questions about autonomous weapons and cyber warfare. Ethical considerations include privacy, bias, accountability, and human rights impact.
Robust governance frameworks are needed to ensure responsible AI development and deployment. AI can transform various aspects of society, but there are concerns about job displacement, inequality, and social cohesion. The rise of AI presents both opportunities and challenges for policymakers, businesses, and societies, necessitating effective governance and collaboration to harness its benefits while mitigating its risks.
With a growing youth population, Pakistan is at the precipice of a transformative era driven by technological advancements. AI represents the emulation of human intelligence processes by machines, encompassing technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. Its applications are far-reaching, altering the way we live, work, and interact.
The AI age is also transforming the employment model in Pakistan, presenting both challenges and opportunities for the youth. As AI disrupts traditional job roles, individuals must adapt to new skill-sets that require creativity, critical thinking, and adaptability. Upskilling and reskilling initiatives are crucial to equip the youth with the competencies demanded by the AI-driven economy. Access to AI education and training programmes provides young individuals with the tools and skills necessary to thrive in an increasingly digital world.
AI holds the potential to drive innovation and entrepreneurship among Pakistani youth. With the rise of AI-powered startups and initiatives, young innovators are harnessing the technology to address pressing societal challenges and create meaningful solutions. However, the proliferation of AI raises concerns and challenges for Pakistan’s youth. The rapid pace of technological advancement risks exacerbating existing inequalities, particularly in terms of access and opportunity. Disparities in digital literacy and infrastructure may widen the gap between urban and rural youth, hindering inclusive development and socioeconomic progress. Ethical considerations surrounding AI loom large, necessitating careful deliberation and regulation to ensure responsible and equitable deployment. By grappling with these ethical dilemmas and navigating the ethical dimensions of AI, Pakistani youth can chart a path towards inclusive and sustainable development in the 21st century.


International collaboration should be encouraged to share best practices and resources in AI development and implementation. Public awareness should be raised about the benefits and risks of AI, and lifelong learning and professional development should be encouraged. By following this roadmap, Pakistan can position itself to capitalize on AI opportunities and become a leader in the new world order of technology.

The integration of AI may initially lead to job displacement, but proactive measures can mitigate these effects by fostering an environment conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship. AI-driven efficiencies can enhance productivity, potentially offsetting job losses with new opportunities in emerging sectors such as data analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Emerging job opportunities emerge as AI permeates various industries, demanding specialized skill-sets. Data scientists, AI engineers, cybersecurity specialists, and digital transformation experts are among the roles in high demand. Encouraging STEM education equips youth with the skills needed to thrive in these domains.
The private sector plays a pivotal role in driving AI adoption and fostering youth employment by investing in research and development, facilitating industry-relevant training programs, internships, and mentorship initiatives. The government’s responsibility is to craft policies that facilitate a smooth transition to the AI-driven economy, promoting digital literacy, vocational training, and entrepreneurship. Universities serve as incubators of talent, preparing the youth for the challenges and opportunities presented by AI. Curricula should be updated to incorporate AI-related subjects, providing students with practical skills and hands-on experience. Partnerships with industry enable universities to offer internships, co-op programs, and industry projects, ensuring graduates are equipped with the skills sought after by employers.
Parents and society play a crucial role in shaping the aspirations and career choices of the youth. Encouraging a culture of lifelong learning and embracing change fosters resilience and adaptability, while destigmatizing vocational education and non-traditional career paths promotes diversity in the workforce. Meanwhile, the broader community has a crucial role in influencing the career choices and ambitions of young individuals, fostering a mindset of continuous learning and embracing diverse career paths. Destigmatizing vocational education and promoting diverse career options ensure inclusivity and provide opportunities for all segments of society. Collaboration among stakeholders is vital as Pakistan navigates the AI revolution.
By embracing innovation, investing in human capital, and fostering an inclusive ecosystem, Pakistan can harness AI’s transformative potential for sustainable economic growth and societal development. Government support should be allocated for AI research and development, with centres of excellence and grants for universities and research institutions. Industry collaboration should be encouraged, with internship programs, apprenticeships, and partnerships with tech companies. To promote entrepreneurship, a conducive environment should be created, offering incentives like tax breaks, grants, and incubation centres.
A robust digital infrastructure should be built, including high-speed internet connectivity and data centres. Skills development should be implemented, with training programmes and workshops to upskill the workforce in AI technologies. A clear regulatory framework should be developed, addressing ethical and privacy concerns while fostering innovation.
International collaboration should be encouraged to share best practices and resources in AI development and implementation. Public awareness should be raised about the benefits and risks of AI, and lifelong learning and professional development should be encouraged. By following this roadmap, Pakistan can position itself to capitalize on AI opportunities and become a leader in the new world order of technology.

The glare of attention on generative AI threatens to overshadow advanced analytics. Companies pouring resources into much-hyped large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT risk neglecting advanced analytics and their proven value for improving business decisions and processes, such as predicting the next best offer for each customer or optimizing supply chains.
The consequences for resource allocation and value creation are significant. Data and analytics teams that our team works with are reporting that generative AI initiatives, often pushed by senior leaders afraid of missing out on the next big thing, are siphoning funds from their budgets. This reallocation could undermine projects aimed at delivering value across the organization, even as most enterprises are still seeking convincing business cases for the use of LLMs.

However, advanced analytics and LLMs have vastly different capabilities, and leaders should not think in terms of choosing one over the other. These technologies can work in concert, combining, for example, the reliable predictive power of machine learning-based advanced analytics with the natural language capabilities of LLMs.
Considering these complementary capabilities, we see opportunities for generative AI to tackle challenges in the development and deployment phases of advanced analytics — for both predictive and prescriptive applications. LLMs can be particularly useful in helping users incorporate unstructured data sources into analyses, translate business problems into analytical models, and understand and explain models’ results.
In this article, we’ll describe some experiments we have conducted with LLMs to boost advanced analytics use cases. We’ll also provide guidance on monitoring and verifying that output, which remains a best practice when working with LLMs, given that they are known to sometimes produce unreliable or incorrect results.
Applying LLMs in Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics lies at the heart of processes that are increasingly data-driven for many companies. It’s rare to find a marketing department that isn’t discussing shifts in customer churn predictions and how to react, or commercial teams that aren’t considering how to boost next month’s sales in response to a dip that’s been forecast by predictive analytics. We see opportunities to expand the impact of such approaches by tapping LLMs in the following ways to increase the variety of data used to train and execute models or better communicate with business stakeholders who use predictive analytics outputs in decision-making.
Incorporating complex data types.

Probably none: the advantages of AI are too great to deny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits AI models offer to organizations are undeniable, especially for optimizing critical operations and outputs. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;generative AI&lt;/a&gt; also comes with risk. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/cybersecurity&quot;&gt;IBM Institute for Business Value&lt;/a&gt;, 96% of executives say adopting generative AI makes a security breach likely in their organization within the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CISA Director &lt;a href=&quot;https://securityintelligence.com/articles/are-we-doomed-to-make-the-same-security-mistakes-with-ai/&quot;&gt;Jen Easterly&lt;/a&gt; said, “We don’t have a cyber problem, we have a technology and culture problem. Because at the end of the day, we have allowed speed to market and features to really put safety and security in the backseat.” And no place in technology reveals the obsession with speed to market more than generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI training sets ingest massive amounts of valuable and sensitive data, which makes AI models a juicy attack target. Organizations cannot afford to bring unsecured AI into their environments, but they can’t do without the technology either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bridge the gap between the need for AI and its inherent risks, it’s imperative to establish a solid framework to direct AI security and model use. To help meet this need, IBM recently announced its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ibm-framework-for-securing-generative-ai/&quot;&gt;Framework for Securing Generative AI&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s see how a well-developed framework can help you establish solid AI cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Securing the AI pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A generative AI framework should be designed to help customers, partners and organizations to understand the likeliest attacks on AI. From there, defensive approaches can be prioritized to quickly secure generative AI initiatives.&lt;img alt=&quot;A chart of the AI pipeline, focusing on data security.&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; src=&quot;https://images1.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz1mNjk0ZTIzYWY0MjIxMWVlYjJiOGFhYTM1YTIwZjI2NA==&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securing the AI pipeline involves five areas of action:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Securing the data: How data is collected and handled&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Securing the model: AI model development and training&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Securing the usage: AI model inference and live use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Securing AI model infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establishing sound AI governance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s see how each area is oriented to address AI security threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[button link=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/ai-cybersecurity&quot; color=&quot;orange1&quot; size=&quot;large&quot;]Learn more about AI cybersecurity[/button]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Secure the AI data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hungry AI models consume massive amounts of data, which data scientists, engineers and developers will access for development purposes. However, developers might not have security high on their list of priorities. If mishandled, your sensitive data and critical intellectual property (IP) could end up exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In AI model attacks, exfiltration of underlying data sets is likely to be one of the most common attack scenarios. Therefore, security fundamentals are the first line of defense to protect these data sets. AI security fundamentals include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/data-security&quot;&gt;Data discovery and classification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data encryption at rest and in transit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/verify?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700074603995207&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAmZGrBhAnEiwAo9qHiTE5RWkmbwf2L1tP4Ol0mhnD5NYxistXMTIX4Z6v2ffn3g-8Nrag6RoCy8UQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot;&gt;Identity and access management&lt;/a&gt; (IAM) to help ensure that no single entity has unrestricted access to the AI model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building in security through security awareness for data scientists, researchers and developers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Secure the AI model&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When developing AI applications, data scientists frequently use pre-existing, freely available machine learning (ML) models sourced from online repositories. However, like any open-source library, security is frequently not built in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every organization must consider the AI security risks versus the benefits of accelerated model development. However, without proper AI model security, the downside risk can be significant. Remember, hackers have access to online repositories as well, and backdoors or malware can be injected into open-source models. Any organization that downloads an infected model is wide open to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, API-enabled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;large language models (LLMs)&lt;/a&gt; present a similar risk. Hackers can target API interfaces to access and exploit data being transported across the APIs. And LLM agents or plug-ins with excessive permissions further increase the risk for compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To secure AI models, organizations should:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuously scan for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/services/vulnerability-management&quot;&gt;vulnerabilities, malware and corruption&lt;/a&gt; across the AI/ML pipeline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discover and harden &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/qradar&quot;&gt;API and plug-in integrations&lt;/a&gt; to third-party models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/products/verify-identity&quot;&gt;Configure policies, controls and RBAC&lt;/a&gt; around ML models, artifacts and data sets so that no one person or thing has access to all the data or all of the model functions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Secure the AI usage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When AI models first became widely available, waves of users rushed to test the platforms. It wasn’t long before hackers were able to trick the models into ignoring guardrails and generate biased, false or even dangerous responses. All this can lead to reputational damage and increase the risk of costly legal headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attackers can also attempt to analyze input/output pairs and train a surrogate model to mimic the behavior of your organization’s AI model. This means the enterprise can lose its competitive edge. Finally, AI models are also vulnerable to denial of service attacks, where attackers overwhelm the LLM with inputs that degrade the quality of service and ramp up resource use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best practices for AI model usage security include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitoring for prompt injections&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitoring for outputs containing sensitive data or inappropriate content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detecting and responding to data poisoning, model evasion and model extraction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deploying &lt;a href=&quot;https://pulse2.com/hiddenlayer-50-million-in-funding/&quot;&gt;machine learning detection and response (MLDR),&lt;/a&gt; which can be integrated into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/qradar&quot;&gt;security operations solutions&lt;/a&gt;, such as IBM Security® QRadar®, enabling the ability to deny access and quarantine or disconnect compromised models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Secure the infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secure infrastructure must underpin any solid AI cybersecurity strategy. Strengthening network security, refining access control, implementing robust data encryption and deploying vigilant intrusion detection and prevention systems around AI environments are all critical for securing infrastructure that supports AI. Additionally, allocating resources towards innovative security solutions tailored for safeguarding AI assets should be a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Establish AI governance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-governance&quot;&gt;Artificial intelligence governance&lt;/a&gt; entails the guardrails that ensure AI tools and systems are and remain safe and ethical. It establishes the frameworks, rules and standards that direct AI research, development and application to ensure safety, fairness and respect for human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is an industry leader in AI governance, as shown by its presentation of the IBM Framework for Securing Generative AI. As entities continue to give AI more business process and decision-making responsibility, AI model behavior must be kept in check, monitoring for fairness, bias and drift over time. Whether induced or not, a model that diverges from what it was originally designed to do can introduce significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oil and gas industry hops on generative AI bandwagon

New York (AFP) –             Away from the Microsoft and Googles of the world, a century-old industry -- oil and gas -- is hoping that generative artificial intelligence will make producing petroleum more efficient and easier on its workforce.

Long before the current craze surrounding generative AI (Gen AI), the energy sector employed traditional artificial intelligence through its use of data to identify oil and gas deposits.But the industry sees even greater potential to save money, reduce accidents and lower greenhouse gases through Gen AI, which exponentially increases and diversifies the data that can be analyzed.The new AI programs can also be employed broadly in the workforce instead of being limited to programmers and data analysts, as has been the case with traditional AI.""Extracting this data from the copious amounts of data generated by drilling activities has historically posed a significant challenge for industry leaders,"" recently wrote Tim Hafke, content marketing specialist with AlphaSense. ""That's where Gen AI comes in.""In recent years the downstream industry, which includes refineries that process crude oil into gasoline, has increasingly relied on so-called digital twins -- computer-modeled replicas of actual facilities. They allow companies to run simulations to assess operational issues in real-life facilities, mitigate potential hazards and do predictive maintenance (PdM).PdM uses historical and current data to project future performance and determine when parts should be taken down for maintenance or replaced.Microsoft vice president Matthew Kerner sees this as an entry point to generative AI, a way ""to explain why the predictive model is making that prediction"" and provide context to better address the situation, he explained during a panel discussion at energy conference CERAWeek.""Gen AI is useful as a bolt on to some other more predictive AI systems,"" Kerner said.Next-generation chatbots similar to the world-famous ChatGPT can also be of help for employees on the ground, said Rob McGreevy, of industry software company Aveva, during the panel.The data-filled chatbot could allow oil field or refinery workers encountering a problem to measure atmospheric conditions like humidity and operational performance like wellhead pressure to quickly diagnose the issue, McGreevy said.Getting a detailed report in seconds allows for a quick fix -- saving time and money in the process.'Less risk'During refinery maintenance, ""you're putting people in dangerous situations to do work. If you can do those turnarounds faster, you're exposing yourself to less risk,"" said Matthew Babin, head of energy and natural resources at software company Palantir Technologies.Gen AI can provide ""context to people who are in the process of making a decision, even if it's outside their area of expertise,"" Babin said.""So if I'm a reservoir engineer, I don't have to know about maintenance, but I do have to know about maintenance when I'm looking at how that resource is going to perform and what that costs my organization,"" Babin added.Petroleum installations are regularly checked or taken offline for upkeep. A Gen AI interface provides ""access to a maintenance manual, so you can look at how maintenance for that piece of kit should be done,"" all laid out in plain English, thanks to a chatbot, McGreevy said.Such a system could also facilitate the repair work itself, taking the guesswork out of such decisions.For example, the technology would allow a company to use a computer model of a facility to determine if there is enough room to use a ladder or install scaffolding, McGreevey said.McGreevy said it could also help new employees: ""I think we can shorten dramatically the time it takes for people coming on board to be proficient to safely operate these facilities at scale.""Greater efficiencies linked to Gen AI also create a chance to reduce an oil facility's carbon footprint. But running the technology also requires huge amounts of electricity, mainly in data centers.

Large language models like those that power ChatGPT have shown impressive performance on tasks like drafting legal briefs, analyzing the sentiment of customer reviews, or translating documents into different languages.These machine-learning models typically use only natural language to process information and answer queries, which can make it difficult for them to perform tasks that require numerical or symbolic reasoning.For instance, a large language model might be able to memorize and recite a list of recent U.S. presidents and their birthdays, but that same model could fail if asked the question “Which U.S. presidents elected after 1950 were born on a Wednesday?” (The answer is Jimmy Carter.)Researchers from MIT and elsewhere have proposed a new technique that enables large language models to solve natural language, math and data analysis, and symbolic reasoning tasks by generating programs.Their approach, called natural language embedded programs (NLEPs), involves prompting a language model to create and execute a Python program to solve a user’s query, and then output the solution as natural language.They found that NLEPs enabled large language models to achieve higher accuracy on a wide range of reasoning tasks. The approach is also generalizable, which means one NLEP prompt can be reused for multiple tasks.NLEPs also improve transparency, since a user could check the program to see exactly how the model reasoned about the query and fix the program if the model gave a wrong answer.“We want AI to perform complex reasoning in a way that is transparent and trustworthy. There is still a long way to go, but we have shown that combining the capabilities of programming and natural language in large language models is a very good potential first step toward a future where people can fully understand and trust what is going on inside their AI model,” says Hongyin Luo PhD ’22, an MIT postdoc and co-lead author of a paper on NLEPs.Luo is joined on the paper by co-lead authors Tianhua Zhang, a graduate student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong; and Jiaxin Ge, an undergraduate at Peking University; Yoon Kim, an assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); senior author James Glass, senior research scientist and head of the Spoken Language Systems Group in CSAIL; and others. The research will be presented at the Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics.Problem-solving with programsMany popular large language models work by predicting the next word, or token, given some natural language input. While models like GPT-4 can be used to write programs, they embed those programs within natural language, which can lead to errors in the program reasoning or results.With NLEPs, the MIT researchers took the opposite approach. They prompt the model to generate a step-by-step program entirely in Python code, and then embed the necessary natural language inside the program.An NLEP is a problem-solving template with four steps. First, the model calls the necessary packages, or functions, it will need to solve the task. Step two involves importing natural language representations of the knowledge the task requires (like a list of U.S. presidents’ birthdays). For step three, the model implements a function that calculates the answer. And for the final step, the model outputs the result as a line of natural language with an automatic data visualization, if needed.“It is like a digital calculator that always gives you the correct computation result as long as the program is correct,” Luo says.The user can easily investigate the program and fix any errors in the code directly rather than needing to rerun the entire model to troubleshoot.The approach also offers greater efficiency than some other methods. If a user has many similar questions, they can generate one core program and then replace certain variables without needing to run the model repeatedly.To prompt the model to generate an NLEP, the researchers give it an overall instruction to write a Python program, provide two NLEP examples (one with math and one with natural language), and one test question.“Usually, when people do this kind of few-shot prompting, they still have to design prompts for every task. We found that we can have one prompt for many tasks because it is not a prompt that teaches LLMs to solve one problem, but a prompt that teaches LLMs to solve many problems by writing a program,” says Luo.“Having language models reason with code unlocks many opportunities for tool use, output validation, more structured understanding into model's capabilities and way of thinking, and more,” says Leonid Karlinsky, principal scientist at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.“No magic here”NLEPs achieved greater than 90 percent accuracy when prompting GPT-4 to solve a range of symbolic reasoning tasks, like tracking shuffled objects or playing a game of 24, as well as instruction-following and text classification tasks. The researchers found that NLEPs even exhibited 30 percent greater accuracy than task-specific prompting methods. The method also showed improvements over open-source LLMs. Along with boosting the accuracy of large language models, NLEPs could also improve data privacy. Since NLEP programs are run locally, sensitive user data do not need to be sent to a company like OpenAI or Google to be processed by a model.In addition, NLEPs can enable small language models to perform better without the need to retrain a model for a certain task, which can be a costly process.“There is no magic here. We do not have a more expensive or fancy language model. All we do is use program generation instead of natural language generation, and we can make it perform significantly better,” Luo says.However, an NLEP relies on the program generation capability of the model, so the technique does not work as well for smaller models which have been trained on limited datasets. In the future, the researchers plan to study methods that could make smaller language models generate more effective NLEPs. In addition, they want to investigate the impact of prompt variations on NLEPs to enhance the robustness of the model’s reasoning processes.This research was supported, in part, by the Center for Perceptual and Interactive Intelligence of Hong Kong.

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

Apple is bringing generative AI to Siri and throughout iOS 18, iPad OS 18 and macOS Sequoia, the company announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10.
As was rumored, Apple partnered with OpenAI to link ChatGPT to iOS, iPadOS and macOS. However, Apple Intelligence will be an independent generative AI service hosted on its own servers.
Adding generative capabilities to Siri has the advantage of familiarity, and partnering with OpenAI means Apple won’t have to do all of the work itself. Apple is betting on generative AI being a seamless addition to the way the Apple ecosystem may already organize a consumer’s or professional’s life.
Apple Intelligence will be available in beta this fall in iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. It will work on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and some other current iPad and Mac devices with M1 or newer chips. ChatGPT assistance for Apple Intelligence will follow later in 2024.
 

 
What is Apple Intelligence?
Apple Intelligence is a suite of generative AI capabilities integrated into the next generation of Apple devices. During the AI reveal at WWDC, Apple put the emphasis on “personal intelligence” and privacy. Most of the generative AI processes used for Apple Intelligence will be performed on-device on the A17 or M-series chips and in a proprietary cloud.

Craig Federighi, Apple senior vice president of software engineering, emphasized personal context in the WWDC keynote.
“We’re tremendously excited about the power of generative models … But these tools know very little about you and your needs,” he said.
In response, Apple Intelligence on iOS 18, iPad 18 and macOS Sequoia will use AI for “personal context” to make day-to-day tasks faster. The iPhone can prioritize and summarize notifications with the “priority notifications” feature, selecting the most important ones first.
SEE: Concerns about ultra-powerful artificial intelligence lead some within Silicon Valley to seek a ‘Right to Warn’ for AI project whistleblowers. 
What else does understanding personal context mean? Apple Intelligence can determine what data you think is most relevant and reference related content. For example, if your meeting is rescheduled, you can check whether the new time will prevent you from getting to your daughter’s school event. Answering this question requires Apple Intelligence to search and reason across your personal and work calendars, email and Apple Maps.
New writing tools with generative AI will be available in Mail, Notes, Pages, Keynote and third party apps. Apple Intelligence can write and summarize emails, too.
Apple Intelligence can take action between apps to carry out tasks on your behalf. For example, you can ask it to take action based on natural questions like “Play the podcast that my wife sent the other day.”
Apple Intelligence lets consumers create custom emojis easily in apps like Messages. Notes, Pages, Keynote and Freeform will all gain generative AI images. Apple intelligence is able to identify and recreate pictures of people in your photo library,” such as creating an image of them for their birthday.
What generative AI models does Apple Intelligence run on?
Apple Intelligence runs on multiple proprietary models, which are trained on the AXLearn framework. On June 10, Apple researchers detailed two of them: a large language model with about 3 billion parameters and the server-based language model used in Private Cloud Compute.
Private Cloud Compute
Sometimes, Apple’s AI processes will need to be performed on external servers. To hopefully prevent privacy and security problems around this, Apple will run these processes on Private Cloud Compute, a home for Apple Intelligence that are still thoroughly within the Apple ecosystem and use Apple’s own Swift programming language. Even Apple can’t see that data, the company claims.
“You should not have to hand over all the details of your life to be warehoused and analyzed in someone’s AI cloud,” said Federighi.
Siri will respond to natural language
Apple Intelligence enables Siri to:

Understand more natural-sounding questions and speech patterns, including understanding pauses or corrections.
Remember previous conversations and references.
Answer questions about Apple devices.
Take actions inside apps on your behalf.

You can now type to talk to Siri, double tapping the bottom of the screen to make natural-language requests.
Apple didn’t show flashy demos like OpenAI and Google did, but they may be betting on more consumers finding uses for generative AI through what they already do with Siri.
Enhancements to Siri with Apple Intelligence will roll out over the course of the next year. Developers will be able to define how Siri with Apple Intelligence will be able to interact with their apps.
ChatGPT will be integrated with Siri
In addition to Apple Intelligence, Apple is partnering with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT and GPT-4o to Siri, which will be used when referencing current information or gathering information that isn’t on your devices.
Siri will ask for permission to reach out to ChatGPT. You can do this for free or connect to your personal ChatGPT subscription. This integration is coming later this year. Plus, Apple plans to add support for other AI models.
Where Apple’s AI fits in to the competition
Apple has seemingly chosen to stay out of the generative AI chatbot race for the last few years, although it published research on running large language models on mobile devices in December 2023. The relatively late entry means Apple has had time to watch the rest of the industry try to find practical use cases for generative AI. It’s also seen Microsoft switch its Recall AI feature from default to opt-in after security concerns.
Will Apple face the same backlash and security digging as Microsoft’s Recall? And is Apple’s ecosystem so powerful that its email summarization and other Apple Intelligence capabilities will prove as game-changing as AI companies predict generative AI content to be? Is Apple playing it safe when it comes to AI? It’s too early to say, but time will tell whether Apple Intelligence might be opt-in — or transformative — going forward.

Artificial Intelligence, Recruitment & Hiring 
AI hype tapers off? Only one in 588 job ads demand AI skills

Demand for employees with generative artificial intelligence skills peaked the year ChatGPT was launched and has tapered off in the past two years, amid hype and concern over the impact of the technology.
Fresh analysis by jobs platform Seek in collaboration with Federal Assistant Minister for Employment Andrew Leigh, found AI jobs made up a sliver of total open roles and typically attracted higher salaries.
To be detailed in a speech by Dr Leigh on Tuesday, the findings follow growing anxiety among creative professions, such as voice artists, about work theft and job losses driven by AI.
Generative AI creates text, images or other media by drawing from massive pools of data and its uses are varied, from being put to use by financial institutions to detect fraud to carers to tailor bedtime stories to their audiences.
ChatGPT, launched in 2022 and owned by OpenAI, is a “large language model” program with an interactive chatbot that creates the media output based on instructions from the user.
Yet as heard by a Senate inquiry into the matter, the technology poses challenges as well as opportunities.
In the federal budget, $39.9 million was committed to developing AI policies and restrictions over the next five years.
Dr Leigh will say there is “considerable interest” in how the technology will shift dynamics in the jobs market, including its potential to save workers time and make them more productive.
Higher demand for skills needed to work with AI models is also an expected consequence of the technology’s spread, the assistant minister will say.
Demand for AI skills had tripled since 2017 but jobs remain “extremely rare”, Dr Leigh will tell the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Reserve Bank of Australia joint conference on human capital in Sydney.
One in every 588 open roles on Seek met the definition of an AI job — which included mentions of technical keywords — with those numbers shrinking as a proportion of total jobs between 2022 and 2024.
Similar patterns were found when isolating job ads that simply mentioned “artificial intelligence” in the post.
Unsurprisingly, AI jobs were most prevalent in science, technology and research roles, making up 6.3% of all mathematical science professional ads.
But hiring in the sector has been sluggish overall, as economic uncertainty takes a toll.



In April, information and communication technology job ads were down 33.4% compared to the year before, a bigger fall than any other sector based on separate Seek data.

Second, Apple has a rocky track record in AI, including having foisted on you the dimwitted Siri for more than a decade.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIf 2023 was the year when AI mania went into hyperdrive, 2024 must be the “prove it” year.💻Follow TechnologyFollowToo many companies have promised magically useful AI that instead has often been rushed, barely functional, not very useful, insecure or error-prone, including Google’s new AI-powered search that suggested people eat glue.

Most people won’t get their hands on the Apple AI features until September or later, and you might need to buy a new iPhone to use them.What Apple’s AI demonstration showed (and didn’t)Apple discussed what are essentially two tiers of AI coming to some newer iPhones, Macs and iPads: the company’s own AI and that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which will step in for tasks that Siri or Apple’s apps can’t handle.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSkip to end of carouselShira Ovide(Patrick Dias for The Washington Post)Tech Friend writer Shira Ovide gives you advice and context to make technology work for you.

(Apple’s own AI may not be capable of this task yet, or Apple didn’t want to risk its AI botching a children’s story.)Apple also lowered the bar for itself by not promising an all-capable AI assistant that would let you skip the steps in planning your vacation or a grocery order.No company’s AI can do that, even the AI assistants from Microsoft, Google and OpenAI that say they’re all-capable. (AI can’t even peer into all the places you have relevant information, including a Gmail message, an Excel spreadsheet and a travel invoice in Expedia.)AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementInstead, Apple said its AI will make what you already do with its apps — and, later, potentially other companies’ apps — smarter and easier.Several of the features Apple showed — including AI writing helpers and AI for editing objects out of photos — are now standard features from Google, Microsoft or Samsung.Even with the lower bar, it’s not clear whether Apple can make solid and flawless AI. This is the company that made Siri; the clunky iTunes program, which even a top executive made fun of; unsuccessful driverless-car software; and auto-correct that thinks you’re typing “duck.” Apple did not respond to a request for comment.The pattern of overpromising and underdeliveringSo much AI promises magic and instead is wildly flawed or useful mostly for a small number of tasks.Story continues below advertisementI don’t blame any of you who aren’t regular users of the new forms of AI — and that’s most people. Only about 7 percent of Americans are using ChatGPT daily, according to a recent survey conducted for the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.AdvertisementOpenAI announced a chattier version of its chatbot in May, but it didn’t have most of the features the company discussed. Google this year scaled back both its AI image generator and the AI-powered search results after high-profile flubs. Meta AI is kind of dumb. Amazon showed an error-prone AI-upgraded Alexa last year, and it hasn’t been released yet. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)Those goofs aren’t Apple’s fault, and the company is usually wary of releasing products before they’re polished.But the backdrop for Apple’s AI glow-up is that it and other companies are under so much pressure to show off their AI expertise to investors, employees and business partners. It’s hard to know if any AI is really made for you or if it’s mostly for corporate self-interest.Share251 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Microsoft Canada President Chris Barry projects that generative AI will boost Canada’s labour productivity by around eight percent by the end of the decade, as reported by BNN Bloomberg.




A recent report by Microsoft, conducted with Accenture, predicts that generative AI could add $187bn to the Canadian economy by 2030. The report estimates that AI will contribute up to $180bn in annual productivity gains and another $7bn from new AI products and services. 




Barry, in an interview with BNN Bloomberg, explained that the study examined various industries, job types, and functions. It found that AI could augment or fully automate approximately 30 percent of these roles.




With a projected 40 percent adoption rate of AI, the Canadian economy could see a significant economic impact, enhancing labour productivity. 









Innovation in Canada
A study by Boston Consulting Group revealed that 57 percent of Canadian executives prioritize innovation, a figure lower than the global average of 83 percent. The study also indicated that 48 percent of executives attributed Canada’s slower pace of innovation to a risk-averse culture.




Despite this, 81 percent of Canadian executives are experimenting with generative AI for innovation, research and development, or product development. However, only 10 percent have implemented the technology at scale. 




AI and the Workforce
Addressing concerns about AI replacing jobs, Barry anticipates that AI will primarily augment the workforce in Canada.




He believes AI will make people more effective by automating menial or task-oriented parts of jobs, allowing workers to focus on higher-order tasks that benefit their organizations and increase their job satisfaction. Barry acknowledges that some job elements may change or be eliminated due to AI.

Generative AI can be a powerful tool for progress and positive change, we know. But what of Africa? This was the question Microsoft sought to ask with the aid of a few brilliant minds on the continent. The African context presents unique opportunities and challenges when we consider the potential of generative AI to transform work.
“We see a significant role for generative AI to not only transform work environments but also foster opportunities for the youth to create jobs, innovate and help drive economic growth and stability across the continent,” says Ravi Bhat, Chief Technology and Solutions Officer, Microsoft Africa.
The continent, it turns out, offers an unprecedented chance to influence the future of work in these early days as large language learning models (LLMs) are still evolving, and the environment for applications is still new. These are the findings of the AI and the Future of Work in Africa whitepaper produced by Microsoft and a collective of industry experts from across the continent.

According to the whitepaper, many expect GenAI to drastically change knowledge worker jobs, especially regarding the type of work done, the skills required, and the outputs produced. McKinsey research shows that GenAI could enable labour productivity growth of up to 0.6 per cent annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology adoption and the redeployment of worker time into other activities.
“Generative AI has significant potential to advance human capabilities,” says Jacki O’Neill, Director at Microsoft Research Africa. “As more people across Africa access GenAI tools through their internet-enabled devices and more affordable data, the barriers to access are being reduced and opportunities for skilling can increase. But it is not only information workers that stand to benefit from GenAI.”
The Beauty Of Numbers 
Nearly one billion people in Africa are currently under the age of 35. With the continent projected to be home to almost half of the world’s youth population by the turn of the century, it will in effect make up half of the potential global workforce of the future. Currently, up to 12 million young Africans enter the labour market annually. A report from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) states more than 20 per cent are neither in employment, education nor training.

The promise of GenAI to transform industries such as agriculture, healthcare, and services must be balanced by equipping the youth with the skills needed for an AI-disrupted labour market to ensure that they are not left behind in this technological shift.
It is therefore important to build skills across the spectrum, from how to deploy and use GenAI tools effectively at work, to how to build appropriate and innovative applications and technologies on top of these models, to the post-graduate skills of research and innovation in machine learning, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, cybersecurity, and systems to name a few.
“Investing in this range of skills gives Africans the best opportunity to create dignified, appropriate jobs, to adapt AI sensitively to indigenous knowledge, to create new value chains, and better AI systems which might reflect, for example, human-centred and community values. Such systems would add value globally and could counter typical tech-centric models of automation and deskilling,” adds O’Neill.

With culturally and linguistically sensitive design, GenAI can become more tailored to individual workers, learning from interactions and becoming a personalised tool that respects privacy and enhances each worker’s unique skills. It can serve as a guide to foster inclusivity and showcase the diverse skills and abilities of African workers. GenAI can also be appropriated as a community-focused tool that supports collaborative work and communal development.
In Comes The Tech 
The technology can assist in decision-making, risk assessment, and data analysis, empowering entrepreneurs in their ventures. For the informal sector, tailored GenAI tools will elevate the capabilities of entrepreneurs, providing customised assistance for their unique needs.
The whitepaper discloses that to ensure a beneficial outcome with GenAI, it is imperative to involve proactive governance, inclusive design, investment in education, and a commitment to regulatory and ethical standards. This, it observes, is a collective responsibility, requiring engagement from policymakers, technologists, and citizens alike.
“Technology alone cannot solve the challenges that our youthful continent faces. We need to create policies and practices to ensure that GenAI, and AI in general, is deployed responsibly with AI-related labour being valued and dignified. It requires the macro-economic, labour, and regulatory markets to adapt and be capable of supporting positive change,” adds Bhat.
The AI revolution in Africa is no longer just a possibility; it is already underway. To learn more, visit AI and the future of work in Africa to download the whitepaper.

As generative AI steamrolls through the art world, science-related art faces some unique conundrums. One of them concerns paleoart, the accurate-as-possible depiction of extinct life forms, based on as much information as we have — often not a lot. Essentially, it’s art because it requires a good deal of judgment and interpretation. But it is also science because, when representing science findings to the public, maximum possible accuracy is a duty. A pterosaur sprouting a third foot from its wing hardly meets the standard.
But that’s an obvious type of generative AI goof. How would lay people who follow paleontology know about less obvious departures from accuracy? That’s a problem, as Isaac Schultz notes an article in Gizmodo earlier this week:

Depending on the prompts they are given, AI image generators are not currently capable of intaking this complex and varied information and producing an image from it with the same fidelity and attention to detail as a human artist. 
Isaac Schultz, “Paleontologists Are Fuming Over AI Depictions of Prehistoric Animals,” Gizmodo, June 10, 2024



As the work of paleoartist and scientific illustrator Gabriel Ugueto illustrates in the video above, when the artist must decide how best to portray the subject, it’s a delicate balance between all-important accuracy and the human touch.
Generative AI as copyright theft
Another issue, of course, is copyright. Generative AI mops up everything available, including copyrighted works.

“Image generative AI is an algorithm for copyright theft,” said Per Ahlberg, a paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden, in a video call with Gizmodo. “What’s even worse is that you can then use this to start driving the people whose work you have stolen and incorporated into your learning algorithm out of business, and this is a major problem because we need to paleoartists—real ones.” 
Schultz, “AI Depictions of Prehistoric Animals”
The paleoartists’ dilemma is one element of the larger, general problem of how to compensate original creators, whether artists or writers, when their work is melded and repurposed in AI-generated output. While new tools that poison an attempted AI image might work for artists, some see the problem as better addressed by new instruments for compensation for creators.
Some paleoartists have taken to X to discuss the problem at #paleoagainstai:

I wasn’t expecting that from this decomposing T. rex model. Pure ridiculousness. 
[In the link below, the decomposed T. rex remains morph into a domestic cat:]
https://x.com/i/status/1759601542028505597Many of my friends & colleagues are artists who dedicate their lives to bringing ancient creatures back to life. It takes skill, passion, & creativity to create something special. #PaleoAgainstAI pic.twitter.com/OdQXyx7HDx— Dr Dean Lomax (@Dean_R_Lomax) February 19, 2024

It’s a challenge the art world must address

Geologist Henry De la Beche‘s 1830 watercolor painting Duria Antiquior – A more Ancient Dorset, based on fossils found by Mary Anning/Public Domain
It’s no surprise that paleoart became a fixture of science reporting back in the nineteenth century. It would be difficult for most laypeople to take much interest in prehistoric life without visual depiction. Would the tyrannosaur have become a cultural icon, instantly recognizable, if we had to rely only on written descriptions for accuracy? Hardly.
Moving with the times includes finding new ways to compensate the creativity that computational systems such as generative AI depend on.
You may also wish to read: Artists strike back!: New tool “poisons” images pirated by AI. Nightshade, developed by University of Chicago computer science prof Ben Zhao, makes the AI generator keep giving you a cat when you ask for a dog. Overall, Nightshade may prove more useful than lawsuits to artists. It is embedded in pixels, visible only to AI, not to humans.
andGenerative AI is creating a copyright crisis for artists. How does an artist assert copyright when her image was only one of many used to create a new image? How does she make a living if she can’t? AI companies could be required to record images’ origin and compensate copyright holders. But as Robert J. Marks notes, end users might then have to pay.

  Future Skills OrganisationNew report indicates VET qualifications in marketing and communications, conveyancing and insurance broking may be most impactedA new report by the Future Skills Organisation (FSO) and Mandala Partners proposes an approach to help identify the finance, technology and business Vocational Education and Training (VET) qualifications most likely to be impacted by generative artificial intelligence (AI).Released today, the ‘Building an AI-Enabled Workforce: Priority Framework’ report suggests that qualifications in marketing and communications, conveyancing, and insurance broking are highly exposed to the impact of generative AI.CEO of the Future Skills Organisation Patrick Kidd OBE OAM said, “As the Jobs and Skills Council for Australia’s finance, technology, and business sectors, we are keen to understand how the training system needs to respond to the impact of generative AI and when. This report helps to identify which areas we should look at first.”The report draws on the FSO’s previous research that identified the generative AI exposure of occupations and VET qualifications across the finance, technology and business sectors, as well as the types of skills most likely to be impacted by generative AI.“A recurring theme during our recent National Forum on skills in the finance, tech and business sectors was the need to recognise the impact of emerging technologies like generative AI in our education and skilling programmes. 1 in 5 Australians work in these sectors; it’s important we are responsive to these changes,” Mr Kidd said.“This research helps to identify the highest priority areas for attention when we collaborate with training providers and industry to help ensure our VET qualifications reflect the needs of the economy.”Leading economic research consulting firm Mandala Partners conducted the research, with Director Tom McMahon recounting the methodology.“We expanded on our earlier research with the Future Skills Organisation, which assessed the exposure to generative AI in VET courses in finance, technology, and business. This report expands on that analysis by creating a prioritisation methodology that determines a qualification’s relative economic impact. This approach can assist the FSO focus their efforts on the most important areas,” Mr McMahon said.“Our industries are at the vanguard of innovation, and generative AI is already making a huge influence on the workplace. However, it is still early days, and we need to better grasp what this means for the skills required. There’s a lot to ponder. This framework will help us identify the topics we should focus on initially. And this will assist drive the results that are likely to have the largest impact,” Mr Kidd said.You can find a copy of the full report attached.

However, 61% of respondents say they are pushing their organisation to adopt generative AI more quickly than some people are comfortable with.The findings also revealed that nearly two-thirds (63%) of surveyed CEOs say their teams have the skills and knowledge to incorporate generative AI, but few understand how generative AI adoption impacts their organisation’s workforce and culture, IBM said in a statement.More than half (56%) of respondents have not yet assessed the impact of generative AI on their employees. Yet, 51% of CEOs surveyed say they are hiring for generative AI roles that did not exist last year, while 47% expect to reduce or redeploy their workforce in the next 12 months because of generative AI.“There is incredible excitement around generative AI, and CEOs want to move beyond the AI hype to deliver business impact. Yet, without the right people and culture in place, progress will be slow,” said&nbsp;Matt Candy, Global Managing Partner, IBM Consulting.“As they embed generative AI in their enterprise strategy, it’s critical that executives build a cultural mindset that fosters adoption and lead people through the changes.”Other key study findings include:Workforces are straining under the pressure of generative AI adoption40% of CEOs surveyed plan to hire additional staff because of generative AI.Yet, more than half (53%) of respondents say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles.CEOs surveyed say 35% of their workforce will require retraining and&nbsp;reskilling over the next three years – up from just 6% in 2021.CEOs recognise it takes a cultural shift to successfully scale AI, but face organisational collaboration and adoption challenges65% of CEOs surveyed say their organisation’s success is directly tied to the quality of collaboration between finance and technology, yet nearly half (48%) say competition among their&nbsp;C-Suite executives sometimes impedes collaboration.Most (81%) CEO respondents say that inspiring their team with a common vision produces better outcomes. At the same time, 37% acknowledge that their employees don’t fully understand how strategic decisions impact them.57% of those surveyed acknowledge that cultural change is more important to becoming a data-driven organisation than overcoming technical challenges1.CEOs cite generative AI adoption as being critical to success, but nearly two-thirds (64%) of surveyed CEOs say their organisation must take advantage of technologies that are changing faster than people can adapt.CEOs indicate the benefits of rapid technology adoption outweigh potential risksMore than two-thirds (68%) of CEOs surveyed agree that governance for generative AI must be established as solutions are designed, rather than after they are deployed.Although 75% of CEOs surveyed say trusted AI is impossible without effective AI governance in their organisation, only 39% say they have good generative AI governance in place today.At the same time, 62% of CEO respondents say they will take more risk than the competition to maintain competitive edge, with half (51%) agreeing that the risk of falling behind is driving them to invest in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value1.67% of surveyed CEOs say the productivity gains from automation are so great that they must accept significant risk to stay competitive.While today 71% of surveyed CEOs are no further than generative AI piloting and experimentation, 49% expect to be driving growth and expansion by 2026.Product and service innovation is a top priority, but a focus on short-term targets might be hindering long-term progressCEOs surveyed ranked product and service innovation as their highest priority for the next three years – up from sixth place in 2023.41% of respondents say they are willing to sacrifice operational efficiency for greater innovation.However, a majority of CEOs surveyed point to a focus on short-term performance as their top barrier to innovation.Today, only 36% of the CEOs surveyed are primarily funding their generative AI investments with net new IT spend, with the remaining 64% reducing other technology spend.To view the full study, including actionable strategies to help organisations navigate the complexity of generative AI adoption, visit:&nbsp;https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/c-suite-study/ceo This article was provided by IBM Malaysia.

Long before the current craze surrounding generative AI (Gen AI), the energy sector employed traditional artificial intelligence through its use of data to identify oil and gas deposits.But the industry sees even greater potential to save money, reduce accidents and lower greenhouse gases through Gen AI, which exponentially increases and diversifies the data that can be analyzed.The new AI programs can also be employed broadly in the workforce instead of being limited to programmers and data analysts, as has been the case with traditional AI.""Extracting this data from the copious amounts of data generated by drilling activities has historically posed a significant challenge for industry leaders,"" recently wrote Tim Hafke, content marketing specialist with AlphaSense. ""That's where Gen AI comes in.""Read alsoApple partners with OpenAI as it unveils 'Apple Intelligence'In recent years the downstream industry, which includes refineries that process crude oil into gasoline, has increasingly relied on so-called digital twins -- computer-modeled replicas of actual facilities.PAY ATTENTION: Work, Family, Education?

Enroll Today!They allow companies to run simulations to assess operational issues in real-life facilities, mitigate potential hazards and do predictive maintenance (PdM).PdM uses historical and current data to project future performance and determine when parts should be taken down for maintenance or replaced.Microsoft vice president Matthew Kerner sees this as an entry point to generative AI, a way ""to explain why the predictive model is making that prediction"" and provide context to better address the situation, he explained during a panel discussion at energy conference CERAWeek.""Gen AI is useful as a bolt on to some other more predictive AI systems,"" Kerner said.Read alsoApple to break AI silence at developers conferenceNext-generation chatbots similar to the world-famous ChatGPT can also be of help for employees on the ground, said Rob McGreevy, of industry software company Aveva, during the panel.The data-filled chatbot could allow oil field or refinery workers encountering a problem to measure atmospheric conditions like humidity and operational performance like wellhead pressure to quickly diagnose the issue, McGreevy said.Getting a detailed report in seconds allows for a quick fix -- saving time and money in the process. 'Less risk' During refinery maintenance, ""you're putting people in dangerous situations to do work. If you can do those turnarounds faster, you're exposing yourself to less risk,"" said Matthew Babin, head of energy and natural resources at software company Palantir Technologies.Gen AI can provide ""context to people who are in the process of making a decision, even if it's outside their area of expertise,"" Babin said.""So if I'm a reservoir engineer, I don't have to know about maintenance, but I do have to know about maintenance when I'm looking at how that resource is going to perform and what that costs my organization,"" Babin added.Read alsoChinese robot developers hope for road out of 'uncanny valley'Petroleum installations are regularly checked or taken offline for upkeep.A Gen AI interface provides ""access to a maintenance manual, so you can look at how maintenance for that piece of kit should be done,"" all laid out in plain English, thanks to a chatbot, McGreevy said.Such a system could also facilitate the repair work itself, taking the guesswork out of such decisions.For example, the technology would allow a company to use a computer model of a facility to determine if there is enough room to use a ladder or install scaffolding, McGreevey said.McGreevy said it could also help new employees: ""I think we can shorten dramatically the time it takes for people coming on board to be proficient to safely operate these facilities at scale.""Greater efficiencies linked to Gen AI also create a chance to reduce an oil facility's carbon footprint. But running the technology also requires huge amounts of electricity, mainly in data centers.PAY ATTENTION: check out news exactly for YOU ➡️  click on “Recommended for you” and enjoy! Source: AFP

We avoid external data sources to maintain objectivity and focus on enhancing user experience ethically. This approach also protects our workforce from potential biases that could be introduced through external data.
How do you measure ROI and success metrics for AI deployments, considering the workforce impact?
Kiran Kumar Katreddi: We tie AI initiatives to business metrics and conduct thorough experimentation before full deployment. Monitoring business metrics alongside control metrics is crucial. We scale up gradually, ensuring positive impacts on business goals while also measuring how AI is affecting employee productivity and satisfaction.
What advice would you give to companies incorporating generative AI, focusing on workforce considerations?
Kiran Kumar Katreddi: Start with small, domain-specific models aligned with business goals. Experiment, measure impact, and scale gradually. Focus on tangible outcomes rather than deploying AI for the sake of it. Ensure a clear understanding of the business metrics you aim to influence. When it comes to your workforce, prioritize upskilling and focus on collaboration between your employees and AI tools.
Could you name some tools Meesho uses for generative AI?
Kiran Kumar Katreddi: We use platforms from Google and Microsoft, along with our in-house ML platform, for for generative AI tasks.
