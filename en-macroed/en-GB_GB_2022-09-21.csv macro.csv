Key Takeaways



                DALL-E and other types of generative AI can produce images that look like photographs, paintings, or drawings that were created by human beings.            


                Generative AI is powered by a computer program called a diffusion model. In simple terms, a diffusion model destroys and recreates images to find statistical patterns in them.            


                The way it operates is not like natural intelligence. We cannot predict how well, or even why, an AI like this works. We can only judge whether its outputs look good.

DALL-E is spooky good. Not so many years ago, it was easy to conclude that AI technologies would never generate anything of a quality approaching human artistic composition or writing. Now, the generative model programs that power DALL-E 2 and Google’s LaMDA chatbot produce images and words eerily like the work of a real person. Dall-E makes artistic or photorealistic images of a variety of objects and scenes.How do these image-generating models work? Do they function like a person, and should we think of them as intelligent?How diffusion models workGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is the bleeding edge of AI technology. The proprietary computer code was developed by the misnomered OpenAI, a Bay Area tech operation which began as a non-profit before turning for-profit and licensing GPT-3 to Microsoft. GPT-3 was built to produce words, but OpenAI tweaked a version to produce DALL-E and its sequel, DALL-E 2, using a technique called diffusion modeling. Diffusion models perform two sequential processes. They ruin images, then they try to rebuild them. Programmers give the model real images with meanings ascribed by humans: dog, oil painting, banana, sky, 1960s sofa, etc. The model diffuses — that is, moves — them through a long chain of sequential steps. In the ruining sequence, each step slightly alters the image handed to it by the previous step, adding random noise in the form of scattershot meaningless pixels, then handing it off to the next step. Repeated, over and over, this causes the original image to gradually fade into static and its meaning to disappear.We cannot predict how well, or even why, an AI like this works. We can only judge whether its outputs look good.When this process is finished, the model runs it in reverse. Starting with the nearly meaningless noise, it pushes the image back through the series of sequential steps, this time attempting to reduce noise and bring back meaning. At each step, the model’s performance is judged by the probability that the less noisy image created at that step has the same meaning as the original, real image.While fuzzing up the image is a mechanical process, returning it to clarity is a search for something like meaning. The model is gradually “trained” by adjusting hundreds of billions of parameters — think of little dimmer switch knobs that adjust a light circuit from fully off to fully on — within neural networks in the code to “turn up” steps that improve the probability of meaningfulness of the image, and to “turn down” steps that do not. Performing this process over and over on many images, tweaking the model parameters each time, eventually tunes the model to take a meaningless image and evolve it through a series of steps into an image that looks like the original input image.To produce images that have associated text meanings, words that describe the training images are taken through the noising and de-noising chains along at the same time. In this way, the model is trained not only to produce an image with a high likelihood of meaning, but with a high likelihood of the same descriptive words being associated with it. The creators of DALL-E trained it on a giant swath of pictures, with associated meanings, culled from all over the web. DALL-E can produce images that correspond to such a weird range of input phrases because that’s what was on the internet.These images were created using the generative AI called Stable Diffusion, which is similar to DALL-E. The prompt used to generate the images: “color photo of abraham lincoln drinking beer in front of the seattle space needle with taylor swift.” Taylor Swift came out a little creepy in the first image, but maybe this is what she looks like to Abraham Lincoln after a few beers. (Credit: Big Think, Stable Diffusion)
The inner workings of a diffusion model are complex. Despite the organic feel of its creations, the process is entirely mechanical, built upon a foundation of probability calculations. (This paper works through some of the equations. Warning: The math is hard.)Essentially, the math is about breaking difficult operations down into separate, smaller, and simpler steps that are nearly as good but much faster for computers to work through. The mechanisms of the code are understandable, but the system of tweaked parameters that its neural networks pick up in the training process is complete gibberish. A set of parameters that produces good images is indistinguishable from a set that creates bad images — or nearly perfect images with some unknown but fatal flaw. Thus, we cannot predict how well, or even why, an AI like this works. We can only judge whether its outputs look good.Are generative AI models intelligent?It’s very hard to say, then, how much DALL-E is like a person. The best answer is probably not at all. Humans don’t learn or create in this way. We don’t take in sensory data of the world and then reduce it to random noise; we also don’t create new things by starting with total randomness and then de-noising it. Towering linguist Noam Chomsky pointed out that a generative model like GPT-3 does not produce words in a meaningful language any differently from how it would produce words in a meaningless or impossible language. In this sense, it has no concept of the meaning of language, a fundamentally human trait.These images were created using the generative AI called Stable Diffusion, which is similar to DALL-E. The prompt used to generate the images: “portrait of conan obrien in the style of vincent van gogh.” (Credit: Big Think, Stable Diffusion)
Even if they are not like us, are they intelligent in some other way? In the sense that they can do very complex things, sort of. Then again, a computer-automated lathe can create highly complex metal parts. By the definition of the Turing Test (that is, determining if its output is indistinguishable from that of a real person), it certainly might be. Then again, extremely simplistic and hollow chat robot programs have done this for decades. Yet, no one thinks that machine tools or rudimentary chatbots are intelligent.A better intuitive understanding of current generative model AI programs may be to think of them as extraordinarily capable idiot mimics. They’re like a parrot that can listen to human speech and produce not only human words, but groups of words in the right pattens. If a parrot listened to soap operas for a million years, it could probably learn to string together emotionally overwrought, dramatic interpersonal dialog. If you spent those million years giving it crackers for finding better sentences and yelling at it for bad ones, it might get better still.

Or consider another analogy. DALL-E is like a painter who lives his whole life in a gray, windowless room. You show him millions of landscape paintings with the names of the colors and subjects attached. Then you give him paint with color labels and ask him to match the colors and to make patterns statistically mimicking the subject labels. He makes millions of random paintings, comparing each one to a real landscape, and then alters his technique until they start to look realistic. However, he could not tell you one thing about what a real landscape is.Another way to gain insight into diffusion models is to look at the images produced by a simpler one. DALL-E 2 is the most sophisticated of its kind. Version one of DALL-E often produced images that were nearly correct, but clearly not quite, such as dragon-giraffes whose wings did not properly attach to their bodies. A less powerful open source competitor is known for producing unsettling images that are dream-like and bizarre and not quite realistic. The flaws inherent in a diffusion model’s meaningless statistical mashups are not hidden like those in the far more polished DALL-E 2.The future of generative AIWhether you find it wondrous or horrifying, it appears that we have just entered an age in which computers can generate convincing fake images and sentences. It’s bizarre that a picture with meaning to a person can be generated from mathematical operations on nearly meaningless statistical noise. While the machinations are lifeless, the result looks like something more. We’ll see whether DALL-E and other generative models evolve into something with a deeper sort of intelligence, or if they can only be the world’s greatest idiot mimics.

But management and technology experts Thomas Davenport and Steven Miller argue that AI is not a job destroyer — no matter what other predictions might say. Yes, AI and intelligent technology will take over some jobs, but that will free up workers to do more challenging and important work.

Tom and Steven recently completed a book on this topic called Working with AI: Real Stories of Human-Machine Collaboration, and I got the chance to speak with them about their predictions for how AI will fit in with the workplaces of the future.

Here’s How AI Is Augmenting Humans in the Workplace
When I asked Tom and Steven for some examples of AI-augmented work, they brought up several innovative examples.
Morgan Stanley’s wealth management business unit is using machine learning to make customized investment predictions, similar to the way Netflix uses predictive technology in the entertainment world. Wealth managers who use the system are not only more productive, but also have happier, more satisfied clients.

How Will AI Impact the Future of the Workplace?
I asked Tom and Steven about the overall impact of AI in the workplace of the future, and they shared several important trends they’re seeing.
“People will need to embrace digital and intelligent technologies if they’re going to be successful in their jobs,” Tom shared. “I worked with a radiologist in the Boston area who also has a Ph.D. in AI. And he kept saying, ‘The only radiologists who are gonna lose their jobs to AI are those who refuse to work with AI.’”
They were quick to mention that “embracing digital and intelligent technologies” doesn’t mean everyone has to understand the mechanisms of machine learning or be able to build underlying DevOps platforms. People simply need to understand how to use the tools and understand how AI can help them perform their work.
Tom also predicted that AI is unlikely to be able to compete with humans in contextual understanding — at least, not anytime soon. One of his favorite examples is the online personal styling company StitchFix.
“AI helps create styling recommendations for customers, but they also have human stylists…the customer sends in notes sometimes about the context of their clothing needs. They’ll say, ‘I’m going to a wedding and my ex will be there” and the computers don’t understand that yet. Humans will be able to pick out an alluring dress for the woman to wear.”
Tom and Steven found a number of cases where AI can take the first swipe at solving a problem, but a company still needs a human to pull it all together, revise it, review it, and potentially override the AI’s answers.
Steven also mentions the fact that AI is only a small part of the monumental changes that will happen in workplaces. “It takes a village to change a job with AI,” he says. “You need a lot of job roles across many different departments that have to be brought into alignment and coordination…these systems don’t materialize overnight.”

AI Doesn’t Have to Kill Jobs — But Companies Must Be Ready
As jobs get augmented, amplified, and transformed, Steven and Tom both encourage companies to create thoughtful strategies about where the technology is going, and what kinds of skills and capabilities are needed.
Understanding what work will be done by digital workers, what needs to be done by human beings, and how the two will relate will be the key to maintaining a competitive edge in the marketplace of the future.

 Since its emergence, artificial intelligence (AI) has crept into technology, changing everything we know about computers. Artificial intelligence refers to the programming of computers to think like humans. If you have ever used an automated program, there’s every possibility that it was AI in action. 







 Interestingly, the workplace structure is not exempted from its influence. Although hazy, AI has greatly impacted your work without you realizing it. This article outlines seven exciting ways you use AI at work that you didn’t know about. Keep reading to find out. 


 1. Spam Filters 
 Spam filters serve as an email security measure against cyber danger. Most email services like Gmail have a section dedicated to junk mail, where spam messages are sent. These emails can fill up your inboxes and distract you from the real work, so they are better off discarded. If you have ever had this experience, that was artificial intelligence. 

 In addition, most malware and viruses that threaten data security at the workplace are sometimes introduced using emails. Using spam filters is one of the ways to stop spam emails, especially for Gmail users. They sort through messages by assessing them against certain criteria, including campaign metadata, IP address, content and format, and codes. 





 Furthermore, these filters measure the level of spam using a spam score, which is the major determinant of what message goes to the inbox or is discarded as junk. Spam filters involve a lot of technicalities, but once it is launched, it automates themselves regularly. 



 2. Chatbots 
    

 As workplace technology expands, there are creative ways to relate with customers. One of them is the AI chatbots. If you work for an organization with an influx of customers, using chatbots to interact with them, especially outside of business hours, is an easy way to communicate with them. This scenario is a perfect example of artificial intelligence in action. 






 Chatbots are automated programs that respond to queries or questions of online users in the manner of a real human conversation. These bots work without human assistants and are coded with predetermined questions and likely answers. 

 AI chatbots work seamlessly with no direct human assistance as long as these queries are asked in natural language. Platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and Facebook Messenger use chatbots to respond quickly to customers. They act more like autoresponders, after which a real human worker may take it up. 



 3. Autocorrect 
 Autocorrect is an AI feature that acts beyond a word editor. It identifies mistakes, uses algorithms to state the correct words, and edits them accordingly. Autocorrect works similarly to an auto-suggestion keyboard by completing the words you want to type. However, this time it corrects the misspellings as you type. 






 You may have applied an autocorrect feature at work that spell-checks as you draft a company email or an official document. A good example is the Microsoft Word editor with the autocorrect feature. If you learn to use Microsoft Editor effectively, you'll enjoy its autocorrect capabilities that help you edit and correct misspellings as you type. 

 Grammarly editor also comes with an autocorrect option and uses an AI algorithm to detect the tone and mistakes as you write. Grammarly interprets words in natural human language and has an inbuilt glossary list it refers to as you write. Other tools that also use autocorrect are Gmail Autocorrect and Quillbot. 



 4. Natural Language Queries in Excel 
 Natural language queries in Excel help you analyze data smarter and faster by using Artificial intelligence to answer all data questions you may have. It compares figures and statistics, filters and sorts through them, providing answers in the form of graphs and charts. 






 Natural language queries use machine learning and natural language processing, which are subfields of AI, to interpret data and summarize them in whatever format you choose. This feature is an excellent data analytics tool and maintains a high level of accuracy due to AI integration. 



 5. Sales Assistant Software 
    

 Sales and marketing teams harness the power of sales assistant software to carry out sales routines and automate certain tasks for a smoother operation. This AI software uses machine learning, natural learning processing, and conversational technology to optimize daily tasks. Examples of this software include the HubSpot sales hub and ZoomInfo sales hub. 






 So every time you conversed or interacted with a sales assistant software, that was artificial intelligence, and you would notice how natural it is. Aside from conversational technology, these tools also use AI to perform tasks like data entry, data collection, and qualifying prospective customers. 



 6. Search and Recommendation Algorithms 
 Artificial intelligence powers search and recommendations. In addition to AI helping you search better, these algorithms display options according to your preferences. On this basis, e-commerce brands market products and services to customers. 

 If you’re a merchant on Amazon, you would understand the place of adding keywords to product descriptions and listings. These search algorithms read through your keywords to find out if they are a perfect match for a search query, and this same principle works for recommendations. 

 Recommendation algorithms help to display products related to what the user wants. AI works in the background to filter through these queries, making it a powerful tool for e-commerce brands. 







 7. Robocalls 
 Robocalls are pre-recorded calls that are used to pass emergency information or used by companies to sell to customers. The technological advancement in robocalling makes this software sound more human and has the intelligence to answer questions from customers in a matter of seconds. 

 These robocalls even go as far as pausing between thoughts like an actual human, so you don’t suspect a thing. These tools have been a breakthrough for companies that want to reach a larger audience through calls. However, a legal order must exist before any company can use this. The basic fact is that robocalls work purely by artificial intelligence. 



 Artificial Intelligence Is Changing the Future of Workplaces 
 As the years go by, the workplace will implement more automated processes. That means AI will power more software and processes. The increase in AI technology improves the value of work and changes the type of skill sets required in the workplace. 






 Although there are concerns about how AI may adversely affect workplace culture or how machines would displace humans in the workplace, these are merely myths surrounding its use. AI is not yet developed to displace the need for humans in the workplace. Instead, they ease the work process for people.

Should artificial intelligence be used in art competitions?





By Reece Goodall
Sep. 22, 2022Posted in Arts




As artificial intelligence continues to advance, there are increased questions about its capabilities and the ethics surrounding them. Should AI have rights in any way similar to our own human rights? Can we trust AI to make calls on medical decisions, or use it in warfare? And, indeed, can AI produce art? It may seem a silly question, but an AI artbot just beat a number of human artists in a competition, and the quality of its work was plausible enough to fool human judges. There was a negative backlash to the story, and it lit the fuse on a debate about whether AI can be an artist.
This discussion was prompted by a competition at the Colorado State Fair. In the fine arts show, artist Jason Allen entered a piece called Théâtre D’opéra Spatial. It’s a sci-fi fantasy scene, in which a number of women in period dress look through a large circular portal in the centre of the frame. Allen took the top prize, and then it emerged that the artist had created his artwork using the Discord-based AI art generator Midjourney. He then upscaled the image, using AI Gigapixel, in order to put it on canvas.
Allen entered the work in the ‘digital art’ category, which refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process”. He also stated that he used Midjourney to create his image when he entered the contest; thus, the judges ruled that he was in line with the rules. A spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Agriculture added that the two judges did not know what Midjourney was at the time, but that they would have awarded the prize to Allen regardless.
AI may be the future of art
As always, negative comments abounded on Twitter. One user wrote: “This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics.” Another said: “This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’. AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.” Allen responded to some of the comments by speaking to the New York Times. He said he wasn’t going to apologise because he didn’t break the rules, and then suggested that AI may be the future of art: “The ethics isn’t in the technology. It’s in the people. This isn’t going to stop. Art is dead, dude. It’s over. AI won. Humans lost.”
As provocative as the statement may be, it is also true that technology required a human to manipulate it. Although art-generating AI now exists in various states of sophistication, Allen didn’t just type in ‘sci-fi art’ or whatever and get a prize-winning piece back. He clarified that he spent weeks generating hundreds of images and fine-tuning them until he produced three that he liked enough to submit to the competition. This has been debated, however. The Artist John Lewis tested Midjourney to try and reproduce something similar to the award-winning work, and he said it took “about ten seconds”.
To claim the user is an artist, or that there is any real skill involved in using it is a bit misleading
He said: “Midjourney is a text-based generator but the user doesn’t really have a great deal of control over the output. It’s more of a random image generator, albeit with some really cool art styles built in. You can guide it but you can’t control it or fine tune it. Midjourney is a lot of fun, and as a quick ideas generator it’s great, certainly just as useful as a Google image search, but to claim the user is an artist, or that there is any real skill involved in using it is a bit misleading.”
There is an argument that AI is a tool, just as paintbrushes and charcoal and sculpting tools are all tools for creating art. Allen certainly argues so: “Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognise that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it.” There have been plenty of historical examples of people doing something new with new technologies to produce art, and ultimately the very subjectivity of art means we can’t say whether it counts or not.

Drug development is expensive, time consuming, and risky. A typical new drug costs billions of dollars to develop and requires more than ten years of work — yet only about 0.02% of the drugs in development ever making it to market. 
Some claim that AI, or artificial intelligence, will revolutionize drug development by ushering in much shorter development times and drastically lower costs. Many scientists and business consultants are especially optimistic about AI's ability to predict the shapes of nearly every known protein using DeepMind's AlphaFold, an artificial intelligence tool developed by Google parent company Alphabet; predicting this information with great detail would be key to quickly developing drugs. As one  AI company boasts, ""We … firmly believe that AI has the potential to transform the drug discovery process to achieve time and cost efficiencies."" 
That kind of rhetoric might be dismissed as typical fake-it-til-you-make-it puffery. But the Washington Post, a presumably neutral observer, has promoted this narrative, too. ""New research on proteins promises drug breakthroughs, and much else,"" said one op-ed that they ran. The New York Times concurred in a similar article titled ""We Need to Talk About How Good A.I. Is Getting."" One thing is certainly true: ""Investors bet on AI start-ups to turbocharge drug development,"" as the Financial Times reported.Advertisement:

Artificial intelligence research may have hit a dead end


Moderna claims that AI computer simulations helped analyze genetic sequence data in an ""optimal way."" Never mind that the ""optimal"" anything is seldom known. In addition, most of the time and effort involved in drug development is not spent in computer simulations, but in clinical trials — a highly uncertain and risky process that isn't made faster or less expensive by artificial intelligence algorithms. A Nature article titled ""The lightning-fast quest for COVID vaccines—and what it means for other diseases"" doesn't even mention AI among the reasons for the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines. Instead, it emphasizes that,

The world was able to develop COVID-19 vaccines so quickly because of years of previous research on related viruses and faster ways to manufacture vaccines, enormous funding that allowed firms to run multiple trials in parallel, and regulators moving more quickly than normal. Some of those factors might translate to other vaccine efforts, particularly speedier manufacturing platforms.

Determined to get a COVID-19 vaccine to the public before the November 3, 2020, presidential election, the U.S. government devoted $14 billion to support the pharmaceutical companies' vaccine efforts. The government agreed to pay Pfizer $5.87 billion for 300 million doses if Pfizer developed an FDA-approved vaccine — regardless of whether the vaccine was still needed. Moderna was given $954 million for research and development and a guaranteed $4.94 billion federal purchase of 300 million doses. Johnson & Johnson was given $456 million for research and development and promised $1 billion for 100 million doses.

The relative unimportance of AI in COVID development is consistent with the conclusion of many scientists that AI is not about to revolutionize drug development. The biggest problem is that clinical trials are the longest and typically most expensive part of the process, and AI cannot replace actual trials. Even AI's impact on drug discovery may be limited. A Science op-ed recently argued that, ""[AI] doesn't make as much difference to drug discovery as many stories and press releases have had it…. Protein structure prediction is a hard problem, but even harder ones remain.""Advertisement:

The data deluge has made the number of promising-but-coincidental patterns waiting to be discovered far, far larger than the number of useful relationships — which means that the probability that a discovered pattern is truly useful is very close to zero.

An often crucial part of drug development is to determine whether a drug binds to the candidate protein, something that MIT researchers have shown that AlphaFold cannot do and DeepMind admits AlphaFold can't do: ""Predicting drug binding is probably one of the most difficult tasks in biology: these are many-atom interactions between complex molecules with many potential conformations, and the aim of docking is to pinpoint just one of them.""Advertisement:
Likewise, the CEO of drug company Verseon is deeply skeptical:

People are saying, ""AI will solve everything."" They give you fancy words. ""We'll ingest all of this longitudinal data and we'll do latitudinal analysis."" It's all garbage. It's just hype.

One huge hurdle for all AI data mining algorithms is that the data deluge has made the number of promising-but-coincidental patterns waiting to be discovered far, far larger than the number of useful relationships — which means that the probability that a discovered pattern is truly useful is very close to zero. Verseon's CEO says that the total number of possible chemical compounds in the universe is on the order of 10 to the 33rd power. Companies cannot do clinical trials on every possible compound, nor can they rely on AI to find needles in this enormous haystack.
It will take real intelligence — not artificial intelligence — to determine which compounds are most likely to generate payoffs that justify the enormous costs of testing. Likewise, it will take real intelligence — not artificial intelligence — to conduct the clinical trials needed to gauge the efficacy and possible side effects.Advertisement:

Nigel Cannings



					 CTO, Intelligent Voice				




September 22, 2022




 





Although AI is undoubtedly revolutionizing the world as a versatile technology implemented in many important sectors, it can only act on the information used to train it. This opens the door for human bias, here’s how can we de-bias AI, says Nigel Cannings, CEO of Intelligent Voice.
Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the world as a dynamic tool across many important sectors. From medical and financial services to recruitment profiling, this versatile technology plays a leading role in our decision-making. 
It can’t, however, think like a human and can only act on the information used to train it. Ironically, this can also open the way for human bias to manifest itself negatively. So, what is the issue with bias in AI, and what can we do to combat the problem?
Fairness and Transparency
Aside from ease, one of the primary selling points of AI in sectors such as recruitment and HR, was the perception that as a “machine”, artificial intelligence is inherently free from bias. Thus it would make it easier for businesses to achieve diversity goals while removing the risk of racism, sexism, and ageism from core human resources management systems. But all was not as it originally seemed. Systemic bias found its way into AI. Why? Because, like all tech, it was created and populated by humans. 
Consequently, it has become increasingly vital that debiasing becomes a watchword in the field and is acted upon by everyone who values fairness and transparency. Making debiasing an invaluable step in the training process. Why? Because we know inputting the wrong data can produce harmful results, damaging not only any business or organization but also individuals in the workplace.
Taking a recruitment example, there have been multiple instances – even in embarrassingly high-profile companies, such as Amazon – where algorithms were previously trained that favored young white men while excluding women and people of color. This was not deliberate but an unfortunate artifact of the training data, based on an unconscious hiring policy that favored certain groups of people. This is literal systemic sexism and racism in action, showing how AI can inadvertently lead to discrimination through thoughtless training. And this is why there needs to be more focus on debiasing these systems.
However, we need to understand the basics of how AI networks decide before we can begin to solve the problem of bias.
The Basics of AI
Machines can now detect cancer in an X-Ray when the most methodical of professionals might have been unable to see the problem. However, AI can only achieve this because a human has previously labeled hundreds of X-Rays as having come from an individual who has either developed or does not have the disease.
Human involvement is the key to the basics of AI. Professionals work to input data to train AI to sift through the right data to make decisions. And often, the results are outstanding. The difficulty is finding ways to input that data without also inputting the potential for bias. 
Staying with the medical model, a recent discovery is that this same technology could identify the race of patients based on an X-Ray when professionals offered the same data could not. While this may not be misused per se, it shows how discrimination can easily creep into AI models.
Everyday People
Let’s take another example with a crucial bearing on people’s everyday lives involving often controversial Universal Credit. The Department of Work and Pensions has cited its intention to use AI to assess who should and should not receive the benefit.
Although this is all in line with 21st-century technology, they have yet to announce more detail on the proposed new system, which brings questions about this technology to light. What data will they use? Will people be heavily profiled? What model of personal information will they feed the software?
Where is the transparency despite Freedom of Information requests from the media? Get this wrong, and lives could easily be ruined. 
Rights on Automated Decisions
It’s important to remember that the EU’s data protection regulation GDPR states that everyone has a right to have automated decisions explained, so a benefits system that cannot do this is illegal and unethical.
‘The point is any pre-existing biases from the creator will be trained into the software, possibly leading to catastrophic results. AI is in essence trained by human thought processes.’ 
See More: The Ethics of AI in HR: What Does It Take to Build an AI Ethics Framework?
How Do We debias?
We use what’s termed “labeled data”, linked to a specific category to train AI models. This could be an image, for example, or in terms of a selection process, a successful and unsuccessful candidates’ CVs. It is possible to use “semi-supervised” training to reduce the amount of human labeling, but this greatly increases the amount of data that has to be used to show an AI model of how the world works. And if the data is not carefully curated, this can quickly lead to unwelcome results.
 Recent advances in Large Language Models such as GPT-3 and BlenderBot mean that machines can mimic human-like interactions. But because the model is more parrot than human, it leads to “speech” that can be racist, homophobic, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic, or just plain wrong.
Explainable AI is Key
To prevent this, we need ‘Explainable AI’, a system asking the software why it came to a certain decision and what it based results on. “XAI” is quickly growing as an area of research.
We can train models that “tell” us why they have reached a decision, or we can trick “black-box” models into revealing how they reached a conclusion. However, if we can’t explain why a system makes a decision, we can never work out how to correct the data it is trained on.
When we use AI correctly, it can be without question one of the most incredible concepts of our times. This can only be done if we maintain the debiasing approach.

In what might be a first, a New York-based artist named Kris Kashtanova has received US copyright registration on their graphic novel that features AI-generated artwork created by latent diffusion AI, according to their Instagram feed and confirmed through a public records search by Ars Technica.
The registration, effective September 15, applies to a comic book called Zarya of the Dawn. Kashtanova created the artwork for Zarya using Midjourney, a commercial image synthesis service. In their post announcing the news from Tuesday, Kashtanova wrote:Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

I got Copyright from the Copyright Office of the USA on my Ai-generated graphic novel. I was open how it was made and put Midjourney on the cover page. It wasn’t altered in any other way. Just the way you saw it here.
I tried to make a case that we do own copyright when we make something using AI. I registered it as visual arts work. My certificate is in the mail and I got the number and a confirmation today that it was approved.
My friend lawyer gave me this idea and I decided to make a precedent.
Going by their announcement, Kashtanova approached the registration by saying the artwork was AI-assisted and not created entirely by the AI. Kashtanova wrote the comic book story, created the layout, and made artistic choices to piece the images together. Ars VideoHow Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror
It's likely that artists have registered works created by machine or algorithms before because the history of generative art extends back to the 1960s. But this is the first time we know of that an artist has registered a copyright for art created by the recent round of image synthesis models powered by latent diffusion, which has been a contentious subject among artists.
Further ReadingFearing copyright issues, Getty Images bans AI-generated artwork
Speculation about whether AI artwork can be copyrighted has been the subject of many articles over the past few months, and just yesterday, we wrote about Getty Images banning AI-generated artwork on its site over unresolved issues about copyright and ethics issues.
Despite popular misconception (explained in the Getty piece), the US Copyright Office has not ruled against copyright on AI artworks. Instead, it ruled out copyright registered to an AI as the author instead of a human.
Zarya of the Dawn, which features a main character with an uncanny resemblance to the actress Zendaya, is available for free through the AI Comic Books website. AI artists often use celebrity names in their prompts to achieve consistency between images, since there are many celebrity photographs in the data set used to train Midjourney.

Experts, however, have raised doubts on how such a policy would work through the stark digital divide..United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has listed 10 policy recommendations in its report released September 20, 2022. It recommended AI to accelerate progress toward the fourth Goal of Sustainable Development. .Sustainable Development Goal 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all..2022 State of the Education Report (SOER) for India: Artificial Intelligence in Education — Here, There and Everywhere has policy recommendations to guide the Indian government, which has identified education as one of the five major areas for using AI-driven technology..AI applications are increasingly becoming common in India, with its recent development and impacts on many fields, including education, said Joyce Poan, programme specialist and chief of education for UNESCO New Delhi. . Read more: How much loss have we seen in child education during the pandemic?.The UN body recommended that Indian stakeholders adopt techniques to eliminate biases, like gender, in algorithms — which are primarily developed in the Global North. .“Biases are directly related to the data fed into the programme, which is often influenced by preconceived human stereotypes and prejudices,” Poan explained during the press conference September 20, 2022..Transparency is essential to achieving neutrality, said Krishnashree Achutan, dean of postgraduate programmes from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, a private deemed university based in Coimbatore. “There should be regulatory bodies that help us validate these AI-based products,” she added..Experts, however, believe the policy recommendations are abstract.`.“These have a feel-good factor for policymakers. I don’t think this means anything at the ground level,” Aniket Sule, associate professor at the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, told Down To Earth..Further, questions were also raised on whether AI can help schools that lack basic infrastructure..“AI has a marginal role to play as it can only help the upper-middle class strata of the society,” Soumitro Banerjee, professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, told DTE..You cannot visualise these recommendations applying to the children of farmers and labourers, he added..The recommendations listed by the UN body include prioritising the ethics of AI in education; providing an overall regulatory framework and creating effective public-private partnerships, other than eliminating bias, including ones of gender, in algorithms. .Ensuring technology access to teachers and students and expanding AI literacy efforts to inform people about the benefits and risks of the technology were some of the other recommendations. .UNESCO also suggested improving public trust, requesting the private sector to include students and educationists in developing AI-based tools, placing ownership of data with the students and embracing the versatility of AI in education systems.. Read more: COVID-19: Access to devices a must for bridging the digital divide.AI ethics, which cover data privacy and ownership, algorithmic fairness and biases, are particularly relevant in education, according to UNESCO. This is because algorithms are built from data often owned by private companies, which can lead to undesirable consequences, it warned..Though UNESCO suggested the technology has the scope to deliver quality content to remote locations, Sule asked if private players are ready to invest in rural hinterlands lacking computers or basic infrastructure..Many of the policy recommendations are abstract. For instance, the meaning of “creating effective public-private partnership” is not clear either. .Further, the report highlighted that AI could help address some challenges in the Indian education system, such as socio-economic inequities, gender inequalities, insufficient teachers and inadequate teaching quality, high drop-out rates, linguistic barriers and the digital divide, the report read..But Banerjee questioned how AI could address the digital divide..The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in 2020 exposed the divide as it drove school drop-out rates in India..Closing of 1.5 million schools during the pandemic impacted 247 million children enrolled in elementary and secondary schools, according to UNICEF. Only one in four children has access to digital devices and internet connectivity, said a press statement from the United Nations body. .There are other issues too. The country is far from benefiting from one application of AI: Enabling personalised student assessment, Sule also pointed out..Technology could help teachers track learning outcomes and assess the competencies of individual students in real-time, the report said. It can identify individual strengths, weaknesses, knowledge levels and learning speed, it added.. Read more: Developing economies risk exclusion as ‘age of AI’ dawns.For example, this technology can train students based on their learning ability. “We are far from attaining this level of engagement in India,” Sule said, adding that initiatives will require a lot of investments in research and development..He also added that more research is needed to vet the efficiency of AI before putting it to use in schools. “We have seen many Ed-Tech companies selling inferior products,” Sule said, adding that parents are often unaware of such issues..The government is likely to buy products based on cost-benefit analysis. “So, who is going to vet the quality?” he asked..Instead, Banerjee added that the emphasis should be on developing a curriculum that enables critical thinking among students and improving basic infrastructure in schools.","{'@type': 'WebPage', 'url': 'https://www.downtoearth.org.in/science-technology/unesco-bats-for-more-ai-in-indian-education-will-it-work--85035', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://gumlet.assettype.com/down-to-earth/import/library/large/2022-09-21/0.04795200_1663740257_school.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675'}}",,

But there has been a lot of research, debate, and criticism about how to create the best computer language to raise the bar for artificial intelligence. Many respected tech-science circles have recently been abuzz with rumors that NASA has made a remarkable finding about a programming language for artificial intelligence. Sanskrit, an ancient Hindu language, is thought by NASA to be the best language for creating computer code for their Artificial Intelligence program..Sanskrit has long been regarded as a significant language in academic circles. Despite having a long history, the language retains certain remarkable qualities that are valued in a variety of professions. Additionally, it is employed in psychological treatment sessions and for spiritual healing. But its recent work with artificial intelligence is an honor, demonstrating its strength as a worthwhile field of writing. Early Indian mathematics and science were conducted in Sanskrit, which has a long history. Sanskrit's rule-based, formula-based, and logical syntax makes it an excellent choice for writing algorithms..Sanskrit's grammar also makes it appropriate for artificial intelligence and machine learning. The idea of employing Sanskrit to create artificially intelligent computers is exciting for both historians and common people since it creatively mines the past to provide answers for the future..NASA's connection to Sanskrit is not new. It all started in 1985 when a study report was published in the spring issue of Artificial Intelligence magazine by a NASA associate scientist. (Page 1 of Volume 6). The scientist's name was Rick Briggs, and his research was titled &quot;Knowledge Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence&quot; in Vedic Science. The argument made in the paper was that natural languages are the greatest choice for converting into a computer program for robotic control and artificial intelligence. Sanskrit is one of the human languages studied in depth in the research since it is one of the most conducive to computer approaches..There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which was a spoken language for about a thousand years and had a sizable body of literature all on its own. Along with important literary works, there was a lengthy legacy of philosophy and grammar that persisted unabatedly into the twenty-first century. Their grammar experts came up with a way of paraphrasing Sanskrit that is identical to modern Artificial Intelligence work both in spirit and in form. – Sanskrit language statement by Rick Briggs..Despite the favorable results, several difficulties need to be taken into account. The first is that all natural languages are ambiguous, which implies that any word in a sentence might have multiple interpretations. The challenge is to translate the language so that it becomes less ambiguous and more literal so that robots with artificial intelligence can grasp it. Although it is challenging for AI, linguistic analysis accuracy is a crucial aspect. Sanskrit, however, appears to be more appropriate than other languages for still another reason. The literal meaning of each word and sentence is now clearer because of the rigid grammar standards, syllable counts, and word choice. This significantly lowers the proportion of abstract meanings in the languages..Shortly, NASA may make a ground-breaking discovery in this area. The NASA Sanskrit connection is a real one that is backed up by a ton of evidence and assertions. Even though there is no official announcement from NASA, it is evident that Sanskrit and other natural languages are important to their approach to artificial intelligence..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
