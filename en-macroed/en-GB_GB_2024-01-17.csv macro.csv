“Generative AI is likely the most significant change to work since the agricultural and industrial revolutions.”

Well, hold that thought, please. This statement out of Accenture’s latest report on the workforce in 2024 may be just a tad over the top, since we’ve been hearing similar pronouncements about work since the dawn of the information revolution in the early 1980s. But there’s little doubt that AI will substantially alter and assist the way work is performed and delivered. Call it the latest phase in the ongoing information revolution.


The question is how exactly AI will transform work as we’ve known it, and how people will be affected. For starters, AI, as with all other technologies to come along over the decades, is seen as something being pushed down the throats of workers.

Just the opposite is true with generative AI, however. Just about all workers Accenture surveyed, 95%, see value in working with the technology.

But employees don’t trust the way their organizations will handle AI — for example, 60% are concerned about job loss, stress and burnout associated with the technology.
PROMOTED
In contrast, fewer than one-third of C-suite executives, 29%, feel job displacement is a worry for their people. There is “a disconnect between workers and C-suite leaders as organizations look to capitalize on the promise of generative AI,” according to Ellyn Shook and Paul Daugherty, the report’s authors.
Both executives and employees need to prepare for the broader sweep AI will take in the near future—and again, its ultimate impact on work is an unknown. All the business leaders surveyed—100%—anticipate changes to their workforce such as growing or reducing headcount and implementing plans to reskill, the survey confirms.

Things have been moving fast—perhaps too fast for business leaders. “Gen AI took a few hours at most to capture the world’s attention,” Shook and Daugherty stated. “Gen AI’s swift adoption by enterprises and individuals alike underscores its ability to reinvent work, reshape the workforce and prepare people for a future that unfolds in real time.”

While the current generation of AI has addressed relatively narrow tasks and roles, the next phase will focus on “redesigning processes across organizations, as well as how people experience work,” Shook and Daugherty stated. However, two-thirds of executives admit they do not yet have the right skills and capabilities needed to carry out such reinvention.
Plus, executives don’t trust that their workers are ready for AI—36% believe workers will not fully embrace generative AI due to a lack of technological understanding, the survey shows. Yet most workers (82%) believe they grasp the technology, and 94% are confident they can develop the needed skills.
In addition, while more than half of workers, 53%, are concerned about the quality of output of generative AI, only 21% of C-suite leaders say trusting the quality of output is a concern for their people.
The growth of AI needs to be a collaborative, user-guided, human-guided process. Companies in the survey successfully taking the lead with generative AI—9% of the sample—“are breaking out of silos and building trust among their people by actively involving them in redesigning their work and roles.” Plus, these leaders who put people first—supported by AI—could create $10.3 trillion in global economic value.
Accenture based its insights on economic modeling of data related to gen AI, along with surveys of more than 7,000 C-suite executives and 5,000 workers at large organizations.
A people-first approach has yet to percolate through corporate ranks. While 95% of workers are ready and willing to embrace generative AI, only 5% of organizations are providing training at scale. The emphasis needs to be on “increasing people’s proficiency, and level of comfort, with the technology,” Shook and Daugherty urged.
Three likely scenarios are now emerging that may determine AI’s ultimate impact on work in the latter half of the 2020s decade:


The aggressive adoption scenario: Organizations will focus “entirely on cutting costs through gen AI, adopting the technology quickly (full adoption within five years), and displacing talent at a high rate. Displaced talent would transition to jobs similar to the ones they held, roles of equal likelihood for displacement, resulting in increased unemployment.”
The cautious adoption scenario: Organizations will focus on “automating and augmenting work with gen AI, adopting the technology slowly and cautiously to avoid displacing talent (full adoption within the next 15 years), but without a focus on creating people-centric approaches and organizations.”
The people-centric adoption scenario: Organizations will focus on “augmenting work with gen AI, while also leveraging automation use cases effectively. As they adopt the technology at a moderate pace (fully within 10 years), talent displacement is ultimately low because effort is placed on creating people-centric approaches and organizations to support both existing workers whose jobs are changing, and new workers displaced due to automation and moving into new roles.”


More than half of the forward-looking leaders in the survey—who ascribe to the people-centric scenario—are taking action to reshape the workforce by redesigning jobs and roles around generative AI. Three-quarters are enabling their workers to help shape these new ways of working.
These leading companies are twice as likely to invest in growing people’s soft skills, along with tech skills, and twice as likely to anticipate workforce productivity gains of 20% or more in the next three years, Accenture predicted.

Quantifying humanity’s impact on global warming – and establishing measurable goals to reduce that impact – often seems like the easy part. Understanding where and how to take action can prove more challenging. Through AI (Artificial Intelligence) and innovation, organizations are transforming the way we solve the climate crisis, radically changing the way we design, deliver and deploy the things that humans create – buildings, infrastructure, machinery, consumer products and more. However, for organizations to truly benefit from the value of AI, we need people with the right skills to harness its value and bring it to bear against the climate crisis. And we must bring the industry along, showing the value of AI through repeatable outcomes that lower emissions and lower costs. AI reinforces the criticality of upskilling, reskilling and training the future global workforce. Just as the pandemic changed how we work, AI is disrupting how we view the workforce.Have you read?Why a digital and AI-first approach is the fastest path to net-zero buildingsAI will be a hot topic at Davos 2024 – here’s what the experts are sayingThe promise of AIAs part of a broader ecosystem of innovation, AI delivers significant possibilities for carbon-reduction and sustainability applications. It can unlock more meaningful and business-specific insights and trend analysis. It can create — through generative applications that produce content such as designs, reports and forecasts. And it can do real work — autonomously executing business processes and controlling systems while learning and adding to its own intelligence. All these capabilities will be essential for creating and operating more sustainable buildings and other human-made environments – for helping us take more intelligent action and to do so more efficiently and effectively. But AI alone cannot create a net zero world and solve the climate crisis. Humans will need to combine AI with other technology to move the needle faster. We will need to integrate it with IoT (Internet of Things), digital twin, metaverse technologies and other emerging applications to create a deeper impact and accelerate action. Bringing together all these technologies requires new insights and action on multiple fronts. But the real need in the future will be reskilling and upskilling our workforce. From software engineers to field technicians, generative AI is becoming a core part of Johnson Controls’ operation — it’s being used in everything from developing new technology to predicting and preventing system failures or aiding those in the office to work more efficiently. Develop use cases for today and tomorrowWith AI, the applications for sustainability and carbon-neutrality are significant. Buildings represent 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve decarbonization goals, making our buildings smarter and more efficient should be the largest area of focus for the entire value chain, from C-suites to government leaders, to building owners and operators. It’s where they can get the most value for their investment — it’s good for the planet and the bottom line. The question is how we get there. A majority (52%) of workers believe that working with AI will accelerate their career growth; however, only 13% of the same cohort said they’ve been offered AI training. This is a huge opportunity for employers to lean in and assess the skills that their workforce needs. Research also shows that organizations continue to see returns in the business areas in which they are using AI, and they plan to increase investment in the years ahead.Despite these numbers, employees are increasingly educating themselves, as organizations start to contend with different rates of adoption. Moving forward, businesses will need to align capabilities with expectations for every role across companies and provide guardrails for the eager and risk-free opportunities for others. This period of learning and trial and error is crucial during this early phase of handling generative AI. Leveraging insights learned from experimentation will help build a culture of responsible usage and illuminate unseen impacts on the future of work.7 principles for human-centric AIGovernance and ethics are imperative to the future of sustainability-focused AI applications and the use of other emerging technologies. Johnson Controls has anchored its AI ambitions in a tailored and robust code of ethics that will guide the company as it works to make the world smarter, healthier and more sustainable — and the principles are a good starting point for any organization that seeks to ensure its usage of AI is as responsible as possible.Rather than being set in stone, these guidelines are open to evolving alongside the technology.Empower humans in buildings: Design AI to augment and elevate human intelligence and human work.Fairness and inclusion: Develop and use AI in a manner that minimizes the creation or reinforcement of unfair, biased and discriminatory impacts.Privacy by design: Develop and use AI within a privacy by design framework.Robustness, safety and security: Apply strong testing, safety and security practices to minimize unintended results or outputs from AI systems and to include appropriate human oversight capabilities.Accountability: Be accountable for how AI systems impact the world.Transparency: Be clear about when, why and how AI systems are deployed and help customers and partners do the same.Sustainability: Develop AI with sustainability as a focal point to help buildings and communities become more sustainable.Human-centricity is at the core of that AI ethics code, and sustainability is one of its key pillars. Ultimately, it helps ensure that AI-enabled solutions allow some of the largest and most complex buildings in the world to become more sustainable.Leaders: act now on AI, or risk being left behindThe future is coming fast, with AI and other emerging solutions continuing to evolve. As the urgency of climate change accelerates, organizations will have to accelerate their adoption of game-changing technologies. The hard part of climate action is getting easier, and we can expect it to become even easier as technologies improve and as more organizations successfully adopt these technologies.For many leaders, it may feel as if the future of the planet is out of your control. Just as the invention of the internet, smartphones and video streaming were disruptive, companies that do not innovate get left behind. Leaders must prepare for the future. Seek out training; consult with experts.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools are evolving quickly, as is their adoption in organizations in every industry. During our recent virtual summit, Insights in Action: Unlocking the Data-Driven Potential of People at Work, a panel of HR, data and technology experts discussed the considerations and ramifications of how organizations implement generative AI and the risks business leaders need to mitigate along the way.
During the recent ADP virtual summit, Insights in Action: Unlocking the Data-Driven Potential of People at Work, experts and leaders from various industries weighed in on key trends affecting work today, tomorrow and beyond.
One of the most engaging discussions of the event is a topic that has captured the attention of many people recently: generative AI. This technology is defined as AI that's capable of using a history of input and using models and algorithms to create all-new text, images and other content.
In a session called Generative AI and the Workplace of Tomorrow, a panel of HR, data and technology experts — Lyndsey Benson, vice president of HR; Steve Madden; Amin Venjara, chief data officer, ADP; and Jason Albert, global chief privacy officer, ADP — along with host Chip Cutter from The Wall Street Journal explore the relationship between this new technology and the future of work as we know it. Here are some key takeaways from the discussion.

5 Ways to Support Gen Z Employees in the Workplace


Most organizations are considering how best to use generative AI
Exploration and education are at the heart of the current state of generative AI in the business world.
""Companies are trying to get a sense of what's really real with generative AI and where they can create tangible value for their customers and within their organizations,"" Venjara said.
Venjara added that business leaders today are prioritizing educational webinars and training, running pilot programs and exploring new vendor relationships. But introducing AI without guardrails could have some risks, so they're also creating policy frameworks that aim to ensure they're using this new technology in ways that are appropriate to their brands and safe for customers and associates.
""Education, pilots, and policy frameworks are all coming together to take the potential of generative AI and turn it into reality,"" Venjara said.
While the speed of adoption may be partly attributed to the excitement around new technology fueled by viral media attention, organizations using generative AI tools still need to recognize the unique responsibilities that come with early adoption.
Albert suggested some questions leaders should ask to guide their decisions around generative AI.
""First, ask: What use cases might this really help with? Where can it help me make things more efficient? Where can it help me generate content? Where can it help me sift through data and provide a more personalized human experience to my customers?""
Efficiency and customer experience, though, aren't the only priorities. Albert recommends that business leaders exploring potential AI use also ask, ""How do I make sure I use this in a way that protects my company's data and individuals' privacy? How do I make sure that I protect my intellectual property and put in place the governance structure to allow me to take advantage of those benefits while still having those appropriate protections?"" (Read: Generative AI at Work: Addressing Your Top Concerns)
Generative AI can offer multiple advantages in the workplace
The benefits of generative AI in the workplace are numerous. Organizations are continuously coming up with new use cases for the developing technology. Here are some of the potential key advantages:
Speed and efficiency
Generative AI tools offer ways to streamline processes, reduce administrative work and obtain data-informed insights faster than ever possible before. Saving time and effort can help teams do more with less, which is a crucial benefit for organizations with workers who can be freed up for other tasks that demand particular knowledge, creativity and innovation.
Data collection and analysis
Generative AI can help leaders gain insight into everything from buyer motivation to employee engagement. At Steve Madden, Benson said, team members are exploring how generative AI tools can improve the recruiting process by sorting high volumes of resumes. These tools can also help summarize and synthesize feedback from departing associates' exit interviews.
""There [are] capabilities with generative AI now where it could sift through some of the writing,"" Benson said, ""where people put their comments about why they're leaving, and [generative AI can] give you the three key reasons why people are leaving.""
She added that directly conversing with people remains a crucial element so that you don't lose the human touch, but generative AI can help you shape those conversations.
Streamlined processes and relief from repetitive tasks
Because these tools can help shoulder manual tasks, people become freer to invest time and energy in creativity and innovation.
""The goal is to make things easier,"" Venjara said. ""Remove manual tasks and make the system proactive – knowing what needs to be done and doing it.
When you have this kind of virtual assistant that takes care of rote tasks and then gives you reports and reminders when you need to act, you can start at the next step and build on it.
Say the system flags for you that an employee has reached a milestone that deserves recognition. You can take that AI prompt and turn it into a more human acknowledgment.
""You can do the job that HR is meant to do,"" Venjara said, ""which is to connect people, drive engagement, and foster a vibrant workplace culture.""
Ethics are a prime focus for early adopters
Organizations that have already adopted generative AI tools in the workplace are on the frontline in ensuring this new technology is used in alignment with their mission and values. The session panelists agree that organizations can benefit from supplementing an existing legal team by bringing in an AI ethicist or a lawyer with an AI specialty.
""AI is all about helping humans make better decisions and better predictions so we can take more impactful action,"" Albert said. ""That's the first part. The second part is having thoughts about ethics and compliance and having a transparent ethics program where we're going to be transparent about where AI is going to be used.""
The goal, Albert added, is to provide guidance to people so they understand how it works, where it's appropriate, where it isn't and the limitations of the system as well as having a security program in place to protect the data.
""The foundation of meaningful results,"" he said, ""is having compliance, explainability and transparency so that clients have confidence in the overall approach that's taken in the development and operation of the systems.""

Right now, many are weighing both their talent acquisition and talent development needs when it comes to AI skills within their workforce.Deloitte surveyed more than 2,800 director- to C-suite-level leaders from different industries and countries to inform its State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report. Because of the rapid development and deployment of AI at work, the company announced a move to conduct this survey as a quarterly pulse rather than annually.“The technology is unfolding so rapidly, you know, there is constant change in the constant best practices and lessons that’s coming out,” said Beena Ammanath, who leads Deloitte’s global AI Institute.More than three-quarters of respondents said they expect generative AI to drive substantial organizational change in the next few years, but only 47% of respondents say their organization is “sufficiently educating employees on the capabilities, benefits, and value of generative AI,” according to the report.“If you’re looking at completely new ways of doing business or new product ideas, you need a workforce that can talk the AI language, that understands the language, to have productive discussions,” Ammanath said.Right now, much of the AI-powered progress has been in the realm of efficiency and productivity, she said. More skilling is needed to really see how the tech could upend the workplace.Ammanth said that no matter the role at an organization, every employee needs to have a base-level knowledge of AI, and how to use it on the job.“Why does an executive assistant need to know AI? It’s not necessarily to build the AI, to design the AI, but how to use it in a most effective manner,” she said, as an example. “How to make sure…he or she is using the AI tools [in] the optimum way. Balancing the work between what he or she can do—or needs to do—from a human perspective versus…[using] the tools that might be available.”Ammanth said more employee training is also needed for knowing when to use publicly available large language models, such as ChatGPT, and when to use internal AI tools only available within an organization.Zoom out. 2024 is set to be a big year for AI upskilling. Companies like EdX, Coursera, and Microsoft are developing tools for individual learners and enterprise organizations to understand what skills may be needed to best work in the new AI-empowered economy.HR pros can help their organizations line up their people policies with best practices and ethical considerations for deploying AI at work.CopyYou might also like...TechHR pros drawn to good data analytics and training platformsAdam DeRose / 07.8.2024Total Rewards (Comp & Benefits)How one lactation company is advising employers seeking to comply with the PUMP Act Courtney Vinopal / 07.16.2024DE&IThis DE&I leader uses ERGs to make sure employee voices can impact company decisionsAdam DeRose / 07.16.2024Quick-to-read HR news & insightsFrom recruiting and retention to company culture and the latest in HR tech, HR Brew delivers up-to-date industry news and tips to help HR pros stay nimble in today’s fast-changing business environment.Try it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the introduction of ChatGPT, the healthcare industry has been fascinated by the potential of AI models to generate new content. While the average person might be awed by how AI can create new images or re-imagine voices, healthcare is focused on how large language models can be used in their organizations. However, the effort to build, train, and evaluate this modeling is only a small fraction of what is needed to reap the vast benefits of generative AI technology.
Consider the iceberg analogy. The LLMs, algorithms, and structures that a healthcare payer or provider interacts with represent the visible part of the iceberg. But as we all know, what is below the surface and not visible is significantly larger and more important. For healthcare organizations, what’s below is data—vast amounts of data that LLMs will have to be trained on.
This is where the healthcare industry has a distinct advantage because payers and providers are sitting on an enormous amount of existing data. In fact, the average hospital produces 50 petabytes of data a year. That amount of data is more than twice the data currently housed in the U.S. Library of Congress. Nearly 80% of hospital data is unstructured and most of it has been underutilized until now.
To build effective and scalable generative AI solutions, healthcare organizations will have to think beyond the models that are visible at the surface. Payers and providers will need to create a data foundation that addresses elements such as bringing in the right data, how to classify it, and how to create a data lineage so data sources can be tracked to address potential AI hallucinations.
Key elements of this foundation are data strategy, data governance, and data engineering. A healthcare payer or provider must establish a data strategy to define its vision, goals, and roadmap for the organization to manage its data. This is the overarching guidance that drives digital transformation. Next is governance; the rules, policies, and processes to ensure data quality and integrity. Data engineering is the process of collecting and acquiring the right data in the right format from multiple sources.
All of this data management work must be completed with intention and planning so your generative AI solution will perform as expected. Additionally, healthcare organizations will need to look at existing workflows, problems that they are trying to solve, and applications that need to be launched. For any healthcare payer or provider, your strongest business asset will become your data and your model, especially when unstructured data becomes fully integrated.
The need for generative AI data management may seem daunting. The good news is that what once was an underwater mountain of unstructured data that was inaccessible can now be surfaced with generative AI. Organizations will be able to access information from sources such as claims, eligibility forms, enrollment data from providers, and policies, along with utilization management data, clinical data, medical records, and contracts.
Today, data scientists and business analysts are the end users of generative AI. One day soon, generative AI functionality will become mainstream and will be integral to healthcare delivery. Every part of the patient’s journey has the potential to benefit from this transformative technology, from finding the right provider to improving the hospital administration process to discovering insights into managing chronic conditions.
Generative AI has the potential to transform how healthcare is delivered, managed, and paid.

Pitch decks often take the form of a series of slides that combine facts about a company with an overarching narrative.Scroll through a site like Upwork, and you'll see hundreds of listings from companies looking for someone to make them a winning pitch deck. With technology like ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating chatbot, and Tome, an AI-powered storytelling tool, freelancers can churn out multiple pitch decks a week. Larry Lundstrom, a pastor based in Arkansas, told BI he makes two to three pitch decks a week using generative AI tools and charges anywhere between $500 to $1,000 per deck. AI tools have helped Lundstrom cut his turnaround time in half, he previously told Insider.

AI tools are making it easier to overdub videos in other languages, which is a pretty lucrative freelance gig.











Content creators like MrBeast spend a lot of money on dubbing their videos into other languages.

Streaming companies like Netflix and content creators on YouTube and TikTok spend hefty sums on voice dubbers, who help them translate their content into more languages and reach a global audience.But AI tools are making it easier to outsource that task to freelancers. When YouTuber Kris McCauley wanted to launch a translation of his videos to Spanish, he initially turned to translations.com, a go-to among YouTubers, he said in a video. But the company quoted him $4,000 for dubbing 100 minutes of footage. Then he came across Nova A.I., a software that can translate and add subtitles to videos. Nova A.I.'s ""Pro"" plan — priced at $18 a month — allows users to translate 300 minutes of footage into 75 different languages, according to its site.McCauley mentioned he's saving hundreds of dollars with this new approach — though he's still relying on external dubbers as well. And he noted that an enterprising freelancer could easily turn dubbing into a profitable side hustle with a tool like Nova A.I.

Henry Williams, a freelance writer based in London, used the bot to generate a marketing article. To his ""horror,"" he said ChatGPT put together a 600-word article in less than 30 seconds.Williams noted that the bot's tone was inhuman and the structure wasn't particularly sophisticated, but the ""key points, the grammar, and the syntax were all spot on.""After a few tweaks, he said it was something he would have charged at least $615 to write.

Generative AI tools are helping people put together movie pitches and animated shorts.
 
                                            Maryna Terletska/Getty Images
                                          




 Jordan Poblete, a corporate strategist with a penchant for movie-making, is using ChatGPT and Dall-E 2 to put together a pitch for an independent movie. ""Our particular fim includes magical realism or aspects of magical realism that can't be created in a real world,"" he said, adding that Dall-E 2 has been especially helpful in achieving the right feel.Poblete said he plans to pitch the movie to producers later this month. Though he said he's not sure exactly how much money the movie might generate, he's certainly hoping for a hit. Reshi used ChatGPT, MidJourney, among other AI tools to make an animated short within six hours. Since it was uploaded to Twitter last month, the video has already amassed more than 7 million views.
 —Ammaar Reshi  (@ammaar) January 16, 2023  
 While Reshi told Insider he doesn't have plans to launch into animated shorts right now, he said, ""If there's an idea that's inspiring enough that is worth monetizing (and I manage to find more time after my day job haha) then definitely!""

Tools like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have made it significantly easier to code via natural language.











AI has made coding easier for people who aren't super-familiar with complicated programming languages.
 
                                            GettyImages/ Hero Images
                                          




That opens up a host of lucrative side hustles for people who don't have direct experience coding in languages like JavaScript or Python.Ammaar Reshi, who wrote a children's book with ChatGPT, also managed to code two computer games almost entirely with GPT-4. 
 —Ammaar Reshi  (@ammaar) March 14, 2023  Reshi said he would type a prompt into GPT-4 like ""Add a high-score label that tracks the amount you've eaten"" and GPT-4 would provide the requisite line of code in JavaScript. Reshi admitted that, at least for now, GPT-4 doesn't generate the most flawless code. However, he does think the tool will make it easier for novice programmers to build out their ideas — and earn money for them.

Generative AI tools like Midjourney, Dall-E 2, and Tome have been game-changers in the world of graphic design.











AI also has helped lend a ""professional"" look to amateur graphic designs.
 
                                            OpenAI
                                          




Aspiring graphic designers and seasoned ones alike are now using these tools to quickly generate images for presentations, pitches, and marketing campaigns. For those looking for help getting started, Worklife Venture's Kimmel had a suggestion:""You can go on Upwork and bid on graphic design jobs. Then use DALL-E 2 to generate the original graphics."" Kimmel added graphic designers and logo designers can make hundreds or thousands of dollars per job this way.

Chase Dimond, an entrepreneur who earns seven figures through multiple income streams, uses ChatGPT to find inspiration for his social media posts. And Dimond, who has 100,000 followers on Twitter, almost 180,000 followers on LinkedIn, and 10,000 on YouTube, counts on his social media brand as one of his six income streams. Samantha North, a blogger who made $115,000 running two websites last year, said she uses ChatGPT to generate themes and ideas on topics or write introductions for her blog posts. AI has helped her to create more content without the need to bring on an additional employee or outsource work to other freelancers, she said.

Creatives are using a slate of AI-tools to generate new music — and even earn royalties.











Creators can earn royalties from AI-renditions of Grimes' voice with her new AI voice software, Elf.Tech.
 
                                            Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images
                                          




And oftentimes it doesn't take more than a simple text prompt to get started. With Google's MusicLM, for example, users can generate music from text and images. Similarly, Meta's open-source MusicGen can create about 15 seconds of audio based on a simple text description. Successful musical artists have also launched tools for creators to earn royalties off of their voice. The musician Grimes unveiled a new AI voice software called Elf.Tech that lets creators upload AI-renditions of her own voice and take a 50% cut of the royalties, according to Pitchfork. The experimental musician Holly Herndon also released a tool called Holly+ that lets artists create new music with an AI-likeness of her voice. And the exciting (or unnerving) thing is that AI-generated hits are going viral — and offering the prospect of even more income. ""It's honestly kind of scary how easy these things are to do,"" said Jered Chavez, the creator of popular AI-generated songs including a viral hit of Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and Ye singing the anime theme song ""Fukashigi no Karte.""

Earn money by building customized versions of ChatGPT and sharing them on OpenAI's new GPT Store.











HaikuGPT is one of the third party chatbots on the GPT Store.
 
                                            Screenshot from GPT Store
                                          




Anyone who subscribes to ChatGPT Plus can build a custom chatbot — which OpenAI calls ""GPTs"" — and share it on the GPT Store. Builders will be paid based on user engagement with their GPTs, but OpenAI has not disclosed further specifics. And you don't need any technical expertise or coding skills to build a GPT. Users essentially prompt ChatGPT with instructions on what they want their GPT to look like, and its ChatGPT will configure a new chatbot. Business Insider's Aaron Mok managed to build a GPT in 15 minutes with pretty satisfactory results. So far, more than 3 million GPTs have been created, according to OpenAI. They range from chatbots that analyze your horoscope to bots that help students with homework to ones that only respond in haikus.

Is Generative AI the Heartbeat of the 4th Industrial Revolution?

By Jeffy Jacob -   01/17/2024      3 Minutes Read 





Insights from the World Economic Forum, 2024
Several global chief executives gathered in Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum 2024 to talk about whether Generative AI is the Steam Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. A chief point highlighted at the forefront was the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI), drawing parallels to past revolutionary technologies.
AI on Workforce Transformation
The pervasive impact of AI across all business sectors is foreseen if the companies embrace AI technology. Julie Sweet, CEO, Accenture emphasized the need for organizations to re-skill their workforce to adapt to AI-driven changes and the role of leadership in understanding and operationalizing AI effectively.
She pointed out saying, “AI is important as there has been no single technology that showed every part of the Enterprise with a material impact with credibility.”
The impact of AI on various business functions depends on the necessity for companies to focus on productivity and embrace AI technology. Arvind Krishna, CEO, IBM mentioned the importance of regulating AI use cases and holding AI model developers accountable, advocating for open ecosystems to ensure widespread economic benefits.
He noted saying, “AI will bring about 4 trillion dollars in productivity by the end of the decade. Programmers or Coders who use Generative AI can work about 30-40% much more efficiently than one who does not. Embracing AI is the key. AI may not necessarily displace jobs, it will undoubtedly transform them.”
Democratization of AI
Democratization of artificial intelligence makes AI technologies more accessible, affordable, and user-friendly for a wider range of users. The democratization of AI technology through on-device AI i.e. those devices that directly interact with the users through the role of data access and distributed computing is key to proliferating AI.
Cristiano Amon, CEO, Qualcomm talked about Qualcomm’s role in bringing AI to a range of devices, including those used in industrial environments. The deal made with BMW to partner with Qualcomm for smart, autonomous cars shows an example of promise.
He says, “The explosion of Generative AI today is enabled by the ability to access data and computing power. AI is a different way to write software and an AI processing is going to be the next way of doing computing. It started in the data centre and will continue to grow in the data centre but it’s expanding everywhere now.”
Tech that transforms the Future? 
The transformative power of AI and its role in scaling intellect and enhancing global competition cannot be reiterated. Omar Sultan Al Olama, the Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy, and Remote Work Applications, UAE, discussed UAE’s proactive stance on AI, emphasizing its deployment in sectors such as oil and gas, climate change, and traffic management. Al Olama also stressed the importance of international cooperation in AI development, the need for AI education starting from a young age, and the UAE’s unique data set and infrastructure for AI development.
He said, “There are certain elements of AI that is going to scale up. Intellect & the brainpower that the countries have at the global front especially developing countries. There is an urgent need to embrace AI at this junction of time.
AI is not just a fleeting trend but a cornerstone of the future and if organisation has to succeed embracing AI is not optional but essential for future success.

Unless you’ve spent the past year under a rock (in which case, welcome back!), you’ve no doubt heard of generative A.I. and its potential to change everything from coding to writing text. You might even be tempted to learn as much about it as possible; if so, we’ve assembled some handy educational resources for you.

First, What is Generative A.I.? 

As the name implies, generative A.I. can generate text, images, code, and other media in response to a user’s prompt. The tech specialists researching generative A.I. rely on machine-learning models and training datasets to “smarten up” their respective platforms; with a popular generative A.I. product like ChatGPT, you can see how the system becomes exponentially smarter with each successive version.

“Generative AI holds enormous potential to create new capabilities and value for enterprise,” reads a handy generative A.I. explainer released last year by IBM. “However, it also can introduce new risks, be they legal, financial or reputational. Many generative models, including those powering ChatGPT, can spout information that sounds authoritative but isn’t true (sometimes called ‘hallucinations’) or is objectionable and biased. Generative models can also inadvertently ingest information that’s personal or copyrighted in their training data and output it later, creating unique challenges for privacy and intellectual property laws.”

Many tech professionals fear that generative A.I. will take their jobs. For example, they envision a future in which companies cut back on hiring software developers and other specialists because a generative A.I. tool can do much of the coding work. But there’s the possibility that generative A.I. will also create new jobs; for example, A.I. prompt engineer is a growing (and lucrative) profession. 

Where Can I Learn About Generative A.I.? 

For those who leverage online learning, multiple institutions have launched generative A.I. learning courses over the past few years. Some of these courses are introductory, while others are quite advanced.

Google, for example, offers the following online tutorials, which include videos, quizzes, and short lessons:


Generative AI, explained
Introduction to Generative AI 
Introduction to Large Language Models 
Generative AI Fundamentals Skill Badge 
What is Generative AI Studio? 
Introduction to Generative AI Studio 
Introduction to Image Generation 
Introduction to Responsible AI 
Responsible AI: Applying AI Principles with Google Cloud 


As you might expect, online learning portals such as Coursera offer courses from the likes of DeepLearning.AI, IBM, Vanderbilt University, and other institutions. Udacity is also offering a generative A.I. “nanodegree” program, with a focus on skills such as the OpenAI API, image pre-processing, and more; prerequisite skills include Python, neural networks, and more. 

But which of these generative A.I. skills will actually land you a job? According to Upwork’s August 2023 analysis of the generative A.I. market, the top 10 generative A.I.-related job searches from companies included, in descending order:

ChatGPT
BERT
Stable Diffusion
TensorFlow
A.I. Chatbot
Generative A.I.
Image Processing
PyTorch
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Bard

Whatever your tech specialty, it’s clear that even a baseline knowledge of generative A.I. can prove incredibly useful. If machine learning really interests you from a career perspective, consider mastering tools and frameworks such as ChatGPT, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

        The influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on work processes is growing rapidly, while there is a shortage of skilled labour in Switzerland and the EU. How will this combination affect the labour market and inflation in the long term?

No, this text was not written by an AI. But it could soon be. Artificial intelligence is making rapid progress. 
+ Why Switzerland needs more workers from abroad
Not only could journalistic texts be written by computers in the future, but many other tasks will soon no longer require humans: for example, photo editing, stocktaking and bookkeeping. 
In the SWI swissinfo.ch podcast Geldcast, we spoke to economist Jan-Egbert Sturm from the Economic Research Centre at the federal technology institute ETH Zurich and asked, among other things: will there soon be fewer jobs? 
Baby boomers retiring
In the short term, the answer is no – at least for Switzerland. Because something else is happening on the domestic labour market at the same time. Something that has never happened before in the recent past. According to calculations by Patrick Eugster, a self-employed economist and financial market expert, a net 30,000 workers will soon be leaving the Swiss labour market – every year. 
The reason: the baby boomers born between 1959 and 1964 are retiring. And these people will only be partially replaced by young and foreign workers.

The bottom line is that there is a shortfall on the labour market. There is a shortage of skilled labour – and not just in Switzerland. There is currently a similar trend in the eurozone. 
This labour shortage is reflected in unemployment figures. These are still at a very low level, despite the very sharp interest rate hikes by central banks in recent years. 
In Switzerland, the unemployment rate is currently 4.2%, according to the international definition (2% according to the Swiss definition), 3.7% in the US and 6.5% in the eurozone. This is very low by historical standards. 
The labour shortage is good news for employees: they are gaining bargaining power vis-à-vis employers. 
In the medium term, this will lead to higher wages, write economists Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan, for example, in their bestselling book The Great Demographic Reversal. They expect inflationary pressure to remain high in the coming years. 
Opposing influences
However, artificial intelligence counteracts this inflationary pressure; it weakens the position of employees in the short term. 
Anyone who can be replaced by a computer will hardly expect to push through a wage increase. This makes the production of goods and services cheaper, reducing inflationary pressure. 
But which effect will dominate? Will prices continue to rise because labour is becoming scarce? Or will prices even fall in future because more and more can be done by computers? 
The answer is not that clear, says Jan-Egbert Sturm in the SWI swissinfo.ch Geldcast. In the long term, central banks will be able to keep inflation close to the target value. 
In the short and medium term, however, this task will become more difficult because even central banks will not know in real time which factor will dominate at any given time. 
AI conclusion
Conclusion: artificial intelligence is accelerating change in the world of work. At the same time, the labour market is facing a potential shortage of skilled workers. 
The entry of boomers into retirement age reinforces this challenge and strengthens the position of employees. 
At the same time, AI is increasingly taking over tasks and weakening the position of employees. However, the long-term impact on inflation remains uncertain. 
And yes, the conclusion was written by AI. But only in part: it was not (yet) possible without the author’s revision.

Every year, after the inspirational whirlwind that is the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, I sit down to reflect on the themes that emerged during the week. Last year, we discussed the radical reassessment of how we think about work and jobs — what we called “Work’s Great Reboot.”


This year, that rapid reboot has been thrown into overdrive by the tsunami that is generative AI (gen AI). It has stirred up excitement — and deep anxieties — as leaders try to understand and prepare for its impact on work, workers, and society at large. Surpassing climate change, geopolitical crises and last year’s hot topic — crypto — gen AI was the hottest topic at this year’s annual meeting by a factor of 10. And this was the topic of the 9th annual Mercer/Oliver Wyman Forum breakfast, Tapping AI’s Power to Optimize Our Working World, in Davos

Charting the rapid rise of gen AI 

The Oliver Wyman Forum’s new report, How Generative AI is Transforming Business and Society, shows a staggering pace of adoption. In less than a year, 55% of people globally are using gen AI for their work. ChatGPT reached mass adoption in ten months, while the internet took 17 years, smartphones took 21 years, and electricity took 37 years.

PROMOTED
This blazingly fast uptake is consistent across regions, industries, and roles — however, it does not inherently translate to productivity. In fact, only 61% of survey respondents report increased productivity from using gen AI.
The research also reveals a striking gap between the enthusiasm of CEOs, 69% of whom see broad benefits of gen AI, and the 59% of employees who worry it will take their jobs.
This is not entirely unwarranted, as research from the World Economic Forum shows that:

A humanistic view of automation is essential if we are to harness the benefits of AI in a sustainable and inclusive manner that reduces inequality. The WEF’s Good Work Framework is a good place to start as we redefine the human-machine compact.
Managing human-machine synergy 
The integration of human and machine intelligence and the productivity gains that might result was a theme that resonated deeply with our panel at the aforementioned breakfast. Microsoft Americas CEO Deb Cupp talked about the transformative breakthroughs that have brought humans and gen AI closer, taking technology that was once the realm of experts and making it accessible to everyone.
“What I love is that a lot of people on the ground who are doing the job every day are the ones who are surfacing the best use cases,” said Deb. “So, although it's great that executives want to do this, the true use cases are actually coming from the people who are doing the work.”
Tanuj Kapilashrami, the Chief HR Officer of Standard Chartered Bank, spoke to the potential of gen AI to ""augment performance, productivity, and the work experience”. The fear of the unknown looms large, she said, but ""as machines get better at being machines, humans can get better at being humans.""
The democratization of access 
As many know, one of the primary benefits of gen AI is how it has democratized access to AI through the use of natural language as its primary interface. For Dan Vahdat, CEO of Huma Therapeutics, the rapid adoption of generative AI holds much promise. Underscoring the democratizing power of this technology, Dan made the case that gen AI is bridging socio-economic divides. ""It's a resource for all of us to use. And probably the best thing that has happened to the world since the internet.""
The double-edged sword that is gen AI
The inherent contradictions in gen AI were an important theme. Dan noted that Huma Therapeutics has identified a potential 10x time-savings for healthcare clinicians with gen AI — a staggering leap forward in productivity and efficiency in healthcare.
But Ana Kreacic, Chief Knowledge Officer at Oliver Wyman, observed that traditionally, such productivity savings have tended to benefit companies, not workers. “On the one hand, workers would love to have some free time. But on the other hand, when you look at history, many of the productivity gains that we've seen historically have gone purely to the employer.”
Reskilling and upskilling for gen AI 
The rapid advance of gen AI is not just transforming how we work; it's catalyzing the shift from job-centric to skill-centric models within an organization. When you get beyond the job to the component activities and tasks, you see clearly where certain activities might be substituted, others augmented, and yet other bodies of work transformed.
The adoption of gen AI calls for skills that are not always present. Ana noted: “40% of executives believe their workforce needs training or retraining. 98% of workers are saying, ‘We need more.’ The disconnect is huge, and companies need to do a lot more.”
The upcoming Mercer Global Talent Trends 2024 research underscores this, as only 45% of employees said they trust that their organization will teach them the skills they will need if their job changes due to AI and/or automation.
Organizations must start with skills, agreed Tanuj. ""I do think it's going to disrupt jobs, but the real opportunity that companies have is to stop thinking of the organization as a collection of jobs and think of it as a collection of skills. If we do pivot from job to skills, I think it can be a really exciting moment for workforces across the world.”
Rethinking and redesigning work for the gen AI age
The age of gen AI is already upon us, cautioned Azeem Azhar, CEO of Exponential View, and there is only a short period of time left before the technology no longer requires a human co-pilot. The panelists agreed that it is essential for companies to proactively redesign work to incorporate gen AI and not just leave employees to grapple with the change on their own. The quantum and pace of change requires organizations to design space for learning and well-being into the flow of work as opposed to expecting the workforce to singularly bear the burden of their continued relevance for a changing world of work.
Ensuring a future-ready workforce
As I noted at the conclusion of the panel, the rapid adoption we’ve seen in gen AI — just over the course of the last year — is only the tip of the iceberg. The WEF has already quantified some of the seismic changes it is bringing to jobs, with more than 75% of companies looking to adopt these technologies over the next five years.
It is going to be pivotal that we reinvent work models to bring our customers, employees and communities on this journey to ensure an equitable and inclusive future of work that appropriately balances economics and empathy. These are table stakes for competing in the era of gen AI, and if we can get this balance right, we can ensure a future-ready workforce that will thrive in the world of work that comes next.

Dutch gov't sees risks & opportunities in generative AI; Worried about job losses




The Dutch government sees both opportunities and risks in generative AI, describing it as a technology that “affects society to the core” in a letter sent to parliament on Thursday. A big concern is short-term job losses, outgoing State Secretary Alexandra van Huffelen (Digitalization) and outgoing Minister Micky Adriaansens (Economic Affairs) wrote. The impact this technology will have on society must not be underestimated, they said.
“It has many consequences for our lives: how we learn and work,” Van Huffelen and Adriaanens said in the government’s “vision” for generative AI, such as chatbot ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney. The most real threat is how the work environment will change. “The International Monetary Fund has already warned that about 40 percent of jobs are changing significantly.”
“In the legal profession, they can use it to collect case law more quickly. In healthcare, doctors can receive support to make diagnoses more easily. But it also means that sectors are changing,” Van Huffelen wrote. Several professional groups are very vulnerable to the rise of generative AI, mainly people in creative fields, data analysis, legal work, and office support.
Most economists expect total employment won’t decline due to generative AI because the new field will also create many jobs. But the government is worried about short-term disruptions - someone laid off as an executive assistant can’t immediately start working at a company that builds generative AI, for example. 
Therefore, the government asked the Social and Economic Council of the Netherlands (SER) to map out how generative AI will impact the Dutch labor market. “How can we ensure that we retain jobs in the Netherlands? Jobs that are interesting. Ensure that our productivity is used properly and that our prosperity is maintained and grows.”
Creating policy in the field of AI is a priority because it is a key technology within society, Van Huffelen and Adriaansens wrote. The government wants obligations in place on companies and governments to protect people against the risks of this technology. 
One such risk is that AI is not developed transparently, putting user privacy at stake and risking systematic discrimination. AI can also be used to create and spread disinformation. The Netherlands largely uses AI systems from non-EU countries, the Cabinet members wrote. “That can pose a risk when these models don’t comply with our European standards and values. The challenge is, therefore, to create a market in which generative AI applications are offered that comply with all Dutch and European values and laws.”
But despite the risks, the government sees many opportunities in using generative AI, for example, in earlier medical diagnoses, more productive work, and supporting the cultural sector. While the technology isn’t considered sustainable in itself - generative AI consumes an enormous amount of energy - the government believes it can contribute to the sustainability transition, for example, by having AI analyze natural ecosystems or predict climate trends.
The Dutch government wants generative AI to be developed and used safely and fairly, always serving human well-being and contributing to sustainability. To steer the development in the right direction, the Netherlands must be in the driver’s seat, Van Huffelen and Adriaansens wrote. “Within the EU, we aim to be a leader in safe and responsible generative AI.”

A new survey of thousands of game development professionals finds a near-majority saying generative AI tools are already in use at their workplace. But a significant minority of developers say their company has no interest in generative AI tools or has outright banned their use.
The Game Developers Conference's 2024 State of the Industry report, released Thursday, aggregates the thoughts of over 3,000 industry professionals as of last October. While the annual survey (conducted in conjunction with research partner Omdia) has been running for 12 years, this is the first time respondents were asked directly about their use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, GitHub Copilot, and Adobe Generative Fill.Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

Forty-nine percent of the survey's developer respondents said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace. That near-majority includes 31 percent (of all respondents) that say they use those tools themselves and 18 percent that say their colleagues do.Enlarge / A majority of game developers said their workplace was at least interested in using generative AI tools.GDC 2024 industry report
The survey also found that different studio departments showed different levels of willingness to embrace AI tools. Forty-four percent of employees in business and finance said they were using AI tools, for instance, compared to just 16 percent in visual arts and 13 percent in ""narrative/writing.""
Among the 38 percent of respondents who said their company didn't use AI tools, 15 percent said their company was ""interested"" in pursuing them, while 23 percent said they had ""no interest."" In a separate question, 12 percent of respondents said their company didn't allow the use of AI tools at all, a number that went up to 21 percent for respondents working at the largest ""AAA developers."" An additional 7 percent said the use of some specific AI tools was not allowed, while 30 percent said AI tool use was ""optional"" at their company.

Worries abound
The wide embrace of AI tools hasn't seemed to lessen worries about their use among developers, though. A full 42 percent of respondents said they were ""very concerned"" about the ethics of using generative AI in game development, with an additional 42 percent being ""somewhat concerned."" Only 12 percent said they were ""not concerned at all"" about those usage ethics.

Overall, respondents offered a split opinion on whether the use of AI tools would be overall positive (21 percent) or negative (18 percent) for the industry. Most respondents seemed split, with 57 percent saying the impact would be ""mixed.""
Developers cited coding assistance, content creation efficiency, and the automation of repetitive tasks as the primary uses for AI tools, according to the report.
“I’d like to see AI tools that help with the current workflows and empower individual artists with their own work,"" one anonymous respondent wrote. ""What I don’t want to see is a conglomerate of artists being enveloped in an AI that just does 99% of the work a creative is supposed to do.”
Elsewhere in the report, the survey found that only 17 percent of developers were at least somewhat interested in using blockchain technology in their upcoming projects, down significantly from 27 percent in 2022. An overwhelming 77 percent of respondents said they had no interest in blockchain technology, similar to recent years.

Despite this, only 23 percent said they were either in a union or had discussed unionization at their workplace.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and the rise of Generative AI (GAI) are ushering in a transformative era in the global job market. This evolution brings both challenges and opportunities, especially for those in their 40s, 50s, and above.The Shift in Job Market Dynamics4IR, characterized by the fusion of technologies blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres, is fundamentally altering the way we work. GAI, as a part of this revolution, is automating complex tasks, leading to a shift in job requirements. Traditional roles are evolving, and new positions are emerging that require an understanding of these advanced technologies.Opportunities and ChallengesFor younger professionals and those entering the workforce, this shift presents an opportunity to dive into new, tech-centric careers. However, for those in their 40s and 50s, adapting to these changes can be daunting. There’s a misconception that learning new technologies at this stage is excessively challenging, but this is not necessarily the case.Lifelong Learning as a KeyThe concept of lifelong learning is crucial. Those in their 40s and 50s can leverage their rich experience and combine it with new skills in technology. Online courses, workshops, and certifications offer avenues to gain these skills without the need for a full-fledged degree. This approach not only enhances employability but also provides a way to stay relevant and competitive.Addressing the Over-60 DemographicFor those above 60, the scenario is different. While some may choose to learn new skills, others might find it more challenging or less relevant, particularly if they are nearing or have reached retirement. However, this demographic can contribute significantly through mentorship roles, leveraging their vast experience to guide younger colleagues navigating the 4IR landscape.The Human Touch in a Digital AgeDespite the technological orientation of 4IR, the human element remains irreplaceable. Skills like critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence are as valuable as ever. In fact, with the rise of AI, these uniquely human skills may become even more important.ConclusionThe rise of 4IR and GAI is not a signal for obsolescence but an invitation to adapt and grow. For those in their 40s, 50s, and above, it is a call to blend their experience with new learning, remaining flexible and open to change. The future job market is not just about competing with machines but leveraging them to enhance human potential. Embracing lifelong learning, focusing on uniquely human skills, and fostering intergenerational collaboration are key strategies for thriving in this new era.

Hearing Wrap Up: Developing AI Literacy in the Workforce is Central to U.S. Leadership in AI









Share via Email



WASHINGTON—The Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation held a hearing titled, “Toward an AI-Ready Workforce.” Members discussed with subject matter experts how to effectively train an AI workforce to ensure economic benefits from AI are broadly distributed.. Members also discussed how to equip public sector workers with AI skills and how the government can apply best practices from private-sector AI learning programs to the federal workforce.
Key Takeaways:
Securing and strengthening America’s lead in artificial intelligence (AI) is key to maintaining national security and economic prosperity. As AI adoption accelerates, that edge will increasingly depend on the global competitiveness of our AI workforce.


Dr. William L. Scherlis—Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University—emphasized the importance of the timing of this hearing topic given the acceleration of AI across industry and society: “The charge to this hearing focuses on developing an AI workforce that enhances American strength and prosperity. This could not come at a more critical time. We see an accelerating pace of innovation in artificial intelligence and also in development of a growing range of applications. We are already seeing transformative impacts on defense and security, and on economic growth and opportunity in many sectors – and these benefits accrue at both national and regional levels, and include the delivery of diverse cost-effective services directly to our citizens.”

Experts anticipate that AI-adoption will also impact the broader workforce by changing or eliminating some jobs while creating new ones. Maintaining the nation’s global leadership in AI will require education and training pathways to train and upskill workers for AI and AI-adjacent roles.


Ms. Timi Hadra—Client Partner and Senior Executive for West Virginia at IBM—discussed what IBM is doing in the private sector to move toward a more Ai ready workforce: “As an industry leader, we have a responsibility to help prepare the American workforce to capitalize on the benefits of AI. In 2021, IBM unveiled a global commitment3 to help skill 30 million people by 2030. And most recently, we committed to train two million people in AI in the next three years through collaborations with universities and with new generative AI coursework on IBM SkillsBuild4 – our online platform with free coursework for teachers, students, and adult learners. The IBM SkillsBuild platform offers free coursework in AI fundamentals, chatbots, AI ethics, and generative AI. The coursework for generative AI includes Prompt-Writing, Getting Started with Machine Learning, Improving Customer Service with AI, and Generative AI in Action.”

Member Highlights:
Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation Chairwoman Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) examined what is holding the federal government back from developing an enhanced AI workforce and ways it can navigate this obstacle.

Rep. Mace: “Why do you think it is so hard for the federal government to or certain agencies to adopt this kind of nimble attitude towards AI?”
Ms. Hadra: “It’s a challenging topic, I think sometimes as some of my fellow panelists have mentioned, we’re not talking across agencies, we’re not talking across industry, and I think it is important for the federal government to look at what industry has done and try to implement the tools that are out there. Like [IBMs] SkillsBuild, like the other platforms that are widely available, and start getting those in use sooner.”
Rep. Mace: “You also mentioned in your testimony that federal contractors are rarely able to place an individual without a four-year degree on a technology services contract regardless of their qualifications. Are you saying that the terms of the federal contracts IBM is asked to sign prohibit the work be done by those without college degrees? Does that inhibit your ability to fill those roles?”
 Ms. Hadra: “Yes it is an issue and let me explain: In my experience with federal contracts a lot of times you have labor category descriptions or requirements that say ‘if you have a cybersecurity analyst, these are the minimum qualifications that they must meet.’ In some cases, we have seen change, it’s not that the regulations are not being implemented, it’s just not enough…our cybersecurity apprenticeship program is a 6 month curriculum. Those people don’t have four years of experience, but they are immersed in six months and they’re ready to hit the ground running on those programs. But because they don’t meet that minimum qualification, we are not able to put them on that contract.”
Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.) discussed how we can prepare and train our existing workforce to be able to integrate the education and tools needed to work in the AI driven future.

Rep. Timmons: “Dr. Scherlis, how do we increase the capacity of our workforce and separate that between the government and the private sector and then how do you develop our capacity long-term to be a leader in this in the global community?”
Dr. Scherlis: “Thank you for that question, I’ll agree that there is some separation but I think the separation is largely, arguable a cultural outcome. In government, it is really important to for us to have strong programs of professional development and advancement for our technology workforce, otherwise people don’t stay current. I think that it may be that many firms in the private sector and certainly in the tech sector, that’s an active element of the employer handshake. But I think what’s going on for example in the Defense Department…the role of leadership and the ability of leadership to think in imaginative ways, to think about what kinds of risks can we safely take, that can bubble down through an organization and effect for example, who’s involved with acquisition, with engineering, with developing strategy, with planning. All those kinds of positions are going to be affected by AI. So if we create an environment where we’re receptive to change, receptive to education and learning, I think that would make a significant difference.”
Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-N.Y.) discussed what processes IBM undertakes to train existing members of the workforce on AI which can be used a model for the federal government.

Rep. Langworthy: “How does IBM approach the process of retraining and upscaling existing employees.?”
Ms. Hadra: “Thank you for that question. Investing in upscaling and rescaling in lifelong learning is in IBMs DNA, and as we usher in new technologies like AI, we must ensure that both our employees and our society more broadly have opportunities to gain these skills. And we do this in real time. We want our employees to remain valuable to our clients, so we employ reskilling and upscaling programs annually.”

Generative AI has the potential to deliver a step-change in productivity, and reduce ‘digital debt’, Microsoft’s executives say.

By Sarah Carney, Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft Australia and New Zealand; and Karlee Scott-Murphy, Global Domain Lead – Employee Experience, Microsoft Australia and New Zealand

Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) has been significant. Generative AI, which encompasses advanced algorithms capable of producing text, images and other content that simulates human creativity, has rapidly transformed the technology landscape. Within two months of its launch, ChatGPT amassed 100 million monthly active users. Today, tens of millions of new users are logging in to OpenAI’s chatbot each week as new apps and use cases emerge.
As a world of possibility is explored, it is generative AI’s potential to deliver a step-change in productivity and reduce the ever-increasing ‘digital debt’ of emails, chats, calls and meetings that is sparking the most excitement for knowledge workers and employers. New research on the earliest users of Microsoft’s generative AI productivity service, Copilot for Microsoft 365, reveals that 70 per cent of users said they were more productive and the time to complete common tasks was on average 29 per cent faster with Copilot.

Quantifying the productivity benefits of generative AI
As has been well documented, one of generative AI’s greatest strengths is automating and augmenting routine tasks – from drafting emails to organising meetings, analysing Excel spreadsheets and preparing summaries. This frees up employees’ time, allowing them to focus on the more strategic and creative aspects of their role.
For example, generative AI can expedite the document preparation process, which is of great value to knowledge workers across all industries and functions. FSI professionals can use generative AI to scan market data, generate alerts when anomalies in risk metrics arise, and summarise the root causes and impacted segments driving the change in the appropriate document formats, to shape the subsequent action plan. Similarly, marketers can summarise articles to include in newsletters or create drafts of event invitations that can be quickly refined with their own creativity.
Finding ways to measure these time improvements can be relatively straightforward. Firstly, through anecdotal feedback from users – as it’s clear that many early users are eager to share examples of time saved in their day – and even savings of an hour per week per person can greatly benefit the bottom line. Another data-driven way is for organisations with Microsoft Viva integrating with Copilot for Microsoft 365, to use the new Copilot Dashboard that surfaces changes in productivity based on meetings, chat, email and document data (with comparisons for non-Copilot users). It will provide clear data to measure the impact of generative AI on common productivity areas and will often be what leadership teams and boards will be looking for to demonstrate ROI.
But generative AI for workforce productivity is about more than just unlocking efficiencies. Its ability to reshape collaboration and improve employee fulfilment and wellbeing are other important reasons why organisations are considering solutions like Copilot. However, measuring change in these areas can be more complex than simply looking at speed to complete tasks or quality of output – organisations must dive deeper into behavioural insights to understand the true impact of AI on their workplace.

				Decoding 2024: Experts unravel AI’s next big phase			




						By Lucio Ribeiro – Contributor 










Generative AI’s influence on collaboration and wellness
Data has shown that often a high number of meetings with a high number of participants, coupled with workday hours that span into personal time, can be risk factors for burnout. Meetings typically foster collaboration, however, not all collaboration is effective and linked to high impact or fulfilling work. The more meetings we attend – particularly if many of them are with high numbers of participants – the more time we may spend catching up outside of normal business hours.
Microsoft’s latest Work Trend Index found that we are in three times more meetings than we were in 2020, while productivity signals indicated that meetings were the number one productivity inhibitor. AI has a huge role to play in rethinking meetings. From enabling fast recaps to asking questions such as, “what were my actions?” or “what was the update on the project from my peer?”, meetings are no longer a single point in time but a digital artefact that people can interact with long after the meeting takes place.
In the research, early Copilot users on average reduced the time it took to catch up on missed meetings from 43 minutes to just 11 minutes – that’s four times faster than without generative AI technology. Whether that results in more uninterrupted focus time for employees to spend on the work that drives the greatest impact, or better work life balance, will be an interesting area to explore over the coming months.  
So how would you measure this? The measure of success extends beyond whether there are less meetings taking place. It requires a deep dive into the quantity and the quality of interactions, as well as how they contribute to employee satisfaction and risk of burnout.
Leaders should look at changes in the collaboration networks across an organisation in tools like Viva Insights to uncover trends and behaviours across the workforce. It means assessing things like changes in the time spent in small meetings versus large, workday spans, as well as how regularly the workforce has uninterrupted focus time. These insights can provide a picture into how AI tools like Copilot are changing an organisation’s meeting culture and collaboration effectiveness.

Who leads the charge?
The integration of generative AI into workplace practices marks a significant cultural shift. It’s not merely about automating existing processes but strategically rethinking how work gets done. This shift demands a thoughtful approach to change management, requiring organisations to adapt and evolve in ways they haven’t before. For example, instead of being methodical and structured in training employees for a new system, early adopters of Copilot found that it was more important to adopt a notion of experimentation, as well as a culture of learning and willingness to share knowledge that’s really had the greatest impact on adoption and use.
Responsibility for generative AI’s ROI is also moving from being the sole domain of IT teams to a more inclusive, cross-divisional approach. This means closer collaboration between the HR and IT departments to understand the full impact of AI on both the technological and human aspects of the workplace. The chief human resource officer (CHRO) or HR Director plays an increasingly important role in this context, bridging the gap between people and technology. HR leaders, with their deep insights into how technology is impacting employee wellbeing and collaboration effectiveness, will be important in leading the organisation’s adoption of AI to drive meaningful change in the workplace.
As organisations look to adopt generative AI services to support productivity in their workforce, they must start firstly with the privacy, security, and governance imperatives, and then incorporate a deep understanding of how they will measure the ROI and impact. By strategically approaching this upfront, businesses can not only track the productivity gains brought by AI but also ensure that these gains translate to a healthier, more collaborative and fulfilling work environment for their employees.

Helsinki wants to test new technologies and pave the way by improving the productivity of its own operations. The experiment also aims to develop the general competence and understanding regarding AI among the city's employees as well as support the use of AI.  
The Copilot trial runs from January to October and involves a total of 1,000 employees across the city organisation. The participants of the experiment consist of teams whose work involves considerable use of M365 tools such as Teams or Word. Teams that process personal data or are in direct contact with city residents have been excluded from the experiment because the use of the new technology involves legal and data protection issues that are yet to be resolved. Artificial intelligence will also not be used in recruitment. 
— Our goal is to learn what benefits Copilot can provide to make knowledge work more efficient and what work tasks the tool is best suited to. Our Copilot experiment makes us pioneers in Finland, as we will be among the first to test the tool, says Tomas Lehtinen, Head of Data at the City of Helsinki.
The City of Helsinki adheres to the ethical principles it has determined for the use of data and artificial intelligence.  There are eight ethical principles. These are human-centredness, transparency, explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, accountability and trust, privacy, safety, and human oversight over AI operations.

For years these Unpacked shindigs have focused on the latest hardware upgrades for Galaxy phones. But Unpacked 2024 saw a major shift, with software getting top billing for the first time. And no shocker there. These days, wherever you look in the tech world, you'll see hype about large language models and AI generators. From ChatGPT to Google Bard, all the tech heavyweights want a slice of that generative AI pie. So it's no surprise Samsung decided to jump on the bandwagon too. Let's break down exactly what Galaxy AI is, what it can do, which devices get it, and why it's so rad. What is Galaxy AI? Galaxy AI refers to Samsung's initiative to leverage on-device processing power to deliver AI features and functionality. This allows users to access certain AI capabilities without needing an internet connection. Samsung first hinted at Galaxy AI in November 2023, describing it as a combination of on-device and cloud-based services aimed at enhancing the user experience. The company has since developed the platform further, with the Galaxy S24 series representing the first real showcase of its potential. Galaxy AI consists of three main sub-models focused on coding, language, and imaging: - Gauss Code - Used internally by Samsung developers to generate test cases and annotate code. Gauss Code and its derivative assistant code.i help Samsung developers improve software efficiency. - Gauss Language - Powers natural language processing for chatbot-style applications. Gauss Language is tuned specifically for summarising, translating, and generating text responses. - Gauss Image - Enables image generation and editing based on text prompts. Gauss Image can create and modify images in a similar manner to leading AI services like DALL-E, Midjourney and Adobe Firefly. By processing data locally on the device rather than in the cloud, Galaxy AI provides benefits such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy and security, and lower data costs for users. What are the features of Galaxy AI? The newly launched Galaxy S24 lineup comes loaded with a variety of AI-powered features leveraging the on-device processing of Galaxy AI. Here's a look at some of the key capabilities now available: - Live Translate - Real-time translation for conversations using the phone dialer or Interpreter mode. This feature enables smooth two-way translations for in-person chats. - Chat Assist - Helps users chat in multiple languages across messaging/social apps. Chat Assist allows adjusting the tone and fixes grammar and spelling. - Note Assist - Summarises documents and creates templates in Samsung Notes. Note Assist can intelligently summarise lengthy files or generate new document templates. - Auto Replies - Summarises incoming messages and suggests smart replies. Users can respond to messages with voice commands to send informative auto-generated replies. - Transcript Assist - Generates transcripts for voice memos with speaker tags. Transcripts are instantly created for audio recordings. - Circle to Search - Lets users circle or highlight text/images to instantly run a web search. This feature allows searching directly from visual content on screen. - Edit Suggestion - Recommends edits to enhance photos. Users get intelligent suggestions to improve their images. - Generative Edit - Allows editing photos by generating new image content. Photos can be altered by removing objects or adding new generated visuals. - Instant Slow-mo - Converts standard videos into slow motion. Any video can be turned into share-worthy slow motion content. - Android Auto tuning - Android Auto will be able to summarise incoming messages and you'll also be able to send simple voice commands to share certain information, such as ETA. Is Galaxy AI secure? Data privacy and security are critical considerations with any AI system. Since Galaxy AI runs locally on devices, it avoids privacy issues associated with cloud-based AI. Samsung states user data remains ""end-to-end secure hardware"" with threat monitoring and protection. Users uncomfortable with Galaxy AI can simply disable these features entirely through the Advanced Intelligence settings menu. For those who enable Galaxy AI, Samsung states all personal data is processed in accordance with applicable laws. What do you need to try Galaxy AI? For now, Galaxy AI is only available on the newly launched Galaxy S24 lineup - the S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra models. Samsung currently provides all Galaxy AI features for free, though notes this is only guaranteed through the end of 2025. The company has also hinted that Galaxy AI will eventually make its way to other Samsung devices. How’s Galaxy AI different from Bixby? With the arrival of Galaxy AI, how does it compare to Bixby, Samsung's existing virtual assistant? Well, Bixby is Samsung's equivalent of Alexa or Google Assistant - focused on answering questions, controlling devices, and accessing information. Galaxy AI, on the other hand, represents a new generation of on-device AI that powers features like real-time translation and image generation. As Samsung moves away from Bixby, Galaxy AI appears positioned as its replacement over time. For now, both AI systems coexist within Samsung's ecosystem.",,,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'IE Premium', 'productID': 'indianexpress.com:showcase'}",,,[],,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/indian-express-logo-n.svg', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'width': 600, 'height': 60, 'caption': 'The Indian Express'}",en,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",,,,,https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-23,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",1932,JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,The Indian Express,"{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://indianexpress.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",2024,"{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/01/galaxy-ai-featured.jpg', 'caption': 'Real-time translation, automated replies, and more.

The company, which had disclosed a few months ago about being engaged in 250 generative AI powered projects, is also using the intelligence gleaned from Gen AI for making its ongoing work for clients faster, he added.Talking about the transformative potential of Gen AI, Ganesan said, ""the huge transformation that we also talk about that supplements assets and augment come by"" is just around the corner. He, however, did not provide a specific timeline, preferring to adopt a ""wait and watch"" approach to observe the technology's trajectory.TCS is actively preparing for the future of AI by investing in two key areas: Workforce training and strategic partnerships. The company is rapidly upskilling its employees, with over 150,000 said to be already trained in Gen AI skills in the last seven months. Optimism mixed with cautionWhen questioned about the potential impact of readily available consumer-grade AI tools like ChatGPT, Ganesan highlighted the complexities involved in enterprise-grade Gen AI solutions.

AI is producing ‘fake’ Indigenous art trained on real artists’ work without permission
One Indigenous artist said the process of using their art to train AI models that competes with them for work is a ‘very colonial mindset’.

People are training artificial intelligence on Indigenous art without the artists’ permission to create inauthentic works, which are selling online on platforms run by companies such as Adobe and eBay. 
Indigenous artists in Australia say their work is being stolen and turned into another threat to their livelihoods and cultures while they are already struggling to compete with the tens of millions of dollars worth of fake art produced every year by non-Indigenous artists.
Among the many jobs affected by the rapid development in generative AI, few have been as directly and immediately affected as visual arts workers. Usually trained on data scraped from the internet without permission, publicly available text-to-image generators let anyone produce instantaneously new images with just a few words.

While this new technology does add to the artist’s toolbox, workers say that AI is already taking their jobs. A group of researchers from Washington University and New York University analysed data from popular freelance platform Upwork and found that freelancers are already experiencing less employment and income since the launch of ChatGPT. 
Now, AI-generated Indigenous art is appearing on online marketplaces where art and derivative products are sold — often directly competing with the work from real Indigenous artists — despite the platforms often having policies that are supposed to protect Indigenous culture.
Both Adobe and Shutterstock run popular stock image websites where people can buy AI-generated images for a variety of commercial purposes. On each of them, there are dozens of fake Indigenous art-style images for sale (that have been marked on the platform as AI-generated). 
While many images are vaguely listed as being “Aboriginal” or “Indigenous”, some are more specific, like a Shutterstock image based on a prompt “Australian Aboriginal Art showing Gwion Gwion Bradshaw figures and Wandjina rock art depictions of the Kimberley Region in Western Australia”.
Adobe allows people to upload AI images for sale and earn money every time they’re purchased. The company requires sellers to only submit images for which they own the intellectual property, but it’s not clear how this is policed. Shutterstock sells images generated by users using the company’s on-site AI model trained on their images and as a result does not have this problem.

These images are already being used commercially. Adobe Stock image “An illustration based on aboriginal style of dot painting. AI Generative Art” appears as part of a graphic for a webpage about a panel hosted by the University of Western Australia on the Voice to Parliament referendum. Another example is childcare diary business Butler Diaries using an Adobe stock image as part of its web design. (The bottom of the company’s website features an Acknowledgement of Country that calls for the “continuation of cultural, spiritual and education practices” of Indigenous peoples.) 
These stock websites also feature AI-generated images of Indigenous peoples in the style of a photograph. They’re already being used on the internet, such as by the government-funded Mining and Skills Alliance, which features a picture of a generated woman to promote its efforts to “raise the profile of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women”.

AI-generated designs are also making it into the real world through other online marketplaces such as eBay and Etsy. Etsy is filled with cheap, digital AI-generated prints intended to be printed and framed, such as a $3.43 “Aboriginal Art print Australian Aboriginal Art Aboriginal Art Print Indigenous Art Australian Art Poster Australian Dot Art” whose seller notes in the listing “The images are my representation and I do not claim that they are anatomically or biologically correct”. Over on eBay, people sell goods with AI-generated goods like an “Aboriginal Art Culture Australia Cool Case Cover Silicone / Shockproof / MagSafe”.
Some of these platforms have policies that protect Indigenous intellectual property but it’s not clear whether they apply.

Adobe, which has a reconciliation action plan outlining the company’s various initiatives and objectives for helping Indigenous peoples achieve equality, has guidelines that state any content uploaded to its Stock service relating to race and ethnicity should be “correctly represented”. A spokesperson for the company didn’t answer questions about whether AI-produced Indigenous art violates this policy, instead giving a general statement: “We are continually auditing, evaluating, and improving the Adobe Stock collections to serve our customers’ needs,” it said.
eBay policies say sellers must not “list, sell or promote materials, products or services that use Indigenous cultural and intellectual property in an unauthorised way”, according to a spokesperson. Pressed on whether AI-generated art would violate this policy, they said how an artwork is created is irrelevant and that a listing “using Indigenous art in an unauthorised way” may breach it.
Neither Etsy nor Shutterstock responded to a request for comment. Etsy has a policy that prohibits users from selling items falsely listed as being produced by Indigenous peoples — but only in Northern America, and allows “Indigenous-style” products by non-Indigenous people. 
Amy Allerton is a Gumbaynggirr and Bundjalung woman who works as an artist and runs the Indigico Creative gallery, which sells original works and goods with Indigenous designs. She said art is hugely significant to her peoples’ cultures and that generating it through AI threatens the cultural integrity of their history.
“You’ve got non-Indigenous people being given the tools to create art based on our culture, which is a big no-no,” she told Crikey.

Allerton said the images that AI produces are “quite offensive” because of the mishmash of designs it produces. Many of the “Indigenous art” images produced by AI mix distinctive styles from different Indigenous nations and artists. 
Indigenous artists in Australia already face fierce competition from people producing “fake” Indigenous art, which are designs and products imitating Indigenous artists’ distinctive styles but produced by people with no connection to or with no benefit to Indigenous communities.
A 2022 Productivity Commission report found that 75% of Indigenous-style goods were created by non-Indigenous people. Online art businesses were particularly bad. One stock image site analysed by the commission had 80% of its Indigenous-style images authored by non-Indigenous people. Similarly, 60% of listings on a print-on-demand marketplace were also produced by non-Indigenous creators. 
Anthony Wallis runs Aboriginal Artists Agency, which helps artists earn income from the reproduction of their works. He said a significant amount of his work comes after the fact — when people and organisations use an artist’s work without their permission — and said it’s surprising how often enormous companies or important institutions don’t correctly license designs. He fears that AI will make this problem even worse.
“It’s frightening because it’s so cheap. It’s really dangerous from an artist’s point of view,” he said.
Allerton said it’s upsetting how AI models are being trained on Indigenous artists’ work without their permission and then used to generate work that competes directly with the artist.
“It’s a very colonial mindset that they are entitled to the entirety of us,” she said.
“Indigenous people don’t have the power for self-determination that we so want. This adds to the weight of all that. It’s like making me redundant. I think about myself, if I were made redundant, that would be devastating.”
