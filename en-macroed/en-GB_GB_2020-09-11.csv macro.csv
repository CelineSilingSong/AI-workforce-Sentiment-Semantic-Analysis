by Mark WalkerSeptember 15, 2020September 15, 2020LinkedInTwitterFacebookWhatsAppTelegramCopy LinkShareHumanity as we know it has gone through many revolutions — we’ve first discovered the power of water and steam, then came electricity, and now we’re here with technological revolution.Today, we are coming close to experience the fourth one too — the Artificial Intelligence revolution.Even though we now think we’ve seen it all, the AI revolution is going to make a change in the society just like the previous three did. Naturally, the revolution is going to affect all the aspects of our lives, including the business sphere.Since it’s inevitable that AI is about to transform our lives in the near future, the best thing we can do is learn how to use it to work for us and help our business grow.Why Is AI Important?We are all familiar with technology gadgets such as computers, drones, cameras, and even robots that can perform a specific action. They are powered by a specific software that allows them to perform a certain action — for example, WIP tracking software is there to help you track the work-in-process portion of the production phase.However, all these devices have so far been controlled by humans in order to do all those things correctly. The whole idea behind the AI is to make these machines think and act on their own, just like we humans do. Although it sounds like science fiction, this can be done using these machines to collect critical data and remember how to react in a specific situation the next time it takes place again.In other words, AI needs a lot of data in order to learn and make realistic decisions, and we are, for that matter, surrounded by data every moment of our lives. Thanks to these circumstances, AI has a strong base to become much smarter, faster, and more accurate in a very short period of time.The best example of this phenomenon is Netflix that gives you recommendations on what to watch next based on the collected data from your search history.How Can the Intelligence Revolution Help Your Business?No matter what you do in life, chances are you’re exposed to many tech gadgets on a daily basis. With the development of the AI, all these devices will start shining in a new light, just like we’ve explained above.This means you’ll be able to use the AI and develop your business faster if you do it the right way, and here we’re not only talking about office jobs where computers and other machines are widely used.Imagine, for example, the agriculture sector, and a farmer that takes care of a lot of land. Thanks to AI, the farmer will be able to make a perfect planting plan and make the whole farming process more efficient with less effort than ever before.The machines used for harvesting and other activities can be programmed to perform without anyone controlling them. Experts are working on developing machines that can identify whether the land needs watering and even differentiate ripe fruits from the rest.Now, when you realize how much the AI revolution can affect a niche such as agriculture, you can only imagine what it can do to businesses that already use some kind of sophisticated technology. One thing is certain though — a change shall occur in all aspects of our lives.All the business owners that oppose the new way of doing business are free to try and keep up the same pace, but they risk being outdated and discarded on their designated business market.Author Mark WalkerEditorial Director of the The Fintech Times LinkedInTwitterFacebookWhatsAppTelegramCopy

As organisations worldwide have had to shift to working remotely, technological measures have had to be taken in order to maintain operations. Keeping networks secure while employees use remote devices and home WiFi, continuing to collaborate on tasks and managing progress are among the challenges that have emerged while remote working, but AI has been able to aid effective collaboration.





With this in mind, we take a look at some particular use cases for AI within work from home (WFH) practices.
Developing skills
A digital skills gap proves to be a prolonged issue, but Paul Clough, head of data science at Peak Indicators, believes that AI can help to nurture skillsets within data science.

National Coding Week 2020: Closing the skills gap
With this year’s National Coding Week launching today, we explore what to consider when looking to close the skills gap across the UK. Read here
“If there’s at least two things likely to be here in the future, it’s remote working and AI,” said Clough. “So it feels like there could (or should) be opportunities for combining these and using AI to support remote working practices, and perhaps ways that remote work could impact AI.”
“Given developments in IT and data science technologies, e.g. cloud platforms, self-service AI and ML, collaborative tools, it is possible for people to continue building AI solutions in a remote and distributed manner (assuming their internet connection holds up) in ways that were similar to going into the office.
“The wealth of materials made available during Covid-19 for self-study means that people can also continue to learn and develop their skills, and perhaps even helping to fill the data science skills gap.”
Managing compliance
Compliance is another important issue that is ever present beyond the mass shift to remote working, as employees now need to manage documents and customer service from home.
“Many of the challenges around working from home revolve around knowledge of key systems and processes (or lack of) and compliance risk (moving from paperless offices to the home),” said Wayne Butterfield, global head of intelligent automation solutions at ISG. “These challenges are made more acute by the very nature of working alone rather than in the same office.

IoT governance: how to deal with the compliance and security challenges
As the IoT becomes more prevalent across an organisation’s network, the question of effective IoT governance becomes increasingly relevant. Read here
“For many organisations, it makes sense to use AI to help bridge these gaps. For example, image recognition can work with an employee’s laptop camera to spot additional people in the room, at which point their screen would go blank to aid with compliance.
“Desktop assistants can help customer service agents access knowledge quickly to resolve customer queries more efficiently, thus mitigating at least some of the problem that a lack of pooled knowledge creates with remote working.”
Sustaining communication and culture
Neil Dunlop, technical director at Infinity Works, cited a number of ways in which AI has been able to help workforces to continue collaborating effectively and sustain company culture.
“A range of AI-powered solutions exist that can solve some of the common remote working challenges,” said Dunlop. “The key to all of these applications is that AI takes the hassle out of the process by automatically doing what would usually take humans a lot of time to achieve. With the effective application of AI, we can smooth the bumps out of our busy working days and free up more time for creative thinking and focussed work.
“Smart AI solutions can help us find the right time to get the team together for a chat amidst packed calendars and back-to-back video calls. AI solutions can make smart suggestions on how multiple calendars can be restructured to make more free time and avoid diary clashes.

How to achieve unified communications during lockdown
How can unified communications be effectively achieved while lockdown continues to keep employees away from the office? Read here
“Working from home presents a host of challenges; lower quality equipment, shared working spaces and limited available bandwidth to name a few. Many of these challenges mean that the quality of our audio and video communication is less than ideal. AI is regularly applied to improve the quality of our video in real time and automatically filter out distracting background noises.
“Remote working can increase the feeling of being isolated or disconnected from workmates, lead to disengagement and even stress and ill health. Through sentiment and interaction analysis of everyday tools like email, messenger and other collaboration applications, AI systems can provide effective means of measuring employee wellbeing and engagement, highlighting where employees need help. Once problems are identified, AI systems can suggest support resources and activities that can help to make things better.”
Digital workers
Lastly, an emerging AI-related method of maintaining operations during remote working has been the use of digital workers.
“Digital workers are becoming essential for businesses, optimising something we’ve never been able to before: the bandwidth of employees,” said Ivan Yamshchikov, AI evangelist at ABBYY. “This is more critical than ever while most teams adjust to remote working. By ‘hiring’ digital workers and incorporating them into a workforce, businesses can empower their staff through AI, and these invisible digital workers – or software bots – can automate mundane and repetitive tasks extremely quickly, giving their human colleagues more time to take on creative, problem-solving tasks.

How digital workers are creating a work revolution
Digital workers are reworking how organisations are operating, helping them to overcome workload challenges. Read here
“In the current climate, an example of this is the thousands of finance teams helping their businesses keep the lights on from their own homes. By enabling digital workers to create and process invoices, human workers can spend less time on paperwork and more time working closely with the business and its customers, figuring out how to ensure employees are paid and helping the business survive.
“With the age-old fear of automation at work subsiding, IDC recently found that the role of digital workers will increase by 50% by 2021. Covid-19 might speed this up further, but right now, most business leaders still don’t know much about the AI behind the human – and its potential to transform their business. This needs to change.
“Companies that have their processes digitised or have already embarked on an automation journey can adapt more quickly to this, and their employees can reap the rewards. Digital workers will never replace human workers, but they can and should be used to complement the human workforce. As we all continue to work remotely, AI can help workers focus on adding the human touch – at a time when it matters more than ever.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 14, 2020 – The use of artificial intelligence to create art raises questions about how credit and responsibility should be allocated. In a recent study, MIT Media Lab researcher and PhD student Zivvy Epstein and MIT Sloan School of Management Prof. David Rand found that the answers depend on the extent to which people view AI as human: the more people humanize AI, the greater the responsibility they allocate to the technology .
“The language we use to talk about AI can impact the way people think not just about AI itself, but all of the stakeholders involved. In the art world, AI has the potential to become a major force in artistic endeavors and understanding how people perceive its role can affect the future of art,” says Rand.
Epstein notes, “The way we allocate responsibility is complicated when AI is involved. AI is simply a tool created and used by humans, but when we describe it with human characteristics, people tend to view it very differently. It can be seen more as an agent with independent thought and the ability to create.”
The researchers point to a portrait generated by a machine learning algorithm in 2018 that sold at Christie’s art auction as an example. A press release about the portrait stated: “an artificial intelligence managed to create art.” Other articles about the portrait emphasized the autonomy and agency of the AI. The initial estimate for the piece was $10,000, and it sold for $432,500.
Many individuals, including machine learning researchers, contributed to the portrait. However, only the art collective that selected, printed, marketed, and sold the image received the $432,000.
In their new study, Who gets credit for AI-generated art?, published in iScience, Epstein, Rand, and their coauthors focused on two main research questions: 1) How do people think credit and responsibility should be allocated to various actors in the production of AI art?; and 2) How do these intuitions vary based on people’s perceptions of the humanness of the AI system?
They found variation in the extent to which people attribute human qualities to AI. While some see it as more of a human-like technology that can make decisions, others view it as only a tool. The more someone sees AI as human-like, the more credit and responsibility they assign the AI.
The study also showed that perceptions about AI can be manipulated with language. The way AI is described has “material consequences,” especially on how people attribute responsibility and credit for the work, says Epstein. If it is described as simply a tool used by humans, then certain humans -- like the person who runs the code -- get more responsibility and credit. However, if it is described with human attributes -- like having the ability to create -- then the AI as well as the technologist who wrote that code get more credit and responsibility.
“Anthropomorphizing AI is risky because it can reduce and shift the accountability among humans. It may prevent the public from holding individuals responsible for their actions,” he says.
Rand adds, “It’s important to understand how the narrative impacts the way people perceive the role of AI in art -- and anything else where AI is involved. That narrative can affect incentives to create, collaborations among different parties, compensation, and liability.”
Additional authors of the paper include Sydney Levine of MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and the Department of Psychology at Harvard University, and Iyad Rahwan of the Center for Humans and Machines at the Max Planck Institute.

The MoU, which is the first of its kind to be signed between two higher education institutes from the UAE and Israel, covers a range of opportunities for collaboration, including student and postdoctoral fellows exchange programs, conferences and seminars, various forms of exchange between researchers, sharing of computing resources, and the establishment of a joint virtual institute for AI. 

This follows the historic Peace Accord agreement, which establishes full normalization of relations between the UAE and Israel. 
The MoU was signed virtually by His Excellency Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Chairman of the MBZUAI Board of Trustees, and Weizmann Institute President Professor Alon Chen, and was attended by officials from MBZUAI and Weizmann Institute.MBZUAI is the world's first graduate-level, research-based AI university. Based in Abu Dhabi, the University offers MSc and PhD programs in computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing. MBZUAI is introducing a new model of academia and research in AI, providing students and faculty access to the world's most advanced AI systems to unleash the technology's full potential. The Weizmann Institute of Science is one of the world's top-ranking multidisciplinary research institutions and offers masters' and doctoral-level degrees across five faculties. It is noted for its wide-ranging exploration of the natural and exact sciences. Institute scientists are advancing research on the human brain, artificial intelligence, computer science and encryption, astrophysics and particle physics. Dr. Al Jaber said: ""As a pioneering university, MBZUAI seeks out partnerships with leaders in their respective fields to further our collective scientific understanding and push the boundaries of technological innovation. Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to collaborate with such a renowned establishment as the Weizmann Institute of Science. Through this MoU we can leverage the expertise of both our institutes towards using artificial intelligence to address some of the world's most pressing challenges, from COVID-19 to climate change, and beyond.""Professor Alon Chen commented: ""We are thrilled to have the opportunity to collaborate with this unique, pioneering institution and to advance the field of artificial intelligence together. As a neuroscientist, I believe that AI is the extension of the power and intricacy of the human brain into the digital realm, and the implications will be vast, affecting our lives and our health, and the global economy. It is said that science knows no borders. I have every hope this collaboration, between scientists in the same region will be a shining example of this expression, and will extend the boundaries of human knowledge.""

She previous worked in B2B digital publishing with Innovation Leaders and Boston MedTech. Pamela holds a Master's degree in Media Ventures from Boston University. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  With the entrance of artificial intelligence and its capabilities of recognizing temperature, vibration, and other factors from sensors pre-built into machinery and vehicles, business leaders in heavy industry might be interested in the possible opportunities of predictive and preventative maintenance applications.  While predictive maintenance allows manufacturers to attempt to predict how long a piece of machinery will last, preventative maintenance involves repairing the machinery to keep it working longer. A 2017 report from Plant Engineering found that 51% of manufacturing companies now use a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). With the digitization of many manufacturing plants and the reported costs of reactive maintenance needed to fix machinery in mind, we have put together a list of five companies that claim to offer software using AI for predictive maintenance. These companies offer software for use in two applications: Asset Performance: The company’s primary goal is using sensors or other data to determine and notify manufacturers when a piece of machinery is broken or not working. CMMS Systems: Systems that both monitor asset performance and allow users to assign and track repair work orders. With this report, we hope to give business leaders in heavy industry insight on how companies claim to use AI to help manufacturers avoid high maintenance costs. Asset Performance Maximo Asset Health Launched by IBM, Maximo Asset Health uses data from IBM Watson and sensors prebuilt on to machines to determine if and when a piece of machinery or part will need maintenance. IBM claims the software also takes factors into account including the machine’s age and maintenance history. While we could not find a demo showing what the interface looks like for a user, the 1-minute video below  demonstrates how the product might be used:  Maximo Asset Health lists clients such as AGR Group, Australian Maritime Systems, Brisbane Motorway Services, ConnectEast, CNR International, Drax Power Station. According to a case study, AGR, which provides on-site maintenance services for oil and gas sites, approached IBM with interest in upgrading maintenance and workflow systems on their clients’ worksites. Because the systems were out of date, the study claims that finding data and problems with machinery became time-consuming and costly. The company upgraded their clients to Maximo and was, according to the study, able to consolidate all of the sites’ maintenance systems into one. They were also able to identify and report machinery problems on different sites more quickly and in a prioritized manner based on the readings from the software. Many team members affiliated with IBM Maximo do not have a master’s in computer science or a related AI field but have held software engineering roles within the company for many years. Progress DataRPM  In 2017, Progress, which provides IoT and data-driven solutions to clients in various industries, purchased the DataRPM predictive maintenance software for $30 million. The resulting Progress DataRPM product allows those working with machinery to track a machine’s health through data collected from sensors pre-built within the machine, according to Progress. A demo video or simple how-to guide could not be found for connecting and implementing the software. However, once it is connected, it seems to be similar to Maximo in that the company claims it uses sensor information on machinery to determine if the machine is slowing down or may need maintenance before it breaks down on the job. DataRPM said they assisted companies in connecting the sensors prebuilt into the companies’ machinery to their software. The company claims they can format the data collected from those sensors into formats such as a data lake or a user-friendly dashboard. After integration, a user, such as a manufacturing supervisor, could log into a panel with an Insights tab. From the tab, they can click on a machine and see its “Storyline,” which shows each of the software’s analyses of it. Each analysis shows how many anomalies were expected based on factors of the machine, such as age and maintenance history. After showing the expected anomalies, it will then show the number of anomalies that actually occurred during the test the software runs on the machine.  If more anomalies occur than expected, it would signal to maintenance personnel that a repair may be necessary for the machine. In a case study, one unnamed Fortune-100 manufacturing company approached Progress looking to optimize and quicken the pace of machinery fixes. The company was also looking to decrease funds on the inventory of spare parts that were not needed but purchased as a precaution, according to the study. The study did not give any further details about how much time or money these fixes could have been costing the company, but it noted that spare-part inventory costs were lowered by 57% as “worker efficiency” increased by 8%, although we do not know how “worker efficiency” was measured. The DataRPM software allowed the company to assign other tasks to employees with downtime during a planned fix. As such, the unnamed company claims this increased productivity of workers by 38 percent.  Progress does not list clients for DataRPM. This could be due to their recent acquisition of the software. Manufacturing clients who use Progress’ other data-driven products include the International Energy Service, FDM4 and Parker Hannifin. Progress’ automotive clients also include Toyota, Kauffman Tire, and ASA Automotive Services. DataRPM co-founder and CTO Shyamantak Gautam previously served as a technical architect at IBM. We could not find evidence of his academic credentials, and so we can not confirm if he has a firm background in artificial intelligence. While Progress has multiple data scientists with academic backgrounds in computer science, we could not find direct leadership with a robust AI or machine learning background. Dmitri Tcherevik, CTO of Progress, received his MS in Computer Science from National Research Nuclear University MEPhI. Predii Predii offers a platform where a user can log in and see alerts about maintenance that may be needed to prevent machinery breakdowns or a guide to fixing a piece of machinery. Like the software detailed above, the company claims it integrates with sensors already built into the machinery. The company claims to assist machinery supervisors in areas relating to automotive, maintenance and repairs, and manufacturing. It seems that Predii’s software is first connected to a fleet of machinery and its sensors. Then, a user who works with the machinery can open a dashboard which will notify them if a piece of machinery is not working or could be failing based on data collected by its sensors. From this notification, it seems that a user can click on a guide that tells them which specific parts must be replaced or how else they could fix the problem. While we could not find a demonstration showing how to use the software, this 4-minute promotional video briefly shows screenshots of the product and explains how it can be used:  The company does not list any case studies nor clients on its website, but Predii claims that its leadership recently met with NASA to discuss Big Data. The company also claims to have a partnership with Snap-On Diagnostics, a car diagnostics software company which uses Perdii to power their predictive maintenance application. The company’s CEO, Tilak Kasturi, holds an MS in Computer Science from the Florida Institute of Technology. He was also the Chief Architect for Time Warner’s interactive TV platform. We previously interviewed Kasturi about predictive maintenance on an episode of our podcast, AI in Industry. Hieu Ho, Predii’s Director of Engineering. holds an MS in Software Engineering from Santa Clara University. CMMS Systems GE Asset Performance Management  GE claims its Predix Asset Performance Management software is used to help automotive companies determine what parts may need to be fixed or replaced on machinery like planes, trains, and cars. According to GE, this tool connects with sensors already built into a vehicle and its parts.  After integration, a user can log into the Predix app and see a list of parts in a vehicle that the software flags as showing anomalies. A user can then click into different parts of the list and get information on them, such as their age or how long they have been working improperly.  When a user clicks into a specific machine’s dashboard, they can see information such as its temperature and prioritized alerts. When they click on an alert, they can get specific details. For example, the platform could alert them that a part within the machine is experiencing a higher vibration or temperature than usual. GE also claims its software allows users to create and assign work orders from a smartphone or tablet. The 2-minute video below details the software’s dashboard:  GE’s website presents a video case study on the Grove City Remanufacturing Facility, which repairs freight trains that travel throughout the US. The Facility, which began using GE’s software in 2013, is 240,000 square feet and holds over 350 employees which rebuild more than 1200 freight train engines a year, according to GE.  GE’s Predix software was implemented following a mass freight train digitization, requiring all trains passing through the Remanufacturing Facility to be tagged with a barcode and connected to the software. Today, when a train arrives, GE says the Predix software is first used to analyze sensor data about how the train was running in the past and if certain parts of it are damaged or newer than others. Through text-based alerts, the software can also show a factory employee what types of repairs it will need aside from replacing broken parts.  GE claims that the Remanufacturing Facility is required to have a train fixed within 10 days of arrival. This includes the time needed to analyze the problem, which they claim took more than five days before the digitization. Now, GE says the sensor analysis can take place in real time, which may eliminate employee downtime. The video case study is provided below:  Predix’s Vice President of Engineering, Jake Johnson, is the former CTO of GE Intelligent Platforms. He has also served as a software engineer at Intel and holds a BSE in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan. Emaint eMaint offers a predictive maintenance and task management software which similarly uses sensor information to determine when an item should be fixed. The company claims that after connecting machine sensors to the software, an employee that manages machinery can log into the software and see the anomalies the software found in the machine. The software then provides suggestions on when the machine should be looked at or fixed. When a user is looking at a page detailing one specific machine, a user can click to schedule a maintenance appointment or assign a task to an in-house technician to look at or fix the machinery.  The company claims it also offers condition monitoring, which allows a user to click on a part or piece of machinery on a desktop or mobile app and see charts and visualizations showing its rate of “noise, vibration, temperature, lubricants, wear, corrosion, pressure and flow.” eMaint claims its system can also identify if a new part is needed and connect with the manufacturing company’s part suppliers so a user can purchase or order a new part. The user can then track the part’s delivery directly from the software. We could not find a full demo of how the software is used or set up. eMaint claims that Westwater Treatment Plant came to the company with challenges related to machinery compliance, aging equipment, outdated technology and high-energy costs.  Along with sensor data, eMaint built a customized platform with data from the plant’s previous system. While the study did not give specific results, it reports that management at the plant was able to track and lessen the time between a piece of machinery’s logged failure and its repair. The system was also used to order and track new parts when failures were detected. eMaint was acquired by Fluke for an unspecified amount in September 2016. Fluke’s CTO, Oliver Sturrock, was formerly the manager of CIO applications at Accenture. That said, we could not find anyone on Fluke’s leadership team with a robust AI background This may be something business leaders in heavy industry may want to consider before working with the company. Takeaways for Business Leaders in Heavy Industry It seems that marquis companies like IBM and GE have the most mature products. Similar technology created by smaller companies is of interest to bigger companies, in the case of Progress’ DataRPM acquisition and Fluke’s buyout of eMait.  Whether they provide just asset management or also added maintenance management features, all of the applications claim to leverage already-built sensor data on machinery. All of them also seem to be compatible with at least one brand of smartphone, tablet, or personal computer. While most companies covered in this report provided demonstrations, case studies and walkthroughs of how the products worked after implementation, none of them provided the steps needed to connect the software to a piece of machinery’s sensors.  Business leaders should take note that it is unclear how much time it might take to integrate one of these applications to a fleet of machinery. Additionally, while some companies provide the cost of their software up front, they do not note if the help they claim to provide clients with integrating their software comes with its purchase.   Header Image Credit: Australian Valuations Related Posts Understanding Predictive Maintenance in ManufacturingThe hypothesis is simple: Equipment breakdowns or downtime is extremely expensive (imagine a train broken… Predictive Analytics in the Oil and Gas Industry - Current ApplicationsMcKinsey reported that most oil and gas operators have not maximized the production potential of… AI in Medical Devices - Three Emerging Industry ApplicationsMedical devices sector, part of the $3 trillion healthcare industry in the United States, is… AI for Exploration & Production (Upstream) in the Oil and Gas Industry - Current ApplicationsThe oil and gas industry is usually divided into three major operational sectors: upstream, midstream,… AI in Fintech - Current Applications and Use CasesIn their recent Worldwide Spending on Cognitive and Artificial Intelligence Systems report, IDC estimated that… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.

Organisations today are facing numerous pressures to enable a remote workforce, particularly in the IT function, since we have entered the post-Covid era. At a time when the traditional modus operandi is constantly being tested, there are some ‘new’ approaches that have actually been in use in other parts of the market for a while now.





We can take several lessons from the consumer tech world and how it leverages automation and AI to reduce maintenance and ease automation. Let’s take at the Nest thermostat as an example. A single thermostat changes temperature about 1500 times per year, so a large house with 3 thermostats changes temperature about 5000 times per year. In fact, it is the Nest cloud-based control plane that enables numerous capabilities beyond keeping your house at just the right temperature:

Thermostat software is always up to date;
It provides remote monitoring and alerts and supports remote administration to respond as needed;
It allows simple automation of your HVAC with home automation tools.

So while the end point is really important — that is, it has to tick the boxes to be considered as a replacement for a traditional thermostat — the real magic is in the features enabled in the cloud-based control plane. If you could apply this cloud-based control plane model to your data centre and edge storage infrastructure, what would that look like?
Tip #1: Seek out storage infrastructure equipped with Gmail or Tesla-like storage software updates.
As we all know, updating software on your external storage infrastructure is a huge headache, and can take weeks or months to propagate an update across a fleet of devices. And just when you finish, you get a new update from your vendor and it starts all over again. It’s a little like painting the golden gate bridge — once you get to the end, it’s time to start all over again.

How to avoid cloud vendor lock-in and take advantage of multi-vendor sourcing options
This article will explore how organisation’s can avoid cloud vendor lock-in and take advantage of multi-vendor sourcing options. Read here
It turns out that as much as 75% of the code delivered in storage array software updates are related to management, with just 25% related to the IO path. What this means is by leveraging a cloud-based control plane for your on prem storage, 75% of the updates just happen in the cloud as they are released. New features simply show up on your UI, much like your Gmail, or for those of you lucky enough to cruise around in a Tesla.
The IO path has a much smaller footprint, and can be distributed in small, less frequent and non-disruptive micro-updates. With these, you might first do a small update in your lab and assuming everything checks out, you push it to hundreds of endpoints with a single click.
Tip #2: Pivot from traditional storage management and monitoring to SaaS-based storage operations-as-a-service.
A number of storage platforms in the market today provide some level of cloud-based monitoring, but administration is typically done in a completely separate on-prem console. Alerts and troubleshooting are great, but co-locating AIOps and storage administration means you can have analytics & alerts in the same cloud that provides administration. That means immediate, even automated, action is possible on predicted current and future issues. Beyond maintenance, a unified AIOps administration approach lends itself to providing proactive recommendations to optimise performance, keep users happy, improve utilisation and ultimately spend less on capacity.

Delivering collective intelligence with the five pillars of AIOps
Guy Fighel, GM of AIOps & VP of Product Engineering at New Relic, explains how to achieve collective intelligence with AIOps. Read here
Tip #3: Demand simple programmability with a single endpoint in the cloud to automate your entire infrastructure
Make sure you have a single API-endpoint in the cloud to enumerate & automate all of your storage assets on-prem. Having a cloud-managed platform provides the visibility and orchestration of your assets across sites, servers and applications and you can take advantage of a single API in the cloud to then automate all or a portion of those as needed. You get an aggregated view, or you can filter by data centre or application, server group, etc. Then ask interesting questions like, where is there available capacity for a new project? What does my VMware utilisation look like? Which of my container deployments is performing best?

Generation Data: the future of cloud era leaders
Greg Hanson, vice-president EMEA at Informatica, discusses the importance of nurturing a new generation of cloud and data leaders. Read here
Perhaps the most important attribute of this approach is the fleet management benefits. If you have 1000 servers each with 10 SSDs and a critical SSD patch in needed, how would you handle that? A cloud-based control plane will allow you to roll out firmware updates across 10,000 SSDs with a single click.
By leveraging automation and AI, IT organisations can help ease the burden of their remote workforce with automated software updates, storage operations-as-a-service and simpler programmability for at-scale automation. With the right tools, the remote IT workforce might just be something that lives well beyond our current challenging times.

Q2 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more
Poker.org analysis of Indeed.com data showed that most AI jobs are being offered in states with high-population cities like California, New York, and Texas.

The Top States For Artificial Intelligence Jobs

California, 1,515 jobs, Top Cities: San Francisco (270) Santa Clara (214)
Virginia, 843 jobs, Top Cities: Arlington (146)
Washington, 592 jobs, Top Cities: Seattle (413)
Massachusetts, 573 jobs, Top Cities: Boston (190)
New York, 562 jobs, Top Cities: New York (379)
Texas, 447 jobs, Top Cities: Austin (158)

Poker.org also used Google Trends data to analyze the states where people search the most often for the term, AI Jobs. They also used keyword research tools to get a clear idea of how many times people in each state searched for that term.
The top states searching for artificial intelligence jobs the most were:

California
Texas
New York
Florida
Illinois

The AI job ads research also showed states with the highest number of remote jobs. The state with the most remote jobs is California (148), followed by New York (89). Texas (76), Massachusetts, (39), and Virginia (31).
Furthermore, the findings revealed US states that currently offer the most entry-level jobs in AI. With California leading again (351), followed by Massachusetts (126), New York (113), Virginia (110) and Washington (84).
However, the data also showed states with fewest AI jobs. These are Alaska, which is also the only state with zero AI job ads, Mississippi (2) and South Dakota (4).
Brendon Thomson, spokesperson for Poker.org commented: “Our research confirmed that AI jobs are growing fast, with thousands of new AI careers popping up around the country.
“It was great to see that not all artificial intelligence jobs, that are currently being advertised, are mid or senior level, but there are plenty of opportunities for AI enthusiasts to join the industry through an entry-level job. The same goes for the offer of remote artificial intelligence jobs in the majority of large US cities”

Methodology
Poker.org analysed Indeed.com in September 2020 for all 50 U.S. states. The company also compiled online search data for AI jobs in all 50 states, adding insights by using keyword research tools to find approximate search numbers for the key terms in every state.
