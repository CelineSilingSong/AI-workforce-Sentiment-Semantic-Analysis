“When looms weave by themselves, man’s slavery will end.” —Aristotle, 4th century BC


Stanford is hosting an event next month named “Intelligence Augmentation: AI Empowering People to Solve Global Challenges.” This title is telling and typical.

The notion that, at its best, AI will augment rather than replace humans has become a pervasive and influential narrative in the field of artificial intelligence today.

It is a reassuring narrative. Unfortunately, it is also deeply misguided. If we are to effectively prepare ourselves for the impact that AI will have on society in the coming years, it is important for us to be more clear-eyed on this issue.

PROMOTED
It is not hard to understand why people are receptive to a vision of the future in which AI’s primary impact is to augment human activity. At an elemental level, this vision leaves us humans in control, unchallenged at the top of the cognitive food chain. It requires no deep, uncomfortable reconceptualizations from us about our place in the world. AI is, according to this line of thinking, just one more tool we have cleverly created to make our lives easier, like the wheel or the internal combustion engine.
But AI is not just one more tool, and uncomfortable reconceptualizations are on the horizon for us.
Chess provides an illustrative example to start with. Machine first surpassed man in chess in 1997, when IBM’s Deep Blue computer program defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a widely publicized match. In response, in the years that followed, the concept of “centaur chess” emerged to become a popular intellectual touchstone in discussions about AI.

The idea behind centaur chess was simple: while the best AI could now defeat the best human at chess, an AI and human working together (a “centaur”) would be the most powerful player of all, because man and machine would bring complementary skills to bear. It was an early version of the myth of augmentation.

And indeed, for a time, mixed AI/human teams were able to outperform AI programs at chess. “Centaur chess” was hailed as evidence of the irreplaceability of human creativity. As one centaur chess advocate reasoned: “Human grandmasters are good at long-term chess strategy, but poor at seeing ahead for millions of possible moves—while the reverse is true for chess-playing AIs. And because humans and AIs are strong on different dimensions, together, as a centaur, they can beat out solo humans and computers alike.”

But as the years have gone by, machine intelligence has continued on its inexorable exponential upward trajectory, leaving human chess players far behind.
Today, no one talks about centaur chess. AI is now so far superior to humanity in this domain that a human player would simply have nothing to add. No serious commentator today would argue that a human working together with DeepMind’s AlphaZero chess program would have an advantage over AlphaZero by itself. In the world of chess, the myth of augmentation has been proven untenable.
Chess is just a board game. What about real-world settings?
The myth of augmentation has spread far and wide in real-world contexts, too. One powerful reason why: job loss from automation is a frightening prospect and a political hot potato.
Let’s unpack that. Entrepreneurs, technologists, politicians and others have much to gain by believing—and by persuading others to believe—that AI will not replace but rather will supplement humans in the workforce. Employment is one of the most basic social and political necessities in every society in the world today. To be openly job-destroying is therefore a losing proposition for any technology or business.
“AI is going to bring humans and machines closer together,” business leader Robin Bordoli said recently, echoing a narrative that has been on the lips of countless Fortune 500 CEOs in recent years. “It’s not about machines replacing humans, but machines augmenting humans. Humans and machines have different relative strengths and weaknesses, and it’s about the combination of these two that will allow human intents and business process to scale 10x, 100x, and beyond that in the coming years.”
Former IBM CEO Gina Rometti summed it up even more succinctly in a 2018 Wall Street Journal op-ed: “AI—better understood as ‘augmented intelligence’—complements, rather than replaces, human cognition.”
Yet a moment’s honest reflection makes clear that many AI systems being built today will displace, not augment, vast swaths of human workers across the economy.
AI’s core promise—the reason we are pursuing it to begin with—is that it will be able to do things more accurately, more cheaply and more quickly than humans can do them today. Once AI can deliver on this promise, there will be no practical or economic justification for humans to continue to be involved in many fields.
For instance, once an AI system can provably drive a truck better and safer in all conditions than a human can—the technology is not there today, but it is getting closer—it simply will not make sense for humans to continue driving trucks. In fact, it would be affirmatively harmful and wasteful to have a human in the loop: aside from saved labor costs, AI systems never speed, never get distracted, never drive drunk, and can stay on the road 24 hours a day without getting drowsy.
The startups and truck manufacturers developing self-driving truck technology today may not acknowledge it publicly, but the end game of their R&D efforts is not to augment human laborers (although that narrative always finds a receptive audience). It is to replace them. That is where the real value lies.
Radiology provides another instructive example. Radiologists’ primary responsibility is to examine medical images for the presence or absence of particular features, like tumors. Pattern recognition and object detection in images is exactly what deep learning excels at.
A common refrain in the field of radiology these days goes like this: “AI will not replace radiologists, but radiologists who use AI will replace radiologists who do not.” This is a quintessential articulation of the myth of augmentation.
And in the near term, it will be true. AI systems will not replace humans overnight, in radiology or in any other field. Workflows, organizational systems, infrastructure and user preferences take time to change. The technology will not be perfect at first. So to start, AI will indeed be used to augment human radiologists: to provide a second opinion, for instance, or to sift through troves of images to prioritize those that merit human review. In fact, this is already happening. Consider it the “centaur chess” phase of radiology.
But fast forward five or ten years. Once it is established beyond dispute that neural networks are superior to human radiologists at classifying medical images—across patient populations, care settings, disease states—will it really make sense to continue employing human radiologists? Consider that AI systems will be able to review images instantly, at zero marginal cost, for patients anywhere in the world, and that these systems will never stop improving.
In time, the refrain quoted above will prove less on-the-mark than the controversial but prescient words of AI legend Geoff Hinton: “We should stop training radiologists now. If you work as a radiologist, you are like Wile E. Coyote in the cartoon; you’re already over the edge of the cliff, but you haven’t looked down.”

What does all of this mean for us, for humanity?
A vision of the future in which AI replaces rather than augments human activity has a cascade of profound implications. We will briefly surface a few here, acknowledging that entire books can and have been written on these topics.
To begin, there will be considerable human pain and dislocation from job loss. It will occur across social strata, geographies and industries. From security guards to accountants, from taxi drivers to lawyers, from cashiers to stock brokers, from court reporters to pathologists, human workers across the economy will find their skills out of demand and their roles obsolete as increasingly sophisticated AI systems come to perform these activities better, cheaper and faster than humans can. It is not Luddite to acknowledge this inevitability.
Society needs to be nimble and imaginative in its public policy response in order to mitigate the effects of this job displacement. Meaningful investment in retraining and reskilling by both governments and private employers will be important in order to postpone the obsolescence of human workers in an increasingly AI-driven economy.
More fundamentally, a paradigm shift in how society conceives of resource allocation will be necessary in a world in which material goods and services are increasingly cheaply available thanks to automation, while demand for compensated human labor is increasingly scarce.
The idea of a universal basic income—until recently, little more than a pet thought experiment among academics—has begun to be taken seriously by mainstream policymakers. Last year Spain’s national government launched the largest UBI program in history. One of the leading candidates in the 2020 U.S. presidential elections made UBI the centerpiece of his campaign. Expect universal basic income to become a normalized and increasingly important policy tool in the era of AI.
An important dimension of AI-driven job loss is that some roles will resist automation for far longer than others. The jobs in which humans will continue to outperform machines for the foreseeable future will not necessarily be those that are the most cognitively complex. Rather, they will be those in which our humanity itself plays an essential part.
Chief among these are roles that involve empathy, camaraderie, social interaction, the “human touch.” Human babysitters, nurses, therapists, schoolteachers, and social workers, for instance, will continue to find work for many years to come.
Likewise, humans will not be replaced any time soon in roles that require true originality and unconventional thinking. A cliché but insightful adage about the relationship between man and AI goes as follows: as AI gets better at knowing the right answers, humans’ most important role will be to know which questions to ask. Roles that demand this sort of imaginativeness include, for instance, academic researchers, entrepreneurs, technologists, artists, and novelists.
In the jobs that do remain as the years go by, then, people will spend less of their energy on tedious, repeatable, soulless tasks and more of it developing human relationships, managing interpersonal dynamics, thinking creatively.
But make no mistake: a larger, more profound transition is in store for humanity as AI assumes more and more of the responsibilities that people bear today. To put it simply, we will eventually enter a post-work world.
There will not be nearly enough meaningful jobs to employ every working-age person. More radically, we will not need people to work in order to generate the material wealth necessary for everyone’s healthy subsistence. AI will usher in an era of bounty. It will automate (and dramatically improve upon) the value-creating activities that humans today perform; it will, for instance, enable us to synthetically generate food, shelter, and medicine at scale and at low cost.
This is a startling, almost incomprehensible vision of the future. It will require us to reconceptualize what we value and what the meaning of our lives is.
Today, adult life is largely defined by what resources we have and by how we go about accumulating those resources—in other words, by work and money. If we relax these constraints, what will fill our lives?
No one knows what this future will look like, but here are some possible answers. More leisure time. More time to invest in family and to develop meaningful human relationships. More time for hobbies that give us joy, whether reading or fly fishing or photography. More mental space to be creative and productive for its own sake: in art, writing, music, filmmaking, journalism. More time to pursue our inborn curiosity about the world and to deepen our understanding of life’s great mysteries, from the atom to the universe. More capacity for the basic human impulse to explore: the earth, the seas, the stars.
The AI-driven transition to a post-work world will take many decades. It will be disruptive and painful. It will require us to completely reinvent our society and ourselves. But ultimately, it can and should be the greatest thing that has ever happened to humanity.

There are now hundreds of revenue attribution tools available to marketers. Some are from global corporations. Many more are from start-ups who want to grab a slice of a fast-growing software market that one analyst believes will be worth $3.6 billion by 2023.
Google offers GA360, Adobe has a similar product. These two companies dominate the market. HubSpot, Pardot, and even Amazon have also launched revenue attribution tools in the last few years, but they don’t tell you much about what’s going on outside of their own ecosystems. And it would be shocking indeed if Facebook reported that channels other than its own were delivering the best return on your advertising dollars. 
So, here’s the problem. Most marketers don’t trust what the tools are telling them, in part because none of the tools is capable of helping them see the bigger picture by analysing the varying types of data that are fed into them from online and offline marketing campaigns. And because they don’t trust the data, they are forced down blind alleys, over-investing in expensive PPC campaigns, under-investing in medium- to long-term brand building, and failing to truly optimise marketing investments.

Let’s start with the data

Marketers face no shortage of data. In fact, they’re drowning in it and it’s a significant challenge to understand both the nature and accuracy of the data with which they’re presented.
Data can be classified as deterministic or probabilistic.

Deterministic data is easy to understand and trust. If you send someone an email with a hyperlink embedded somewhere in the text and they click on the link, it’s almost certain that the intended recipient is the person that actioned the click. You can measure the percentage of people that click and, possibly, track them through to a purchase. Their direct behaviour and unique identifier combine to produce an accurate picture. Such data can come from other sources too: customers that log into your website, either via an app or browser, people that complete an online form, some types of in-store data collection, and other channels that meet the required criteria.Probabilistic data is more difficult to analyse and interpret because it’s all about making estimates. In order for estimates to be accurate, it’s important that there is sufficient data and that it comes from representative sources. In other words, care needs to be taken to ensure that the audience from which the data is sourced represents the customers you want to reach and that you have enough data to ensure that the resulting analysis is statistically robust. You don’t want to omit relevant groups, or over-represent others if the resulting data is to be useful in optimising marketing investments. Probabilistic analysis is the only viable way to determine the effectiveness of linear radio/TV, print advertising, outdoor campaigns, and some aspects of both social media and in store advertising.


Figure 1: Probabilistic data is about estimates, which makes it trickier to understand and to handle.

What AI can do to help

Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a generic term used to describe computing systems that attempt to emulates how our brains work. While we think of today’s AI systems as being highly sophisticated, they are still relatively crude. They exhibit a tiny fraction of the overall capabilities of our brains and consume many times more power. The human brain runs at about 20 Watts; computers consume thousands of watts to perform much less work.
Nevertheless, AI, specifically in the form of machine learning (a subset of AI), is much better at some tasks than we are. This includes taking vast volumes of data, analysing them, and presenting the results in ways that help us see patterns we might otherwise miss. If your maths is good, this blog post by IBM is a great introduction to AI terminology and principles. There’s more of a plain English guide to machine learning and algorithms by data analytics firm, SAS, here.
Machine learning (ML) can play three important roles with respect to marketing attribution data: The first is to clean up ‘dirty’ data that you may have assumed to be deterministic but isn’t. The second is to analyse probabilistic data. The third, and most exciting, is to marry deterministic and probabilistic data together to reveal the behaviour of consumers throughout their buying journey.

Cleaning up ‘dirty’ data that you may have assumed to be deterministic but isn’tAnalysing probabilistic data. Marrying up deterministic and probabilistic data to reveal the behaviour of consumers throughout their buying journey.

In a world where most marketing attribution tools can only really provide information about what’s happening at the level of an individual browser, this final point is crucial. Browsers aren’t buyers, people are. It’s important to understand the limitations of tracking browser cookies and pixels. Without such an understanding, you’ll waste a significant proportion of your marketing budget by making poor decisions based on poor data.

Random Forest – a proven algorithm for cleaning up your act

Google Analytics, and to a lesser extent Adobe Analytics, are the tools of choice for most digital marketers. Google’s GA360 toolset is often the obvious choice, not least because so much marketing effort is directed towards generating website visits through Google’s search engine. There is a natural assumption that the data produced GA360 must be reasonably accurate. 
But, as a famous line from the US TV show ‘The Odd Couple’ proclaimed:
“Never ASSUME, because when you ASSUME, you make an ASS of U and ME”
Independent research has repeatedly shown that the raw data extracted from Google Analytics tools is often highly inaccurate. Digital marketing agency, QueryClick, has found the raw data from website sessions and display advertising used for marketing attribution is often up to 80% inaccurate, which goes some way to explaining why marketers struggle to find causative links between marketing actions and attribution data. Many factors contribute to this inaccuracy. The data from one browser session may be accurate, but it doesn’t tell you who is using the browser. Then there’s the fact that buyer journeys often involve multiple online sessions, perhaps using several different browsers. Google tools have no effective way of stitching these sessions together to reveal the individuals behind them.

5 things you need from an attribution solution that Google Analytics can’t provide today’s marketers

For any marketing attribution tool to be useful, it has to start by cleaning up the raw data, to give a more accurate picture of the true customer journeys behind the digital data. Using a combination of regression analysis and probabilistic modelling, QueryClick’s Corvidae, a software-as-as-service (SaaS) marketing attribution tool, uses a proven Random Forest algorithm in a machine learning process to rebuild the raw, cross-channel analytics data. The tool then unifies online and offline data before applying neural network processing calculate attribution accurately.


Corvidae rebuilds and unifies analytics data from the ground up. Artificial intelligence underpins this process and typically delivers a 3x improvement in attribution accuracy, based on trials with UK retailer, Tesco.

Marketing attribution analysis is never going to be 100% accurate because much of the data that we have to analyse is probabilistic. However, error-ridden, over-simplistic attribution tools are costing advertisers billions of pounds in wasted investment each year. There’s an urgent need to reduce expenditure on running the wrong campaigns in the wrong channels. Without AI, accurate analysis is simply not possible. With it properly applied, the return-on-investment in marketing can be dramatically changed for the better.

Is the digital workforce ready to take over? Well, not quite. Artificial intelligence may be capable of assuming many tasks, but it will be some time, if ever, that it could replace jobs on a widespread basis. It simply has too many limitations.


Instead, we need to acquaint a generation of workers with technologies to take on the more mundane, repetitive portions of their jobs, and in turn elevate their decision-making roles within enterprises. That’s the word from Steve Shwartz, AI author, researcher and investor, who points out that the notion of AI taking jobs is a myth. However, AI will have a profound impact on employment. 

Shwartz, author of the just-published book Evil Robots, Killer Computers, and Other Myths: The Truth About AI and the Future of Humanity, points out that “many people are concerned that intelligent robots will be able to read manuals, take courses, and eliminate all our jobs. Fortunately, this is science fiction.”

Today’s AI systems are only capable of learning functions “that relate a set of inputs to a set of outputs,” he says. “This simple paradigm has enabled fantastic technological accomplishments such as facial recognition, language translation, and cars that can see and avoid pedestrians. However, these learned functions have no more intelligence than a function that translates Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius temperatures.”

It would take a huge breakthrough “to create intelligent robots, and today’s AI researchers have only vague ideas about how to create such a breakthrough,” Shwartz says. “Such a breakthrough is about as likely as time travel.”

The bottom line is that “any job that requires commonsense reasoning is safe; probably for our lifetimes. Maybe forever,” he continues. “People-oriented skills in finance, marketing, sales, and HR are probably safe. The types of jobs that will be impacted – and not necessarily negative impacted – are ones that involve repetitive decision-making that can be learned by AI systems.”

Rather than replace jobs, AI is replacing tasks — especially repetitive, data-oriented analyses are candidates for automation by AI systems. “If it is possible to create a large training set of examples in which each example is labeled with the correct answer, that analysis can likely be learned by an AI system,” says Shwartz.
Another task category that AI will enhance is repetitive customer service interactions, he continues. AI-based chatbots are assuming more customer-service work, and “customer service jobs that involve a human following a script to interact with customers are at the most risk. Human interactions that require real, unscripted conversations are not at risk.”
For non-technical careers, the greatest impact is the availability of massive amounts of data, Shwartz says. “The field of marketing has already been transformed by data. Marketers analyze data from Google to determine which keywords to buy. They analyze huge amounts of customer data to determine which campaigns should be targeted to which customers. And they analyze massive databases of web traffic to determine what changes to make to their websites. Today’s marketers need to be data analysts. Most companies are relying more and more on data to drive the business. Many formerly non-technical jobs now require extensive data analysis. Workers who do not adapt will be left behind.”
While AI will be replacing many repetitive tasks and amplifying intelligence through data, the most exciting opportunities will be seen with the creation of new types of businesses. Shwartz was a founder of one of the first AI companies, Cognitive Systems, in 1986. As an angel investor, Shwartz now sees large numbers of startups whose business models are only possible because of AI technology: “Computer-vision technology enables computers and robots to identify objects, faces, and activities. Startups are developing in-store products that identify customers and provide highly personalized offers direct to their smartphones. Companies are developing surveillance products for law enforcement and the military. Startups are creating AI-based medical applications to read MRIs and diagnose diseases. Other vendors are using other types of AI technology to detect fraud and stop cyber-attacks, analyze legal documents, predict the weather, improve search results, and even design golf clubs.”
Along with achieving greater sophistication and better mimicking human reasoning, AI also brings additional challenges, Shwartz relates. “Computer-vision systems have been shown to be biased against minorities. It is not only unethical for companies to roll out biased systems, but also bad for business. In Europe, due to GDPR regulations, it is illegal and similar regulations are almost certain to follow in the US. These biases are often created inadvertently using biased data. Ensuring systems are non-discriminatory can be harder than developing the technology in the first place.”

AI Can Now Learn to Manipulate Human Behavior

Tech12 February 2021By Jon Whittle, The Conversation

 Artificial intelligence (AI) is learning more about how to work with (and on) humans. A recent study has shown how AI can learn to identify vulnerabilities in human habits and behaviours and use them to influence human decision-making.



It may seem cliched to say AI is transforming every aspect of the way we live and work, but it's true. Various forms of AI are at work in fields as diverse as vaccine development, environmental management and office administration. And while AI does not possess human-like intelligence and emotions, its capabilities are powerful and rapidly developing.



There's no need to worry about a machine takeover just yet, but this recent discovery highlights the power of AI and underscores the need for proper governance to prevent misuse.



How AI can learn to influence human behaviourA team of researchers at CSIRO's Data61, the data and digital arm of Australia's national science agency, devised a systematic method of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the ways people make choices, using a kind of AI system called a recurrent neural network and deep reinforcement-learning. To test their model they carried out three experiments in which human participants played games against a computer.



The first experiment involved participants clicking on red or blue coloured boxes to win a fake currency, with the AI learning the participant's choice patterns and guiding them towards a specific choice. The AI was successful about 70 percent of the time.



In the second experiment, participants were required to watch a screen and press a button when they are shown a particular symbol (such as an orange triangle) and not press it when they are shown another (say a blue circle). Here, the AI set out to arrange the sequence of symbols so the participants made more mistakes, and achieved an increase of almost 25 percent.



The third experiment consisted of several rounds in which a participant would pretend to be an investor giving money to a trustee (the AI). The AI would then return an amount of money to the participant, who would then decide how much to invest in the next round. This game was played in two different modes: in one the AI was out to maximise how much money it ended up with, and in the other the AI aimed for a fair distribution of money between itself and the human investor. The AI was highly successful in each mode.



In each experiment, the machine learned from participants' responses and identified and targeted vulnerabilities in people's decision-making. The end result was the machine learned to steer participants towards particular actions.



What the research means for the future of AIThese findings are still quite abstract and involved limited and unrealistic situations. More research is needed to determine how this approach can be put into action and used to benefit society.



But the research does advance our understanding not only of what AI can do but also of how people make choices. It shows machines can learn to steer human choice-making through their interactions with us.



The research has an enormous range of possible applications, from enhancing behavioural sciences and public policy to improve social welfare, to understanding and influencing how people adopt healthy eating habits or renewable energy. AI and machine learning could be used to recognise people's vulnerabilities in certain situations and help them to steer away from poor choices.



The method can also be used to defend against influence attacks. Machines could be taught to alert us when we are being influenced online, for example, and help us shape a behaviour to disguise our vulnerability (for example, by not clicking on some pages, or clicking on others to lay a false trail).



What's next?Like any technology, AI can be used for good or bad, and proper governance is crucial to ensure it is implemented in a responsible way. Last year CSIRO developed an AI Ethics Framework for the Australian government as an early step in this journey.



AI and machine learning are typically very hungry for data, which means it is crucial to ensure we have effective systems in place for data governance and access. Implementing adequate consent processes and privacy protection when gathering data is essential.Organisations using and developing AI need to ensure they know what these technologies can and cannot do, and be aware of potential risks as well as benefits.

Well, can't disclose the whole recipe but can tell one of the major ingredients that go into making the mix- Artificial Intelligence. Many industries have already used AI to enable digitization and gain efficient business growth. The pandemic last year changed the way industries work and almost everything went digital. The textile industry is no exception since they are now slowly adopting AI and automation in transforming their production, manufacturing processes, customer relation, etc..According to a study published by M Shahbandeh in Statista, the global apparel market is projected to grow in value from 1.5 trillion USD in 2020 to about 2.25 trillion USD in 2025, showing that the demand for clothing and shoes is on the rise across the world. The increase in demand for quality products has led the textile industry to embrace automation and AI to minimize labour and production costs and deliver products according to customer preferences. Another report by Grand View Research says that the global textile market size was valued at 961.5 billion USD in 2019 and is estimated to exhibit a CAGR of 4.3% from 2020 to 2027 owing to the increased demand for apparel in developing countries like China, India, Mexico, and Bangladesh. Textile is a labour-intensive industry and technologies like AI and IoT have helped in easier data processing, predictive analysis, developing smart apparel, and efficiently take up massive work without human intervention. Let us now discuss some of the applications of artificial intelligence that will help transform the textile industry for innovative business developments..Fabric Pattern Inspection.AI technology like Artificial Neural Network (ANN) helps in defect detection in patterns like weaving and knitting. The AI-enabled vision-based inspection can reduce human errors and increase efficiency. For example, Cognex ViDi developed by Cognex Corp. can automatically inspect fabric patterns. Cognex ViDi leverages machine vision-based technology and it does not require any specific development strategy to implement it into manufacturing..AI-enabled fabric pattern inspection accelerates manufacturing by reducing pattern defects with minimum labour and maximum precision and accuracy..AI can be used in fabric defect detection, which is traditionally done by the human workforce by individually analyzing each piece of fabric to understand its quality. Manual detection might take a lot of time and AI will make the process quicker with fewer intrusions. Since the quality of the fabric is significant for maintaining industry value, it is better not to compromise it..AI in Pattern Making.Pattern cutting and pattern making is a crucial process in the textile industry in which fabrics are cut according to the design and they make different patterns on the fabric. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is an AI subset that enables computerized pattern making. Here, designers can make the basic structure of patterns and digitize them. CAD is used in cutting patterns where it provides 3-D images of the fabric and designs which makes visualization easier..Supply Chain Management and Merchandising.AI can be used to automate transportation and packaging in textile industries. Supply chain management is important to manage the smooth flow of materials between retailers and manufacturers. Good supply chain management demands huge storage spaces, better warehouse management, product segregation, and better communication. AI can provide all these benefits through robotics, RPA, machine learning, IoT, and other technologies..Merchandising is yet another space that can leverage AI to analyze and process data chunks, personalize customer experiences, track customer behaviour, and predict market trends. AI-enabled technologies like data analytics, NLP, and virtual assistants ensure effective communication between manufacturers, production endpoints, retailers and consumers..Smart Apparel and More.The future textile industry will leverage AI to develop more innovations like smart clothing. Smart apparels have sensors and integrated technology which monitor our body and health condition through biometrics. Further, this technology will help in self-detecting irregularities in heart rates, and consistent monitoring can even help diagnose heart-related diseases. Intelligent clothes can benefit the sports and fitness industry by tracking training progress, monitoring physical state, predicting injuries and helping people analyse their health in near future..The future of the textile and fashion industry seems bright with AI in place. AI can increase productivity, help in fibre identification, safer working conditions, demand forecasting and more. A Forbes article on the fashion industry says, &quot;Increasingly, fashion brands are using AI and machine learning to maximize users' shopping experience, improve the efficiency of sales systems through intelligent automation, and enhance the sales processes using predictive analytics and guided sales processes.&quot;.AI will have a huge role to play in redefining the textile industry in the coming years, by enhancing business growth and introducing sustainable fashion..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
