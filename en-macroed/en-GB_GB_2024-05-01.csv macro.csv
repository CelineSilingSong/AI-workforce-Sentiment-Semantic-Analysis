In 2017, Savannah Thais attended the NeurIPS machine-learning conference in Long Beach, California, hoping to learn about techniques she could use in her doctoral work on electron identification. Instead, she returned home to Yale with a transformed worldview.At NeurIPS, she had listened to a talk by artificial intelligence researcher Kate Crawford, who discussed bias in machine-learning algorithms. She mentioned a new study showing that facial-recognition technology, which uses machine learning, had picked up gender and racial biases from its dataset: Women of color were 32% more likely to be misclassified by the technology than were White men. The study, published as a master’s thesis by Joy Adowaa Buolamwini, became a landmark in the machine-learning world, exposing the ways that seemingly objective algorithms can make errors based on incomplete datasets. And for Thais, who’d been introduced to machine learning through physics, it was a watershed moment.“I didn’t even know about it before,” says Thais, now an associate research scientist at the Columbia University Data Science Institute. “I didn’t know these were issues with the technology, that these things were happening.”After finishing her PhD, Thais pivoted to studying the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in science and in society. Such work often focuses on direct impacts on people, which can seem entirely separate from algorithms designed to, say, identify the signature of a Higgs boson in a particle collision against a mountain of noise. But these issues are interwoven with physics research, too. Algorithmic bias can influence physics results, particularly when machine-learning methods are used inappropriately. And work done for the purpose of physics likely won’t stay in physics. By pushing machine-learning technology ahead for science, physicists are also contributing to its improvement in other areas. “When you’re in a fairly scientific context, and you’re thinking, ‘Oh, we’re building these models to help us do better physics research,’ it’s pretty divorced from any societal implications,” Thais says. “But it’s all really part of the same ecosystem.” Trusting your modelsIn traditional computer models, a human tells the program each parameter it needs to know to make a decision—for example, the information that a proton is lighter than a neutron can help a program tell the two types of particles apart.  Machine-learning algorithms, on the other hand, are programmed to learn their own parameters from the data they’re given. An algorithm can come up with millions of parameters, each one with its own “phase space,” the set of all possible iterations of that parameter.Algorithms don’t treat every phase space the same way. They weight them differently according to their usefulness to the task the algorithm is trying to accomplish. Because this weighting isn’t decided directly by humans, it is easy to imagine that making decisions by algorithm could be a way to remove human bias. But humans do still add their input to the system, in the form of the dataset that they give the algorithm to train on.In her thesis, Buolamwini analyzed an algorithm that created parameters for facial recognition based on a dataset comprised largely of photos of White people, mostly men. Because the algorithm had a variety of examples of White men, it was able to come up with a good rubric for differentiating between them. Because it had fewer examples of people of other ethnicities and genders, it did a worse job differentiating between them.Facial-recognition technology can be used in a variety of ways. For example, facial-recognition technology can be used to verify someone’s identity; many people use it every day to unlock their smart phones. Buolamwini gives other examples in her thesis, including “developing more empathetic human-machine interactions, monitoring health, and locating missing persons or dangerous criminals.”When facial-recognition technology is used in these contexts, its failure to work equally well for all people can have a range of consequences, from the frustration of being denied access to a convenience, to the danger of being misdiagnosed in a medical setting, to the threat of being falsely identified and arrested. “Characterizing how your model works across phase space is both a scientific and an ethical question,” Thais says.Cosmologist Brian Nord has been thinking about this for years. He began using machine learning in his work in 2016, when he and his colleagues realized machine-learning models could classify objects observed by telescopes. Nord was particularly interested in algorithms that could decode the weirdness of light bending around celestial bodies, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Because such models excel at classifying items based on existing data, they can identify the stars and galaxies in images far better than a human can.But other uses of machine learning for physics are far less trustworthy, says Nord, a scientist in Fermilab’s AI Project Office and Cosmic Physics Center. Where a traditional program has a limited number of parameters that physicists can manually tweak to get correct results, a machine-learning algorithm uses millions of parameters that often don’t correspond to real, physical characteristics—making it impossible for physicists to correct them. “There is no robust way to interpret the errors that come out of an AI method that we can look at in terms of how we think of statistics in physics,” Nord says. “That is not a thing that exists yet.”  If physicists aren’t aware of these issues, they may use models for purposes beyond their capabilities, potentially undermining their results. Nord is working to push machine-learning capabilities to aid with all steps of the scientific process, from identifying testable hypotheses and improving telescope design to simulating data. He envisions a not-too-distant future where the physics community can conceive of, design, and execute large-scale projects in far less time than the decades such experiments currently take. But Nord is also keenly aware of the potential pitfalls of driving machine-learning technology forward. The image-recognition algorithm that enables a cosmologist to distinguish a galaxy cluster from a black hole, Nord points out, is the same technology that can be used to identify a face in a crowd. “If I’m using these tools to do science and I want to make them fundamentally better to do my science, it is highly likely I am going to make it better in other places it’s applied,” Nord says. “I’m essentially building technologies to surveil myself.”Responsibilities and opportunitiesPhysics is behind one of the most famous scientific ethical quandaries: the creation of nuclear weapons. Since the time of the Manhattan Project—the government research program to produce the first atom bomb—scientists have debated the extent to which their involvement in the science behind these weapons equates to a responsibility for their use. In his 1995 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance lecture, physicist Joseph Rotblat, who walked away from the Manhattan Project, appealed directly to scientists’ ethical sensibilities. “At a time when science plays such a powerful role in the life of society, when the destiny of the whole of mankind may hinge on the results of scientific research, it is incumbent on all scientists to be fully conscious of that role, and conduct themselves accordingly,” Rotblat said. He noted that “doing fundamental work, pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge… often you do it without giving much thought to the impact of your work on society.” Thais says she sees the same pattern being repeated among physicists working on artificial intelligence today. There’s rarely a moment in the scientific process when a physicist can pause to consider their work in a larger context.As physicists increasingly learn about machine learning alongside physics, they should also be exposed to ethical frameworks, Thais says. That can happen at conferences and workshops and in training materials online. This past summer, Kazuhiro Terao, a staff scientist at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, organized the 51st SLAC Summer Institute, which centered around the theme “Artificial Intelligence in Fundamental Physics.” He invited speakers on topics such as computer vision, anomaly detection and symmetries. He also asked Thais to address ethics. “It’s important for us to learn not just the hype about AI, but what kinds of things it can do, what kinds of things it can be biased about,” Terao says. Artificial-intelligence ethics research can teach physicists to think in ways that are also useful for physics, Terao says. For example, learning more about bias in machine-learning systems can encourage a healthy scientific skepticism about what such systems can actually do.Ethics research also provides opportunities for physicists to improve the use of machine learning in society as a whole. Physicists can use their technical expertise to educate citizens and policymakers on the technology and its uses and implications, Nord says.And physicists have a unique opportunity to improve the science of machine learning itself, Thais says. That’s because physics data, unlike facial-recognition data, is highly controlled—and there’s a lot of it. Physicists know what kinds of biases exist in their experiments, and they know how to quantify them. That makes physics as a field a perfect “sandbox” for learning to build models that avoid bias, Thais says. But that can only happen if physicists incorporate ethics into their thinking. “We need to be thinking about these questions,” Thais says. “We don’t get to escape the conversation.”

Customers and prospective buyers are gathering in Las Vegas this week for ServiceNow’s annual Knowledge event, where many will be seeking out guidance on how to progress generative AI projects in their organizations.
This time last year ServiceNow was making its early announcements regarding a partnership with NVIDIA and how it saw generative AI impacting enterprise workflows - but 12 months have passed and attendees will now be looking for more practical guidance about the impact of the rapidly advancing technology on their systems and work. 
Just a few weeks ago ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott told financial analysts during the vendor’s quarterly earnings call that process optimization is the “single biggest generative AI use case in the world”, where he believes that the company’s Now Assist tool will play a critical role. However, as diginomica has noted time and time again in recent months, buyers are facing some ridiculously difficult decisions at the moment, in the context of tough macro-economic conditions and in a market that’s progressing at a rapid rate. 
CEOs and board members are being told the generative AI is the future and that companies need to invest, whilst lines of business and technology leaders are being presented with an array of options by their chosen technology partners. With every vendor in the market announcing their own version of what generative AI looks like, and with buyers also having to decide whether it’s worth investing in their own models, it’s a confusing time - where it’s becoming increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction. 
And so, this week, ServiceNow’s primary objective is to present buyers with a compelling choice about why it is one of the platform choices that is worth pursuing, when it comes to generative AI. No announcements have been made yet, but on the eve of the event diginomica got the chance to speak with ServiceNow’s Chief Commercial Officer, Paul Smith, to get a better understanding of the choices facing buyers at this moment in time and what they should be thinking about as they make them. 
Smith agrees that enterprises are grappling with difficult decisions, saying that they are being asked to make choices that deliver value quickly. Up until now, he adds, enterprises have fallen into two camps: they’ve either been investing in popular offerings like Microsoft’s Copilot for productivity, or they’ve been taking a scattergun approach with multiple LLMs across multiple pilots. 
However, looking ahead, Smith argues that buyers will likely frame their decision making in a similar way to how cloud purchasing decisions have played out over the longer time - in that a few core platforms will win. He says: 
My personal point of view is it takes just as much corporate effort and energy to run those smaller pilots as it does to go and make a bold platform choice. And I personally believe that the organizations that are making those bets early, will get more gains…real gains.
The pendulum is definitely swinging more in favour of those platform choices. They’ve done the pilots, done some experimentation, they know this stuff works, they know they can derive value from it - but now they need to make some hard choices in terms of who their platform partners are going to be. 

The few that will make the most difference
Smith argues that enterprises have had the past year or so to experiment, but that now it is time for prioritization. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, ServiceNow believes that buyers will look to existing platforms to surface most of the value that they need. Smith says:
Every single week there's a new LLM…only by choosing what you truly want to prioritize are you going to make very very swift progress in this. It’s not that dissimilar to the world when you had a million different collaboration tools out there - but you choose your particular flavour. 

Smith acknowledges that there’s currently a fight in the enterprise software industry to be the ‘compiler’, the platform that mediates and manages all the other generative AI offerings. However, businesses are going to have to choose - and Smith believes that this choice will come down to the platforms that are going to make the most difference to employees and organizations, delivering the most value as quickly as possible. He adds: 
I do see the world coalescing around two or three [platforms] and I'm confident that we're going to be one of those two or three

It could be argued that ServiceNow is well positioned to take advantage of this decision making time amongst buyers, given that its core proposition for the past few years has been that it is the ‘platform of platforms’. McDermott has consistently said that the purchase of the Now platform is not a zero sum game in the cloud industry, given that ServiceNow integrates into systems of record and acts as a unifier across the enterprise to get work done. I expect this proposition will become more critical to the vendor over the coming months and years, as it argues that it can surface enterprise data for generative AI use across all silos. As Smith notes: 
ServiceNow comes along and provides one pane of glass across all, [allowing you to] get work done, as it moves across those different silos. That now goes into the world of generative AI where human language is the primary interface into the business, whether that’s written or spoken - it just amplifies that even more. I can now go into a single pane of glass, or even a single virtual agent, to accomplish all of that work.
All of that automation you've already invested in, all of the digitization and the value you're getting from ServiceNow, you're actually just surfacing that, making it even more useful, because now you're able to call upon it and do it from simple conversational tasks.

My take
It was good to catch up with Smith, who is now leading a large team in the US, framing his go to market strategy around generative AI. I believe his sentiments will likely also frame the coming week at Knowledge ‘24. I expect ServiceNow to argue that its role over the past few years has been to automate the flow of work across the enterprise, by integrating into systems of record, and that it makes sense for buyers to choose its platform as the ‘service-based’ generative AI tool for business, given that already acts as a ‘unifier’. 
If Microsoft or Google are going to ‘own’ generative AI for productivity and collaboration, ServiceNow wants to be the vendor that owns generative AI for work fulfilment and service execution. It’s becoming clear to me that these are how the bubbles will form around generative AI in the industry - which vendor has the best data for the jobs humans currently do in the enterprise? If you use Microsoft or Google for collaboration, they probably have the best data for that. As we saw last week with Qualtrics, it probably has the best data for experience management. Marketing, you’re probably going to look to Adobe or similar. Equally, for service-based work, you’re probably going to look to a vendor like ServiceNow. 
There’s likely lots of change to come, as we saw with the advancements in cloud computing - new vendors and companies emerged as buyers sought out new operating and business models. However, what we should be looking at is: who holds data around specific knowledge tasks? Because it looks like generative AI will now be able to play a big role there and those vendors will be pushing aggressively on that front. And what impact will this have on those roles in the enterprise as a result? 
Plenty more to come over the coming week, so stay tuned to diginomica for all the announcements and analysis from Knowledge, on the ground in Vegas.

Nvidia continues to invest in AI initiatives and the most recent one, ChatRTX, is no exception thanks to its most recent update. ChatRTX is, according to the tech giant, a “demo app that lets you personalize a GPT large language model (LLM) connected to your own content.” This content comprises your PC’s local documents, files, folders, etc., and essentially builds a custom AI chatbox from that information.Because it doesn’t require an internet connection, it gives users speedy access to query answers that might be buried under all those computer files. With the latest update, it has access to even more data and LLMs including Google Gemma and ChatGLM3, an open, bilingual (English and Chinese) LLM. It also can locally search for photos, and has Whisper support, allowing users to converse with ChatRTX through an AI-automated speech recognition program.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksGoVisionaryProfitMan Who Picked Nvidia Before Jump Reveals New PredictionGoVisionaryProfitLearn MoreUndoNvidia uses TensorRT-LLM software and RTX graphics cards to power ChatRTX’s AI.

Can AI escape its ethical dilemma?The concept of an AI chatbot using local data off your PC, instead of training on (read: stealing) other people’s online works, is rather intriguing. It seems to solve the ethical dilemma of using copyrighted works without permission and hoarding it. It also seems to solve another long-term problem that’s plagued many a PC user — actually finding long-buried files in your file explorer, or at least the information trapped within it.However, there’s the obvious question of how the extremely limited data pool could negatively impact the chatbot. Unless the user is particularly skilled at training AI, it could end up becoming a serious issue in the future. Of course, only using it to locate information on your PC is perfectly fine and most likely the proper use. But the point of an AI chatbot is to have unique and meaningful conversations. Maybe there was a time in which we could have done that without the rampant theft, but corporations have powered their AI with stolen words from other sites and now it’s irrevocably tied.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Given that it's highly unethical that data theft is the vital part of the process that allows you to make chats well-rounded enough not to get trapped in feedback loops, it’s possible that Nvidia could be the middle ground for generative AI. If fully developed, it could prove that we don’t need the ethical transgression to power and shape them, so here's to hoping Nvidia can get it right.You might also likeI finally found a practical use for AI, and I may never garden the same againMy jaw hit the floor when I watched an AI master one of the world's toughest gamesI tried to give an AI an existential crisis, and it tricked me into leaving it alone

  There is considerable disagreement about the growth potential of artificial intelligence. Though emerging micro-level evidence shows substantial improvements in firm productivity and worker performance, the macroeconomic effects are uncertain. This column argues that the promise of AI-related economic growth and social welfare hinges on the rate of adoption and its interplay with labour markets. Policies should focus on both domestic and global governance issues – including threats to market competition and increased inequality – and do so rapidly to keep pace with fast-evolving AI.

As the burden of documentation and various other administrative duties has increased, physician burnout has reached historical levels. In response, EHR vendors are embedding generative AI tools to aid physicians by drafting their responses to patient messages. However, there is a lot that we don’t yet know about these tools’ accuracy and effectiveness.
Researchers at Mass General Brigham recently conducted research to learn more about how these generative AI solutions are performing. They published a study last week in The Lancet Digital Health showing that these AI tools can be effective at reducing physicians’ workloads and improving patient education — but also that these tools have limitations that require human oversight.
For the study, the researchers used OpenAI’s GPT-4 large language model to produce 100 different hypothetical questions from patients with cancer.

					With hospitals struggling to retain staff and value-based care shrinking healthcare revenues, health systems must look to technology resources to become more efficient, without losing sight of patient care or staff support.				








The researchers had GPT-4 answer these questions, as well as six radiation oncologists who responded manually. Then, the research team provided those same six physicians with the GPT-4-generated responses, which they were asked to review and edit.
The oncologists could not tell whether GPT-4 or a human physician had written the responses — and in nearly a third of cases, they believed that a GPT-4-generated response had been written by a physician.
The study showed that physicians usually wrote shorter responses than GPT-4. The large language model’s responses were longer because they usually included more educational information for patients — but at the same time, these responses were also less direct and instructional, the researchers noted.




Overall, the physicians reported that using a large language model to help draft their patient message responses was helpful in reducing their workload and associated burnout. They deemed GPT-4-generated responses to be safe in 82% of cases and acceptable to send with no further editing in 58% of cases.

But it’s important to remember that large language models can be dangerous without a human in the loop. The study also found that 7% of GPT-4-produced responses could pose a risk to the patient if left unedited. Most of the time, this is because the GPT-4-generated response has an “inaccurate conveyance of the urgency with which the patient should come into clinic or be seen by a doctor,” said Dr. Danielle Bitterman, who is an author of the study and Mass General Brigham radiation oncologist.
“These models go through a reinforcement learning process where they are kind of trained to be polite and give responses in a way that a person might want to hear. I think occasionally, they almost become too polite, where they don’t appropriately convey urgency when it is there,” she explained in an interview.




Moving forward, there needs to be more research about how patients feel about large language models being used to interact with them in this way, Dr. Bitterman noted.

Many AI-savvy companies are moving past the Generative AI infatuation stage and beginning to make serious changes to turn workplace adoption into a reality, according to an April 29 report from Deloitte’s AI Institute. 
The report, based on a survey of nearly 2,000 director to C-suite leaders who are directly involved in piloting or implementing AI at their organizations, found that three-quarters of leaders said they’re looking to change their talent strategies in the next two years due to generative AI, particularly with a focus on work processes and upskilling or reskilling employees.




















“As we move from possibilities to practicalities in enterprise Generative AI adoption, scaling up and skilling up go hand in hand,” Deborshi Dutt, artificial intelligence strategic growth offering lead and principal at Deloitte Consulting LLP, said in a statement.
“Organizations are hiring new talent and training their workforce, with both technical and human-centered skills remaining valuable to successful deployment,” Dutt said. “To help stay competitive in an ever-evolving market, it is crucial for leaders to foster trust and remain focused on AI fluency when evolving their workforce to meet this moment of transformation.”
Only 37% of respondents said their organizations were slightly or not at all prepared to address talent concerns related to generative AI adoption. In addition, 39% said they plan to increase head count during the next 12 months due to generative AI initiatives.
Leaders pointed to efficiency and productivity as the most anticipated benefits of generative AI adoption, and although many are reporting benefits, most aren’t realizing the full extent so far. 
At the same time, lack of trust continues to be a top barrier to large-scale adoption. Although most leaders reported their organization’s trust in all forms of AI has increased since 2022, only 36% said they measure worker trust and engagement as part of their talent strategy. Beyond that, fewer than half said they’re focused on processes to build trust in generative AI. 
In a Pearl Meyer report, many company leaders said they’re shifting their organizational structure in response to AI adoption at work. They’re making significant AI talent investments, developing change management strategies and implementing employee communication plans.

Amid the shifting AI landscape, talent leaders said they face uncertainty in 2024 due to AI and work design changes, according to a Mercer report. About 40% of HR pros said they have “AI workflows” on their agenda and plan to prioritize ways to redesign work to incorporate AI and automation.
Although 82% of companies appear to be investing in AI, half aren’t sure about the business impact or implementation, according to an Orgvue report. Leaders cited barriers to AI adoption such as a lack of organizational expertise, employee skepticism and lagging regulations.

Nearly 65,000 people were cut from their jobs at U.S. based companies in April according to a report released Thursday by career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas , with continued cuts in the technology sector, a large layoff at Tesla and the replacement of jobs by artificial intelligence largely to blame.

Key Facts


At 64,789, April's job cuts were down significantly from the 90,000 cuts announced in March and slightly down from the 66,995 announced in April of 2023.



So far this year, almost 325,000 jobs have been slashed, down 4.6% from the jobs that had been eliminated by this time last year, according to the report.



Tesla's announcement that it would cut roughly 14,000 employees—about 10% of its workforce—made automotive the single sector with the largest number of cuts last month, and automakers have cut more than 20,000 jobs this year, twice as much as were cut by April of 2023.



Technology remains the sector with the highest number of job cuts on the year at 47,436. Of the cuts across sectors, 800 lost jobs were blamed on AI, the highest number of layoffs citing the reason since May of 2023.


Employers announced plans to hire 9,802 new workers in April, bringing the total number of new jobs announced this year to 46,597, the lowest total in the first four months of the year since 2016.

Surprising Fact
The Challenger report this month said 80 cut jobs could be directly blamed on Texas Senate Bill 17, which prohibited higher education institutions in the state from participating in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Among those cuts were 60 employees who lost their job at the University of Texas alone. The college announced the cuts in a message to campus last month.
PROMOTED
Big Number
5 months. That was the average duration of unemployment in March, compared to 4.4 months during the same period in 2023. Unemployment is expected to rise slightly to 3.9%.
Contra
Despite the slow hiring, the unemployment rate has remained largely unchanged over the last year. Unemployment was 3.8% in March, down slightly from 3.9% in February, but continuing a trend that hasn’t seen the rate rise above 4% in 26 consecutive months. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its monthly jobs report on Friday.

Joanna Andreasson/DALL-E4 The term wicked problem has become a standard way for policy analysts to describe a social issue whose solution is inherently elusive. Wicked problems have many causal factors, complex interdependencies, and no ability to test all of the possible combinations of plausible interventions. Often, the problem itself cannot be articulated in a straightforward, agreed-upon way. Classic examples of wicked problems include climate change, substance abuse, international relations, health care systems, education systems, and economic performance. No matter how far computer science advances, some social problems will remain wicked.

Could that technological advance give bureaucrats the tool they have been missing to allow them to plan a more efficient economy? Many advocates of central planning seem to think so. Their line of thinking appears to be:  Chatbots have absorbed an enormous amount of data. Large amounts of data produce knowledge. Knowledge will enable computers to plan the economy.  These assumptions are wrong. Chatbots have been trained to speak using large volumes of text, but they have not absorbed the knowledge contained in the text. Even if they had, there is knowledge that is critical for economic operations that is not available to a central planner or a computer.

The Promise of Pattern Matching The new chatbots are trained on an enormous amount of text. But they have not absorbed this data in the sense of understanding the meaning of the text. Instead, they have found patterns in the data that enable them to write coherent paragraphs in response to queries. Loosely speaking, there are two approaches to embedding skills and knowledge into computer software. One approach is to hard-code the sort of heuristics that a human being is able to articulate. In chess, this would mean explicitly coding formulas that reflect how people would weigh various factors in order to choose a move. In loan underwriting, it would mean spelling out how an experienced loan officer would regard a borrower's history of late credit-card payments in order to decide whether to make a new loan. The other approach is pattern matching. In chess, that would mean giving the computer a large database of games that have been played, so that it can identify and distinguish positions that tend to result in wins. When the computer then plays the game, it would select moves that create positions that fit a winning pattern. In loan underwriting, pattern matching would mean looking at a large historic sample of approved loans to find characteristics that distinguish the borrowers who subsequently repaid the money from those who subsequently defaulted. It would then recommend approving loans where the credit report resembles the pattern of a borrower who is likely to repay. Human beings use both pattern matching and explicit heuristics. An experienced chess player will not try to calculate the advantages and disadvantages of every single possible move in a position. Instead, the player will immediately recognize a pattern in the position, and this will intuitively suggest a few possible moves. The player will then make a more careful analysis to choose from among those moves. In speed chess, a player relies more on pattern recognition and less on heuristics and careful thought. If you are on a hike, you may instinctively flinch when you see something that resembles the pattern of a snake. But then you will stop and reason about what you see. If it is not moving, you may conclude that it is merely a stick. In American football, the quarterback may call a play based on careful reasoning about what the defense is likely to do in a situation. But once the play starts, the quarterback has to make instantaneous decisions based on what his instinct tells him about what the defense is doing. For these decisions, the quarterback is pattern matching. We tend to pride ourselves on our ability to use heuristics and careful reasoning. When we examine our own thought processes, we do not think of ourselves as mere pattern matchers. But the latest advances in computer science rely heavily on pattern matching. ChatGPT has studied an enormous corpus of text in order to find patterns in how words are used in relation to one another, without having been given any instruction about what the words mean. Many experts, who assumed computers would have to be programmed to know the meaning of words, are surprised that this pattern matching works as well as it does. When you type a comment or a question into ChatGPT, not only will it respond by putting words in proper order; the response is usually meaningful, relevant, and appropriate. It is almost mysterious how this happens. To a chatbot, a word is a mere ""token,"" like a tiny square of cloth with a particular color. All it knows is which squares of cloth tend to appear near each other in the patterns that are in its training dataset. One at a time, it places squares of cloth in a sequence, and when the sequence is read as words it makes sense to a human reader. Pattern matching also works with images. You can give a computer a prompt to draw an image; based on the patterns it finds, it will produce an image that follows the instructions in the prompt. The same pattern-matching technique can be applied to working with computer code, sounds, and video. A Natural Language Revolution These new tools revolutionize the way that people and computers communicate, because now computers can respond to our language. Before, we had to learn the computer's language. The first computers only understood ""machine language,"" consisting of sets of zeroes and ones. An improvement was provided by ""assembly language."" Beyond assembly language were ""programming languages,"" such as COBOL, FORTRAN, and BASIC. About 40 years ago, most of us began communicating via the ""user interface."" We learned to manipulate a cursor and click on a mouse. Later we learned to use gestures on a phone. With ChatGPT, we can communicate with a computer using ""natural language."" We type something in English, and we get a response in English. This is a superpower, and we are just starting to learn how to take advantage of it. I wanted to be able to judge essays based on how well they address differing points of view. Can a computer do this for me? If I had to design, code, and test a program to do so, it would take months of work. But after spending a few hours experimenting with and refining prompts, I can get ChatGPT to perform this essay-grading task. Pattern matching also lets computers respond to and mimic the emotional content of human writing. Chatbots do not merely retrieve information—for that purpose they may actually be less reliable than a Google search. They respond in paragraphs, using human phrasing and tone. Because they communicate in natural language, ChatGPT and its relatives can do impersonations. Economist and public intellectual Tyler Cowen used a chatbot to conduct an ""interview"" with Jonathan Swift, the early 18th century satirist. Prompted to impersonate Swift, the chatbot responded to questions from Cowen. For example, Cowen asked about Swift's attitude toward the Church of Ireland. The chatbot responded, in part: ""Ah, dear reader, it is indeed true that I, Jonathan Swift, harbored a certain degree of skepticism towards religious doctrine. Yet, one must not confuse this skepticism with a lack of faith or an aversion to the church altogether. Indeed, I was ordained a priest in the Church of Ireland, and throughout my life, I served in various capacities within its structure. ""Now, you may wonder how a man of my disposition could reconcile these seemingly contradictory stances,"" it continued. ""The answer, I daresay, lies in the understanding that the church and the state must work in concert to maintain order and stability within society. The Church of Ireland, as an established state church, served as an important institution that promoted social cohesion and provided moral guidance to the people."" Chatbots can impersonate celebrities, therapists, companions, and romantic partners. They are able to connect to us emotionally to an extent that far exceeds any previous computer programs. The implications of this advance may be profound. A few decades ago, math teacher Jaime Escalante became famous for motivating teenagers in a high-poverty school to learn calculus at an Advanced Placement level. His demanding, confrontational style and striking accomplishments were immortalized in a film, Stand and Deliver. Imagine being able to clone Escalante and put him in classrooms across the country. Or consider the problem of training a robot. Today that involves working in computer code, but within a few years we should be able to communicate with robots using natural language. Customer support calls are another area with obvious potential. All of us have experienced the frustration of menu systems (""If you are calling about , press 1""). Thankfully, those systems may soon be obsolete. Instead, a chatbot can quickly catch on to the customer's question or respond sympathetically to the customer's complaint. Some enthusiasts see chatbots becoming lifelong companions. Futurist Peter Diamandis has predicted that ""you'll ultimately give your personal AI assistant access to your phone calls, emails, conversations, cameras…every aspect, of every moment, of your day. Our personal AIs will serve (and we may become dependent upon them) as our cognitive collaborators, our on-demand researcher, our consigliere, our coaches…giving us advice on any and all topics that require unbiased wisdom."" Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has argued similarly that within a few years every child will grow up with a personal chatbot as a lifelong partner. Your personal chatbot would have the ability to understand your abilities and desires. It would be able to motivate you, coach you, train you, and serve you. It is too early to know which of these forecasts will actually pan out and which will fail to materialize, let alone what unexpected uses will appear out of nowhere. This is reminiscent of the World Wide Web circa 1995, when many of us anticipated rapid disruptions in education or the real estate market that have yet to occur. Meanwhile, nobody was predicting real-time driving directions or podcasting. Limited Knowledge Chatbots use pattern matching to provide coherent, relevant responses. But that does not mean that they have encyclopedic knowledge. The answers that a chatbot gives are not necessarily wise. They are not even necessarily true. I have written several papers on the 2008 financial crisis, in which I make a case for what I believe were the most important causal factors. But when I asked ChatGPT to summarize my views on the crisis, it included explanations that are favored by other economists but not me. That is because the chatbot is trained to identify word patterns without knowing what the words mean. Some knowledge is not available in any corpus of data. For example, we cannot predict how an innovation will play out. As of this writing, Apple has introduced a revolutionary product it calls the Vision Pro. No one knows exactly how this product will be used, or whether it will be successful. This knowledge will emerge over time, with the market providing the ultimate judgment. As economist Friedrich Hayek wrote, market competition is a discovery procedure. Even if a computer possessed all of present knowledge, it could not replace this discovery procedure. Central Planning Still Won't Work Economic organization is a wicked problem. Your intuition might be that the best approach would be for a department of experts to determine what goods and services get produced and how they are distributed. This is known as central planning, and it has not worked well in reality. The Soviet Union fell in part because its centrally planned economy could not keep up with the West. Some advocates of central planning have claimed that computers could provide the solution. In a 2017 Financial Times article headlined ""The Big Data revolution can revive the planned economy,"" columnist John Thornhill cited entrepreneur Jack Ma, among others, claiming that eventually a planned economy will be possible. Those with this viewpoint see central planning as an information-processing problem, and computers are now capable of handling much more information than are individual human beings. Might they have a point? F.A. Hayek made a compelling counterargument. In a famous paper called ""The Use of Knowledge in Society,"" first published in 1945, Hayek argued that some information is tacit, meaning that it will never be articulated in a form that can be input to a computer. He also argued that some information is dispersed, meaning that it is known only in small part to any one person. Given the decentralized character of information, a market system generates prices, which in turn generate the knowledge necessary to efficiently organize an economy. A central computer is not going to know how you as an individual would trade off between two goods. You may not be able to articulate your preferences yourself, until you are confronted with a choice at market prices. The computer is not going to know how consumers will respond to a new product or service, and it is not going to know how a new invention might change production patterns. The trial-and-error process of markets, using prices, profits, and losses, addresses these challenges. Economists have a saying that ""all costs are opportunity costs."" That is, the cost of any good is the cost of what you have to forgo in order to obtain it. In other words, cost is not inherent in the nature of the good itself or how it is produced. It is impossible to know the cost of a good until it is traded in the market. If central planners do away with the market, then they will not have the information needed to calculate costs and make good decisions. Forced to use guesswork, planners will inevitably misallocate resources. In a market system, bad decisions result in losses for firms, forcing them to adapt. Without the signals provided by prices, profits, and losses, a central planner's computer will not even be aware of the mistakes that it makes. Learning From Simulations The problem of organizing an economy is too wicked to be solved by computers, whether they use pattern matching or other methods. But that does not mean that advances in computer science will be of no help in improving economic policy. New software tools can be used to create complex simulations. The tools that gave us chatbots could be used to create thousands of synthetic economic ""characters."" We could have them interact according to rules and heuristics designed to mimic various economic policies and institutions, and we could compare how different economic policies affect the outcomes of these simulations. Among economists, this technique is known as ""agent-based modeling."" So far, it has been of only limited value, because it is difficult to create agents that vary along multiple dimensions. But it may be improved if we can use the latest tools to create a richer set of economic characters than what modelers have used in the past. Still, this improvement would be incremental, not revolutionary. They will not permit us to hand off the resource allocation problem to a central computer. The latest techniques for using large datasets and pattern matching offer new and exciting capabilities. But these techniques alone will not enable us to solve society's wicked problems.

Introduction
Artificial intelligence holds the promise of delivering new
waves of efficiency and productivity in the workplace, but it also
carries risk for employers who don't mitigate operational,
reputational, and legal risks associated with unauthorized use.
Generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and
Microsoft Copilot are free tools at the fingertips of employees.
Surveys conducted by KPMG and Salesforce have demonstrated that
generative AI is already widely used in Canadian workplaces, often
without employer knowledge.
Without a comprehensive policy governing the internal use of AI,
unauthorized use of AI by employees could jeopardize an
organization's data security, intellectual property, and create
issues of liability and reputational damage.
Generative AI Use in the Workplace
KPMG recently carried out a Generative AI Adoption survey of over
4,500 Canadians which identified that one in five Canadians are
using generative AI daily with 61% percent of generative AI users
using the technology multiple times per week for work purposes.
Salesforce also recently carried out a survey collecting data from 14,000
global workers, including over 1,000 in Canada. The findings show
that 28% of professionals are using generative AI at work, while
55% of these professionals are using AI without approval from their
employers.
While the use of generative AI tools offers significant benefits
such as enhanced efficiency, creativity, and problem-solving
capabilities, it simultaneously introduces a plethora of challenges
and uncertainties, particularly when these tools are integrated
into the workplace.
Employer Concerns with Generative AI
Despite the growing buzz around generative AI, many
organizations remain on the fringes and are contemplating its
integration. In 2023, the Human Resources Professional Association
(HRPA) ran a pulse survey of its membership to
gain insights into their attitudes and behaviours regarding the use
of generative AI technology in the workplace. 205 respondents
across numerous industries participated in the survey.
While 67% of respondents indicated their organizations had no
plans to use generative AI technology, 47% of respondents were
either concerned or potentially concerned about employees using
generative AI in an unauthorized way to carry out their work
tasks.

Workplace – HRPA Survey Report, 2023
While many organizations may not have plans to implement
generative AI, the results of the KPMG and Salesforce surveys
demonstrate that employees may have different ideas.
With the rapidly expanding landscape of artificial intelligence,
one term has increasingly gained attention: Democratized
Generative AI. This term represents a shift from AI being a
tool of the few to a resource of the many. This poses a particular
challenge for employers as free and easy access generative AI tools
means those without technical backgrounds and training have access
to a resource which presents significant risks if misused.
The HRPA reported that those respondents who did have concerns
about unauthorized use of generative AI in the workplace listed
privacy and security risks, lack of originality and plagiarism, and
poor output from the generative AI tools as common reasons.
Risks with Generative AI
Misuse of generative AI by employees can bring about
consequential legal, ethical, and operational risks. A few
illustrative examples include:

Intellectual Property and Data Security:
Without explicit guidelines, employees might unwittingly compromise
sensitive information, leading to legal, financial, and
reputational damage.
Ethical and Legal Concerns: The absence of
ethical guidelines could result in the creation of content that
infringes on copyright laws or perpetuates bias, attracting legal
scrutiny and eroding public trust.
Operational Inefficiency: A lack of coherent
AI use policy may result in inconsistent and inefficient
operations, diminishing the potential benefits of generative AI
technologies.

Despite 47% of respondents expressing concerns about employees
using generative AI in the workplace, only 0.5% of respondents
reported that their organizations had a formal policy in place
addressing the use of generative AI in the workplace.

Source: Generative AI in the
Workplace – HRPA Survey Report, 2023
Regardless of whether an organization aims to use generative AI
in their operations, the vast number of tools currently available
are particularly appealing to employees, meaning that organizations
may have exposure to the risks presented by generative AI without
realizing it. This presents a critical blind spot in organizational
strategies.
Implementing Generative AI in the Workplace
Implementing a comprehensive Generative AI Workplace Policy not
only mitigates legal and operation risks but ensures ethical use,
protecting the organization's intellectual property and data
security. It offers a framework for maximizing the benefits of
generative AI while maintaining control over its deployment and
usage.
The planned implementation of Canada's Artificial
Intelligence Data Act (AIDA) underscores the urgency for employers
to recognize and address the use of generative AI in the workplace.
AIDA is anticipated to introduce a risk-based regulatory framework,
mandating that employers assess and mitigate risks associated with
high-impact AI systems – which could include generative AI
tools employed by staff. With requirements for transparency, data
anonymization, and robust accountability frameworks, AIDA will
likely significantly sharpen the legal and ethical responsibilities
surrounding AI. Notably, it is planned that the Act will carry
substantial penalties for non-compliance, emphasizing the legal and
financial imperatives of managing AI use.
The discrepancy between an employer's perceived and actual
risk exposure is particularly relevant here; even if a business
does not officially deploy generative AI, it may still be liable
for its employees' use of such technologies. Therefore,
developing comprehensive AI governance policies is not just prudent
– it is necessary to navigate the intricate landscape AIDA
will soon establish.
The content of this article is intended to provide a general
guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought
about your specific circumstances.

Revised by Generative AI, Written and Reviewed by Humans.  At last week’s Biomedical HIV Prevention Summit in Seattle, Washington (hosted by NMAC), HIV.gov facilitated a workshop on the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Washington State Department of Health’s Director of Communications, Maranatha Hay. The workshop, Generative AI for Extending the Reach of HIV Communications Work, provided over 100 Summit attendees with information regarding how Generative AI has the potential to extend the work of the HIV community. Immediately following the workshop, Maranatha shared, via a video conversation, some strategies for using Generative AI. We also had a conversation with Harold Philips, MRP, NMAC’s Deputy Director of Programs, about the importance of exploring these tools. (You can watch it at the top fo this article and on YouTube.)   Workshop Reflections As Maranatha recapped the workshop, she encouraged individuals to start trying out these tools. She continued, “we are currently in this […] new […] world where AI is so brand new, but right now we are writing the future of what’s to come.” She also noted, “we need a variety of people with a variety of different backgrounds—perspectives—to come to the table,” when developing and using Generative AI.  Miguel Gomez, Director of HIV.gov, stressed, “Please do the homework. Check with those you work with and those you serve and see if Generative AI tools can help you extend your reach and the reach of us as an HIV community.”  Later that day, Miguel had a conversation with Harold on his perspective about this exciting and quickly evolving tool.  Harold’s Insights on Generative AI Use in HIV Work In the video, Harold shared that “Generative AI is a really important tool […] that can help us address our workforce and workflow issues when it comes to HIV service delivery, HIV prevention, and HIV treatment.” He followed this by saying he’s excited about using the tools, and he encouraged HIV service organizations, particularly those that serve people of color to “think about what the role of AI is in addressing health disparities.”  To learn more about HIV.gov’s use of Generative AI, check out our December 2023 blog. Also, stay tuned to HIV.gov, as we share more insights from the Biomedical HIV Prevention Summit. Be sure to follow us on our social media channels (Facebook, X, and Instagram) to stay abreast of the different topics of interest to the HIV community.   This blog post was published April 25, 2024, on HIV.gov.

While the guidance is addressed to federal contractors, all private-sector employers using or considering using artificial intelligence should pay attention. The guidance makes clear that long-standing nondiscrimination principles fully apply to AI and outlines “Promising Practices” designed to mitigate AI risks in employment, including the risk of unlawful bias from the use of AI. While not a binding standard, the Department of Labor’s issuance of these “Promising Practices” demonstrates regulators’ evolving expectations surrounding employers’ use of AI. 
President Biden’s comprehensive Executive Order on AI, issued in October 2023, directed multiple federal agencies to issue AI-related guidance.[1] As part of this “whole of government” approach, the Department of Labor was specifically tasked with publishing guidance for federal contractors on “nondiscrimination in hiring involving AI and other technology-based hiring systems.”
The April 29 AI guidance issued by the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) consists of two parts: (1) a Q&A section addressing how OFCCP will apply existing nondiscrimination laws to AI tools, and (2) a list of “Promising Practices” for the development and use of AI in employment.
While the Department of Labor’s guidance is specifically addressed to federal contractors, it has far-reaching implications for employers generally, not just federal contractors. Consistent with the EEOC’s position, the guidance makes clear that long-standing nondiscrimination principles fully apply to AI, and the “Promising Practices” represent OFCCP’s attempt to capture best practices for mitigating AI risks in employment, drawing from the prior work of stakeholders in the responsible AI ecosystem. While not a binding standard, OFCCP’s issuance of these “Promising Practices” represents a significant marker of the evolving expectations surrounding employers’ use of AI.
Applying Existing Laws to AI: OFCCP Reinforces Foundational Principles
In the Q&A portion of the guidance, OFCCP makes clear that federal contractors are fully responsible for affirmatively ensuring their AI tools comply with existing nondiscrimination laws. The agency also emphasizes federal contractors’ obligations to maintain records related to AI tools, and reminds contractors that their obligation to provide reasonable accommodations extends to the contractor’s use of automated systems. OFCCP also explains how it will use its existing authorities to investigate federal contractors’ use of AI in employment decisions. Key takeaways include:

AI tools can constitute “selection procedures” subject to OFCCP's existing regulations. Consistent with prior statements from OFCCP in 2019[2] and the EEOC in May 2023,[3] OFCCP again emphasizes and confirms that AI-based tools used to make employment decisions can be “selection procedures” under the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP) from 1978, and validation processes required under UGESP.
Reasonable accommodations obligations fully apply. Federal contractors must make reasonable accommodations to ensure individuals with disabilities have equal access to jobs, including in the contractor's use of AI-based selection procedures.
Employers are responsible for their AI tools, whether they developed them themselves or if they are using an AI vendor. OFCCP unambiguously warns that federal contractors cannot delegate or avoid their nondiscrimination and affirmative action obligations by using third-party AI products. During an OFCCP audit, contractors must be able to provide the information and records needed for OFCCP to assess compliance, including information about the impact and validity of AI-based selection procedures. In addition, information regarding the design of tool as well as information regarding whether alternative approaches were considered and tested for adverse impact may be requested during audits.  

While these principles are not new, OFCCP’s firm stance serves as a call-to-action for employers to proactively examine their use of AI. As OFCCP Acting Director Michelle Hodge recently warned, federal contractors “can't just pull something off the shelf and decide to use it” without ensuring compliance with OFCCP regulations. Just like federal contractors should not rely solely on an affirmative defense of, “I thought my AI vendor was handling that,” private-sector employers should be mindful of these evolving standards and how these defenses may be received if accusations of unlawful bias from the use of AI arise. Now is an excellent time for employers using AI – whether or not they are federal contractors – to work closely with trusted legal counsel to develop a comprehensive approach to AI risk management.
OFCCP’s “Promising Practices” Reflect an Evolving Consensus on AI Risk Management
The “Promising Practices” portion of OFCCP's guidance outlines recommendations to help federal contractors “avoid potential harm to workers and promote trustworthy development and use of AI.” These recommendations span the AI lifecycle, from development to deployment and monitoring, and include “big picture” concepts like the creation of internal AI governance frameworks. Many of the practices identified in the “Promising Practices” closely align with concepts from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's AI Risk Management Framework.
OFCCP’s guidance acknowledges that these “Promising Practices” are “not expressly required,” and that it is “not an exhaustive list but rather an initial framework"" and further cautions that ""the rapid advancement and adoption of AI in the employment context means that these practices will evolve over time.""
Despite their non-mandatory nature, employers should not ignore OFCCP’s guidance. In that regard, the impact of OFCCP's April 29 “Promising Practices” on employer behavior may follow a trajectory similar to the EEOC’s 2017 “Promising Practices” for preventing harassment, which had a significant impact on the way employers thought about harassment prevention. By 2017, some proactive employers had already implemented policies and procedures aligned with the EEOC’s recommendations. But with the #MeToo movement contemporaneously gaining momentum in late 2017, increased public awareness of harassment and demand for action prompted further employer action. This provided the impetus for some employers to re-evaluate and revise their harassment policies and training programs to align with the EEOC’s recommendations. The ultimate goal was to prompt the implementation of more proactive, comprehensive, and systemic approaches to preventing harassment, rather than relying solely on reactive measures like complaint reporting and investigations.
OFCCP may be hoping that its “Promising Practices” on AI will follow a similar trajectory. Like the EEOC’s 2017 effort on harassment, OFCCP's AI ""Promising Practices"" did not emerge from thin air; they reflect principles identified by various stakeholders, contain similar themes articulated in the White House’s recently issued guidance to federal agencies, emphasizing the need for “stakeholder engagement, validation and monitoring, and greater transparency” in the federal government’s own use of AI, and closely align with NIST AI RMF, which has gained significant traction as a foundational resource for organizations seeking to manage AI risk.
Key themes and recommendations in OFCCP's “Promising Practices” include:

Transparency and notice to employees and applicants. OFCCP advises federal contractors to provide clear notice about their use of AI, what data is being collected, and how employment decisions are being made.
Stakeholder engagement. OFCCP advises federal contractors to consult with employees and/or their representatives in the design and deployment of AI systems.
Fairness assessments and ongoing monitoring. OFCCP advises federal contractors to analyze AI tools for discriminatory impact before use, at regular intervals during use, and after use. Where issues are identified, OFCCP advises employers to take steps to reduce adverse impact or consider alternative practices. While some of this advice may sound obvious to those experienced in AI risk management, OFCCP’s inclusion of these concepts emphasizes their importance.  Likewise, OFCCP also advises employers to ensure meaningful human oversight of AI-based decisions. While OFCCP does not provide greater clarity regarding how it might be defining “meaningful human oversight,” the inclusion of this concept in OFCCP’s “Promising Practices” invites contractors and employers to examine and consider how human oversight mechanisms may or may not be present in their existing AI processes.
Documentation and recordkeeping. OFCCP advises federal contractors to retain information about the data used to develop AI systems, the basis for decision-making, and the results of any fairness assessments or monitoring.
Vendor management. OFCCP advises federal contractors to carefully vet AI vendors. Among other things, OFCCP’s “Promising Practices” discuss the desirability of verifying the source and quality of the data being collected and analyzed by the AI system, the vendor's data protection and privacy policies, and critical information about the vendor's algorithmic decision-making tool, such as the screening criteria, the predictive nature of the system, and any differences between the data used for training and validation and the actual candidate pool. OFCCP also discusses the desirability of having access to the results of any assessment of system bias, debiasing efforts, and/or any study of system fairness conducted by the vendor and cautions that relying on vendor assurances alone is not enough – emphasizing the importance of being able to verify key information about the vendor's practices.
Accessibility for individuals with disabilities. OFCCP advises federal contractors to ensure AI systems are accessible, allow for reasonable accommodation requests, and accurately measure job-related skills regardless of disability.

As federal contractors or other employers consider whether changes to their AI risk management practices are warranted in light of OFCCP’s issuance of these “Promising Practices”, contractors and employers should be mindful of legislative activity mandating or otherwise incentivizing employers to implement an AI risk management framework similar to the “Promising Practices” described in OFCCP’s guidance.  OFCCP’s “Promising Practices” are not mandatory, but aspects of them may soon be mandatory under future legislative or regulatory efforts.[4]
Implications for Employers
Federal contractors and private-sector employers should expect continued coordination between OFCCP, EEOC and other enforcement agencies on AI issues. While OFCCP’s April 29 AI guidance is addressed to federal contractors, OFCCP’s “Promising Practices” reflect progress toward regulatory consensus regarding AI risk management, and their issuance invites both federal contractors and other employers to evaluate their existing AI risk management practices and to consider whether further proactive processes may be warranted or desirable.

New NSF grant targets large language models and generative AI, exploring how they work and implications for societal impacts



May 2, 2024





The U.S. National Science Foundation has announced a grant of $9 million to Northeastern University for research to investigate how large language models (LLMs) and generative AI operate, focusing on the computing process called deep inference and AI’s long-term societal impacts.The research seeks to establish a National Deep Inference Fabric (NDIF), a collaborative research platform. The goal is to provide U.S. researchers with access to cutting-edge LLMs within a transparent experimental platform that reveals the systems’ internal computations — a capability currently unavailable in academia.“Chatbots have transformed society’s relationship with AI, but how they operate is yet to be fully understood”, said Sethuraman Panchanathan, director of the U.S. National Science Foundation. “With NDIF, U.S. researchers will be able peer inside the ‘black box’ of large language models, gaining new insights into how they operate and greater awareness of their potential impacts on society.”LLMs, such as those behind chatbots like ChatGPT, have emerged as a transformative force in AI with profound capabilities including general-purpose knowledge and language skills. However, their sheer size — often more than 100 billion parameters — poses a significant challenge for researchers investigating how the systems operate, especially without adequate computing resources.The NDIF project aims to address that gap by creating a platform for exploring such large-scale AI systems. NDIF will leverage the resources of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications DeltaAI project, a high-capacity AI-focused cluster in the NSF computing portfolio that combines high-performance data processing and high-speed storage, ideal for designing and deploying new software resources to study LLM inference.The broader impacts of the NDIF project extend beyond academia. The project has significant implications for a range of scientific disciplines, including computing, medicine, neuroscience, linguistics, social sciences and the humanities.""In the always evolving realm of emerging technologies like AI, understanding the inner workings of LLMs is paramount,” said Dilma DaSilva, NSF's acting assistant director for Computer and Information Science and Engineering. “As we navigate the complexities of these transformative systems, we must ensure transparency and accountability, paving the way for inclusive and beneficial applications of AI-powered solutions. This investment in deep inference research not only empowers academic exploration, it fosters a culture of ethical and responsible AI development.""NDIF will actively collaborate with public interest technology groups to ensure that innovations in AI uphold principles of ethics, transparency and social responsibility in the deployment of LLMs.""Understanding the mechanisms behind the strength of modern LLMs is one of the most pressing mysteries facing scientists today, raising fundamental questions about cognition as well as the many societal impacts of AI,"" said David Bau, principal investigator and assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University. ""NDIF defines a new, fully transparent way to access the largest models that is both powerful and cost-effective. It will democratize scientific access to the largest open AI models.""In addition, the project will help build a next-generation, AI-enabled workforce by providing comprehensive training to students and equipping them to serve as networks of experts. NDIF will support and train graduate students in AI, disseminate educational materials for university and professional use, and make tools for the science of large-scale AI widely available to users in other disciplines.“NDIF will create a research framework that helps the research community explore the factors that ensure LLMs are safe and secure, which aligns with the goals of the White House Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence,” said Eleni Miltsakaki, the NSF program director for NDIF. “Launching NDIF will break new ground in the scientific study of very large language models, equipping researchers with deep inferencing tools that will enable them to study the internal mechanisms of these models. This investment in knowledge itself will unlock important research problems in every field impacted by large-scale AI.""

How is artificial intelligence reshaping the notion of original scholarship? How are faculty using the technology in their research and teaching, and what are administrators doing with the tools to streamline their work? A May 1 symposium convened by Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) considered the many ways AI is already changing the nature of academic research, teaching, and administration. Because large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have initiated dramatic upheavals in the way students and faculty acquire and process information, even the Harvard Library, as a trusted curator of knowledge, must respond. Preeminent library collections like Harvard’s could play an important role in future iterations of LLMs, once the legal issues surrounding fair use of copyrighted materials are settled.





FAS dean Hopi Hoekstra reflected on the challenges and opportunities presented by AI during the past nine months. “We’ve been investing in the positives,” she said “looking for all the ways that we can channel this powerful technology to create a better world, from the sciences to the arts.” Paul professor of the practice of government and technology Latanya Sweeney, who has co-chaired the FAS Artificial Intelligence Systems Working Group since the summer of 2023, emphasized in her introductory remarks that “this is a pivotal moment for all of us in society,” and—on the same day that Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, spoke in Memorial Church—urged community engagement and collaboration to help shape AI’s future impact. Students in two of Sweeney’s classes, Government 1430, “Tech Science to Save the World,” and Democracy, Politics, and Institutions 642, “Grand Challenges in Technology-Society Clashes,” presented posters of their coursework during the break between sessions.Original Scholarship in an AI WorldThe day opened with a panel discussion on the meaning of original scholarship in the age of AI. The speakers brought their distinct disciplinary perspectives to the question of what constitutes original work, and what represents acceptable use of AI tools.





Providing an historical perspective, professor of the history of science Alex Csiszar began by questioning the idea that authorship itself is a stable notion. Shifts in the understanding of what it means to publish an original text, including the twentieth-century emergence of “contributorship” on scientific papers with a large number of authors, suggest that while AI may accelerate the need for new models to meet the needs of a highly collaborative digital era, the unattributed, digest-like forms in which ChatGPT presents information are not new. Commonplace books of the seventeenth century, he explained, gathered quotations and information from “all over the place” without attribution. AI will “not necessarily revolutionize anything,” he said, “but it’s going to force us to take seriously a whole bunch of problems that already existed.”Kingsley professor of art, film and visual studies David Joselit said that similar questions arose in the arts when technologies such as photography and film became ubiquitous. He advocated for understanding AI not just as a tool but as a genre that will reshape creative and scholarly outputs. And he called for critical engagement with the training data used to create LLMs, pointing to their highly curated nature and potential biases.Furer professor of economics Melissa Dell highlighted the problem of duplication of original material—one that is poised to become much worse as LLMs parrot and essentially replicate existing information without citing sources. She highlighted the important role that libraries (the subject of a later session—see below) could play to counteract that diluting effect: “How do we get the information that’s in Widener, buried, and in the offsite storage,” she asked, and work out the legal obstacles to “make it all accessible” which will enhance scholarship in social science disciplines?





Harvard University Distinguished Service Professor Mike Smith, Finley professor of engineering and applied sciences, a computer scientist, suggested taking a practical approach to the use of AI in student work in his field. He views the tool as a means of enhancing scholarly work, without necessarily altering the nature of authorship. In his own courses, Smith said, he encourages the use of AI, but emphasized the importance of dialogue between students and instructors to ensure that the tool supplements, rather than defeats, the engagement of students in their own learning.Research, Teaching, Administration, and TrainingThat featured opening panel was followed by three concurrent sessions on the use of AI: in faculty research; in teaching tools and innovation; and in the practical preparation of undergraduates and doctoral candidates alike for a world transformed by AI-driven change.Faculty researchers highlighted the fact that ChatGPT allows users to make natural language queries—the form of questions posed most often to Google—of large, complex databases. The technology is also useful for generating new ideas and predicting human preferences, including for political issues and candidates. Moncher professor of astronomy Christopher Stubbs, who is Hoekstra’s special adviser for AI, described how he has used AI to automate tasks, analyze data, generate code, and even predict the windspeed at a telescope in Chile that produces blurred images in heavy wind. (Selected students from his course, General Education 1188: “Rise of the Machines? Understanding and Using Generative AI,” presented their final projects later in the day.) Assistant professor of computer science Stephanie Gil hailed the utility of generative AI for improving the decision-making capabilities of autonomous vehicles and robots.





In the realm of pedagogy, innovative uses abound. One professor has begun using AI models to analyze how ballet has changed over time. And Harvard’s information technology services organization (HUIT) has developed a specialized tutor bot that runs on Slack, a messaging tool. The bot uses “retrieval-augmented generation” to provide accurate information to students: instructors can upload documents, papers, and readings, and the bot will draw upon that information, citing its sources when answering questions.Administrators at the symposium described how they have used AI to make transcripts of meetings (recorded with participant assent), generate high-level summaries, and highlight action items that need to be followed up. Strategic director of endowment and gifts Naveen Reddy gave a particularly memorable example when he described creating a custom GPT model to help him manage Harvard’s 8,000 restricted-use endowment funds. The original donors earmarked their gifts for specific uses, and Reddy’s role is to help the University advance its teaching and research mission by allocating the funds appropriately and efficiently. The gift terms were in one Excel spreadsheet, balances in another, and prior year expenditures in yet another database. Reddy provided this information to his GPT model, and can now make natural language queries to quickly query multiple datasets through a single interface.Among the fascinating presentations were several by leaders of the Harvard Library, one of the world’s largest. University librarian Martha Whitehead began by drawing a parallel between generative AI and research libraries, noting that both “draw upon a broad corpus of existing information to answer questions and generate new information.” The fundamental value of the Harvard Library, she continued, is that it provides “access to trustworthy information spanning centuries, regions, and voices around the globe.” And part of the library’s aspiration is to make their curated datasets available through LLM-enabled interfaces. The library aims to do so in the same spirit that it makes the pre-1923 Google Books corpus available—and according to similar legal reasoning: the library can share its legally acquired collection with students and researchers according to the principles of fair use. “We’re immersed in the ethics of information,” Whitehead emphasized, from intellectual property, to copyright, to plagiarism: what director of copyright and information policy Kyle Courtney has referred to—tongue-in-cheek—as “copyright’s close cousin.”





Other presentations covered patterns of student AI use (by the fall of 2023, 65 percent of surveyed students said they had used or planned to use generative AI for academic work, 80 percent using ChatGPT specifically); legal aspects of copyrighted information (libraries, with their vast and legitimate content collections, are well-positioned to support the ethical development of AI technologies, although the legal landscape will evolve slowly); and a pilot project that allows patrons to “Talk to HOLLIS,” the library’s online catalog.“The grand challenge for the Harvard Library,” concluded associate University librarian and managing director for library technology Stu Snydman, “is to enable researchers and students to find the right content when needed to support world-class research, teaching, and learning, amidst a massive and ever-growing sea of information. And to ensure that users have confidence that the Library is connecting them to trustworthy sources.” The challenges facing libraries in an age of AI are a microcosm of those confronting institutions of higher learning: how to ensure that they advance knowledge and educate students who will bring an informed and ethical perspective to their contributions to society. The FAS symposium was one of many efforts underway across the University in pursuit of those aims.

How Dice Can Help
There are key elements to what makes any city a “tech hub,” including how many tech or tech-focused companies have headquarters or offices there, how many tech jobs are available in the locale on average, and what these cities do to specifically attract tech talent. The meteoric rise of generative AI all but ensures there will be another layer added on top, with some cities doing everything they can to vie for the hottest AI and ML talent available now.
It's important to remember that, just like every company today is a technology today, you don’t have to live in a “tech hub” to have a successful career as a tech professional. After all, your career is a deeply intimate, personal thing. It’s something that’s very uniquely “you,” and that means “success” is defined by how where you live and the work you do fits in with your most important personal and professional goals. Setting all else aside, you make these decisions the right ones more so than what the city can provide.
So how you decide what you really want, need and value in your tech career? Start with Dice, the only tech career marketplace designed exclusively for tech professionals. We create content each week to highlight both the established and emerging tech hubs around the country (including what makes them attractive for tech professionals), what to look for when evaluating tech jobs and companies, the top AI and ML skills you can use to position yourself for your next role, how to set attainable and realistic career goals, and so much more.

DOL’s Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs released guidance documents governing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace.
The documents address employers’ and federal contractors’ potential legal and business risks associated with AI, and provide recommended practices to help avoid them.





On April 29, 2024, the White House released a statement entitled, “Biden-⁠Harris Administration Announces Key AI Actions 180 Days Following President Biden’s Landmark Executive Order.” A few hours later, the U.S. Department of Labor’s (DOL) Wage and Hour Division (WHD) and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) released guidance documents about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace. Both sets of guidance documents were issued following President Biden’s Executive Order on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence” (“AI Executive Order”) issued on October 30, 2023. Specifically, the AI Executive Order directed these agencies within DOL to develop best practices for employers, agencies, and federal contractors.
WHD Guidance. The AI Executive Order directed DOL to “issue guidance to make clear that employers that deploy AI to monitor or augment employees’ work must continue to comply with protections that ensure that workers are compensated for their hours worked, as defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. 201 et seq., and other legal requirements.” WHD’s AI guidance was issued as a Field Assistance Bulletin (FAB). According to WHD, FABs aim to “provide [WHD] investigators and staff with guidance on enforcement positions and clarification of policies or changes in the policy of WHD.”1
The thrust of the FAB is that employers are responsible for ensuring employees are properly paid if AI tools are used for scheduling, timekeeping, employee tracking purposes, or calculating wages owed. The FAB identifies certain recommended practices such as ensuring proper human oversight to make sure that any AI tools or systems—when used to track/monitor work, break, and waiting times—pay employees the applicable minimum wage and accurately calculate and pay an employee’s regular rate and overtime premium.
In addition to FLSA risks, the FAB also addresses risks that might arise under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) if employers use AI for processing leave requests. The FAB briefly explains that the use of AI tools to administer FMLA leave can create potential risks of violating the FMLA’s certification requirements for determining whether leave is FMLA-qualifying. Moreover, the FAB notes that AI tools used “to track leave use may not be used to target FMLA leave users for retaliation or discourage the use of such leave.”
The FAB also addresses certain risks that might arise under the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers Act (PUMP Act), which requires covered employers to provide nursing employees with reasonable break time and space to express breast milk while at work. The FAB states that AI tools or systems that restrict or penalize employees for taking pump breaks (e.g., by limiting break length or frequency), penalizing productivity, or requiring makeup hours, would be illegal under FLSA.
In addition, the FAB addresses the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, which generally prohibits employers from using polygraph tests for applicants. The guidance explains that AI tools such as eye-tracking and voice-monitoring software, which are intended to gauge “truthfulness,” might qualify as polygraph tests. In that case, they would be regulated in the same manner as more traditional polygraph tests.
Finally, the FAB recognizes that, while AI tools may commonly be used to manage many aspects of employees’ work, the use of such tools to surveil the workforce for protected activity and to take adverse action could violate anti-retaliation laws.
The FAB concludes by acknowledging that “[w]hen used responsibly, AI has the potential to help improve compliance with the law.” WHD reinforces that “employers must ensure the responsible use of AI in order to continue to comply with the laws WHD enforces.”
The FAB has several notable shortcomings. First, it was not subject to public notice-and-comment. Indeed, the FAB fails to cite any resources WHD relied upon in making its assertions about how employers are using AI.
Second, it does not address other areas of FLSA concerns in the age of AI. Perhaps most notably, some have argued that the use of AI and algorithmic technologies may fundamentally alter workers’ primary duties, thus impacting FLSA exemption status.2
Third, WHD ignores the employer-vendor relationship. Employers usually engage third-party software vendors that develop and sell the AI-powered tools, which are then used to perform a wide variety of employment tasks. The FAB ignores this reality, which reinforces why notice-and-comment is so important for any actions on AI.
Fourth, the FAB reflects the Biden administration’s “whole of government” approach to promote a pro-union agenda across the entire spectrum of the government. This “whole of government” approach has relied on executive orders, interagency task forces, councils, interagency agreements, individual agency actions such as rulemaking and enforcement strategies, attempts to influence Congress, and a variety of other means to achieve a pro-union agenda. The FAB notes, without any reason or citation, that “employers have reportedly created systems to predict the likelihood that particular locations will unionize based on employee surveys and data analytics.” The FAB further states in a footnote that “[t]he use of electronic monitoring or AI systems to identify organizing activity may raise compliance challenges under the National Labor Relations Act” and cites a memorandum issued by the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. WHD does not enforce the National Labor Relations Act, however, nor has it entered into an interagency agreement on AI with the National Labor Relations Board.
OFCCP Guidance. President Biden’s AI Executive Order also directed DOL to “publish guidance for Federal contractors regarding nondiscrimination in hiring involving AI and other technology-based hiring systems.” In line with this mandate, the OFCCP issued guidance addressing AI in the federal anti-discrimination context vis-à-vis obligations enforced by OFCCP. As an initial matter, the OFCCP’s guidance addresses primarily federal contractors’ use of predictive AI, as opposed to generative AI, which is a type of AI that can create new content. Indeed, AI is defined in the OFCCP’s guidance, in relevant part, as “a machine-based system that can … make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.”
While acknowledging the benefits that may be conferred in terms of efficiency and productivity when leveraging AI systems in employment decisions, OFCCP emphasizes that federal contractors’ EEO obligations not to discriminate in employment extend to their use of AI in employment decisions. Federal contractors’ compliance obligations related to AI include:

Maintaining and ensuring confidentiality of records consistent with all OFCCP regulatory requirements;
Cooperating with OFCCP by provided information on their AI systems;
Reasonably accommodating known disability of otherwise qualified applicants or employees unless doing so is an undue hardship;
When a selection procedure, including one utilizing AI, results in an adverse impact3 on a protected group, validating the systems in accordance with applicable OFCCP-enforced non-discrimination laws and the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP); and
Being responsible, i.e., not delegating non-discrimination and affirmative action obligations, for use of third-party products and services, including AI screening tools.

OFCCP emphasizes that because improperly designed or implemented AI may perpetuate bias and discrimination in the workplace, federal contractors using these systems in employment decisions must be aware of the risk of infringing on workers’ civil rights.
OFCCP confirms that it will investigate federal contractors’ use of AI during compliance evaluations and complaint investigations to ensure compliance with nondiscrimination obligations.
Finally, OFCCP’s guidance impresses that, whenever AI systems are being used in the employment lifecycle, federal contractors should possess a baseline understanding of the system’s design, development, intended use, and consequences. To that end, OFCCP outlines several of what it considers best practices pertaining to disclosure of use to applicants and employees; use of the AI system; vetting third-party vendor AI systems; and prioritizing accessibility and disability inclusion.
Many of OFCCP’s recommendations reflect recent legislative efforts at regulating AI. For instance, the guidance document suggests that contractors must regularly assess their AI tools for potential bias and maintain records of the assessments. This same requirement is already the law in New York City and has generally appeared in state proposals across the country.
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The White House’s announcement claims that the administration has “[r]eleased resources for job seekers, workers, and tech vendors and creators on how AI use could violate employment discrimination laws” since the AI Executive Order was issued in October. But the EEOC has not issued any AI guidance in about a year. Indeed, the EEOC has not released any resources within the 180 days of the AI Executive Order. It is also worth noting that none of the EEOC’s guidance documents have been voted on by the full Commission or subject to notice-and-comment.
Conclusion
Ultimately, the White House’s announcement and DOL’s guidance documents show how the administration is attempting to regulate AI without new legislation from Congress. More AI guidance is expected in the future, including a DOL report on how the government can support workers displaced by AI. The AI Executive Order directed DOL to issue the report by the end of April, but DOL has not yet issued the report.
The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape requires that employers and their compliance counsel remain especially attentive to current and developing legal authority regarding the use of AI in the workplace. Relatedly, employers and federal contractors should ensure that their AI-based algorithms are compliant with all federal and state laws and regulations. Finally, employers and federal contractors should examine ways to minimize the potential legal and business risks associated with AI such as implementing an AI usage policy and establishing internal practices.

Before you click away, we’d like to ask you for a favour … 
 

Journalism in Canada has suffered a devastating decline over the last two decades. Dozens of newspapers and outlets have shuttered. Remaining newsrooms are smaller. Nowhere is this erosion more acute than in the coverage of foreign policy and international news. It’s expensive, and Canadians, oceans away from most international upheavals, pay the outside world comparatively little attention.
At Open Canada, we believe this must change. If anything, the pandemic has taught us we can’t afford to ignore the changing world. What’s more, we believe, most Canadians don’t want to. Many of us, after all, come from somewhere else and have connections that reach around the world.
Our mission is to build a conversation that involves everyone — not just politicians, academics and policy makers. We need your help to do so. Your support helps us find stories and pay writers to tell them. It helps us grow that conversation. It helps us encourage more Canadians to play an active role in shaping our country’s place in the world.

						OpenAI claims that its use of data, much of which it acknowledges was subject to various copyrights, is fair use and did not require payment.		

By Mercury News & East Bay Times editorialUPDATED: May 3, 2024 at 11:27 a.m.There is no artificial intelligence without the vast trove of human knowledge.Today’s generative AI applications were built on a foundation of such information, drawn from across the internet and from various databases totaling, according to at least one estimate, somewhere around 300 billion words.That’s a lot of intellectual property, much of it produced by generations of professional writers, honed and polished by editors and sent out into the world by publishers in newspapers, magazines, books and more.Hard to put an exact price on such a thing or even to measure the collective value of such an incredible library.It definitely should not be free.But that’s the assumption made by OpenAI when it claims that its use of all this data, much of which it acknowledges was subject to various copyrights, is fair use and did not require compensation to the original creators and owners of that knowledge and information.

About ConnatixV512852 Here’s what happened to California Gov. Newsom’s quietquest for the presidencyIf you walked into a bookstore and stole not just some of the books, but all of the books, that would be a crime, right?That’s why newspapers, including this one, as well as authors and an array of digital publishers have filed lawsuits seeking to force OpenAI to pay for its exploitation of their work.

Regular people aren’t allowed to make copies of a recent best-seller and resell it with a different cover, nor can a studio stream a competitor’s series just because it’s on the Internet and it’s possible to copy it. They might be able to license that material, if the owner allows it, and they can certainly buy copies, but even buying a copy doesn’t give the purchaser the right to reproduce and redistribute such works.There’s a fundamental issue of ownership in play here.For decades, newspapers have been independent entities. They have written the obituaries of local luminaries, chronicled crimes committed, and followed fights over public works. In most every U.S. city, they’ve accumulated a great storehouse of knowledge, day by day.The theft of that journalism to create new products clearly intended to supplant news publishers further undermines the economy for news at a time when fair and balanced reporting and a shared set of facts is more critical than ever before.Weakening news publishers also has a collateral effect on democracy as it not only siphons off publisher revenue, but it also damages publishers’ reputations by attributing bogus information to credible publications.Related Articles

			Q&A: AI vs. the metaverse — How artificial intelligence might change the future of the internet		

AI “hallucinations” occur when an AI app provides false information in response to a user’s question.The rise of artificial intelligence may be inevitable but that does not mean that the originators of the content should not expect adequate compensation.OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, pay their engineers to write their code and certainly recognize the value of that code. In fact, a recent valuation for OpenAI was $90 billion.Surely all the knowledge and information required to train their apps — to develop the code, as it were — has value.That value must be recognized and these companies must be held accountable.

Since then, we have taken extra measures such as creating an official Glassdoor account and reporting any accounts that were impersonating us. We filed a formal complaint with IC3 back in 2023, though we have yet to hear back from any relevant authority or jurisdiction regarding this matter. Our team also took the extra step and responded to each person we could verify had been scammed via email to let them know that the requests came from a non-Synterex domain so they would cease communications with the scammers.“Our hearts go out to any applicant who spends time applying for a job only to find out the process was not real. We understand how involved the talent acquisition process can be.

How we’re upskilling and preparing our workforce for the age of generative artificial intelligence 















PUBLISHED

Global Capability Lead – Digital, Data, AI and 
Learning Agility, AstraZeneca











Marc Howells
Vice President, Talent & Development, 
AstraZeneca










We stay at the forefront of innovation by prioritising our people’s learning and development (L&D) journeys and creating opportunities where we can all learn, adapt and grow in the face of new challenges and technologies. Discover more from Dr. Bonnie Cheuk, Global Capability Lead – Digital, Data and Learning Agility, and Marc Howells, Vice President, Talent & Development, about our journey to be more agile with digital and data insights, and what we’re doing to upskill our workforce in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). 







The prevalence of AI across all aspects of our lives is growing every day. From creativity to productivity, AI provides us with limitless opportunities to become more efficient and simplify the way we work. Rather than replacing the need for humans, these technologies work alongside our teams to augment human intelligence, transform and simplify our ways of working, and help drive innovation across our organisation. 
Now generative AI technologies have become widely accessible, we want to make sure we upskill our employees through a series of activities designed to increase awareness and readiness, so they feel equipped to use emerging generative AI tools and feel confident to experiment with generative AI in a responsible way. As one of the first pharmaceutical companies to publish principles for AI and Data Ethics, we’re committed to building a continuous learning environment where people can enhance their digital capabilities.
As the world becomes increasingly more integrated with technology, so too have our learning practices. Technology gives our people autonomy over how they choose to learn and empowers individuals to engage with materials in a style and at a pace that suits them best. Today there’s an increased demand for personalised learning experiences that are accessed via user friendly and convenient technologies, anytime and anywhere. Our global learning platform offers a number of digital and AI learning content pathways in 12 languages, creating a digital community of learners across our company. 
The generative AI accreditation programme 
Leaders from across IT, HR, AI governance, business and corporate communications worked with internal and external experts to create a programme that focuses on how we can use generative AI in our daily work and be intentional about our relationship with AI.
Our generative AI accreditation programme is a self-guided training course to upskill our workforce in using generative AI tools, through practical, peer-to-peer activities to enhance the learning process. Open to all our employees globally (who are not AI/Data Science specialists), no matter their experience or comfort level with the technology, it aims to increase people’s confidence in using generative AI tools ethically and responsibly, as well as nurturing the human skills needed to thrive in the age of AI so we can better prepare for the future.  
We ask participants to undertake a range of learning experiences; from keynote seminars and lab sessions to reflection activities and strategic thinking workshops, everyone is invited to take an active role in their learning. It’s about encouraging our people to be curious, to think critically, ask questions, speak up, and use the tools in an informed and ethical way. 
The data and insights gained from questions, comments and reflection activities shape the future of the programme so that it continuously evolves. Currently, there’s over 3,300 people in the cohort, with over 2,000 joining online forums, and more than 1,000 employees participating in each live session – demonstrating our culture of curiosity and lifelong learning, as well as the mass appeal of understanding generative AI technology no matter your job role or location. Over 90% of the participants reported the learning is relevant to their work and has increased their work performance.
The connection to our wider L&D philosophy 
According to Marc Howells, one of the sponsors of the programme, its structure demonstrates our commitment to inclusive learning practices that empower our people to learn in their own way and help to make learning digital, data and AI part of a lifelong learning habit.
“We make no assumptions about prior knowledge or experience and invite everyone to learn together, at their own pace, so we can create a high impact programme and maintain a psychologically safe learning environment for everyone to think together, experiment together and learn together.
Our journey began five years ago, when we started to build digital skills, adapting to more collaborative and agile ways of working, evolving from ‘doing digital’ to ‘being digital’. Over the years, we have created resources that increased awareness, empowered our people and enabled them to thrive in an ever-changing world.  And now, the generative AI programme is not just about mastering new tools, it's about cultivating a mindset of curiosity and lifelong learning within our company. By encouraging our people to explore the possibilities, we not only enhance our digital capabilities but also support our drive for innovation. Staying true to our Values, we recognise that curiosity is part of the fuel that drives us to push the boundaries of science.”
By upskilling our employees in generative AI, we enable our people to make informed generative AI related business decisions whilst we accelerate innovative science and the delivery of life-changing medicines to patients. 
Note: In addition to this programme, we offer a range of learning programmes for AI and data science specialists, and support colleagues who have an ambition to gain deeper AI expertise.

The Madonna della Rosa, a painting of the Virgin Mary thought to be by Raphael and now hanging in the Prado in Madrid, was recently revealed to have an unexpected extra dimension: an image of Joseph that the Renaissance master did not create himself. 
It came to light thanks to analysis with facial recognition technology trained in Raphael’s style by experts at the University of Bradford.
This is just one eye-catching example of the role that artificial intelligence (AI) might play in art history.
While AI has been used behind the scenes in museums for some years, the revolution is gathering momentum. This is driven partly by generative AI and online tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which are igniting much wider interest in how the technology could improve efficiency and how it might open the door to new ways of working.
What do we mean by AI?
AI is an umbrella term for a range of sophisticated technologies that can perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence, analytical skills or judgement, such as understanding speech or recognising images.

“Most AI is a form of machine learning – statistical models, usually created from data scraped from the internet – that tries to generate text, images, video or audio based on the ‘training data’ it has access to,” says Mia Ridge, a digital curator with the Western Heritage Collections digital research team at the British Library. 
“It’s not ‘intelligent’ and doesn’t have knowledge or semantic understanding of what the words and images mean. AI is a great marketing term and a not-that-accurate shorthand name for machine learning.”
Generative AI is the form that has captured public attention since ChatGPT emerged in late 2022. Generative AI models, trained on data from across the internet, respond to prompts and can generate detailed answers in human-like terms.
They can replicate a specific tone of voice and can also adapt to format (for example, bullet-point summaries, social media posts or news item). Most significantly, they can do it in a matter of seconds.
ChatGPT was followed by other software including Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini (formerly Bard) and Microsoft’s Co-pilot.
Models such as Midjourney and DALL-E can produce visual content to a written text prompt, drawing on existing images. There are also tools that can produce audio and video to written instructions.

The latest version of Adobe Premiere, one of the most widely used video-editing applications, now includes a facility for writing a text instruction directing the AI to edit raw footage into a package: the human is still the director-editor, but the AI does the fiddly cutting and assembling.
A comprehensive report for the National Lottery Heritage Fund last year entitled Artificial Intelligence: A Digital Heritage Leadership Briefing explores how AI is already being used.
It identifies three key areas: 
1. Heritage and collections management use and research
Heritage and collections management use and research This is the area in which AI is most deployed. It is helping to expedite some of the more labour-intensive, time-consuming tasks around the labelling of objects, indexing and generally making collections more searchable.
At the Science Museum, machine learning is used internally to help provide more relevant results in searches via the collections website, and to automatically identify elements of images that may be useful to users when returning results.

“We can use it to generate alternative spellings and synonyms – as well as related people, companies and subject areas – and add those entities to the underlying index to help improve discoverability,” says Jamie Unwin, the museum’s head of digital technology and a member of the Museums + AI Network, a 12-month research project that took place in 2019-20 and was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.
The Science Museum also uses a technique called “entity recognition” to scan its internal catalogue records for identifiable people and places, which it then links to third-party sources such as Wikidata, making the content easier to find and enabling institutions to share data and perform other functions more efficiently.
“We’ve got over half a million objects in our database,” says Unwin. “Going through every one and trying to link everything to Wikidata or other institutions’ systems by hand would be impossible.”
Although machine learning works to a high degree of accuracy and can improve how searches work, Unwin says the museum does not “present as fact” anything that is produced with AI.
At the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth, staff have taken textual collection descriptions written by curators and used AI technologies to generate the keywords.
AI is able to generate these 20 times faster than a human, according to Amy Adams, the museum’s collections information and access manager. “But the accuracies around some of them are still debatable,” she says.
2. Visitor experience
AI applications are already embedded in some museum functions. These include chatbots to interact with visitors online, automate translations for people for whom English is not a first language, and automated transcription of events such as conferences.
The Anne Frank House in Amsterdam incorporated a chatbot into Facebook Messenger to answer people’s questions about Anne Frank’s story, while the National Library of Scotland uses tools such as the transcription app Otter.ai to transcribe live events and write captions for videos, which are proof read by staff before publication.
3. Business and management
There is potential for AI to support functions such as forecasting ticket salesor visitor attendance. The National Gallery, London, developed AI tools to predict how popular temporary exhibitions would be, drawing on two decades of its visitor data, which helped staff to manage room capacity at events in real time.
Departments such as marketing and comms seem ideal candidates for the use of ChatGPT and other generative tools to undertake tasks such as sending out emails, exhibition flyers or social media posts, but evidence of its use – at least institutionally approved use – seems limited.

Other uses of AI

Even if one shies away from using the generative tools for original writing, there are plenty of straightforward tasks that it could be assigned, always with the caveat that a human needs to check the final output. Such tasks include:
 

Writing report summaries– feed in the 20-page document and prompt the AI to summarise it in 500 words.
Email responses to common queries.
Session planning outlines for schools and other workshops.
One of the more creative applications popular in other sectors is brainstorming ideas. Ask ChatGPT for 10 ways to mark Black History Month as a museum and it might generate seven you’re aware of, a couple you had overlooked, and one you’d never even considered.



The importance of data
A cornerstone of the efficient use of AI tools is effective data. For collections purposes, for example, effective linkages in search depend on accurate data – and this can be a challenge.
“Whether you’re using tools that are tailored to you or those that are bought off the shelf, you need to have digitised data,” says Mathilde Pavis, author of the Heritage Fund report and an expert in intellectual property law.
“It needs to be properly labelled and structured, even before you start looking at AI tools. This is the bread and butter of digitisation – digital data management and rights management. Without that, it will be difficult to get the most out of your data and what you do with AI.”
Tools such as ChatGPT are by no means perfect and may “hallucinate” and produce an answer or text that sounds plausible but is factually flawed, with invented quotes and references. Even when generally accurate, it can be superficial and generic.
More insidious, still, is the risk of bias: a generative text tool is likely to have trained on biased text, meaning that bias – whether racial, colonial, historical or gender – will form part of the result.
It means human editing is vital; not just proof reading for spelling and grammar (which AI tools are actually pretty good at) but detailed checking of content, links and sources. 
But some argue that the use of generative AI tools to perform even straightforward writing tasks will always be too great a risk for museums.
Writing object labels, for example, might be seen as a task that, in future, could be outsourced to an AI tool such as ChatGPT. But the result would inevitably lack depth, argues Rachel Coldicutt, founder of research consultancy Careful Industries and a member of the Museums + AI network.
“A subject matter expert in a museum will be bringing lots of separate contexts to include in the label – knowledge that doesn’t sit in an online database but is about how to engage specific audiences and what’s culturally relatable to visitors,” she says.
The Science Museum’s Unwin says: “ChatGPT works by guessing what the most likely next word or sentence should be in a text, based on what others have written.
""A system that just says the obvious probably isn’t what we should be doing for a museum website. Where we’ve got a vast wealth of information, we should be the primary sources for that information.”
Coldicutt also points to the economic impact on some parts of the workforce in that generative AI potentially poses a threat to jobs on the lower rungs of a career ladder, such as copywriting, which people do as freelancers or on an otherwise precarious basis to allow them to get a foothold in the creative industries.
Skills
AI is bringing a wave of disruption across the sector – as it is across society. The good news is you don’t need great technological aptitude to grasp at least some of the opportunities.
The British Library’s Ridge suggests people play around with AI to understand what might be coming.
“AI literacy is an important part of good governance,” she says. “People need a solid understanding of where biases are likely to appear, how to review and contest decisions made by algorithms and where sharing data might have privacy or legal implications, so that they can make good decisions about the products they buy or implement. It also helps people plan so that AI tools enhance jobs, rather than attempting to replace them.”
Pavis, an expert in intellectual property law, pinpoints training for staff and volunteers in areas such as data management, rights and compliance, AI systems and risks in all departments of the organisation, as part of workforce development.
One fundamental is to agree on a common language.
“Everyone needs to know that they are talking about the same thing when they use the term ‘AI’ in their institution – what does it mean, and when we are talking about ‘data’, do we all mean the same thing?” asks Pavis.
The future
The potential for even greater transformation is huge, says Dave Thomas, chief technology officer with Axiell, which provides specialised content management systems to museums worldwide.
The key to success will be greater interoperability, fuelled by AI, which will potentially allow museums to collaborate seamlessly for collections management and for public benefit.
The problem is people don’t share knowledge effectively and swathes of collections are yet to be digitised, says Thomas.
“My concern is around how we connect collections, because digital audiences don’t see institutional silos,” he says. “If I’m a digital visitor interested in the second world war, I’m not just interested in one collection in one place.”
That could, for example, mean a visitor starting with the Imperial War Museum online then following links to, perhaps, Tate Britain’s war artists and Cumbria’s Museum of Military Life.
“Museums have to be much more digitally inspirational when it comes to things like education, which they can’t do very well at the moment unless they work together,” says Thomas.
Coldicutt foresees museums following in the footsteps of some retailers and using AI-led tech to streamline areas such as customer service.
“It may be that we will get to a place where seeing an actual person front of house becomes unusual,” she says.

One doctor says it saved her career.,N/A,N/A,"
During the summer of 2023, Dr. Rosemary Lall, a family physician working at a bustling medical clinic in Scarborough, hit her breaking point.
After nearly three decades on the job, Lall was ready to throw in the towel as she found herself buried under inescapable patient-related paperwork that often cut into precious family time.“I lost all my joy of work,” Lall told Global News. “I was coming into work really dreading the day.”That dread, Lall said, had less to do with the patient experience and instead came from the work associated with the “aftermath” — mandatory record-keeping that front-line health-care workers are expected to input into Ontario’s electronic medical records system.Physicians, Lall said, are expected to update patient charts, fill out medical forms, provide sick notes and provide specialist referrals.

 The administrative burden would often take her up to two hours per day. Ontario’s Medical Association has estimated family doctors spend 19 hours per week on administrative tasks, including four hours spent writing notes or completing forms for patients.“I came to a crossroads where I’m going to quit, I’m going to give this up, or I’m going to find a solution,” Lall said.The solution, Lall said, was new artificial intelligence note-taking apps that are designed to mimic doctor’s notes and reduce the amount of paperwork a physician would have to manually compile.

Patients who give consent have a routine conversation about their ailment with the physician, while the doctor verbalizes their thoughts during the physical exam. The AI Scribe software is able to create and process a real-time transcript during the appointment.Lall said the true benefit comes after the appointment when the AI Scribe compiles the information into a so-called SOAP note, a standard requirement for family physicians as prescribed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.Artificial intelligence technology separates the information it hears into subjective information, as relayed by the patient, objective information, as relayed by the doctor, assessment information, as verbalized by the physician during a physical exam, and a plan of action for patient care. The four areas — subjective, objective, assessment and plan — make up the acronym SOAP.  Story continues below advertisement



 Lall said it takes minutes for AI Scribe to collate the information, allowing her to move on to other patients while the SOAP note is being created in the background.If the physician is unhappy with the note, Lall said, they can ask the AI model to regenerate the information or add more detail to any one of the categories. While the tool has some imperfections, she said, the improvements have been noticeable over the 10 months since she began using it.“I really feel this should be the next gold standard for all of our doctors. It decreases the cognitive load you feel at the end of the day,” she said.The Ford government has been so impressed with the technology that it announced a pilot program to allow 150 family physicians to use AI Scribe as part of their practices. The health minister said the early signs were promising but stressed the government would proceed carefully.“We’re doing it in a very measured way so we can look at those results and see that the impact is there,” Deputy Premier Sylvia Jones told Global News. “Anecdotally, patients really appreciate it. Clinicians are seeing benefits.”Still, some have questions about the data collected by AI Scribe, privacy and the potential for misuse.“I would have significant concerns if it’s not properly executed,” said Liberal health critic and physician Dr. Adil Shamji.  Story continues below advertisement



 “There are going to be important things to do in terms of ensuring patient confidentiality, ensuring accuracy,” Shaji said. “If it’s going to be truly autonomous with minimal oversight that would need to be very carefully implemented.”France Gélinas, the Ontario NDP’s health critic, said artificial intelligence would be “part of the future of health care” in Ontario but needed to be carefully managed.“You have to maintain the trusting relationship between the providers and the patient,” she said.“That means respect their privacy. Are we there yet? I don’t think so. Will we be there? Absolutely. It will become part but let’s take the proper steps, finish the pilot, see what we learn from it.”Lall said that after 29 years as a family physician, last Christmas was the first celebration that wasn’t interrupted by the need to update patient notes thanks to the AI notetaking software.“For me, this has changed things,” Lall said. “It’s made me really happy.“I will never go back.”

Few tech innovations have made headlines and impacted lives as the rise of generative AI, with the capacity to create and curate content that resembles humans, Multiple AI platforms have taken center stage, tech VCs are pouring millions of dollars into the sector, and generative AI will be altering the very nature of work and the modern workplace. It can do many things, ranging from writing poems or stories, breaking down complex manuals into understandable text-sized nuggets, and occasionally even helping folks write code and more.
In due course, as more data sets get analyzed, stored, and used, generative AI will be finishing tasks such as making predictions, getting accurate business forecasts, and eliminating redundant ones that took a great deal of hours and capital. In essence, it will make our lives better by cutting out the tedium of everyday work by finishing it in the background. It will ensure employees get more time to exercise their creative muscle, innovating and creating solutions that can transform their business vertical. Business owners can use their power to eliminate redundancies and drive the business to growth and profitability. We shall discuss how generative AI is changing all aspects of human life, from work to recreation and play.
Work redefined
Take a step back and think about the first AI innovation one may have encountered. It is the humble chat bot and virtual assistant, popping up multiple times on websites and apps from banks to delivery platforms and offering quick fixes to the occasional problem. More often than not, though, one tends to prefer having an actual human at the other end, getting a human angle to resolve complex issues.
This is a problem statement that generative AI is trying to fix at the moment, as new-age chatbots use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to offer interactive and conversational details. They do not rely on specific keywords and are able to grasp the context, offering a natural flow to a larger conversation. Moreover, these chat bots can learn from ongoing conversations and offer customer care executives information using internal and external data on the main issues consumers face. In due course, these tools can write out basic marketing copy and send out mass mailers, leaving support executives with more time and energy to look at big-picture events.
The next area where generative AI might be a game changer is using the large volumes of information to gauge mood and employee sentiment, potentially flag any employee burnout issues, and be deployed by companies to take corrective measures. Moreover, AI tools can be deployed to track general employee performance, suggest personal training paths, and look at proactive measures to improve and upskill employees. Generative AI at work is a major disruptor that is bound to change the workplace in many ways. It is, however, a force for good that will ensure human creativity will be able to reach its acme, while AI picks up the tasks that can be easily automated.
However, it would be amiss to talk about generative AI and miss its impact on the creative fields, where the changes are numerous.
Shaking it up 
In the creative arena, generative AI often amplifies existing experiences and makes them sharper and more entertaining. The data sets can be tapped by artists, designers, and creators to sharpen their skills and offer a better experience for the end user. In music, for instance, in due course, tools can create and generate novel melodies, harmonies, and rhythms.
It can also help build more personalized tracks and lists, swift through volumes of musical databases, learn patterns, and eventually help compose pieces that can potentially mimic the style of classical composers and create novel sounds. A combination of human creativity and machine learning tools can aid in creating musical scores that create compositions that do not fit in the regular genres.
In the visual arts, AI algorithms can be used by artists to generate intricate designs, digital paintings, and sculptures. For writers and those creating content, the system can analyze vast amounts of text, understand context, and generate coherent and engaging narratives. For instance, it can help one draft quick mass mailers and basic marketing copies and aid in drafts for simple functions.
Of course, a human voice and input will be needed to tweak the content and add more data points and information, but generative AI can provide the barebones for the creation of a superstructure in terms of content. It can help writers sharpen their research skills, go through reams of content, deliver sharper insights, come up with incisive writing, and make the writer’s block a relic of the past. Its impact is also seen in gaming and entertainment. In video games, generative algorithms can help create dynamic and immersive experiences. It creates vast and diverse game worlds that adapt to player actions, ensuring a unique and engaging experience for all individual users. Think different storylines, character arcs, and so on.
Suffice it to say, generative AI and its tools are changing multiple aspects of our lives, from the workplace to entertainment and more. Most experts believe its integration into various aspects of daily life will result in a leap in workplace efficiency, with a trust for strategic thought and a renewed imagination of creative processes and entertainment options.
It is early days in space, but we should look forward to a future of harmonious coexistence between human creativity and the efficiency of AI tools, making the world a better place in multiple ways.

Is generative AI so important that you need to buy customized keyboards or hire a new chief AI officer, or is all the inflated excitement and investment not yet generating much in the way of returns for organizations?
Gen AI takes us from single-use models of machine learning (ML) to AI tools that promise to be a platform with uses in many areas, but you still need to validate they’re appropriate for the problems you want solved, and that your users know how to use gen AI effectively.
For every optimistic forecast, there’s a caveat against a rush to launch. Multiple studies suggest high numbers of people regularly use gen AI tools for both personal and work use, with 98% of the Fortune 1000 experimenting with gen AI, according to a recent PageDuty study. But now organizations appear to be taking a more cautious approach when it comes to official deployments.
 
 
 













 
 

For example, a quarter of IT decision-makers in Foundry’s 2023 AI Priorities Study are piloting gen AI technologies, but only 20% have moved on to deployment. Senior leaders in CCS Insight’s Employee Technology and Workplace Transformation Survey gave similar responses: by the end of 2023, 18% had already deployed gen AI to their full workforce, and 22% were ready to deploy. “People want to see it be real this year,” says Bola Rotibi, chief of enterprise research at CCS Insight. But talking to IT teams like the AI professionals in Intel’s 2023 ML Insider survey suggests only 10% of organizations put gen AI solutions into production in 2023.

Ready to roll 
It’s shorter to make a list of organizations that haven’t announced their gen AI investments, pilots, and plans, but relatively few are talking about the specifics of any productivity gains or ROI. But that may be as much about protecting any competitive advantage as it is about any lack of success.
For example, many Google customers, like Goldman Sachs, IHG, and Mercedes Benz, talking about building with its Gemini gen AI tools at the recent Google Cloud Next conference turned out to still be at the pilot stage rather than in deployment.
 
 
 













 
 

Pilots can offer value beyond just experimentation, of course. McKinsey reports that industrial design teams using LLM-powered summaries of user research and AI-generated images for ideation and experimentation sometimes see a reduction upward of 70% in product development cycle times. But it also emphasizes that those design teams need to do significant evaluation and manipulation of gen AI output to come up with a product that’s realistic and can actually be manufactured, and the recommendation is still to set policies, educate employees, and run pilot schemes. Similarly, Estée Lauder sees value from pilots like an internal chatbot trained on customer insights, behavioral research, and market trends to make those analytics more broadly available in the business, but is still working on how to actually deliver that value.
When it comes to dividing gen AI tools into task and role-specific vertical applications, or more general tools that can be broadly useful to knowledge workers, organizations seem able to adopt the latter more quickly.
As expected, Microsoft claims its own staff gets significant value from the gen AI tools it has in market, like Copilot for Microsoft 365. “Our best users are saving over 10 hours a month,” says Jared Spataro, CVP, modern work and business applications at Microsoft, and 70% of Copilot users say it makes them more productive, working up to a third faster.
 
 
 













 
 

Customers like Telstra report similar time savings for their early adopters, although Forrester lead analyst on Copilot for Microsoft 365 JP Gownder suggests five hours a month is a more common gain. The other question is how well that will scale across the organization. Large Japanese advertising agency Dentsu, for instance, is very enthusiastic about Copilot for Microsoft 365, claiming staff save up to 30 minutes a day on tasks.

Ask




Adoption of Copilot so far tends to be in what he refers to as pockets, which matches how McKinsey reports that most gen AI deployments are happening in specific departments: marketing and sales, service and support, and product development.
Telcos surveyed by McKinsey demonstrated the same blend of optimism and restraint as other industries, with a majority claiming to have cut costs with gen AI, and seen increases in call center agent productivity and improvement in marketing conversion rates with personalized content — both with models deployed in weeks rather than months. On the other hand, the impact has been low outside customer service or mapping network infrastructure.
 
 
 













 
 

Organic growth
Some of Microsoft’s original test customers have already moved from pilot to broad deployment. One of the earliest Microsoft 365 Copilot trials was at global law firm Clifford Chance, and the company is now deploying it to the entire workforce, alongside its custom AI tool, Clifford Chance Assist, built on Azure OpenAI. The company is careful to note that any legal output from gen AI is clearly labelled and checked by a qualified lawyer but, again, the main benefits are productivity gains for knowledge workers: live transcripts, meeting summaries, and both implicit commitments and agreed-on tasks from those meetings.
“This is an incredible technology that can raise productivity, save time, and be a great human assistant,” says Gownder. “But it’s different from the tools we’ve been releasing over the last 40 years in computing. It has these characteristics you need to learn about to be truly successful.”
He offers a string of questions to assess the AI quotient of your organization:
 
 
 













 
 


Do you have a basic understanding of how AI and prompt engineering work?
Have you had training?
Do you feel confident about being able to learn these things?
Are you motivated to get involved?
Are you aware of what can go wrong and how you can be an ethical user of these things?

Another issue is getting staff to make gen AI tools part of their workflow. “Some people are really bullish on Copilot and say they’re having a great experience with it,” adds Gownder. Others find bumps in the road, though, where half of users see productivity gains and the other half doesn’t use the tools. Frequently, that’s because enterprises are underinvesting in training by an order of magnitude.
Almost every major company evaluating Copilot for Microsoft 365 is only planning on an hour of training for staff instead of the 10 he suggests. “This is a core skill and you need to invest in training here because otherwise it’s going to bite you,” he says. That’s key both for gen AI deployments to succeed, and to get the most out of the gen AI features and natural language interfaces that’ll become common in commercial software, from Photoshop to Zoom.
Very specific successes
There are gen AI success stories in verticals like document engineering, where Docugami offers custom small language models that build a knowledge graph from a customer’s own complex documents, and can be used for both document generation and to extract data.
 
 
 













 
 

And commercial insurance is a vertical Docugami CEO Jean Paoli says has been an early adopter, including statements of value, certificates of insurance, as well as policy documents with renewal dates, penalties, and liabilities. That’s critical information describing the risk of both individual customers and the entire portfolio, which has been difficult to manually extract and consolidate to use for generating new quotes, or representing the portfolio to reinsurers. “These are real scenarios that save you millions of dollars, not few hundred bucks,” Paoli says.
Like everyone else, large Docugami customers created gen AI committees and started pilots in 2023, but many have already moved from discovery to implementation, starting production deployments at least six months ago and seeing real returns, chief business officer Alan Yates says. In life sciences, one customer uses the platform for clinical trial documentation, compliance, and data exploration. “It took them six months to do this work previously and now it takes them a week,” he says.
Coding is another vertical where adoption of gen AI in production is increasingly common, whether that’s GitHub Copilot, Google’s new Gemini Code Assist, AWS CodeWhisperer, or tools like ChatGPT that aren’t developer specific.
 
 
 













 
 

Productivity improvements can be much lower initially, though. When Cisco first rolled out GitHub Copilot to 6,000 developers, they only accepted the generated code 19% of the time. Now nearly half of code suggestions are accepted. Saving just six minutes of developer time a month is enough to cover the cost, according to Redfin, although there are other metrics like code quality that organizations will want to track as well.

But the gen AI gains can also be much higher for low code platforms where citizen developers with less expertise get more benefit from the assistance. Digital insurance agency Nsure.com was already using Power Automate extensively, but describing an automation flow in natural language is much faster than even a drag and drop interface. Workflows that took four hours to create and configure take closer to 40 minutes with Copilot for Power Automate, an improvement of over 80%.
Then there’s Microsoft customer PG&E, which built an IT helpdesk chatbot called Peggy with the low code Copilot Studio gen AI tool in Power Platform that handles 25 to 40% of employee requests, saving over $1.1 million annually, principal program manager for Microsoft Copilot AI Noa Ghersin says. And having Peggy walk employees through unlocking their access to SAP saves the helpdesk team 840 hours a year alone.
 
 
 













 
 

Organizations that have already adopted Power Platform for low code and RPA find they can make that automation more powerful using Copilot Studio to orchestrate processes where there are multiple workflows to choose from, like ticket refunds for Cineplex. Agents used to spend five to 15 minutes processing a refund even with automation, and now that’s 30 to 60 seconds.
Counting the cost
Set monthly subscriptions can seem expensive, but it’s hard to accurately estimate costs for on-demand gen AI tools, which may gate some deployments. The costs for individual gen AI tasks can be pennies, but even small costs add up.
“Cost is a primary thing you have to take into account in gen AI, whether you go to third-party vendors or even internally,” says LinkedIn principal staff software engineer Juan Bottaro. His team recently rolled out a new gen AI feature for premium users that uses your profile to suggest if you’re a good match for a job posting, and what skills or qualifications might improve your chances.
 
 
 













 
 

“There were several times where we would’ve liked to move much faster because we felt the experience was a lot more mature, but we had to wait because we just didn’t have enough capacity and GPUs available,” he says.
It’s hard to predict costs for novel workflows, and any assumptions you make about usage will probably be wrong because the way that people interact with this is very different, he adds. Instead, deploy to a small percentage of users and extrapolate from their behavior.
Initially, you may see cost savings because the speed of prototyping is dramatically and almost deceptively fast. Training and testing a classifier to understand intent typically takes one to two months, but his team was able to get prototypes of what they wanted to deliver in just a couple of days. “In a week, you can get something that looks like a finished product,” says Bottaro. “We managed to build something that looks very close to what you see today in the premium experience in a month or two.”
 
 
 













 
 

But getting from something that’s 80% of what you want to the level of quality you need to deploy will often take much longer. In this case, another four months.
It’s still too early to learn lessons from either technical or cost control failures in gen AI pilots, CCS Insight’s Rotibi says, but users can consider quotas and rate-limiting outbound requests to cloud AI services through API management gateways, just like other cloud services. The majority plan to limit the use of gen AI to targeted roles, individuals, or teams because of the pricing. “That’s a lot of money if you want to go across the organization,” she says.

What are you measuring?
Self-reported productivity isn’t necessarily the best way to measure gen AI deployment success, and successful deployments may even change what metrics matter, Gownder says. “If you’re pushing your entire tier-one support off to generative AI and you have really good natural language, the success rate will go up, so everything that gets to a human is a harder problem,” he says. “It’s more long tail and white-glove hand holding, and the metric is more about customer satisfaction than the length of the call.”
 
 
 













 
 

Just measuring the quality and accuracy of gen AI results is difficult given that it’s non-deterministic; the same inputs will likely give you a different result every time. That’s not necessarily a flaw if they’re correct and consistent, but does make it harder to evaluate, so unless you have an existing tool to compare it to, you have to create a benchmark for evaluating performance.
“Defining whether something is right or wrong becomes very subjective and difficult to measure,” Bottaro says.
To evaluate the tool, the team created shared guidelines for what a good response looks like. Similarly, for the Ask Learn API powering Copilot for Azure, Microsoft built a ‘golden dataset’ of representative, annotated questions and answers with reference data for ground truth to test against — and metrics to represent — answer quality.
 
 
 













 
 

Organizations are often more interested in whether they make money than save it by deploying gen AI, notes Rotibi. “I can see this as a productivity capability and an efficiency improvement for my workforce,” she says. “But where am I going to make money as an organization?”

There’s pressure to demonstrate the uptake of true ROI, Gownder adds, but warns we’re not at that point yet. It may be easier to connect role-specific tools like Copilot for Sales to improvements in conversion rate, deal flow, or the mean time to resolution of a call, but he cautions against assuming a direct causal relationship when there are so many variables.
Less quantifiable benefits can still be valuable in terms of TCO, though. “Let’s say giving people Copilot not only saves them time, but takes tedious tasks off their plates,” says Gownder. “That could improve their employee experience. We know employee experience benefits tend to lower attrition, and make people more motivated and engaged. There’s a lot of positive productivity from the psychological side of that.”
But sheer enthusiasm for gen AI and LLMs complicates things, says Bottaro: “We’re faced with a problem of, ‘Let’s find out how to measure value because I definitely want to build it.’ That’s looking at it the wrong way round.” He suggests going back to the same objective function of success metrics you’d use for any product, and being open to the possibility that for some use cases, traditional AI will be good enough.
 
 
 













 
 

Is gen AI failing?
There are valid questions about where it’s appropriate to adopt gen AI, how to stop users accepting inaccurate answers as irrefutable truths, and the concerning inclusion of both copyright and inappropriate material in training sets. But negative publicity and scaremongering can exaggerate risks and ignore the useful things you can already do if you adopt gen AI responsibly.
Reported gen AI failures are often as much about irresponsible behavior by users testing boundaries, or organizational failure to launch AI-powered tools to put sufficient guardrails in place, as it is about the inherent issues of the models themselves. Embarrassingly, at one point in 2023, OpenAI’s own $175 million VC fund was under the control of a fake identity, but that appears to be just another example of someone using AI-powered tools to help them with good old-fashioned business fraud.
Other concerns about gen AI involve deepfakes or simpler digital forgeries, potential legal risks around copyright of data used for the training set, and questions about compliance when using gen AI with sensitive or confidential data.
As with any cloud model, the notion of shared responsibility is key. AI providers need to supply models and services that are safe to use, but organizations adopting AI services must read the model cards and transparency notes, and test they’re adequately constraining the way they can be used.
“Some organizations have overextended to the customer with chatbots and realize they’re getting inconsistent answers,” Gownder says. But that doesn’t usually mean abandoning the project. “Maybe they pull it back and try to iterate offline before they launch it to customers,” he adds.
Organizational maturity in gen AI tends to track maturity in AI generally, and most companies adopting it say it’s helping them invest elsewhere. “They’re investing more in predictive AI, computer vision, and machine learning,” says Gownder. Businesses building their own AI tools are using multiple technologies and treating gen AI as a component rather than a solution. 
The best correction to gen AI hype is to view it as both a groundbreaking technology and just another tool in the toolbox, says Bottaro.

When talent search platform Plum noticed ChatGPT sending ripples through the tech world and beyond, it decided to turn right to the source to lay out how staff could and couldn’t use the generative artificial intelligence chatbot.
ChatGPT, which can turn simple text instructions into poems, essays, emails and more, churned out a draft document last summer that got the Kitchener, Ont.-based company about 70 per cent of the way to its final policy.
“There was nothing in there that was wrong; there was nothing in there that was crazy,” Plum’s chief executive Caitlin MacGregor recalled. “But there was an opportunity to get a little bit more specific or to make it a little bit more custom to our business.”
Plum’s final policy — a four-page document building on ChatGPT’s draft with advice from other startups cobbled together last summer — advises staff to keep client and proprietary info out of AI systems, review anything the technology spits out for accuracy and attribute any content it generates.
It makes Plum one of several Canadian organizations codifying their stance around AI as people increasingly rely on the technology to boost their productivity at work.
Many were spurred into developing policiesby the federal government, which released a set of AI guidelines for the public sector last fall. Now scores of startups and larger organizations have reworked them for their own needs or are developing their own versions.
These companies say their goal is not to curtail the use of generative AI but to ensure workers feel empowered enough to use it — responsibly.
“You’d be wrong to not leverage the power of this technology. It’s got so much opportunity for productivity, for functionality,” said Niraj Bhargava, founder of Nuenergy.ai, an Ottawa-based AI management software firm.
“But on the other hand, if you use it without putting (up) guardrails, there’s a lot of risks. There’s the existential risks of our planet, but then there’s the practical risks of bias and fairness or privacy issues.”
Striking a balance between both is key, but Bhargava said there’s “no one size fits all” policy that works for every organization.
If you’re a hospital, you might have a very different answer to what’s acceptable than a private sector tech company, he said.
There are, however, some tenets that frequently crop up in guidelines.
One is not plugging in client or proprietary data into AI tools because companies can’t ensure such info will remain private. It might even be used to train the models that power AI systems.
Another is treating anything that AI spits out as potentially false.
AI systems are still not foolproof. Tech startup Vectara estimates AI chatbots invent information at least three per cent of the time and in some instances, as much as 27 per cent of the time.
A B.C. lawyer had to admit to a court in February that she had cited two cases in a family dispute that were fabricated by ChatGPT.
A California lawyer similarly uncovered accuracy issues, when he asked the chatbot in April 2023 to compile a list of legal scholars who had sexually harassed someone. It incorrectly named an academic and cited a Washington Post article that did not exist.
Organizations crafting AI policies also often touch on transparency issues.
“If you would not attribute something that somebody else wrote as your own work, why would you attribute something that ChatGPT wrote as your own work?” questioned Elissa Strome,executive director of Pan-Canadian artificial intelligence strategy at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).
Many say people should be informed when it’s used to parse data, write text or create images, video or audio, but other instances are not as clear.
“We can use ChatGPT 17 times a day, but do we have to write an email disclosing it every single time? Probably not if you’re figuring out your travel itinerary and whether you should go by plane or by car, something like that,” Bhargava said.
“There’s a lot of innocuous cases where I don’t think I have to disclose that I used ChatGPT.”
How many companies have explored all the ways staff could use AI and conveyed what’s acceptable or not is unclear.
An April 2023 study from consulting firm KPMG of 4,515 Canadians found 70 per cent of Canadians who use generative AI say their employer has a policy around the technology.
However, October 2023 research from software firm Salesforce and YouGov concluded 41 per cent of the 1,020 Canadians surveyed reported their company had no policies on using generative AI for work. Some 13 per cent only had “loosely defined” guidelines.
At Sun Life Financial Inc., staff are blocked from using external AI tools for work because the company can’t guarantee client, financial or health information will be kept private when these systems are used.
However, the insurer lets workers use internal versions of Anthropic’s AI chatbot Claude and GitHub Copilot, an AI-based programming assistant, because the company has been able to ensure both abide by its data privacy policies, said chief information officer Laura Money.
So far, she’s seen staff use the tools to write code and craft memos and scripts for videos.
To encourage more to experiment, the insurer has encouraged staff to enrol in a self-directed free online course from CIFAR that teaches the principles of AI and its effects.
Of that move, Money said, “You want your employees to be familiar with these technologies because it can make them more productive and make their work lives better and make work a little more fun.”
About 400 workers have enrolled since the course was offered to them a few weeks ago.
Despite offering the course, Sun Life knows its approach to the technology has to keep evolving because AI is advancing so quickly.
Plum and CIFAR, for example, each launched their policies before generative AI tools that go beyond text to create sound, audio or video were readily available.
“There wasn’t the same level of image generation as there is now,” MacGregor said of summer 2023, when Plum launched its AI policy with a hackathon asking staff to write poems about the business with ChatGPT or experiment with how it could solve some of the business’s problems.
“Definitely a yearly review is probably necessary.”
Bhargava agrees, but said many organizations still have to play catch up because they have no policy yet.
“The time is now to do it,” he said.
“If the genie is out of the bottle, it’s not like we can think ‘maybe next year we’ll do this.'”

The financial services industry is investing heavily in the technology that makes artificial intelligence work. Now it needs to make the same investments in the talent that will make AI work for their businesses.


Almost all large financial services firms are introducing artificial intelligence to their strategies. In fact, more than 95% of firms participating in a new Broadridge study say they are investing in AI. These firms are working to integrate AI into client-facing, front-office functions such as customer service and research, as well as into operations, data management, risk, fraud and virtually every other area of the business.

Senior leaders at these companies are making AI a priority because they understand the potential impact AI and machine learning could have on their businesses and also on society, in general. Experts project that generative AI (GenAI) applications could add up to $4.4 trillion in value to the global economy—every year!

PROMOTED
Digital Transformation
Estimates like those have prompted financial service firms around the world to make AI a key part of ongoing efforts to remake their businesses with digital technology. Although the financial services industry has been slow to adopt new technology, firms are investing heavily in digital transformation. Once firms modernize their technology platforms by moving to the cloud, centralizing data and making other upgrades, they are in position to integrate powerful innovative tools such as AI and ML. Among financial service firms categorized as digital leaders, 44% are making moderate to large investments in GenAI—more than twice the level of nonleaders.

These early adopters are laying out a road map for other firms to follow when it comes to building the technology platforms needed to support AI. However, even among these advanced companies, one critical element is being neglected. Firms will never realize the ultimate potential of their AI investments if the people within the organization don’t know how to use it effectively. Despite the push to build out AI capabilities, the majority of financial services firms have not implemented a defined strategy for reskilling their workforces for the coming era of AI.

Upskilling Across The Board
The need for upskilling is apparent for IT staff such as developers, security professionals and data engineers. However, since AI is being integrated into nearly every business function, it’s equally important for companies to train teams outside of tech roles, creating GenAI experts throughout the company and teaching employees across the organization how to integrate AI into their workflows.

Roughly 46% of companies in the survey have implemented a reskilling plan to help employees manage the general impact of AI, and about 45% allow staff to use GenAI for general work purposes. However, only about a quarter of companies are directly training staff on how to use GenAI tools.

Empowering Employees
Even fewer companies are talking to employees about the bigger issue of how to best apply AI to their jobs and get the most out of the technology. AI and ML applications will automate many of the routine tasks that now take up time. That will free up staff to work directly with clients and focus on higher value-added activities. In so doing, it will change the nature of many positions and could change the skill sets needed for many roles. For example, LTX’s new BondGPT+ solution has the potential to dramatically reduce the amount of time bond traders spend collecting and analyzing market information. By instantly processing information about more than 30,000 corporate bonds, the AI-powered tool will dramatically increase the amount of real-time data traders have on hand to make decisions, while freeing up hours of traders’ time. Companies should be working closely with professionals in all fields to determine how best to use this time.
About 55% of survey respondents say the rise of AI will create a greater need for strong analytical and critical thinking skills. Of course, employees will have access to AI tools designed to boost those exactly those capabilities. Organizations are already using large-language models (LLMs) to improve data-driven decision-making and analysis.
Figuring out ways to integrate these tools that empower staff and enhance business results will be one of the biggest challenges facing financial service firms and, indeed, all companies. As companies build out the technology platforms that will enable AI, they should also be building out programs to educate employees about the practical, legal and ethical aspects of AI. Upskilling the workforce to thrive in an environment fueled by AI applications is the only way to unleash the full benefits of this powerful technology for companies and employees alike.

How are Businesses Adjusting to the Rise of Artificial Intelligence?

Whatever your feelings about artificial intelligence (AI), one thing is clear: businesses are rapidly adjusting to a reality where AI has been baked into a plethora of workflows. How that might impact your own job is an open question.

A new study by Ernst & Young LLP suggests that A.I. adoption will force 50 percent of businesses to unleash layoffs alongside new hiring in an attempt to adjust. Companies are reshaping their workforce to be more AI savvy. With this transition, we can anticipate a continuous cycle of strategic workforce realignment, characterized by simultaneous layoffs and hiring, and not necessarily in equal volumes,” Vamsi Duvvuri, EY Technology, Media and Telecommunications AI Leader, wrote in a statement accompanying the study’s data. “But it’s not all doom and gloom. Employees and companies alike continue to show enthusiasm around AI, specifically when it comes to opportunities to scale and compete more effectively in the marketplace.”

Of the 255 business leaders surveyed for the study, some 72 percent said their employees were using AI at least daily in the workplace. Top uses included coding and software development (51 percent), data analysis (51 percent), and internal and external communication (47 percent). Moreover, 82 percent of these leaders plan increasing their AI investment in the next year.

Amidst this changing landscape, these leaders are hiring for key roles, including:
Cybersecurity Analyst
AI will increasingly automate threat detection and other aspects of the cybersecurity business, freeing analysts to focus on strategic response and investigation.

AI Tools to Know: Anomaly detection systems, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), Machine learning for threat hunting.
Languages: Python (Scikit-learn for ML), scripting (bash, PowerShell) for automation.
Takeaway: Upskill in AI to understand and leverage automated tools. Hone soft skills like communication and critical thinking for effective incident response.

Data Scientist
AI will impact data cleaning and feature engineering, allowing data scientists to focus on model building and sharing their results with other stakeholders throughout their organization.

AI Tools to Know: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis, Deep Learning for complex pattern recognition.
Languages: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch for deep learning), R for statistical analysis.
Takeaway: Learn AI fundamentals to build and interpret complex models. Strengthen communication skills to translate insights into actionable business strategies.

AI Engineer
Although a relatively new role, AI engineering is evolving quickly. The focus is shifting from designing algorithms to building robust and secure AI systems for real-world applications.

AI Tools to Know: Deep Learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), Explainable AI (XAI) for model transparency.
Languages: Python (core language for AI development), C++ for high-performance computing.
Takeaway: Deepen your understanding of AI theory and practical application. Master software engineering principles to build scalable and secure AI systems.

If you want to expand your career to incorporate A.I., consider the following:

Online Courses: Numerous online platforms offer AI and ML courses with varying depths. Choose reputable providers with career-oriented curriculums.
Personal Projects: Experiment with open-source AI libraries and datasets to gain hands-on experience. Build a portfolio showcasing your skills.
Certifications: Industry-recognized AI certifications can validate your expertise and enhance your resume.

As companies are scramble to get ahead in the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, one problem the face is finding and retaining AI talent.
For example, Meta has been extending job offers to candidates with AI experience without even interviewing them, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg went so far as to email researchers at Google’s DeepMind unit to recruit talent.
According to a recent study led by the Oxford Internet Institute, “AI skills are particularly valuable as they have high levels of skill complementarity, increasing worker wages by 21% on average.”
 
 
 













 
 

Foote Partners, a consulting and research firm, recently published its latest IT skills and pay index, which found, not surprisingly, that companies are paying premiums for workers with AI-related abilities.

Foote Partners recognizes 47 “critical A.I. skills,” and on average, employees who obtain those skills get a pay premium of 7% to 21%. Those premiums can come in different  forms, including bonuses and cash compensation.
“This is cash paid out, not as a salary increase but in addition to salary,” said David Foote, chief analyst at Foote Partners. “In fact, 28 of these core AI skills can add between 15% and 21% in pay, well above the 9.6% average premium across all 632 non-certified skills we report. They are very hot right now.”
 
 
 













 
 

Cash premiums for skills such as AI chatbot app developer and large language model (LLM) tuning are paid out separately from salaries so that as needs are met and the value of those talents declines, the payouts can be reduced or eliminated.
“Perhaps the main difference with skills pay is, unlike a bonus, skills pay premiums are typically paid out at every pay period —  same as salary — instead of a lump sum at the end of year, which is more common with bonuses,” Foote said.
In addition, more than a dozen AI-related certifications “are showing real market value strength,” he said. Those skills include prompt engineering, neural networks, AI engineer, AI scientist, and AI model optimization.
 
 
 













 
 

According to Foote, a Certified Artificial Intelligence Scientist earns the highest pay premium, ranging 8% to 12%, with the average being 10% of base salary equivalent,. The next highest cash pay premium in this cluster is for a Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate, who can earn 9% of base equivalent in skills premium pay.
Averaging 8% of base salary equivalent in skills pay premium are: SAS Certified Professional: AI and Machine Learning; IBM Certified Specialist — AI Enterprise Workflow V1; Artificial Intelligence Engineer (AIE – all tracks); and Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer certifications.
“We’ve been tracking some of these AI-related skills for many years, updating every 90 days,” Foote said. “Others have been recently added. So, given all the volatility in the marketplace for skills cash pay premiums, there have been remarkable changes over time ,including most recently.”
 
 
 













 
 

Foote Partner’s findings are echoed elsewhere. Freelance work platform Upwork, which recently published its 2024 list of most in-demand skills, found that the rise of AI — especially generative AI in the last couple of years — has changed the top skills businesses seek from independent professionals. In particular, generative AI modeling, machine learning and data analytics are the top three fastest-growing data science and analytics skills, as well as among the most in-demand skills.
“In particular, skills in key programming languages commonly used in the development of AI — Python, Java, and SQL — rank among the top five most sought-after skills on the technical side in the US,” Ya Xu, head of data and AI at LinkedIn, said in a blog post.
Machine learning skills can command at least a 10% premium compared to the average tech worker, according to a survey conducted at the end of 2023 by tech staffing firm Dice. “But this is a fast-moving market where the demand is growing rapidly,” said Art Zeile, CEO of Dice. “I predict that this premium will only continue to grow as the gap between supply and demand for AI talent grows, and offering benefits such as continuous professional development and training will be key to retaining this top talent.”
 
 
 













 
 

A key differentiator in the job interview process now involves how a tech professional has upskilled themselves in the face of the growing demand for AI, Zeile noted.
“Now is the time to ensure that their skill sets encompass [LLM] theory and programming architecture, areas that may have been overlooked or haven’t been delved into fully,” he said. “Recruiters are looking for tech professionals who are quick on their feet and able to adapt to changes with agility and curiosity.”
In January 2023, AI or machine learning-related skill sets were referenced on 9% of tech job postings. Just over a year later, in February 2024, that figure had climbed to nearly 14% of all tech job postings, according to Zeile.
 
 
 













 
 

“As AI continues to evolve, its impact on organizations will be most prominent in key departments such as research and development, data analytics, and operations,” Zeile said.
To secure top AI talent in these areas, Zeile advised that companies:

Invest in comprehensive recruiting strategies that show a full understanding of what a particular AI role actually requires — whether it’s machine learning, Python, or data science skills for tech jobs, or other content-centric skills such as copy writing and graphic design. 
Establish competitive salaries and provide opportunities for professional growth and development. 
Offer flexibility in the form of hybrid/remote work environments. Dice’s 2023 Tech Sentiment Report noted that remote work remains very important to tech professionals: 73% of those surveyed said it is “extremely” or “very” important to have the opportunity to work remotely at least three days a week.

While Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft are among the top 15 companies hiring for AI talent right now, according to Dice, there are a variety of factors tech pros must consider determining if Big Tech is right for them.
 
 
 













 
 

“While these Big Tech companies offer many opportunities for individuals with AI skills, candidates should also consider startups and other industries that align with their career goals and work/life balance preferences that would also still give them the ability to learn and flex their AI muscles,” Zeile said.  “Ultimately, it is up to tech professionals to decide what companies most align with their values and what kind of industries they want to work in.”

Startups, Zeille said, often provide more room for innovation and growth, but may have less rigorous AI programs in place. At the same time, compensation at Big Tech companies might be higher, but work/life balance lower. Once a candidate has decided what is important to prioritize in their future role, they can job search accordingly.

Generative AI has captured everyone’s attention — and for good reason. But getting from potential to profitability does not come without risks, such as assuming that your established processes for deploying mainstream enterprise IT infrastructure will work in the new era of complex AI superclusters.
A solid technology infrastructure has always been essential. Still, CIOs who want to ensure AI delivers on its promise will need a better idea of what’s required to design, deploy, and manage this foundational component at scale, including:

Infrastructure requirements

AI-based environments are relatively new, and trying to align traditional enterprise computing design and architecture with high-powered processors, low-latency networks, and scheduler-driven workload environments introduces a new set of challenges. Physical data center design is foundational, and the silent, longtail impact of an incorrectly provisioned system can mean launching into a “false start” deployment based on incorrect power, cooling, and network elements.
2. Performance optimization
Second to good design is the impact of complex, low-latency GPU networking fabrics. These systems require precision configuration, and while untuned systems remain functional, teams sit blissfully unaware of low-performance levels on AI workloads and, ultimately, substantial missed ROI.
Mark Seamans, Vice President of Global Marketing at Penguin/SGH, likens it to Formula 1 Racing. “An improperly configured system may seem like it’s running like a Formula 1 car, but it’s only when you put five other cars on the track that you realize your competition is blowing past you,” he says. “Making sure you work with a prescriptive set of criteria during design, build, and deployment means you can hit full Formula 1 speeds even if you’re the only one on the track.”
3. Scalability, flexibility, and reliability
When you consider AI infrastructure and its building block nature, precision becomes even more important for handling varying AI workloads effectively. Yes, that’s scalability and flexibility to accommodate changing computational demands. But, as Mark notes, “It’s also about stability as teams go through security, software, and firmware updates, or in cases of adding new AI nodes to expand cluster capacity. If the building blocks were done non-optimally, future changes could destabilize systems.”
4. Data management
Organizations are used to environments where other servers can pick up the load if one goes down. Yet, AI systems don’t operate the same way. Misconfigured networks, node failures, or even the loss of an individual GPU, can kill a job that may have been running for weeks – frustrating users and adding work for heavily burdened IT teams.  
“Penguin has developed many innovations for improving cluster performance and reliability – including a solution that isolates pending GPU failures, where we can evacuate those nodes, triage it outside of production configuration, remediate the problem, and then reprovision and put it back as a healthy node into the cluster,” says Mark.
5. Cost considerations
Cost is always a consideration, but the implications associated with AI workloads are on a larger scale. Consider a system with 1,000 nodes, each connected by ten network cables and multiple complex network fabrics. The hardware procurement, significant energy consumption for power and cooling, and maintenance costs can stretch budget constraints upfront if not balanced with deployment timelines and performance requirements. With these multi-million-dollar AI configurations, delays in bringing a system to production drives significant unnecessary costs from depreciation and missed ROI. 
Proof points from an experienced AI infrastructure partner
Over 25 years of HPC experience and more than seven years of deploying AI infrastructure at scale has made Penguin Solutions the go-to for AI platforms. With more than 50k GPUs deployed and customers like Meta relying on their specialized expertise, Penguin is ready to be the trusted partner to help every customer on their race to the future.

Recent data reveals significant shifts in both academic preferences and industry demands, necessitating a data-driven approach to educational adaptation.MBAs becoming less lucrative or just another cyclical downturnData from educational institutions worldwide points to a concerning trend: a decline in admissions to traditional Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs. The Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) revealed a significant 13% drop in global MBA applications between 2018 and 2021. This trend persisted, with NDTV reporting a further 5% decline in 2023. Notably, European schools experienced a sharp decrease, with a 13% drop in all international applications in 2023.The dwindling interest in MBAs reflects shifting preferences among prospective students. Increasingly, individuals are seeking specialised skills tailored to emerging industries like technology and data science. This begs the question: is the MBA market experiencing a cyclical downturn, or is a more profound shift underway in the demand for full-time MBAs.Employment trends in the tech sectorA 2020 McKinsey report estimates that up to 800 million jobs globally could be lost to automation by 2030, with jobs in manufacturing, transportation, and administrative support most at risk. However, the report also highlights that up to 950 million new jobs could be created in areas like ‘data analysis’, ‘technology development’, and ‘creative content production’. Sign up for our exclusive newsletters.Subscribe to check out our popular newsletters.* indicates mandatory fieldsAnalysis of job market data reveals a growing demand for professionals with expertise in AI-related fields such as machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence engineering. A report by LinkedIn indicates that AI-related skills, including proficiency in ‘machine learning’, ‘data structures’ and ‘natural language processing’, are among the fastest-growing in-demand skills globally (Dec 2022 onwards). Globally, professionals with bachelor’s and graduate degrees stand to see a slightly greater level of disruption (55% and 52%, respectively) than professionals with high school diplomas and associate degrees (50% and 47%, respectively), which suggest that they may face relatively more urgency to adapt their skills by adopting AI tools. Education trends in the AI driven marketAs the demands of the job market shift in response to technological advancements, educational institutions are reassessing their course offerings to remain relevant in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Data-driven insights suggest that traditional courses focused solely on theoretical concepts may soon become redundant, while those integrating AI and emerging technologies are witnessing a surge in demand. For instance, enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) indicates a notable increase in computer science programs with specialisations in AI and data analytics in the USA.So, which skills will see an upsurge?Data fluency: In the AI era, proficiency in data fluency is paramount. Students need to master statistical analysis, programming languages like Python (as preferred by 88% of data scientists according to a 2023 poll by KDnuggets), and data visualization tools to thrive in data-driven environments.Critical thinking and problem-solving: With AI automating routine tasks, human-centric skills like critical thinking, complex problem-solving, and creativity are more crucial than ever. Educational programs should prioritise these skills to equip students for the unpredictable challenges of tomorrow.Continuous learning: Given the rapid pace of technological change, fostering a culture of lifelong learning is imperative. Educational institutions must instill in students the value of continuous skill development and adaptation to new technologies to remain competitive in the evolving job market.In an intriguing twist, it’s noteworthy how rapidly the relevance of certain fields of study is evolving. What was once considered knowledge for a lifetime now faces redundancy in less than a decade—a phenomenon previously unheard of.ISRO like Institute for TechnologyTo ensure India doesn't fall behind in the next technological wave, there's a pressing need to establish institutions akin to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) but tailored for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies. Just as ISRO propelled India into the space race, these institutions could spearhead our efforts to catch up with other countries in the realm of AI and new technologies.Given that we are behind many countries in the AI race, it's imperative for India to invest in building robust research and development infrastructure focused on AI and related fields. By fostering innovation and collaboration between academia, industry, and government, we can position ourselves as leaders in the global AI landscape.""Universal Basic Income: Addressing mass unemployment debateAs mass unemployment becomes a stark reality in the wake of technological advancements, it's time to initiate discussions on implementing Universal Basic Income (UBI). With automation and AI displacing traditional jobs at an unprecedented rate, UBI offers a pragmatic solution to ensure financial stability for individuals facing job loss. By providing a guaranteed income floor, UBI not only alleviates immediate financial hardships but also promotes economic resilience and empowers individuals to adapt to the changing job market through retraining and upskilling initiatives. It's imperative to engage in open dialogue and explore innovative policy measures to address the challenges posed by mass unemployment effectively.The adaptation of education to the needs of the AI-driven job market requires a data-driven approach informed by empirical evidence and industry trends. By analyzing academic preferences, employment trends, and skill demands, educational institutions can tailor their offerings to equip students with the competencies needed for success in the digital age. Through the strategic integration of AI-driven technologies, education can become equitable, accessible, personalised, inclusive, and responsive to the evolving needs of learners and employers alike.Edited by Megha Reddy(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)Advertise with usArtificial IntelligenceEducationUnemploymentAdvertise with usMOST VIEWED STORIES1Union BudgetUnion Budget 2024: Live updates2FundingStable Money raises over Rs 123 Cr in Series A CCPS round3EventsStartup TN on a mission to encourage world-class, deeptech, ground-breaking startups4NewsIndia's renewable energy sector to attract Rs 30.5 lakh Cr investment by 2030: Economic Survey5FundingCoworking startup Incuspaze raises $8M from Indian Inflection Opportunity FundAdvertise with usAdvertise with us

This begs the question: is the MBA market experiencing a cyclical downturn, or is a more profound shift underway in the demand for full-time MBAs.
Employment trends in the tech sector
A 2020 McKinsey report estimates that up to 800 million jobs globally could be lost to automation by 2030, with jobs in manufacturing, transportation, and administrative support most at risk. However, the report also highlights that up to 950 million new jobs could be created in areas like ‘data analysis’, ‘technology development’, and ‘creative content production’. 
Analysis of job market data reveals a growing demand for professionals with expertise in AI-related fields such as machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence engineering. A report by LinkedIn indicates that AI-related skills, including proficiency in ‘machine learning’, ‘data structures’ and ‘natural language processing’, are among the fastest-growing in-demand skills globally (Dec 2022 onwards). 
Globally, professionals with bachelor’s and graduate degrees stand to see a slightly greater level of disruption (55% and 52%, respectively) than professionals with high school diplomas and associate degrees (50% and 47%, respectively), which suggest that they may face relatively more urgency to adapt their skills by adopting AI tools. 
Education trends in the AI driven market
As the demands of the job market shift in response to technological advancements, educational institutions are reassessing their course offerings to remain relevant in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Data-driven insights suggest that traditional courses focused solely on theoretical concepts may soon become redundant, while those integrating AI and emerging technologies are witnessing a surge in demand. For instance, enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) indicates a notable increase in computer science programs with specialisations in AI and data analytics in the USA.
So, which skills will see an upsurge?
Data fluency: In the AI era, proficiency in data fluency is paramount. Students need to master statistical analysis, programming languages like Python (as preferred by 88% of data scientists according to a 2023 poll by KDnuggets), and data visualization tools to thrive in data-driven environments.

Critical thinking and problem-solving: With AI automating routine tasks, human-centric skills like critical thinking, complex problem-solving, and creativity are more crucial than ever. Educational programs should prioritise these skills to equip students for the unpredictable challenges of tomorrow.

Continuous learning: Given the rapid pace of technological change, fostering a culture of lifelong learning is imperative. Educational institutions must instill in students the value of continuous skill development and adaptation to new technologies to remain competitive in the evolving job market.

In an intriguing twist, it’s noteworthy how rapidly the relevance of certain fields of study is evolving. What was once considered knowledge for a lifetime now faces redundancy in less than a decade—a phenomenon previously unheard of.
ISRO like Institute for Technology
To ensure India doesn't fall behind in the next technological wave, there's a pressing need to establish institutions akin to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) but tailored for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies. Just as ISRO propelled India into the space race, these institutions could spearhead our efforts to catch up with other countries in the realm of AI and new technologies.
Given that we are behind many countries in the AI race, it's imperative for India to invest in building robust research and development infrastructure focused on AI and related fields. By fostering innovation and collaboration between academia, industry, and government, we can position ourselves as leaders in the global AI landscape.""
Universal Basic Income: Addressing mass unemployment debate
As mass unemployment becomes a stark reality in the wake of technological advancements, it's time to initiate discussions on implementing Universal Basic Income (UBI). With automation and AI displacing traditional jobs at an unprecedented rate, UBI offers a pragmatic solution to ensure financial stability for individuals facing job loss. 
By providing a guaranteed income floor, UBI not only alleviates immediate financial hardships but also promotes economic resilience and empowers individuals to adapt to the changing job market through retraining and upskilling initiatives. It's imperative to engage in open dialogue and explore innovative policy measures to address the challenges posed by mass unemployment effectively.
The adaptation of education to the needs of the AI-driven job market requires a data-driven approach informed by empirical evidence and industry trends. By analyzing academic preferences, employment trends, and skill demands, educational institutions can tailor their offerings to equip students with the competencies needed for success in the digital age. Through the strategic integration of AI-driven technologies, education can become equitable, accessible, personalised, inclusive, and responsive to the evolving needs of learners and employers alike.

UT Partners With Grammarly to Guide Effective Generative AI Use in Higher Education

                          By:
                        Hannah Conrad


















The University of Texas at Austin has teamed up with Grammarly for Education, an AI-enabled writing assistant, to investigate the adoption of generative artificial intelligence in a broad academic setting.
This project, led by UT’s Office of Academic Technology and in alignment with the University’s Year of AI initiative, will be broken into two phases. First, there will be a testing phase during which students, faculty and staff will interact with Grammarly’s generative AI assistant. Faculty and staff participants will design generative AI activities relevant to their own work areas and test those activities with students and peers. Second, faculty will create more detailed lesson plans to engage students in generative AI learning activities — all vetted to meet UT’s academic standards.
“We strive to be involved in projects that will influence higher education on and beyond the Forty Acres,” said Art Markman, vice provost for academic affairs. “We are in an era with a lot of uncertainty surrounding AI and education. This is a chance to demonstrate how to use generative AI as a positive source for education, teach responsibility to our students, and engage an industry leader to improve our understanding of classroom AI.”
Grammarly’s GenAI assistant
All participants in the project will receive a short-term Grammarly for Education pilot license. Training on Grammarly for Education and the AI assistant will be provided.
“We’re thrilled to partner with UT on such a forward-looking project,” said Mary Rose Craycraft, head of customer success at Grammarly for Education. “We know that innovating with AI while preserving academic integrity and critical thinking is a key challenge that all institutions are grappling with right now. We look forward to working with UT to develop best practices that can scale responsible AI adoption across the sector.”
Projects like the Grammarly adoption are carefully assessed and vetted by the Office of Academic Technology through a Learning Technology Adoption Process (LTAP). LTAPs provide a strategic and coordinated approach to data-driven adoption of academic technology ensuring the University only adopts and promotes tools on campus that align with its principles of effective teaching. The process protects students and faculty from adopting short-term technologies or those unsuitable for information security regulations.
Ultimately, the University’s coordination and partnership with emerging learning technology platforms leads to decisions that are in the best interest of students, staff and faculty. By collaborating with those who will be using generative AI tools most through case studies and active feedback, the Office of Academic Technology aims to engage in both AI-forward and AI-responsible teaching and learning at UT Austin.
“Our primary generative AI strategy is to use evidence-based decision-making to drive effective, forward and responsible AI use in ways that advance the teaching and learning mission of the University,” said Julie Schell, assistant vice provost of academic technology. “We are very excited to work with Grammarly to engage the UT community and create generative AI activities and lesson plans vetted by UT faculty, staff and students that can be scaled with any generative AI tool.”

Artificial intelligence is predicted to impact 17% of Saudi Arabian jobs in the next 3 years, according to international experts.
According to Arab media, Najla Najam, a professional business manager of an American consulting business company, said that AI is expected not only to change the way people work but also possible that it will replace people.
Experts predict that AI will have an impact on 80% of creative jobs and that it will risk 53% of executive positions.
While the study found that Middle Eastern workers are more involved in productivity problems than workers in other countries, it is also anticipated that companies would provide their workers training to help them adjust to the demands of the new era.
A large number of those affected by artificial intelligence will be people from the 90s to the 21st century whose jobs may be at risk.
Oliver, director of the Middle East affairs of a global consultancy firm, said that considering the future changing conditions, it can be said that 17% of jobs in the Kingdom will be replaced by artificial intelligence within 3 years.
