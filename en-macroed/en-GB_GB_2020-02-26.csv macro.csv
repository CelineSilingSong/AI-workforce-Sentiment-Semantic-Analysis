In the age of artificial intelligence, technology has given us many online tools, apps, and robots to help us educate our children. But, as parents know, nothing beats one-on-one interaction between a parent and a child. Our children learn most effectively by social means. 


With the influx of technology, there’s one inherent problem in our current education system that seems to be amplified: flexibility. 

Our children never had the “flexibility” of education that can provide them with a tailored experience to fulfill their potential. We had camps, schools, after school activities, etc.. But now we have much more.

Now, with the use of AI and robotics, we can tailor curriculums and provide personalized distance learning options. We can even provide therapeutic options for students with special needs. 

PROMOTED
With an increase in flexible learning options, we are faced with too many choices while still grappling with the inflexible behemoth of our current public education system. 
Can a mixture of technology options and our public education system provide what our children will need to usher them into the age of artificial intelligence?
This is the question that many parents are asking. 
There’s no doubt that many parts of our public school education system needs to change. Educator Sir Ken Robinson, the author of Creative Schools: The Grassroots Revolution That’s Transforming Education speaks about the way that we need to change our education system so that we can help our kids succeed in their future world.

Creativity is at the center of progress
The catch 22 in our current education system is the question of creativity. As technology advances, humans are put in a position of having to be more creative. At the same time, without creativity, our humanity doesn’t progress and our technology doesn’t progress either.

Creativity is not just about creating artworks, making music, or writing poetry.
Creativity underlies every single profession in our future of work.
With the help of an AI, every single one of us: teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, programmers, politicians, and shop keepers, etc.. will be making decisions about more complex problems. We will get to a point when an AI will be integrated into our work to help us become more efficient. The complex world will demand us — humans, to be that much more creative in our future of work. 
No, we don’t want to offload the best parts of us, such as creativity to an AI. 
This is why we must step up to the job. 
We’ve got to show our children how to step up to the job as well. We are educating people out of their creative capacities.. I believe this passionately, that we don’t grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it.

Ken Robinson
More technology is not the whole solution, the whole solution is a mindset change
What does it mean to educate a creative child? The answer is not what we expect. Some of us who came out of the rigid system of education is not familiar with the concept of educating a creative child.
This is when we need to shift our mindset.
Educating a creative child can mean letting your child engage in messy play at the expense of cleaning up right away.
Educating a creative child can mean a focus on art and physical education as much as focusing on STEM subjects.
Educating a creative child can mean that coaching a child is as important as teaching a child.
This mindset shift of educating our children how we have always done it versus let’s find out how we can do better is an important one.
Replace the complacency with action
Currently, many of us are struggling with the future of work. It’s tempting to put off our children’s education and just let the system take care of it. The truth is that complacency actually leads us to fear. Complacency in times of change leads us to a place where we fear for the future. 
The best way to deal with water is simply to float above the water and swim. 
Visualize change as the action of a wave. It may inundate you with emotions for a few weeks if the change is drastic. But, once you go through that, you can adapt by swimming in it and taking action.
We can all see the future of artificial intelligence. It’s not coming in tidal waves of months but rather years. Still, it’s there. We can see the wave coming up over the horizon.  
To deal with it effectively, burying comfort is the first step. Taking action to come up with a plan of action for our children will snap the fear at its source. 
Ask yourself these questions:


What does my child need? 
How can I help my child unleash their potential? 


Each one of us along with our children can cultivate their intelligence by walking alongside of them on their learning journey.
Instead of teaching, how about facilitating opportunities for them to learn?
Integrate your learning with your child’s
There’s no better time to learn with your child. Yes, we don’t know everything that there’s to know. If we admit that, then it’s that much easier to be empathetic toward your child’s learning path. Learning with your child means going on an exploration with your child. Both of you don’t know where you will end up. That’s what’s thrilling.
Kobe Bryant taught his daughter to play basketball.
Kris Jenner taught her children to run businesses.
Maria Shriver taught her children to care about the world around them.
In each of these cases, these parents are not just teaching their children about their own professions and values. They are increasing their own depth of knowledge by going on an educational journey with their children.
The path of learning is failing over and over again
There’s nothing more powerful than the gut-wrenching feeling of failure. You feel humiliated. You can’t get up from your bed. You want to eat a tub of ice cream. Sometimes, even when you know that you gave it your all, you still feel terrible when things didn’t work out. 
If you are watching your child go through this process, you can feel worse.
It’s tempting to show them how to do it so that they can avoid feeling like a failure.
My question to you is that, would you rather have your child fail “young”, when no one is watching, or would you rather have your child fail as an adult when the world is watching? 
Failures are lessons that are hard-won. They are opportunities to imprint a set of values and experiences that will consistently remind your child of important lessons. 
In the end, your child will learn whether you are there or not. Your child’s learning process might start with your encouragement but it will carry on without you.
How do you set them up for success?
In the age of artificial intelligence, as parents, we are blessed to have so many tools available to design a flexible, tailored set of education for our children. We are empowered to work with teachers, and our community to set our children up for success in their future of work. If we simply shifted our mindset and took small steps to steer our everyday actions toward unleashing our children’s potential, the end result, in the next decade, is that our collective efforts have the power to change the world. Now, that’s something to look forward to.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  HSBC Holdings is a multinational banking and financial services holding company and is ranked 99th on the Fortune 500 list. The bank has worked with multiple AI vendors and provided evidence of success that other top banks lack. According to our AI Opportunity Landscape research on how the top global banks are using AI, besides Deutsche Bank, HSBC is the European bank with the most AI initiatives. HSBC’s AI initiatives account for 12.5% of the AI initiatives at the European banks in our analysis.  In this article, we cover the bank’s work with two vendors in particular: Ayasdi: AI for anti-money laundering and reducing false positives in fraud detection processes. Element AI: AI for compliance and predicting services customers might need. We begin our dive into HSBC’s AI initiatives with its anti-money laundering solution from Ayasdi.  HSBC’s AI-enabled Anti-Money Laundering Solution In 2018, HSBC partnered with Ayasdi to develop an AI-enabled anti-money laundering solution. The software can purportedly identify patterns within historical data that may point toward money laundering, which helps the bank stop payments before they violate regulations. Ayasdi claims to have reduced HSBC’s false positives by 20% and found numerous behavioral patterns directly related to fraud. The solution was developed in collaboration with HSBC’s IT team and Ayasdi’s data scientists and developers. The IT team purportedly helped Ayasdi access and parse the bank’s AML data. Additionally, the internal modeling review team helped Ayasdi create more accurate models for customer behavior. The bank could then understand these models because they were made using terms they were already familiar with.  Ayasdi’s solutions are primarily based on anomaly detection technology, which is helpful for recognizing deviations from a pre-established norm. They claim their software analyzes the sources and destinations of customer payments to make sure the funds are coming from legitimate sources. Anomaly detection software seems to have worked well for HSBC and other banks looking to improve their defense against money laundering. This is because well-trained algorithms may recognize deviations much faster than human analysts at computers.  HSBC’s Interest in AI for Trade Flow and Document Search In 2019, HSBC announced a partnership with Element.AI, a firm that primarily offers AI solutions for trade flow and document search. They also offer AI business management solutions such as an access governor that determines which employees can access which sets of data.  HSBC claims their goal for this partnership is to improve global regulatory compliance in areas such as anti-money laundering rules. Additionally, the solution would help them predict which services and product solutions their clients may need in the future.  HSBC may be able to achieve its goal of global compliance using AI resources from Element. An NLP solution would allow them to automatically tag new information with metadata for greater searchability and transparency.  This allows a client company to more accurately retrieve data requested by a customer or auditor. One example of this is a situation where a customer requests all of their personal data be deleted from the company’s database. Element AI’s solutions most likely run on some combination of natural language processing (NLP) and predictive analytics technology. NLP could be used to create document search applications and automatically tag documents with metadata. HSBC likely intends to use Element’s predictive analytics engine to study customer data for information that could indicate potential problems. For example, Element’s software may be able to detect metadata tags pertaining to the type of customer support issue for each email. It could then determine that the majority of their customer support tickets come from their mobile app not recognizing a verification code.  Most of these customers could report a problem where the app would not allow them to log in until they have requested a second code and used it for verification. HSBC may be able to recognize this problem as it arises and begin working on a fix earlier than if detected and reported manually by customer service agents.

See our ethics statement.Pope Francis waves to worshippers taking photos as he arrives for the weekly general audience on November 6, 2019, at St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican. Andreas Solaro/AFP via Getty ImagesRebecca Heilweil covered emerging technology, artificial intelligence, and the supply chain.On Friday, Pope Francis backed a document that outlines how artificial intelligence, including facial recognition technology, should be regulated. This so-called “Rome Call for AI Ethics” carries the endorsement of the Vatican as well as Microsoft and IBM. Believe it or not, the future of AI is actually one of the pope’s passion projects — and greatest worries.The Vatican’s interest in the technology is hardly new, and several of its pontifical academies — essentially research societies under the Pope’s authority — are hard at work studying what AI, robotics, and other emerging technologies will mean for the Catholic faith and humanity at large. Still, the document is a sign that organized religion is increasingly interested in weighing in on the ethics of artificial intelligence and, in the case of the Vatican, working alongside large tech companies in the process.Six general principles for the use of artificial intelligence are at the center of the Rome Call, which declares that ethics must be integral to an algorithm’s initial design. But notably, none of the outlined principles are particularly new ideas. The pope’s pledge embraces the values that many AI ethics experts have already called for by pointing to values of transparency, nondiscrimination, and the right to privacy. That somewhat echoes some of the nonbinding AI guidelines the European Union released last year, as well as the Trump administration’s guidance for the federal regulation of artificial intelligence (released in January).From the “Rome Call for AI Ethics”Transparency: in principle, AI systems must be explainable;Inclusion: the needs of all human beings must be taken into consideration so that everyone can benefit and all individuals can be offered the best possible conditions to express themselves and develop;Responsibility: those who design and deploy the use of AI must proceed with responsibility and transparency;Impartiality: do not create or act according to bias, thus safeguarding fairness and human dignity;Reliability: AI systems must be able to work reliably; [and]Security and privacy: AI systems must work securely and respect the privacy of users.“AI systems must be conceived, designed and implemented to serve and protect human beings and the environment in which they live,” the document reads. “This fundamental outlook must translate into a commitment to create living conditions (both social and personal) that allow both groups and individual members to strive to fully express themselves where possible.”Alongside these principles is a mandate from the Vatican and its affiliates for AI to be “explainable” to humans. In other words, as artificial intelligence is increasingly applied in consequential contexts — like algorithms that screen our resumes and determine whether we’re granted parole — we need to understand how artificially intelligent technology makes decisions. AI ethics advocates argue that such “explainability” is one of the key ways we can hold artificial-intelligence-based systems accountable.The Rome Call also emphasizes that artificial intelligence should not be discriminatory, echoing board concerns about algorithmic bias. Depending on who builds them, how they’re built, and the data on which they’re trained, computer systems can end up mimicking and even amplifying societal racism, sexism, and other forms of bias. This is bad, says the pope.Also (maybe) bad: facial recognition, one of the most controversial applications of artificial intelligence. This is a particularly buzzworthy topic, as the fallout of the Clearview AI scandal demonstrates how facial recognition technology raises significant concerns about security and human rights. However, the Vatican’s new statement on the matter does not raise the idea of a complete ban or moratorium on facial recognition, which some critics of the technology say is necessary. Instead, the Vatican simply seems to call for better rules to govern the tech.“New forms of regulation must be encouraged to promote transparency and compliance with ethical principles,” the document reads, “especially for advanced technologies that have a higher risk of impacting human rights, such as facial recognition.”The Catholic Church is actually no stranger to artificial intelligence. In recent years, much of its focus on the technology has been in consultation with expert researchers in the field and representatives of major technology companies. The Dominican Order has even supported a priest-led research organization called Optic since 2012, which, among other things, researches AI and its potential to marginalize people. The organization also says it provides private consultations to leaders in the tech industry.Meanwhile, the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy for Life has hosted workshops on artificial intelligence. The effort extends further, as last year, two more pontifical academies — the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences — hosted a conference on the ethical questions raised by robotics and artificial intelligence. These conferences have been attended by the likes of DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Facebook computer scientist Yann LeCun, and even LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. The Vatican’s much-covered first hackathon in 2018 was also supported by companies such as Google, Salesforce, and Microsoft.The list of Silicon Valley stars hanging out in Rome goes on. The Pope himself has personally met with Microsoft president Brad Smith, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Google’s Eric Schmidt. Earlier this month, the Pope met Smith to discuss how artificial intelligence could serve the “common good,” according to Reuters.So it might not be surprising that the Vatican’s vision for artificial intelligence appears to mirror much of what tech giants are already saying: Regulate our new technology, but don’t ban it outright.Keep in mind that, as Wired reported last year, tech companies have been actively trying to influence the rules that will govern this new technology. Some, such as Microsoft, are even creating AI principles of their own. There’s also the Partnership for AI, a corporate-funded nonprofit meant to study best practices for artificial intelligence that is supported by Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and IBM, among other companies.The Rome Call is just another sign that the Vatican is paying close attention to emerging technology. And, for whatever it’s worth, tech companies seem eager to come along. While new faith-filled robots and AI-inspired gods stand to shape conversations about religion in the 21st century, there are also complicated conversations between age-old religious institutions and powerful tech platforms that it would be a mistake to ignore.Open Sourced is made possible by the Omidyar Network.

By Jerimiah OettingUPDATED: February 29, 2020 at 7:00 a.m.How many scientists does it take to design a better battery? According to a new study, artificial intelligence might do it better and faster than human scientists ever could.Researchers at Stanford University employed artificial intelligence to work out a method for rapidly charging a battery while minimizing the impacts on the battery’s lifespan. The technique, a form of AI called machine learning optimization, revealed an ideal charging method in a fraction of the time it would have taken using traditional experiments. It’s a method that the scientists say can shorten the time it takes to design better batteries in the future.“The goal was to get better batteries faster. Our paper provides one solution, which is to use artificial intelligence to speed up the process,” said William Chueh, a materials scientist at Stanford who co-led the team.Improving batteries is a major step in California’s goal of reaching carbon-free electricity by 2045. Batteries are necessary for storing electricity generated by wind and solar. And battery-powered electric cars are becoming more common around the Bay Area and beyond, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.“The reason this is exciting is because battery research and development is a really long process … batteries last a really long time,” Chueh said. “You don’t get the instant reward of knowing if something worked or not.”The team, which included scientists from the Toyota Research Institute, wanted to apply a machine learning approach to a specific problem: charging an electric car battery to 80% of its capacity in only 10 minutes, while minimizing stress on the battery that would shorten its life.

About ConnatixV510246 What’s next in AI: Can we become virtually immortal?Do we want to?“People don’t want to take a road trip and then have to wait 40 minutes to recharge,” said Peter Attia, the lead author of the study, which was completed when he was a graduate student at Stanford. Attia said the fear of running out of a charge is a common deterrent to electric car ownership.Normally, testing a new battery design requires observing how the battery behaves over repeated charging cycles — a process that can take years before the battery fails. Instead of this lengthy approach, the researchers fed “training data” from past experiments into a computer, teaching it to accurately predict how long the batteries would last after only 100 charging cycles. That shortened the process of testing a battery with each charging method from 40 days to four.

Then, the computers detected patterns in the results of each experiment, and whittled down the options for the next round of tests, speeding up the process even more.“Humans don’t usually work that way. We have intuitions,” Chueh said. “We think a certain thing works better based on our understanding of the process.”He said the AI tested 224 different charging methods, and produced a solution in just 16 days. That process would have normally required over a year and a half to accomplish.“It’s a pretty big multiplier in terms of time-saving,” Chueh said. “Not to mention, the answer you arrive at may be better than the one that you would get in the ordinary approach.”While this particular example used artificial intelligence to identify the best way to charge a battery, the researchers said AI could improve all aspects of battery design, from the way they’re manufactured to their internal chemistry.“I’m pretty excited about the future of AI development,” Attia said. “AI gets a lot of flack for being used for (advertising). But I think there’s a lot of excitement now for getting AI to accelerate science.”Attia notes that machine learning is also being used in the field of genetics, to create better cancer treatments, and to speed up pharmaceutical development.But using complicated machine learning programs is a bit of a black box, according to Matthieu Dubarry, a battery specialist at the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute.“You could get a result without understanding how you got there,” he said. “As a scientist, that bothers me a little.”Dubarry cautions that speeding up the design process using machine learning depends on the strength of the training data involved, which has to reflect the particular qualities of a type of battery and how it’s being used.“I don’t think you can really extrapolate their result to another application, even for that same battery,” he said. “Battery degradation is extremely dependent on the way (the battery) is used.”To fully understand how a different charging method might change between different batteries, and different applications, Dubarry said you need “more diverse training data.” And that training data is produced the old-fashioned way: with lots of time-intensive testing.But Dubarry also agrees that there are some big advantages to using AI.Related Articles

“The work they did is a really great starting point, they did a wonderful job,” he said. “No doubt their approach will lead to some major discoveries.”Chueh said he’s driven to increase the development of technologies, like batteries, that can help mitigate climate change. Using AI is a way to achieve that goal.“Many people are working on better batteries, so we have less expensive electric vehicles, and solar and wind electricity that’s available 24/7” he said. “I’m constantly asking myself … can we do it faster? Because time is limited.”

Predictions about the impact of artificial intelligence on employment oscillate between unlimited optimism and the fear of human redundancy. Which is true? A look at the past, peppered with some economics, provides more clarity. After all, this is not the first time technology is shaking up established working practices.
The website for the history of Switzerland’s PTT, the former post, telegraph and telephone monopoly, is most informative. It includes testimonials from former employees about special moments in their careers. The memories of the switchboard operators – a typically female profession at the time – are particularly insightful, revealing much about the arrival of new technology.
Although the technology had long progressed, female switchboard operators were employed for more than half a century in Switzerland. (ETH picture archive Commons)
Although Switzerland was at the forefront of the switch to direct dialing, the last manual telephone exchange (in Scuol in the canton of Grisons) only closed in 1959. Quite late, considering direct dialing had been available for more than 60 years. As early as 1892, the world’s first automatic telephone exchange started service in the US. By 1900, some phone companies had completely dispensed with manual exchanges.
The long career of the Swiss switchboard operator was not due primarily to technical tardiness. Practical reasons prompted the PTT, like many international counterparts, to delay the introduction of direct dialing. Among the reasons was quality of service. As PTT pensioners recount, it used to be commonplace to call the operator to connect with someone whose number you did not have. The operator also checked the quality of the line and, if the person called did not answer, would sometimes even take a message to pass on later (services performed today by Siri and other digital assistants).
So, if artificial intelligence should one day become truly intelligent, it is by no means certain the professions theoretically most at risk will actually disappear. Ultimately, rising female wages and rapidly growing demand for telephone services after World War II provided the decisive impulse for full automation. From then on, people had to learn how to dial a number themselves.

It is making mundane and dull office work more interesting and productive. AI also enables workers to focus on the most engaging jobs while making them more effective and efficient..Soon, even those who don't happen to work for technology companies (although as every company moves towards becoming a tech company, that will be increasingly few) will find AI-enabled machines increasingly present as they go about their day-to-day activities..From how people are recruited and on-boarded to how they go about on-the-job training, personal development and eventually passing on their skills and experience to those who follow in their footsteps, AI technology will play an increasingly prominent role..The technology in the workplace has eventually been better for higher-skilled workers than for the lower-skilled, said Mark Muro, an expert from Brookings Instiution. &quot;Artificial intelligence could play out just the opposite.&quot;.As noted by Livemint, while machines have long been able to perform repetitive physical tasks or complex mathematical calculations, AI enables computers to analyze data, predict outcomes, learn from experience by recognizing patterns and make decisions. Such tasks are currently done by professional workers, many with college degrees..Examples:.A financial adviser analyzes a client's economic circumstances, income prospects and personal goals to guide retirement planning. With AI, an algorithm could use the same information to make recommendations..The market research analyst analyzes consumer spending trends and patterns to recommend an advertising strategy for a new movie or automobile. With AI, a computer could do the same thing..Medical facilities have started using computers to read X-rays and determine whether images are consistent with a disease such as pneumonia, a task previously performed by radiologists..AI will replace the jobs?.&quot;AI will substitute for a set of tasks, but there's no reason it would have to be a total displacement,&quot; said Stanford University economist Michael Webb. &quot;The only thing you can say for sure is that the job will change.&quot;.Artificial intelligence may allow some workers to dispense with time-consuming tasks such as data analysis, and focus on potentially more profitable activities, such as meeting clients. Those workers could become more productive and command higher wages..Other workers could find their jobs simplified and more easily filled by someone with less education, which could drive down wages in the process. And in other cases, jobs could be replaced entirely by technology..To be sure, experts in the past have incorrectly predicted that other major shifts in the economy—including the mechanization of agriculture, automation of factories and outsourcing of labor to foreign countries—would cause mass unemployment. While these trends did eliminate many US jobs, many others were created over time. And the unemployment rate was near a 50-year low in January, at 3.6 percent..&quot;Expanded use of artificial intelligence is necessary given the labor shortage that is happening,&quot; said Irina Novoselsky, chief executive of job-search site CareerBuilder.com..The company is tapping AI to help fill some job openings. It uses technology to scan resumes and job descriptions, matching workers who might have the right skills for a job but not the specific experience. Such matching wasn't possible a few years ago, Ms. Novoselsky said..The company uses AI to read resumes and make sense of jargon the same way a human can, but without the pesky constraints of sleeping or eating..Top executives are likely less exposed to potential displacement by AI than lower-level professionals. A Brookings study found that exposure to artificial intelligence falls for the top 10% of earners..&quot;CEOs are largely exempt from this,&quot; Mr. Muro said. &quot;They're not the ones doing the number crunching and making the PowerPoints.&quot;.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Where are our self-driving cars?In the age of AI advances, self-driving cars turned out to be harder than people expected.by  Kelsey PiperFeb 28, 2020, 5:33 PM ESTFacebookLinkA Yandex driverless car undergoes testing in Moscow on July 15, 2019. |  Sergei Bobylev/TASS via Getty ImagesKelsey Piper is a senior writer at Future Perfect, Vox’s effective altruism-inspired section on the world’s biggest challenges. She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.FacebookLinkWhen it comes to self-driving cars, the future was supposed to be now.In2020, you’ll be a “permanent backseat driver,” the Guardian predictedin 2015. “10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020,” blared a Business Insider headline from 2016. Those declarations were accompanied by announcements from General Motors, Google’s Waymo, Toyota, and Honda that they’d be making self-driving cars by 2020. Elon Musk forecast that Tesla would do it by 2018 — and then, when that failed, by 2020.But the year is here — and the self-driving cars aren’t.Despite extraordinary efforts from many of the leading names in tech and in automaking, fully autonomous cars are still out of reach except in special trial programs. You can buy a car that will automatically brake for you when it anticipates a collision, or one that helps keep you in your lane, or even a Tesla Model S (which — disclosure — my partner and I own)whose Autopilot mostly handles highway driving.But almost every one of the above predictions has been rolled back as the engineering teams at those companies struggle to make self-driving cars work properly.What happened? Here arenine questions you might have had about this long-promised technology, and why the future we were promised still hasn’t arrived.1) How exactly do self-driving cars work? Engineers have been attempting prototypes of self-driving cars for decades. The idea behind it is really simple: Outfit a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it and have the carreact if it’s about to steerinto one. Teach in-car computers the rules of the road and set them loose to navigate to their own destination.This simple description elidesa whole lot of complexity. Driving is one of the more complicated activities humans routinely do. Following a list of rules of the road isn’t enough to drive as well as a human does, because we do things like make eye contact with othersto confirm who has the right of way, react to weather conditions, and otherwise make judgment calls that are difficult to encode in hard-and-fast rules.John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, presents a self-driving car at Wed Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, on November 7, 2017. Horacio Villalobos/Corbis/Getty ImagesAnd even the simple parts of driving — like tracking the objects around a car on the road — are actually much trickier than they sound. Take Google’s sister company Waymo, the industry leader in self-driving cars. Waymo’s cars, which are fairly typical of other self-driving cars, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging), a way of estimating distances to objects by bouncing light andsoundoff things.The car’s computers combine all of this to build a picture of where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they’re moving. For this part, lots of training data is needed — that is,the car has to drawon millions of miles of driving data that Waymo has collected to form expectations about how other objects might move. It’s hard to get enough training data on the road, so the cars also train based on simulation data — but engineers have to be sure that their AI systems will generalize correctly from the simulation data to the real world.That’s far from a complete description of the systems at work when a self-driving car is on the road. But it illustrates an important principle to keep in mind when wondering where our self-driving cars are: Even the “easy” things turn out to hide surprising complexity.2) Why is it takinglonger than expected to get self-driving cars on the road?Self-driving cars rely on artificial intelligence to work. And the 2010s were a great decade for AI. We saw big advances intranslation, speech generation, computer vision and object recognition, and game-playing. AI used to have a hard time identifying dogs in pictures; now that’s a trivial task.It’s this progress in AI that drove the optimistic predictions for self-driving cars in the mid-2010s. Researchers anticipated that we could build on the amazing gains they’d seen (and are still seeing) in other arenas.But when it came to self-driving cars, the limitations of those gains becamevery apparent. Even with extraordinary amounts of time, money, and effort invested, no team could figure out how to have AI solve a real-world problem: navigating our roads with the high degree of reliability needed.Much of the problem is the need for lots of training data. The ideal way to train a self-driving car would be to show it billions of hours of footage of real driving, and use that to teach the computer good driving behavior. Modern machine learning systems do really well when they have abundant data, and very poorly when they have only a little bit of it. But collecting data for self-driving cars is expensive. And since some events are rare — witnessing a car accident ahead, say, or encountering debris on the road — it’s possible for the car to be out of its depth because it has encountered a situation so infrequently in its training data.Carmakers have tried to get around this in lots of ways. They’ve driven more miles. They’ve trained the cars in simulations. They sometimes engineer specific situations so that they can get more training data about those situations for the cars.And they are getting closer. Waymo cars do roam the streets of Arizona with no one behind the wheel (a small pool of specially screened people can call them up like they would an Uber).If all goes well, they may expand to more cities later this year (more on this below).But it’s a hard problem, and progress has been slow.3) What does a world with self-driving cars look like?Companies continue to invest despite the setbacks because self-driving cars, when they happen, will change a lot for the world — and make their creators lots of money.Many consumers will want to upgrade. Imagine being able to read or doze off during your morning drive to work or on long car trips.It also seems likely that taxi and ride-hailing companies will offer self-driving cars, rather than paying drivers (in fact, companies like Uber are betting on it). Self-driving cars should also make a huge difference for Americans with disabilities, many of whom can’t get a driver’s license and have trouble getting to work, the store, and doctor’s appointments.A self-driving car from General Motors’ Cruise division waits at an intersection in San Francisco on January 26, 2020. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesExperts disagree on whether self-driving cars will change anything fundamental about car ownership in America. Some argue that people won’t need to own a car if they can order one on their phone and get a timely robot ride anywhere.Others have pointed out that people generally still own a car even in areas with good ride-share coverage and that self-driving cars might not be any different. Polls suggest that most Americans don’t want to be driven to work by a self-driving car — but that might change fast once such cars actually exist. Gallup polling on this question found a small share (9 percent) of Americans who’d get such a car right away, with a larger contingent (38 percent) saying they’d wait a while, and half holding steadfast that they’d never use one.Over time, our infrastructure will likely change to make iteasier for self-driving cars to navigate, and in fact, some researchers have argued that we won’t have widespread self-driving cars until we’ve made major changes to our streets to make it easier to communicate information to those cars. That would be expensive and require nationwide coordination, so it seems likely that it wouldfollow the widespread introduction of self-driving cars rather than precede it.4) What are the leading self-driving car programs, and what are they doing?Almost every major car manufacturer has at least tested the waters with self-driving car research. But some are much more serious about it than others.There are two core statistics useful for evaluating how advanced a self-driving car program is. One is how many miles it has driven. That’s a proxy for how much training data the company has, and how much investment it has poured into getting its cars on the road.The other is disengagements — moments when a human driver has to take over because the computer couldn’t handle a situation — per mile driven. Most companies don’t share these statistics, but the state of California requires that they be reported, and so California’s statistics are the best peek into how various companies are doing.On both fronts, Google’s sister company Waymo is the clear leader. Waymo just announced 20 million miles driven overall, most of those not in California. In 2018, Waymo drove 1.2 million miles in California, with 0.09 disengagements every 1,000 miles. Coming in second is General Motors’ Cruise, with about half a million miles and 0.19 disengagements per 1,000 miles. (Cruise argues that since it tests its cars on San Francisco’s difficult streets, these numbers are even more impressive than they look.)Those two companies are well ahead of everyone else in both miles driven and disengagements in the state of California. While that’s only a limited snapshot of their efforts, most experts consider them the leading programs in general.5) Didn’t a self-driving car kill a woman? How did that happen? And what are the safety issues involved with self-driving cars?March 18, 2018, was the first time a self-driving car ran down a pedestrian. An Uber car with a safety driver behind the wheel hit and killed Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman walking her bicycle across the street in Tempe,Arizona.The incident was a reminder that self-driving car technology still had a long way to go. Some people were quick to point out that humans frequently kill other humans while driving, and that even if self-driving cars are much safer than humans, there will be some fatal incidents with self-driving cars. That’s true as far as it goes. But it misses a key point. Human driving produces one fatal accident in every 100 million miles driven. Waymo, the leader in miles driven, just reached 20 million miles driven. It hasn’t had a fatal accident yet, but given the number of miles its cars have driven, it’s simply far too soonto prove that they’re as safe as or safer than a human driver.An Uber self-driving car drives through traffic on Fifth Street in San Francisco on March 28, 2017. Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesUber hasn’t driven nearly as many miles andhas had a fatal incident. The company doesn’t release specific figures, but its filings for its IPO last year said that it had driven “millions” of miles. It’s hard to tell without specific numbers, but it’s fair to wonder ifUber’s driving record is much worse than a human’s.Furthermore, a review of Herzberg’s death suggests that a lot of preventable mistakes were made. The accident report by the National Transportation Safety Board, released in December 2019, found that the near-range cameras and the ultrasonic sensors “were not in use at the time of the crash.”Additionally, the system was having such a problem with false alarms — detecting dangerous situations when none existed — that it had been programmed with “a one-second period during which the ADS [automated driving system]suppresses planned braking while the (1) system verifies the nature of the detected hazard and calculates an alternative path, or (2) vehicle operator takes control of the vehicle,” according to the NTSB report. So even when the car detected the hazard, it didn’t brake — which could have made the collision avoidable or much less deadly — but instead continued with exactly what it was doing for a full second.The system was designed to assume that pedestrians would never cross except at a crosswalk, so when one did cross without using one, it failed to identify her. Even worse, when the system was unclear on whether an object was a bicycle (as it was with Herzberg), it was unable to retain any information about how the object was moving. The system sensed her presence six full seconds before the impact — and yet did nothing (except possibly braking in the last two-tenths of a second) before colliding with her at deadly speed.Those are avoidable failures.Uber pulled its cars off the road in response, returning to self-driving car trials a year later with a drastically changed program. “We’ve implemented key safety improvements from both safety reviews, shared our learnings with the larger self-driving industry, and accepted the NTSB’s recommendation to implement a Safety Management System, which is underway today,” Nat Beuse, Uber’s self-driving cars head of safety, told Voxin a statement in response to a request for comment. “As we look ahead to the future, we’ll continue to keep safety at the center of every decision we make.”Nonetheless, deadly accidents with self-driving cars will keep happening — and it’s not just Uber. A report from the National Transportation Safety Board implicated Tesla’s Autopilot system in another lethal 2018 accident; while the driver had his hands off the wheel, the car steered into a concrete divider and crashed, killing him. A full investigation hasn’t yet been conducted on three more recent deadly Tesla crashes. The problem, according to NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt, is that drivers assume Autopilot lets them take their attention off the road, when they shouldn’t. That won’t be a problem with fully autonomous vehicles, but it’s a potentially major one now.As I’ve written before, getting good self-driving cars on the road can save hundreds of thousands of lives. But it takes a lot of engineering work to get the cars good enough to be lifesaving.6) Are self-driving cars going to be good for the environment? Some advocates have argued that self-driving cars will be good for the environment. They claim they mightreduce car trips by making car ownership unnecessary and transitioning society to a model where most people don’t own a car and just call for onewhen they need one.In addition, others have argued that human drivers drive in a wasteful way — braking hard, accelerating hard, idling the engine, all of which use up fuel — which a computer could avoid.But as self-driving cars have inched closer to reality, most of these claimed benefits have started to look less likely.There’s not much evidence that computers are dramatically more fuel-efficient drivers than humans. There’s one small study suggesting adaptive cruise control improves efficiency a little (5 to 7 percent),but there’s little else beyond that. Furthermore, researchers have examined the effects of more fuel-efficient cars on miles traveled and found that, under many circumstances, people drive more when cars get more fuel-efficient — so self-driving cars having higher fuel efficiency might not mean that they produce lower emissions.One study attempting to estimate the effects of self-driving cars on car use behavior simulated a family having a self-driving car by paying for them to have a chauffeur for a week, and telling them to treat the chauffeur service the way they’d treat having a car that could drive itself.The result? They went on a lot more car trips.It’s still possible that some big transition to a lower-driving world will happen. A study of one week of driving habits isn’t enough to settle the question for sure. The researchers who conducted that study are preparing future studies, and it’s possible those comparisons will turn up more encouraging results.7) So if they’re not necessarily safer and they’re not necessarily greener, why are we even doing this?The above few sections might inspire some pessimism, but there’s plenty of reason to be excited about self-driving cars. They will likely make life easierfor older people and those with disabilities who cannot safely drive. Theymight provide better, safer, and cheaper options for people currently forced to own a car to get anywhere. Additional research and development will make them safer — and once the kinks are worked out, there is a likelihood that self-driving cars will be safer than human-driven ones.In a sense, we’re in an awkward transition moment where we want self-driving cars they aren’t yet an uncomplicated positive.Research and development is proceeding anyway, mostly because self-driving cars will probably be a gold minefor the first company to get them on the road. They’ll likely be able to establish themselves in ride-hailing, taxi, and trucking markets while competitors are still struggling to catch up, and then they’ll benefit from the additional miles traveled to further improve their cars.It’s not uncommon for a technology to be dangerous and barely worth it when it is first invented, only to eventually be refined into a valuable part of modern life. The first airplanes were dangerous and commercially useless, but we improved things dramatically from there.8) What role does policy play in the development of self-driving cars? There is no federal law regarding self-driving cars. Much of the action on policy has largely taken place at the state level. And the laws surrounding self-driving cars vary enormously by state, with 29 states having passed legislation.Self-driving car development mostly happens in the states that have been friendliest to it — especially California and Arizona — and it’s easy to envision some states banning self-driving cars long after they become commonplace in other states, especially if the safety case for them isn’t a slam-dunk.When self-driving cars were first proposed, I heard a lot of worries that regulators would unnecessarily delay their implementation. By 2016, it was obvious that hadn’t come to pass. Indeed, in some cases regulators may have been too permissive — for example, in light of Uber pulling its cars and instituting new safety procedures, it seems the vehicle that killed Elaine Herzberg probably shouldn’t have been on the road at all.Policy might also shape whether self-driving cars are good or badfor the environment. With high taxes on gasoline, for example, the social costs of carbon emissions could be reflected in the price of usingself-driving cars — and the money can bespent on climate adaptation and clean energy. But right now, our transportation policy doesn’t do much of anything about the social costs of driving, and that’s a problem that will only get worse if self-driving cars put more people on the road.9) So just when are we getting self-driving cars?In some senses, we’ve been “close” on self-driving cars for years now. Waymo is doing test runs with no one behind the wheel in Arizona, whichit’s been doing since 2017. Cruise delayed the 2019 launch of its autonomous taxi service but thinks it might happen in 2020. Earlier this year, the company unveiled a car with no steering wheel ... and no timetable for when it’ll be available for sale. Tesla’s periodic software updates make its Autopilot highway self-driving work better, but it remains well short of full self-driving.There are certainly skeptics. Recently, the CEO of Volkswagen said that fully self-driving cars might “never happen.”A Tesla Model 3, which is fitted with a a partial self-driving system, on display at the Brussels Expo in Brussels, Belgium, on January 9, 2020. Sjoerd van der Wal/Getty ImagesThat might be an overly harsh forecast, considering the progress that’s been made. But it is exasperatingly difficult to get a good estimate of how long until self-driving cars happen for real for the typical American, both because no one knows for sure and because companies have incentives to publicize optimistic estimates. The companies boast abouttheir progress butdon’t publish their mishaps. Timelines slip, and the change in plans is often publicly acknowledged only long after it’s become obvious that the deadline can’t be met.At the same time, companies hesitate to put their cars on the road when there’s any chance they aren’t ready. They are well aware that killing someone, as Uber did, is not only horrible but also probably spells doom for their business.
