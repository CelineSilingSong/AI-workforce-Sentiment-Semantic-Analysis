If your sense of worth comes from work—what’s left to hold on to?Photo-illustration: WIRED Staff; Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveA few months ago, I was waiting for the subway with a friend, a professional editor, who had never used a large language model (LLM). Standing on the platform, she told me about an article she’d been working on. ChatGPT had come out six weeks earlier, and I input her summary into it on my phone and showed her the result. I’d been following OpenAI’s transformer-driven models since 2019 and had forgotten the effect they can have on first exposure. My friend couldn’t take her eyes off the little gray box as the article came out, line by line. It took me a minute to register the shock on her face. On the train, she said, only half-joking, “I’m going to be unemployed by the end of the year.”SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.As wave after wave of new AI capabilities have hit over the past few months, I’ve been thinking of my friend and her place in the world that’s unfolding. When GPT-4 came out in March, OpenAI’s press release included a chart of its scores on various standardized tests. The much-hyped new model scored above 80 percent on 11 AP and SAT exams, 77 percent on “Advanced Sommelier (theory knowledge),” and—most buzzed-about on Twitter—90 percent on the Uniform Bar Exam, the national test to become a lawyer. OpenAI’s previous model, GPT-3.5 (which powered ChatGPT when it debuted), had already passed the US Medical Licensing Examination, earning a grade that, were it human, would qualify it to become a doctor.Results like these seem to validate a 2019 paper by then Stanford PhD candidate Michael Webb. Though entirely speculative at the time, it upended received wisdom about who would win and who would lose as a result of AI-driven automation. Before Webb’s report, studies by Oxford and McKinsey had predicted that lower-wage, lower-skill jobs would be hardest hit, as indeed they have been throughout the entire history of automation going back to the steam-powered weaving loom.Featured VideoAstrophysicist Answers Space Questions From TwitterThe LLM era has changed all that. Now, the conventional wisdom—replicated and extended in a recent paper by researchers at OpenAI—is that higher-paid jobs and creative jobs (including mathematicians, tax preparers, quants, writers, and web designers, to name a few) are the mostly highly exposed to automation (100 percent exposure for the professions just listed). This has an interesting side effect, since, as Webb’s study spelled out, white-collar work in the US is disproportionately done by the most privileged: men, white people and Asian Americans, people in their prime working years (25-54), and people living in rich coastal cities. Many in these demographics have had it easy for a long time, but it’s looking like the AI revolution will be a bumpy ride for them. I spoke with four economists for this piece, and, though they offered good reasons to think AI won’t “take all the jobs”—indeed, as in previous waves of automation, the economy is likely to grow—none denied that some jobs will be lost. They didn’t know exactly how many, and neither do I. But what I do know is that we've never had a wave of automation in which white-collar workers are uniquely vulnerable, and we should therefore expect this one to play out differently.The crux of the difference lies in the relationship that blue-collar and white-collar workers have with work. According to one study, white-collar workers tend to feel that they “express” their “full potential” more at work than blue-collar workers do; they also experience higher levels of “developing inner self” at work.  According to another study, white-collar workers valued “interesting work (nature of the work), achievement, and appreciation of the work done (recognition)”—in contrast to blue-collar workers, whose motivators were “receiving salary, working condition, peer relations, and job security.” (And even more than other groups, men derive their self-worth from achievement and feeling useful. A dramatic illustration of this was a study of language used by suicidal men, which showed that being considered useful was core to men’s well-being, and its absence was devastating. Being rendered useless by a bot will have disproportionately bad emotional effects for a man.)Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt Kamen“Nature of the work” is one way of saying that white-collar workers care about the tasks we do. Being “recognized” and “appreciated” for “achievement” in these tasks is important to us; it is how we “express” our “full potential.” In other words, large pieces of our emotional lives and social selves are hooked into the tasks we do for work. What happens when AI does those tasks better?AdvertisementAt the furthest edge of white-collar work is a species of task where competency is so admired that it becomes a sport or an art, and competency is rewarded by society with status and esteem, over and above financial compensation. This is the category of games of logic and art. Our shock at the new wave of AI models like ChatGPT and Midjourney comes from their proficiency at the artier, more creative tasks like writing and illustration. But the more strictly logical sports of chess and Go have long since been conquered by previous waves of AI, and so it may be instructive for the left-brainers to look in on how the right-brainers have handled usurption, emotionally and practically. Go is generally considered humanity’s most complex game. In 2016, DeepMind’s AlphaGo beat two of its highest-ranked players. Lee Sedol, a Korean prodigy and the second-best player in the world at the time, took it the hardest. He became depressed, and a couple years after the match he retired from the game, citing AlphaGo. “Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated,” he said.Fan Hui, the European champion but a rung below the world leaders, took it better. He was initially shocked and humbled by his defeat, and indeed tried to forget the game altogether. “I want to try to forget Go, but it’s impossible, because all the things I’ve learned in my life is with Go,” he said in AlphaGo, the 2017 documentary released by DeepMind about Lee and Fan. The game, he said, is like looking in a mirror. “I see Go; I also see myself. For me Go is real life.” Later, however, he joined DeepMind—the architect of his defeat—and helped improve its model’s capabilities. Basically, he couldn’t beat ’em, so he joined ’em.These differences seem illuminating, and it’s hard not to look for lessons. I can’t help but think that Lee’s higher ranking actually made him more vulnerable to an existential crisis, because he had more to lose. Fan was disappointed, but Lee lost very publicly in front of millions of Korean viewers. It’s hard to bounce back from that, and perhaps harder than it was for Fan to pivot.I caught up with my editor friend again recently—three months after her first exposure to ChatGPT. She seemed more concerned than ever. “I just think it’s going to be a hard fall,” she said. She felt the younger, more technically adept nipping at her heels and was worried she hadn’t been brought up to be resilient enough for this kind of challenge. I tried to offer hope in the form of a story that Gregory Clark, a professor emeritus at UC Davis, told me about aristocratic land owners during the Industrial Revolution. Tenant farmers abandoning the country to follow better wages into factories in the city caused the value of the aristocrats’ farmland to drop, causing massive losses for the aristocracy. The smart aristocrats, though, said Clark—the ones who could adapt—simply followed the farmers into the cities and became urban landlords.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenMy friend was only partly sold. What was the equivalent now, for her?That’s when I remembered a third Go champion who played AlphaGo but wasn’t included in the documentary. This is Ke Jie. In 2017, months after the Lee match, he was 19 years old and the best player in the world, having beaten Lee in three consecutive championships. Like Fan and Lee, Ke also lost to AlphaGo, after which AlphaGo had no human left to beat.But Ke’s reaction is, I think, the most interesting and also the most hopeful. Pre-AlphaGo, Ke, a teenager of world-class abilities, was also a world-class brat, famous for bucking Go’s culture of humility. When Ke challenged Lee to a match, for example, he posted a video of himself as a boxer beating up Lee and ostentatiously bragged and baited his opponents. In the aftermath of Ke’s defeat by DeepMind’s AI, however, he underwent a remarkable change. On TV appearances since then, he has affected a stance of irony, playfulness, and humility, becoming a much loved crowd-pleaser along the way. Again, looking for lessons, I can’t help but notice Ke’s extreme youth—15 years younger than Lee, 16 years younger than Fan—and wonder if he had less invested in a particular way of valuing and understanding himself. Perhaps he was therefore better able to change how he related to the world on a fundamental level. Important to this story, too, is that, unlike Fan, whose pivot to temporary AI research consultant could be seen as a demotion from European Go champion, Ke’s pivot allowed him to remain at the top of the game.The pivot from “best player in the world at humanity’s most logically complex game” to “comedian” is pretty dramatic, though, and I think the magnitude of that flip reflects the profundity of the changes coming down the pipe. And if Ke Jie has to do that, what does that mean for the rest of us? My hunch is that economic concerns will dominate in the coming years, but assuming that’s solved, where will status reemerge if the core competencies of art, design, science, law, medicine, and engineering are swallowed by GPT-7?Webb himself thought the human niche would become something closer to judgment, “where the point is that it’s a human making the decision.” For a judge or a politician or a newspaper editor, for example, “we know we could get the AI to do it for us—we could ask it to tell us what to do—but we’d rather have a human do it.”Again, the vanguard of Go and chess—“solved” by AI two decades earlier—offer us tea leaves to divine if we choose to read them. In these worlds, Ke Jie is not the only high-status genius to pivot as he did; Magnus Carlsen, the world’s best chess player, has in recent years become known for “interesting” gameplay in response to AI creating an indisputable hierarchy of opening moves. Even more heretical, players at much lower skill levels are beginning to overtake the old masters in popularity: The personable and attractive Botez sisters are the second-most-streamed chess players while having ELO ratings nowhere near the world’s best. And Zhan Ying, a Chinese Go player at a skill level considerably below Ke Jie’s, recently dethroned him, briefly, as the most-watched Go player in the world.If this trend is any indication, we should expect to see softer skills—humor, presence, personality—become the game. In this light, we may already be halfway there without quite realizing it: Perhaps the future belongs to the influencer.",BreadcrumbList,"As wave after wave of new AI capabilities have hit over the past few months, I’ve been thinking of my friend and her place in the world that’s unfolding.

Everyone is excited about generative artificial intelligence, but hype doesn't necessarily translate into solid productivity or revenue gains. Now, a study suggests that even in these early, hyped-up days of generative AI, there are gains being seen.


That’s the conclusion of a recent study out of the National Bureau of Economic Research, which tracked the results of a staggered introduction of an AI-based conversational assistant using data from 5,179 customer support agents. The result is a 14% boost in issues resolved per hour. “AI assistance improves customer sentiment, reduces requests for managerial intervention, and improves employee retention.” the study’s authors, Erik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li Lindsey, and R. Raymond, conclude.

Overall, the greatest impact was on novice and low-skilled workers, with minimal impact on experienced and highly skilled workers, the co-authors find. That’s because the AI model “disseminates the potentially tacit knowledge of more able workers and helps newer workers move down the experience curve. Analyzing the text of agent conversations, we find suggestive evidence that AI recommendations lead low-skill workers to communicate more like high-skill workers.”

PROMOTED
Industry leaders concur that the impact of generative AI on productivity is just starting to be felt. ""Professionals who can adeptly harness the capabilities of large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, will undoubtedly gain a competitive advantage over those who do not embrace these cutting-edge advancements,"" says Egor Nazarov, chief marketing officer at Soter Analytics. “Progressive organizations will leverage AI to unlock their workforce's full potential, whereas regressive companies may choose to eliminate positions in response to automation.”

""Generative AI, like disruptive innovations before it, enables humans to do things faster and often better,"" says Cliff Jurkiewicz, vice president of global strategy for Phenom. “The line between non-technical and technical is irrevocably blurred. There are few roles where technology doesn’t or can’t play its part.”

Nazarov agrees that employees are evolving into ""software developers — as they provide instructions to AI, subsequently generating intellectual property and potential software through meticulously crafted prompts. By training employees to develop superior software through refining prompts, organizations can simplify scaling and systematizing processes by converting prompts into code. Incorporating effective prompts into pre-existing systems can automate tasks, such as summarizing meeting notes or updating CRM databases, ultimately optimizing workflows and allowing employees to concentrate on more strategic, value-added tasks.""

Professionals need to embrace generative AI “as a co-pilot or cobot,” says Jurkiewicz. “The risk of not learning the skills to drive generative AI may very well be similar to resisting a personal computer over a typewriter. At some point, this technology will become essential to one’s work. We’re not there yet, but we will be in the near-term future. Responsibly embracing it early means an advantage when the skills in using the technology become necessary.”
For example, generative AI is re-arranging the deck for marketers. “Large language models, including Google Bard and Microsoft Bing, are beginning to encroach upon organic search traffic, particularly for unbranded searches,” says Nazarov. “The dynamics of search engine optimization are changing as machine learning influences content discovery and ranking. For example, Bing consults its index and subsequently channels results through GPT-4 to generate coherent responses. OpenAI updates its model by crawling the web on an annual basis.”
Generative AI tools within enterprises “should be viewed as a co-pilot or cobot for knowledge workers,” says Jurkiewicz. “Organizations should adopt a balanced approach to implementing AI by combining the strength of the technology with human intuition, expertise, and judgment — keep humans in the loop.”

Author: Pedro Domingos, professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at the University of WashingtonPublish Date: September 22, 2015Why it's good: Domingos, whose research focuses on machine learning and data mining, takes on an ambitious task with The Master Algorithm, which was recommended by Bill Gates at the Code Conference in 2016.Domingos starts by giving readers a look into the five major schools of thought in machine learning. He also takes readers behind the scenes of the learning models that power tech giants like Google and Amazon. Ultimately, he elucidates what the invention of a ""master algorithm"" — a learning algorithm that is capable of discovering any knowledge from data — will mean for both business and society at large. Matt Turck, an investor who focuses on generative AI at the venture firm FirstMark Capital, believes The Master Algorithm is still relevant now, and a great introduction to the field. ""It's a book that was sort of ahead of its time in terms of thinking through the issues,"" he said, adding that it's also ""just one of those rare books that is approachable, compelling to read, and technically correct.""Learn more about The Master Algorithm

Authors: Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis, both professors at New York University. Marcus, is a professor emeritus of psychology and neural science, while Davis is a professor of computer science. Publish Date: September 10, 2019Why it's good: Rebooting AI offers an explanation of the developments around AI and what it will really take to move AI systems from narrow intelligence to genuine general intelligence. The authors argue that much of the development around AI has occurred in closed systems with fixed rules. The real world, however, is open-ended and much more complex, they say.  FirstMark's Turck, who also recommended Rebooting AI, said its interesting because it offers a more skeptical take on deep learning.Turck said that the explosion in deep learning over the past several years laid the foreground for the current revolution in generative AI. Over these years, he said the overarching belief has been that if you build systems with ""more and more and more data"" then you'll get ""better and better and better results."" Turck said that Rebooting AI pushes back against that ""brute force approach,"" offering a slightly different path to AGI.Learn more about Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust

You don’t have to necessarily belong to a tech background to be able to monetise on the rising popularity of this multidisciplinary field. If you don’t have a degree in computer science but the concept of AI fascinates you, then there is a career window for you. As long as you are willing to learn and widen your spectrum of knowledge, this field will make room for you. However, it’s imperative to have a basic understanding of AI and its major branches in order to build a successful non-technical career in it.     by Taboola by Taboola Sponsored Links Sponsored Links Promoted Links Promoted Links You May LikeSmart Lifestyle TrendsCheapest Way To Get A Walk In Tub If You're On MedicareSmart Lifestyle TrendsUndoHere are a few options. Let’s explore each one of them:1) Conversation and manual writers – As a writer, you have the freedom to be “genre-fluid” and take up various roles — creative, research, technical and more. This is probably why you can effortlessly make your way into AI. The increasing integration of chatbots on websites and social media platforms is forcing tech companies to hire writers who can bring these robots to life.AI writers are asked to write conversational scripts and include all the possible outcomes that a user might expect while interacting with a chatbot. Similarly, a tech field may employ writers for generating documents and manuals for AI systems to make them understandable and operable for non-tech users. For the technical aspect involved in this role, you are usually given proper training before assigning a project.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 51:42Loaded: 1.16%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -51:42 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

From planning to managing resources, ensuring smooth communication, collaborating with the technical teams to monitor progress, and deploying the solutions effectively, a project manager has a crucial role to play in the success of every AI project.However, enrolling in a short-term course to comprehend the technicalities associated with AI solutions can be extremely beneficial for your quick transition from a non-tech field to an area that heavily relies on technological advancements.3) Business analysts – Business analysts form another category of professionals who can truly excel in artificial intelligence. The job of a business analyst is to first define the business requirements and then suggest domain-specific AI solutions. And, to be able to execute this responsibility, you must possess skills such as idea generation capacity, creative thinking, flexibility to adopt new technologies, and the ability to embrace the changes.Besides aligning AI solutions with an organisation’s goals, a business analyst sometimes also engages with users and collects feedback in order to identify the area of improvement.4) Ethicists – There is a huge demand for AI ethicists in tech giants across the globe, and this need is only going to multiply in the coming years. The key job of an ethicist is to make sure that the AI systems are ethically, politically and socially compliant. This further allows the machines to operate in an unbiased manner. Otherwise, the companies may suffer severe consequences — including lawsuits and reputation damage.To become an AI ethicist, you must be equipped with skills such as interdisciplinary knowledge, strong communication, understanding of ethical implications of technologies and, most importantly, an unwavering commitment to social responsibility.5) Sales/marketing professionals – Every business product or technology needs to be marketed to potential clients in order to boost production. AI is no different. By working closely with technical teams, sales and marketing professionals first try to understand the features of the AI solutions produced by the company, and then use innovative marketing strategies to sell them.At the same time, sales professionals contribute in building and maintaining long-term relationships with the customers. This further helps them in identifying the constantly evolving market requirements and in conveying the feedback to the product development teams. AI is an enormous field with plenty of job opportunities for both tech-led and non-tech roles.

While it has existed for decades, its presence has become ubiquitous only recently. In addition, the widespread adoption of this high-end technology has also resulted in a host of non-tech job opportunities. Yes, you heard it right. You don’t have to necessarily belong to a tech background to be able to monetise on the rising popularity of this multidisciplinary field. If you don’t have a degree in computer science but the concept of AI fascinates you, then there is a career window for you. As long as you are willing to learn and widen your spectrum of knowledge, this field will make room for you. However, it’s imperative to have a basic understanding of AI and its major branches in order to build a successful non-technical career in it. Here are a few options. Let’s explore each one of them:1) Conversation and manual writers – As a writer, you have the freedom to be “genre-fluid” and take up various roles — creative, research, technical and more. This is probably why you can effortlessly make your way into AI. The increasing integration of chatbots on websites and social media platforms is forcing tech companies to hire writers who can bring these robots to life.AI writers are asked to write conversational scripts and include all the possible outcomes that a user might expect while interacting with a chatbot. Similarly, a tech field may employ writers for generating documents and manuals for AI systems to make them understandable and operable for non-tech users. For the technical aspect involved in this role, you are usually given proper training before assigning a project.2) Project managers – The role of a project manager revolves around coordinating with teams involved in development as well as deployment of various AI solutions. From planning to managing resources, ensuring smooth communication, collaborating with the technical teams to monitor progress, and deploying the solutions effectively, a project manager has a crucial role to play in the success of every AI project.However, enrolling in a short-term course to comprehend the technicalities associated with AI solutions can be extremely beneficial for your quick transition from a non-tech field to an area that heavily relies on technological advancements.3) Business analysts – Business analysts form another category of professionals who can truly excel in artificial intelligence. The job of a business analyst is to first define the business requirements and then suggest domain-specific AI solutions. And, to be able to execute this responsibility, you must possess skills such as idea generation capacity, creative thinking, flexibility to adopt new technologies, and the ability to embrace the changes.Besides aligning AI solutions with an organisation’s goals, a business analyst sometimes also engages with users and collects feedback in order to identify the area of improvement.4) Ethicists – There is a huge demand for AI ethicists in tech giants across the globe, and this need is only going to multiply in the coming years. The key job of an ethicist is to make sure that the AI systems are ethically, politically and socially compliant. This further allows the machines to operate in an unbiased manner. Otherwise, the companies may suffer severe consequences — including lawsuits and reputation damage.To become an AI ethicist, you must be equipped with skills such as interdisciplinary knowledge, strong communication, understanding of ethical implications of technologies and, most importantly, an unwavering commitment to social responsibility.5) Sales/marketing professionals – Every business product or technology needs to be marketed to potential clients in order to boost production. AI is no different. By working closely with technical teams, sales and marketing professionals first try to understand the features of the AI solutions produced by the company, and then use innovative marketing strategies to sell them.At the same time, sales professionals contribute in building and maintaining long-term relationships with the customers. This further helps them in identifying the constantly evolving market requirements and in conveying the feedback to the product development teams. AI is an enormous field with plenty of job opportunities for both tech-led and non-tech roles. Whether you are a writer, sales professional, business analyst or a project manager, there are emerging opportunities in this segment. Having said that, transitioning into any role that is associated with AI might require you to strengthen your technical knowledge with upskilling courses.",,Careers,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Riya Tandon'}",2023-06-28T14:59:00+05:30,2023-04-24T10:44:00+05:30,"Non-techies, AI has job opportunities for you as well: Five non-tech roles in AI","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-99721531,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-16412,overlay-etcareers/photo.jpg', 'width': 1200, 'height': 900}",,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/mid-career/non-techies-ai-has-job-opportunities-for-you-as-well-five-non-tech-roles-in-ai/articleshow/99721531.cms,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Economic Times', 'productID': 'prime.economictimes.indiatimes.com:prime'}",https://schema.org/False,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/mid-career/non-techies-ai-has-job-opportunities-for-you-as-well-five-non-tech-roles-in-ai/articleshow/99721531.cms,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Economic Times', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76939477,width-600,height-60,quality-100/economictimes.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}",,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'https://schema.org/False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}",,,"Non-techies, AI has job opportunities for you as well: Five non-tech roles in AI",,,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76939477,width-600,height-60,quality-100/economictimes.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative AI systems like ChatGPT and DALL-E have been attracting media attention for their potential to cause disruption across a range of industries. In a recent report, Goldman Sachs estimated that generative AI systems could impact 300 million full-jobs globally. In the same report, Goldman Sachs found that the same AI systems could also boost global productivity and lead to a 7% increase in annual global GDP.
Generative AI systems present a number of challenges from a copyright law perspective. Two questions are particularly pressing:


Can copyright subsist in AI-generated content?


Does the use of generative AI models infringe the copyright in pre-existing works?


This post will explore these questions, with a focus on text-to-image generative AI systems, and in particular, an AI model called Stable Diffusion. However, much of what is discussed in this post will be equally applicable to text-to-text generative AI models like ChatGPT. 
What is Generative AI?
Generative artificial intelligence systems are machine learning tools which can be used to create content, including text, images, videos and software code. Generally, these AI systems learn patterns from existing data, then use this knowledge to generate new outputs based on prompts from a user.
While generative AI systems have been in existence for some time, recent breakthroughs in the field have significantly advanced their capabilities, catapulting them into the global spotlight.
Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image generative AI system developed by the start-up Stability AI, in collaboration with a number of academic researchers and non-profit organisations. The model was trained on approximately 5 billion text-to-image pairings derived from a ‘general crawl’ of the internet.
The inner workings of Stable Diffusion are quite complex. The model is trained through a process known as ‘diffusion’. Essentially, it adds a random quantum of visual noise to an image, then teaches itself to successfully ‘de-noise’ the image by predicting the original image and comparing its prediction to the actual image. This process typically requires a very large amount of computing power. However, Stable Diffusion solves this problem by creating highly-compressed, encoded (or latent) versions of these images and running the diffusion process in latent space. Through this process, Stable Diffusion teaches itself to create new images from random noise. The model also includes a text encoder, which enables it to transform text inputs into values that can be understood by the diffusion model and ‘steer’ the diffusion process based on a text prompt. The end result is that Stable Diffusion is able to produce new image outputs responsive to user text prompts.1
For example, below is an image generated by Stable Diffusion using the prompt “a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse.”

Can copyright subsist in AI-generated content
A key question is whether copyright can subsist in content created by generative AI systems like Stable Diffusion. This question has significant ramifications for the ability of businesses and individuals to commercially exploit AI-generated content. Without legal rights of ownership in such content, the ability to licence or sell it is effectively nil.
Under Australian law, copyright will only subsist in works that have been created by a human author. The key authority for this proposition is Telstra Corporation Limited v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd [2010] FCAFC 149, in which the Full Federal Court found that Telstra’s computer-generated telephone directory did not qualify for copyright protection in light of Telstra’s inability to identify human authors responsible for the ‘material form’ of those directories.2 This case was decided in the wake of the High Court’s decision in Ice TV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (2009) 239 CLR 458, where the Court found that for copyright to subsist, a work must originate with an author, from some ‘independent intellectual effort.’3
Does entering a text-based prompt into an AI model like Stable Diffusion satisfy the requirements for human authorship and ‘intellectual effort,’ such that copyright will subsist in the output of the AI model? This question is yet to be tested in Australian Courts (or, as far as the author is aware, Courts in any other jurisdiction).
The answer is likely to depend on the particular case. In circumstances where little time and effort is spent on the input provided to the AI model – for example, just typing the text prompt “cat wearing a tie” – it will be difficult to argue that the generation of the resulting artwork involved some ‘creative spark’ on the part of the human author.





Image created using Stable Diffusion and the prompt “cat wearing a tie”.
On the other hand, it’s possible to conceive of works which might require considerable creative effort on the part of the human operator: for example, works generated by an elaborate string of text prompts, or after an iterative process of trial and error. Such works may be in a stronger position to qualify for copyright protection, based on current Australian authority.
Indeed, user accounts of Stable Diffusion suggest that, at present,4 obtaining high quality output takes a lot of work. Typically, the user must refine the prompt until it is ultra-specific, generate a very large set of images and select the best option, refine this further using an image to image generator (another form of generative AI), and finally, add finishing touches using a program like Photoshop.5 Clearly, this is a labour-intensive process. However, whether the resulting artwork ultimately qualifies for copyright protection is likely to depend on the extent to which the ‘skill and labour’ of the user was directed to the actual material form of the resulting artwork.6
The upshot is that the creators of AI-generated artworks presently have little certainty regarding the legal rights in their creations.
Infringement of Third Party Copyright
Another important question is whether the use of generative AI systems amounts to an infringement of copyright in the pre-existing content used to train the AI-model.
There are at least two ways in which the use of Stable Diffusion could potentially infringe third party copyright:


First, the use of Stable Diffusion to create new images could infringe the copyright in works comprised in the AI model’s training set; and




Secondly, the training process itself could infringe the copyright in works comprised in the training set.


We will consider both in further detail below.
There are two principle questions that a Court will consider when determining infringement of copyright. First, whether the allegedly infringing work was derived (or ‘copied’) from the copyright work; secondly, whether the allegedly infringing work takes a substantial part of the copyright work. Both derivation and substantiality must be established for infringement to arise.
I. Creation of new images
Let’s start with the use of Stable Diffusion to create new images.
It should be noted that the creation of new images using the Stable Diffusion model does not involve any direct or ‘literal’ copying from the images in the model’s training dataset. Rather, new images are created from random noise, based on patterns that the model has learned from these images during its training process.
This in itself is unlikely to be fatal to derivation. Copyright law recognises that copying can occur in various forms and may be direct or indirect.7 The key question is really whether there is some causal connection between the allegedly infringing work and the copyright work.8 This requirement is likely to be satisfied where it can be shown that the copyright work forms part of an AI model’s training set.
The question of substantiality is likely to prove more challenging. It is important to remember that to establish copyright infringement in Australia, it must be shown that the allegedly infringing work reproduces a substantial part of a particular copyright work. It is not an infringement of copyright to combine a ‘non-substantial’ part of a multitude of different works. Indeed, this is arguably how the human creative process works, because all new works of art are built to some extent on what has come before them.
The difficulty here is that AI-generated works may be derived from a very large number of sources. In most cases, it is likely to be quite difficult to demonstrate that an AI-generated artwork takes a ‘substantial part’ of any one copyright work in its training set.
The case for infringement may be stronger for AIs trained on more specific data sets, or AIs that are instructed to produce images ‘in the style’ of a particular artist or artwork. In such cases, it may be easier to identify the reproduction of a substantial part of a particular work. However, there is still considerable scope for legal uncertainty.
For example, below is an artwork generated by Stable Diffusion using the prompt ‘a garden in the style of Monet.’ Underneath it is an actual painting by Monet of his garden at Giverny.





A ‘garden in the style of Monet’ created using Stable Diffusion.





The Artist’s Garden at Giverny, Claude Monet, 1900.
The first image is a passable imitation of Monet’s style, and one can see how it might be the cause of some concern to the artist (or in this case, his estate).
Assuming that the second image forms part of Stable Diffusion’s training set, then derivation ought to be established. However, whether the first image actually reproduces a ‘substantial part’ of the second image is a more difficult question.9 The works depict the same subject matter and share a distinct impressionistic style. But there are also notable differences in their composition and colour palette. In fact, it is difficult to precisely identify any particular aspect of the second image which is reproduced in the first image. In practice, where there is clear evidence of derivation, Courts may be more inclined to make a finding of substantiality. The challenge here, though, is that the first image may also be derived from a very large number of additional sources, potentially diluting the substantiality of any single instance of copying. This issue is compounded by the lack of transparency around Stable Diffusion’s image creation process and the sources relied upon to create new output in any particular case.
This exercise illustrates the challenges presently faced by copyright owners whose works are used, and in some cases imitated, by generative AI-models.
II. Training
A separate question arises as to whether the process of training generative AI-systems itself amounts to an infringement of copyright.
In Stable Diffusion’s case, this question is likely to turn on whether the training process, and in particular, the creation of latent versions of images in the training set, amounts to a reproduction in material form of those images. It is not contentious that the reproduction of a work in a non-visible, digital form may amount to an infringing reproduction under Australian copyright law.10 A key question will be whether the highly-compressed, latent images created by the Stable Diffusion system still reproduce a ‘substantial part’ of the original image – or whether the training process involves the creation of other ‘non-latent’ digital reproductions of the training images.
These question are at the core of US Court proceedings recently commenced by stock image database Getty Images against Stability AI in the District Court for Delaware. Getty alleges that Stability AI has copied at least 12 million copyright images from its websites, along with associated text and metadata in order to train its Stable Diffusion model. While the proceeding is still at an early stage, it is clear that Getty considers that Stability AI’s training process amounts to an infringement of Getty’s copyright – Getty alleges that the training process involved wide scale copying, encoding and storage of Getty’s stock images and text pairings. Getty also alleges that Stable Diffusion has violated US trade mark and copyright law by producing images which either reproduce, or distort, or remove the watermarks on Getty’s images.11 The determination of Getty’s claim is likely to entail a detailed, technical consideration of the operation of the Stable Diffusion system, and how this interacts with the conventional copyright principles of derivation and substantiality.
While there are relevant differences between Australian and US copyright law (most notably, the absence in Australia of a general ‘fair use’ defence), the proceeding is still likely to provide helpful guidance to Australian artists, businesses and intellectual property lawyers, in the absence of local case law or legislative intervention.

4 It is expected that obtaining quality output will require less work as the model continues to be developed.
5 See https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33902248.
6 The High Court in Ice TV queried the relevance of ‘skill and labour’ per se to questions of copyright subsistence and infringement – the critical question is whether skill and labour is directed to the particular form of expression – see [47], [52] – [54].
7 For example, in Fred Fisher Inc v Dillingham (1924) 298 Fed 145, the Court found that copying occurred unconsciously, on the basis that the copyright work was stored somewhere in the memory of the infringer – see 147-8 per Learned Hand J.
8 See Francis Day & Hunter Ltd v Bron [1963] Ch 587 at 614.
9 The copyright in Monet’s works is, in fact, expired – but let’s assume for the purpose of this exercise that it is still current.
10 See Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) Section 10.
11 Another proceeding was commenced against Stability AI (and another generative AI called MidJourney) by a collective of artists in January this year in the US district Court for the Northern District of California, involving similar allegations.

AI could replace millions of U.S. jobs 











Artificial intelligence could replace millions of jobs in the U.S.
03:18

Love it or hate it, so-called generative artificial intelligence has proved its ability to make at least one type of worker more productive on the job. Using the enhanced AI boosted the productivity of customer service representatives at a Fortune 500 software firm by 14%, according to the first study to examine the emerging technology's use by employees in a real workplace.Notably, human support agents reported resolving more customer queries per hour when aided by a custom-built tool powered by OpenAI's GPT technology. Assistance from the AI also improved customer sentiment, reduced the volume of requests for managerial intervention, and even improved employee retention, presumably because it allowed service agents to have more pleasant interactions with customers, according to Erik Brynjolfsson, one of the paper's authors and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) and director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. 






""There was less churn once they used this tool because it seemed workers were happier and enjoyed the job more,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. ""We wondered if it would push them harder, but it seems to be something workers liked. Customers were happier and I'm guessing as a call center operator, it's more enjoyable to interact with happy customers.""The AI revolution: Google's artificial intelligence developers on what's next in the fieldService reps interacting with customers through text chats used the custom-built AI tool to help them find answers to client questions. Specifically, the AI read interactions between customers and support agents, and generated suggested responses for the agents to use. They also had the ability to accept or reject the AI-generated text answers. 


""It basically saw both what the customers and agents were saying and would give them strategically-timed hints or suggestions,"" Brynjolfsson said.

For example, the AI tool would prompt reps to mention products or possible upgrades customers could make to solve their problems. It was also sensitive to tone, offering guidance to agents how to politely""communicate with clients. The AI was trained on thousands of client-agent interactions that were labeled as either successful or unsuccessful. ""It tended to know what worked well with customers,"" Brynjolfsson said.

The results: Agents generally solved problems faster, customers were happier, new employees got up to speed faster and the employer (which wasn't identified in the study) experienced less turnover. 


""People worry this is going to replace everything. I think by far the bigger effect is it augmenting us, like a calculator. It allows us to do things faster and more efficiently,"" Brynjolfsson said. ""I say lean in and embrace it, learn to use these tools to be more effective.""

According to a recent survey conducted by KPMG US, nearly two-thirds (65%) of the 225 US executives surveyed in March 2023 believe that generative AI will have a high or extremely high impact on their organization in the next three to five years, surpassing other emerging technologies. 
However, despite these findings, nearly the same number (60%) of respondents said they are still a year or two away from implementing their first generative AI solution, revealing a lack of preparedness among executives for immediate adoption.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



>>Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing generative AI coverage<<
Generative AI has become a buzzword among executives and boards, as the technology has become increasingly accessible. However, organizations are struggling to keep up with its rapid development. The KPMG survey found that less than 50% of respondents believe they have the necessary technology, talent and governance to implement generative AI successfully. 
“Generative AI is moving so fast, it has executives’ heads spinning. Companies can’t keep up with dozens of new generative AI offshoots coming out each month. While they’ve bought into its overall promise, they struggle with taking the first step,” Todd Lohr, US technology consulting leader at KPMG, told VentureBeat. “As a result, they may lack the necessary technical expertise in their workforce to build and deploy generative AI solutions.”
To bridge this gap, executives plan to spend the next 6–12 months understanding how generative AI works, evaluating their internal capabilities and investing in generative AI tools. Lohr said that regulatory and ethical concerns around the use of generative AI is another reason for its slowed adoption in certain industries.
The survey polled 300 global C-suite and senior executives, of which 225 were US-based. The respondents were from businesses with revenue of $1 billion and above.
Generative AI: A competitive differentiator 
KPMG US conducted this survey as part of their generative AI research initiative. The report highlighted that generative AI has the potential to be the most disruptive technology seen to date, according to 77% of the executives surveyed. Furthermore, respondents expect the impact to be highest in enterprise-wide areas, such as driving innovation, customer success, tech investment, and sales and marketing.
However, it also revealed that executive prioritization of generative AI varies significantly by sector. While most executives in technology, media, telecommunications (71%), and healthcare and life sciences (67%) feel they have appropriately prioritized generative AI, only a small percentage of consumer and retail executives (30%) view it as a priority. 
The survey also found that organizations struggle to derive value from emerging technologies when they adopt a siloed approach. In fact, 68% of executives responded saying that they have yet to appoint a central team or person to coordinate their response to the rise of generative AI. At present, the IT function is taking the lead.
“Without a leader spearheading generative AI and steering through the hype, companies risk spinning their wheels, duplicating efforts, and having competing strategies. Companies need a generative AI North Star to confidently scale generative AI,” Lohr said. advertisement
The technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) industry is leading the way in prioritizing research on generative AI applications, with 60% of respondents considering it a high or extremely high priority over the next 3–6 months. This is the highest percentage across all industries surveyed.
Moreover, respondents from TMT and financial services industries were most likely to report that the recent emphasis on tools such as ChatGPT has significantly impacted their digital and innovation strategies. As a result, these industries are particularly receptive to the benefits of generative AI and actively seeking ways to incorporate it into their operations.
“Generative AI has the potential to be the most disruptive technology we’ve seen to date,” said Steve Chase, US consulting leader at KPMG. “It will fundamentally change business models, providing new opportunities for growth, efficiency and innovation, while surfacing significant risks and challenges.”
According to Chase, for leaders to harness the enormous potential of generative AI, they must set a clear strategy that quickly moves their organization from experimentation into industrialization. advertisement
Lohr added, “Given that the technology (generative AI) is relatively new, ROI remains hard to quantify. For a clear business case, companies need to identify specific use cases and prioritize them like a product portfolio.” 
Lack of risk management and the fear of negative consequences 
Most executives (72%) believe that generative AI is crucial in building and maintaining stakeholder trust, but almost half (45%) say that not having the right risk management tools can negatively impact their organization’s trust. Furthermore, most executives (79%) think that leveraging generative AI provides a competitive advantage in risk management compared to their peers.
Despite the expected impact of generative AI on their organizations and customers, most organizations are still in the early stages of designing and implementing risk and responsible use programs. Only 6% of the 300 surveyed have a dedicated team for evaluating risk and implementing mitigation strategies, while 25% are in the process of implementing such strategies.
In addition, nearly half (47%) are in the initial stages of evaluating risk and mitigation strategies, and 22% haven’t started evaluating them yet. Only 5% have a mature responsible AI governance program, while 49% plan to establish one in the future, and 19% have partially implemented an AI governance program. 
Interestingly, 27% said they do not currently see a need or have not yet reached enough scale to merit a responsible AI governance program.
“Beyond understanding the technology’s risks and keeping the data in-house, companies must develop a robust data governance framework that establishes clear policies, security protocols, and standard operating procedures for handling data. This ensures that data is collected, processed, and stored securely and appropriately,” added Lohr. 
He said as with any other technology or service, it’s important to do your due diligence when data moves outside the organization.
Executives predict a new era for the workforce that combines human work with generative AI. While many believe it will increase productivity, change how people work and encourage innovation, they are also concerned about potential negative impacts. 
Almost 4 in 10 executives (39%) fear decreased social interactions and human connections with coworkers, while 32% worry about increased mental health issues among their workforce due to the stress of job loss and uncertainty. 
To address this, companies are taking a hybrid approach to both hiring and capability-building across various industries and functions.
Responsible use for fruitful benefits
Executives recognize that generative AI can revolutionize businesses in various sectors, but many barriers to adoption remain. Major concerns include clear business cases and adequate technology, talent and governance. 
To stay ahead of the competition, KPMG recommended that executives prioritize the swift deployment of generative AI while ensuring ethical and responsible use. To successfully do so, KPMG said CEOs and board members must personally invest time in understanding generative AI, and they must demand the same from their teams. 
“The key to success with AI is acceptance, adoption and alignment at the leadership level within the institution. This strategy should start with literacy first. Furthermore, companies should think about new operation models, with R&D into generative AI capabilities, potential use cases and limitations,” Lohr explained. “They should get their ‘hands dirty’ and experiment with pilot projects to test the technology and better understand its potential impact.”

Yet, more companies are hiring AI professionals that do not require advanced skills like computer science. In other words, you may enter these AI careers with non-tech skills to excel in this new technological age.
You can apply for a data analytics translator job if you have excellent English language proficiency. If you have worked as a virtual assistant, you may remain competitive in the job market by learning about ChatGPT and other AI tools. Also, those passionate about video games may work as game writers because modern titles use machine learning.
I will discuss the best AI careers accessible to non-technical people, such as chatbot designers and artificial intelligence writers. Note that these roles require a basic understanding of ChatGPT and similar machine learning systems. Also, higher-paying jobs require advanced skills like data science, systematic and analytical thinking, and data modeling.

For example, I wrote this article so that you can learn about the AI professional roles you may take. The cool thing about this profession is that it suits people with only non-tech skills.



You only need to communicate innovative ideas effectively. However, those with computer programming skills can earn more by covering technical topics.
3. Chatbot designer

Annual salary: $90,877
We expect AI chatbots to produce content on par with manmade ones. Consequently, AI firms need humans to ensure it communicates like a person.
Chatbot designers do that by writing scripts for virtual customer service support. Also, they map the various queries customers may submit to the chatbot.
These AI professionals work with non-tech skills. However, you need role-playing, writing, and communication skills to understand how customers will use the chatbot.
4. Virtual assistant

Annual salary: $59,153
Companies have been integrating ChatGPT into their chatbots, but that does not mean they will replace human agents. Contrary to popular belief, they need virtual assistants more than ever.
AI chatbots are great at answering simple customer queries but need help with complicated ones. Moreover, some people still prefer speaking with human intelligence.

These artificial intelligence jobs cover the customer concerns chatbots couldn’t by providing a human touch. Voice assistants only need to effectively collect data and other non-technical skills.
5. Language translator

Annual salary: $76,070
Modern AI chatbots accept queries in various languages and translate them. For example, the latest large language model of ChatGPT, GPT-4, understands 26 languages.
Machine learning tools rely on language translators to build their language translation features. They translate prompts so AI editors can review and integrate them into the final product.
Nowadays, online translation services use machine learning in their workflows. As a result, working as an ordinary translator remains a viable career in the age of artificial intelligence.
You may land this job if you only have non-tech skills. However, you need to know English and a non-English language you can translate.
6. Digital artist

Annual salary: $53,013
Why would anyone hire artists if AI can produce media? These computer programs are a shortcut to creating appealing art without artistic skills.
Contrary to popular belief, generative AI images increase the demand for manmade art. Machine learning can emulate aesthetics but not human creativity.
People seek manmade art as AI images become more widespread. You do not need to know deep learning or data modeling to become a digital artist. However, you must have artistic skills and understand digital tools like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
7. Game writer

However, most game development firms still prefer manmade scripts. They can produce more natural-sounding dialogue, which resonates better with players.
You may land this job with only non-tech skills like the other entries. You may need to use the company’s AI tools, but your tasks remain the same.
8. AI ethicist

Annual salary: $121,841
Machine learning sparked unprecedented ethical concerns. Specifically, AI needs regulations to ensure it will not eliminate jobs.
As a result, more businesses need guidance in navigating our growing digital world. AI ethicists promote accountability and responsibility in the use of artificial intelligence.

Annual salary: $112,398
AI companies must understand where to implement their projects. As a result, the demand for domain experts grew. Domain experts offer their understanding of various fields to check whether AI tools produce their intended results.
For example, those with an education college degree can confirm whether an AI chatbot helps with learning. As a result, they are essential for creating the most effective AI tools.
Even better, it is one of the artificial intelligence careers that require no technical AI skills. However, you should have expertise in other fields, such as healthcare, finance, or agriculture.
10. Data analytics translator

And to our surprise, it came up with a list of different jobs that AI could potentially impact in the future. Here it goes: Data Entry: Automation tools powered by Artificial Intelligence can scan and extract data from various sources, which can reduce vacancies for manual data entry jobs. Customer Service: AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants have already taken over quite a few platforms. These chatbots can handle routine customer queries, reducing the need for human customer service representatives, thus impacting these jobs in future. Transportation: With the development of self-driving cars and trucks, the jobs of drivers and delivery personnel may be affected. They can easily be replaced by this high-end technology.   Manufacturing and Assembly: AI-powered robots can perform repetitive tasks faster and more efficiently than humans, leading to a reduction in the number of workers required in manufacturing and assembly jobs. Accounting and Bookkeeping: AI-powered software can automate many financial tasks, reducing the need for accountants and bookkeepers. Even the need for librarians may be reduced as AI can easily keep track of the plethora of books assembled in the library. Retail: AI-powered tools can track inventory levels, analyze consumer behavior, and automate ordering and stocking processes, reducing the need for human intervention. Also ReadWhen AI is your assistant Not to forget, AI systems require vast amounts of data to learn and improve. This dependence on data can limit the accuracy and usefulness of the system if the data used to train it is incomplete, biased, or outdated. These tools can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data breaches, and other security concerns. They require a complex infrastructure, including hardware, software, and networks, to function properly. This dependence on infrastructure can as of now limit the scalability and accessibility of AI systems. These systems not only give a peek into the After pointing out these jobs, ChatGPT also noted that while AI may replace these jobs, it will also create new opportunities and require workers with new skills, such as data analytics, programming, and machine learning.

 Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, can be effective, everyday assistants that help you optimize your workflow. However, whether you use it as a writing, coding, or research assistant, it's important to know they are far from perfect. 






 That said, there are a few things to keep in mind to get the best output from AI content generators and ensure you use them ethically. Here, we'll cover some common mistakes to avoid when using AI-generative tools. 


 1. Not Understanding How Generative AI Tools Work 
    

 While you don't need to be a machine learning or AI expert to use generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Jasper, Copysmith, etc., having a basic understanding of how they work is vital. This helps you appreciate their limitations and find ways to get better results. 

 Although these AI text generators have some differences, most use the same underlying engine, so understanding how one works can also give you a pretty accurate view of how the others work. So, how does ChatGPT work? 





 ChatGPT is a large language model trained on massive amounts of data from the internet and other sources. This AI chatbot relies on this training to generate human-sounding responses to your queries. It is worth noting that some of these AI text generators, including ChatGPT, have a training cutoff date, which means they lack knowledge of events after this date. 



 2. Not Editing Responses From AI Text Generators 
 The next big mistake to avoid when using AI-generative tools is failing to edit their responses. By editing, we don't just mean correcting spelling or grammar mistakes. You also need to fact-check the information generated and compare it to other credible sources. 

 As we have covered above, some of these tools don't have access to current information. So, while AI chatbots are effective at predicting their next words (based on their training data and your prompt) and generating plausible and human-like responses, their output is not always accurate, and that's one of the biggest problems with OpenAI's ChatGPT. 





 In addition, these tools may have been fed with biased information and could also generate biased responses. So, you should always ensure you review and edit the generated content before using it. 



 3. Over-Relying on Generative AI Tools for Your Writing Tasks 
    

 Although these AI writing tools can help you write entire articles for online publishers or write your school essays from scratch, developing an over-reliance on them is a huge mistake. There are several reasons why content writers should not rely on AI chatbots for their daily writing tasks. 






 First, as we have covered, these tools don't guarantee accuracy and may contain factual errors or biased content. In addition, these AI writing tools typically generate bland, generic, formulaic content that lacks sufficient depth and creativity. Lastly, an over-dependence on these tools will kill your creativity and make you lazy. 

 This is not to say you shouldn't use them at all, as there are several responsible ways to use AI as a content writer, including brainstorming titles or content ideas, researching, crafting catchy headlines, and more. 



 4. Failing to Write Good Prompts 
 For the most part, the quality of the responses you get from ChatGPT and similar tools depends on the quality of their training and your prompts. In the most basic terms, prompting is how humans talk to AIs, so adopting good prompting techniques is an effective way to improve your ChatGPT responses. 

 For instance, it's always good to ensure your prompts are clear and grammatically correct. Next, you want to provide enough information and context for the AI to understand your query. In addition, you can also assign it a role to get more specific and relevant responses. 





 All in all, learning how to write effective prompts is a key skill to master when using generative AI tools. You can continuously practice by interacting with the AI and adjusting your prompts as you go—you never know, you may just start a career in prompt engineering. 



 5. Trusting Generative AI Tools With Sensitive Information 
    

 Similar to other Tech Giants, OpenAI has faced criticism over its data collection practices that put user privacy and security at risk. However, this goes beyond the account information you give when signing up (name, transaction history, payment card information, etc.), as it also includes data from your conversations with the chatbot. 






 This includes everything you type into the chatbot field or file uploads. That said, you shouldn't trust ChatGPT with confidential information because it could end up in the wrong hands. This is a serious concern, as countries like Italy have already banned ChatGPT, and it's safe to assume that other AI generative tools have similar data collection practices. 

 That said, you should always remain mindful when using these tools and ensure you do not input sensitive or confidential information. 



 6. Using Generative AI Tools Unethically 
 Like most tools out there, AI content generators can be used for good and malicious purposes. For instance, some students have been using AI chatbots to cheat in school, while other malicious actors use them to write phishing emails or create malware. 

 In addition, it's also good practice to inform clients/readers when using AI-generated content in your work. This is particularly important when it comes to sensitive topics like health, politics, and finance. 





 Lastly, you also want to keep an eye on the Terms of Use of any AI content generator you use to ensure you're not violating them, as this could result in your account being suspended or banned. 



 7. Not Familiarizing Yourself With AI-Powered Tools 
    

 A lot has been said about artificial intelligence recently, and several predictions have been made as well. Whether you believe that these tools will take your job or not, what's certain is that AI will change the job market, and it's here to stay. 

 This means adaptability is more vital than ever, so ignoring these AI generative tools is a mistake you want to avoid. While you may have unique skills and talents that artificial intelligence can't replace, there's a huge chance that early adopters will gain an edge over their competition. 







 Get Better Results From Generative AI Tools by Avoiding These Mistakes 
 AI chatbots can enhance your workday in several ways, but like most tools, you need to know how to use them properly to get the best results. By avoiding these mistakes, you'll be able to make the most out of generative AI tools and ensure that your work is of the highest quality. 

 As this technology continues to evolve, it's vital to continuously refine your skills to stay ahead of the curve. And once you can use these tools effectively, make sure that you use them to their full advantage and boost your own productivity.

Learn more about the new generation of artificial intelligence and what it means for the future of knowledge work, the nature of creativity, and the origins and truthfulness of content on the internet



As published byThe Conversation













The light and dark sides of AI have been in the public spotlight for many years. Think facial recognition, algorithms making loan and sentencing recommendations, and medical image analysis. But the impressive – and sometimes scary – capabilities of ChatGPT, DALL-E 2 and other conversational and image-conjuring artificial intelligence programs feel like a turning point.
The key change has been the emergence within the last year of powerful generative AI, software that not only learns from vast amounts of data but also produces things – convincingly written documents, engaging conversation, photorealistic images and clones of celebrity voices.
Generative AI has been around for nearly a decade, as long-standing worries about deepfake videos can attest. Now, though, the AI models have become so large and have digested such vast swaths of the internet that people have become unsure of what AI means for the future of knowledge work, the nature of creativity and the origins and truthfulness of content on the internet.
Here are five articles from our archives the take the measure of this new generation of artificial intelligence.
1. Generative AI and work

A panel of five AI experts discussed the implications of generative AI for artists and knowledge workers. It’s not simply a matter of whether the technology will replace you or make you more productive.
University of Tennessee computer scientist Lynne Parker wrote that while there are significant benefits to generative AI, like making creativity and knowledge work more accessible, the new tools also have downsides. Specifically, they could lead to an erosion of skills like writing, and they raise issues of intellectual property protections given that the models are trained on human creations.
University of Colorado Boulder computer scientist Daniel Acuña has found the tools to be useful in his own creative endeavors but is concerned about inaccuracy, bias and plagiarism.
University of Michigan computer scientist Kentaro Toyama wrote that human skill is likely to become costly and extraneous in some fields. “If history is any guide, it’s almost certain that advances in AI will cause more jobs to vanish, that creative-class people with human-only skills will become richer but fewer in number, and that those who own creative technology will become the new mega-rich.”
Florida International University computer scientist Mark Finlayson wrote that some jobs are likely to disappear, but that new skills in working with these AI tools are likely to become valued. By analogy, he noted that the rise of word processing software largely eliminated the need for typists but allowed nearly anyone with access to a computer to produce typeset documents and led to a new class of skills to list on a resume.
University of Colorado Anschutz biomedical informatics researcher Casey Greene wrote that just as Google led people to develop skills in finding information on the internet, AI language models will lead people to develop skills to get the best output from the tools. “As with many technological advances, how people interact with the world will change in the era of widely accessible AI models. The question is whether society will use this moment to advance equity or exacerbate disparities.”
2. Conjuring images from words












Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley computer scientist who specializes in image forensics, explained the process. The software is trained on a massive set of images, each of which includes a short text description.
“The model progressively corrupts each image until only visual noise remains, and then trains a neural network to reverse this corruption. Repeating this process hundreds of millions of times, the model learns how to convert pure noise into a coherent image from any caption,” he wrote.
3. Marking the machine
Many of the images produced by generative AI are difficult to distinguish from photographs, and AI-generated video is rapidly improving. This raises the stakes for combating fraud and misinformation. Fake videos of corporate executives could be used to manipulate stock prices, and fake videos of political leaders could be used to spread dangerous misinformation.
Farid explained how it’s possible to produce AI-generated photos and video that contain watermarks verifying that they are synthetic. The trick is to produce digital watermarks that can’t be altered or removed. “These watermarks can be baked into the generative AI systems by watermarking all the training data, after which the generated content will contain the same watermark,” he wrote.
4. Flood of ideas
For all the legitimate concern about the downsides of generative AI, the tools are proving to be useful for some artists, designers and writers. People in creative fields can use the image generators to quickly sketch out ideas, including unexpected off-the-wall material.

Rochester Institute of Technology industrial designer and professor Juan Noguera and his students use tools like DALL-E or Midjourney to produce thousands of images from abstract ideas – a sort of sketchbook on steroids.
“Enter any sentence – no matter how crazy – and you’ll receive a set of unique images generated just for you. Want to design a teapot? Here, have 1,000 of them,” he wrote. “While only a small subset of them may be usable as a teapot, they provide a seed of inspiration that the designer can nurture and refine into a finished product.”
5. Shortchanging the creative process
However, using AI to produce finished artworks is another matter, according to Nir Eisikovits and Alec Stubbs, philosophers at the Applied Ethics Center at University of Massachusetts Boston. They note that the process of making art is more than just coming up with ideas.












The hands-on process of producing something, iterating the process and making refinements – often in the moment in response to audience reactions – are indispensable aspects of creating art, they wrote.
“It is the work of making something real and working through its details that carries value, not simply that moment of imagining it,” they wrote. “Artistic works are lauded not merely for the finished product, but for the struggle, the playful interaction and the skillful engagement with the artistic task, all of which carry the artist from the moment of inception to the end result.” – Rappler.com
