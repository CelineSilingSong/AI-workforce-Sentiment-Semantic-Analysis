There’s an understandable nervousness among any workforce when you start talking about automation.
It’s actually been 10 years since Oxford University academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne released their seminal paper ‘The Future of Employment’, which contained a list of occupations with an automation probability score. It was a moment that launched a spate of headlines claiming robots were coming for our jobs.
For field services teams, this has been a slow burn. As the paper suggests, “the manual tasks of service occupations are less susceptible to computerisation, as they require a higher degree of flexibility and physical adaptability.” And yet, the workforce is under pressure, not so much from automation but from the fact that it is ageing.
To compound the problem, not enough millennials and ‘Gen Zers’ are seeing the profession as an attractive career option.
According to research, almost three-quarters of companies (73 per cent) identify an ageing workforce as a potential threat to their field service operations. Meanwhile, over two-thirds (67 per cent) of businesses feel that technology plays a key role in attracting new talent. The challenge is which technologies and to what extent an organisation commits.
What is becoming increasingly clear is that AI and automation are going to play a significant role in field service operations. Generative AI is going to be at the heart of this. ChatGPT, a product of US-based not-for-profit organisation OpenAI, believes it has the ability ‘to limit the impact of a shrinking and ageing field service workforce in several ways.’
Overcoming a major issue
Field service has a major workforce recruitment and retention problem. The majority of the workforce is nearing retirement which means that we are losing their expertise, their knowledge and their ability to complete work.
It also leaves a void that is not being filled by new entrants, who are not as interested in the type of work being done in field service. This is where the capabilities of ChatGPT can be transformational. 
However, the outgoing workforce isn’t really where the potential lies. The real value lies in the next-generation workforce.
ChatGPT can help organisations capture and organise the unstructured knowledge and experience of the workforce and make it accessible in a format that is desirable for the next generation of employees.
As opposed to viewing paper manuals, calling a friend, and completing countless forms to close out a service job, consider an experience where an engineer has access to relevant and contextual information via a query, with work instructions overlayed visually via Augmented Reality, and work summarised and documented via generative AI.
While it might seem futuristic, it’s the type of vision for field service that organisations must have to create a marketable product for the next generation workforce. These potential entrants are digitally native, they’ve grown up on the tools of today and are constantly tinkering with the likes of ChatGPT.
Organisations must be able to provide these technologically-savant workers with the tools, information, and working models that they are already familiar with to make the profession of field service more relevant.
If they can provide them with a way to engage with the experience and knowledge of former generations to become more proficient in the craft, open up new opportunities for learning and growth, and create working opportunities that could be remote-first or data-focused, then it changes the profile of what a career in field service looks like.  
The point is that automation can enable field engineers to do their jobs more efficiently and effectively.
By automating mundane tasks and improving asset intelligence, field service teams can optimise work schedules, parts ordering and parts delivery times. This reduces unnecessary truck rolls and improves customer satisfaction through more accurate and efficient maintenance work.
Collaboration between support teams and engineers on a common platform and using real-time asset data also helps to identify opportunities for new contracts or device upgrades.
There are, of course, some things technology cannot replace, such as engineer experience, but this is about how to use technology to manage skills gaps, attract new engineers and even unretire some of the older ones. The technology is there to make the job easier and more effective. Regardless of age, that must be a good thing.

SILICON Valley’s feverish embrace of large language models (LLMs) shows no sign of letting up. Google is integrating its chatbot Bard into every one of its services, while OpenAI is imbuing its own offering, ChatGPT, with new senses, such as the ability to “see” and “speak”, envisaging a new kind of personal assistant. But deep mysteries remain about how these tools function: what is really going on behind their shiny interfaces, which tasks are they truly good at and how might they fail? Should we really be betting the house on technology with so many unknowns?
There are still large…

Everyone is worried about Artificial Intelligence. From writers in Hollywood to computer programmers, recent advances in technology are causing concern about what Generative AI is going to mean for the future of work, our society and the wider world.  Is there nothing machines will not be able to do?

We have spent a decade researching the impacts of AI. Ten years ago, we wrote a paper estimating that some 47% of US-based jobs could be automated in principle, as AI and mobile robotics expanded the scope of tasks that computers can do.
Our estimates were based on the premise that, while computers might eventually be able to do most tasks, humans would continue to hold the comparative advantage in three key domains: creativity, complex social interactions, and interaction with unstructured environments (such as your home).
However, it is important to acknowledge there has been meaningful progress in these domains, with Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT4, capable of producing human-like text responses to a very wide range of queries. In the age of Generative AI, a machine might even write your love letters.
Yet if GPT4 does write your love letters, your in-person dates will become even more important. The bottom line is, as virtual social interactions are increasingly aided by algorithms, the premium on in-person interactions, which cannot be replicated by machines, will become even greater.
As virtual social interactions are increasingly aided by algorithms, the premium on in-person interactions, which cannot be replicated by machines, will become even greater
Second, although AI can produce a letter in the style of Shakespeare, this is only because Shakespeare’s works already exist, and on which an AI can be trained. AI is generally good at tasks which have clear data and a clear goal, such as maximizing the score in a video game, or the similarity to the language of Shakespeare. But if you want to create something genuinely new, rather than rehashing existing ideas, for what should you optimise? Answering the question of the true goal is where much human creativity resides.
Third, as we noted in our 2013 paper, there are many jobs that can be automated, but Generative AI – a subfield of the broader field of AI – is not yet an automation technology. It needs prompting from a human, and it needs a human to select, fact-check and edit the output.
Finally, Generative AI generates content that mirrors the quality of its training data – ‘garbage in results in garbage out’. And these algorithms require training on expansive datasets, such as extensive segments of the internet, as opposed to smaller, refined datasets developed by experts. Consequently, LLMs are inclined to create text that aligns with the average, rather than the extraordinary, portions of the internet. Average input yields average output.

What implications does this hold for the future of employment? For one thing, the latest generation of AI will persist in necessitating human intervention. What is more, workers with less specialised skills stand to gain disproportionately, as they can now generate content that aligns with the ‘average’ benchmark.

Could the hurdles outlined above be overcome shortly, paving the way for widespread automation also of creative and social tasks? In the absence of a major breakthrough, we think it is unlikely. Firstly, the data already ingested by LLMs is likely to comprise a considerable fraction of the internet, making it unlikely that training data can be significantly expanded to power further progress. Furthermore, there are legitimate grounds to expect a surge of inferior AI-crafted content on the Web, progressively degrading its quality as a source of training data.
Second, while we have become accustomed to Moore's Law - the observational law that declares the quantity of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles approximately every two years - many anticipate this trend will lose momentum, owing to physical constraints, around 2025.
Third, it is estimated that the energy to create GPT4 cost a large fraction of its $100 million training cost – even before the price of energy went up. With the climate challenge looming large, there are questions over whether this approach can continue.
Many jobs will be automated, but not because of the latest wave of Generative AI
What is needed, in other words, is AI that is capable of learning from smaller, curated datasets, drawing upon expert samples, rather than the average population. But when such innovation will come is notoriously hard to predict. What we can do is create better incentives for data-saving innovation.
Consider this: around the turn of the 20th century, there was a genuine contest - would electric vehicles or the combustion engine prevail in the burgeoning car industry? At first, both contenders were on a par, but massive oil discoveries tipped the balance in favour of the combustion engine. Now imagine that we leveraged a tax on oil back then: we might have shifted the balance in favour of the electric car, sparing us plenty of carbon emissions. In similar fashion, a tax on data would create incentives for innovation to make AI less data-intensive.
Going forward, as we have argued elsewhere, many jobs will be automated, but not because of the latest wave of Generative AI. In the absence of major breakthroughs, we expect the bottlenecks we outlined in our 2013 paper to continue to constrain automation possibilities for the foreseeable future.

The launch of generative AI represents an era-defining moment. Never before have so many people become so excited by a technology program. Within five days of ChatGPT’s release in November 2022, more than 1 million people (including me) had logged on to try it out. If financial investments are a predictor of growth, then the $12 billion invested in generative AI in the first five months of 2023 shows the depth of commitment. 
To get a sense of current momentum and direction, I ran a research webinar last month on the impact of generative AI on the workplace. Some 260 executives from organizations in Australia, Europe, Japan, and the United States joined me to describe their current use of generative AI in human capital domains. What I heard is that generative AI is a top priority for many CEOs, experiments abound alongside ambiguity, and organizations are already beginning to use artificial intelligence to augment their human capital strategies. I’ll share more details about those findings in a moment.

I wanted to hear directly from practitioners because it seems to me that, as with the previous era-defining event — the COVID-19 pandemic — and its impact on the workplace, imagining what is ahead with this new technology is a tough call. As with the emergence of hybrid work and work-from-home initiatives in response to the pandemic, figuring out the right approaches to generative AI is a process replete with ambiguity, experiments, and changes of mind. In other words, it is a learning process driven both by the initiative of individuals and the strategies of organizations. 
Like the response to the pandemic, debate and action around gen AI are moving fast. 


					Figuring out the right approaches to generative AI is a process replete with ambiguity, experiments, and changes of mind.
					
Two facts are emerging. First, this is a rapidly developing technology. The size of investment gives a sense of this. So, too, does the volume of experimentation: One executive told me, “We have created a head of generative AI with a role simply to moderate and make sense of the hundreds of experiments we have running on any day.” Second, unlike previous workplace technologies, generative AI is not being positioned as a substitute for routine tasks — either analytical tasks, like keeping records or providing repetitive customer-oriented services, or manual tasks, like picking and sorting products or performing routine assembly. Instead, it’s a technology with the potential to hit at the heart of nonroutine analytical work. This is knowledge work, such as forming a hypothesis, creating content, recommending medical diagnostics, or making a sales pitch. The source of this impact is generative AI’s growing capacity to understand natural language. Around 25% of the total work time of knowledge workers is spent on the kinds of creative tasks that generative AI is beginning to get good at.
Yet, like during the early days of the pandemic and hybrid work, much is currently conjecture. There will certainly be pushback, changes of direction, and believers and resisters, just as there has been throughout the ongoing debate about hybrid work. There will be many experiments before leaders begin to develop their own narratives about how best to support their workers in these complex and ambiguous times.









Experiments, Projections, and the Great Ambiguity
The potential for generative AI to very quickly have a real impact in the workplace is fueling the attention it’s getting. Consider the McKinsey report on generative AI published in June 2023. McKinsey asked a group of technology experts at what point they believed generative AI would substitute for a number of human tasks. It then compared those estimates with pre-gen AI projections made in 2017 about when human performance might be achievable by technology. What is striking is the extent to which their estimated timelines have contracted. For one work task, for example — “coordination with multiple agents” — the experts in 2017 estimated a timeline of substitution that ranged from 2035 to 2058. Today, they estimate that happening from 2023 to 2035. That feels very soon. As important, in 2017, the estimate for when we’d see technology achieve human-level performance for the task of “creativity” was 2030 to 2045; today, the projection is from 2025 to 2030. These dates are for tasks where technology performance is expected to match median human performance. For top-quartile human performance, the timelines are pushed out somewhat. 
How do we make sense of this? What I learned from observing the impact of the pandemic on work is that watching closely and asking questions of people in the field about their current lived reality is a useful practice. So my Sept. 19 webinar was essentially a listening process. Many executives came from human capital functions, so their interest was primarily in the people side of their business. 
I began by asking where generative AI currently sits on the leadership agenda. Over half of attendees (52%) agreed with the statement “It is a CEO priority where leadership teams are discussing impact.” Only 13% said “It is not yet on the agenda in any meaningful way.” This is a topic that is definitely consuming bandwidth at the top levels of organizations across the world. 


					A useful practice is to watch closely and ask questions of people in the field about their current lived reality.
					
Generative AI is at the top of leaders’ agendas — but what about the scope of debate? What issues are coming forward as people talk through its consequences? For the webinar, I focused on a central aspect of this question: machines and creativity. The technologists in the McKinsey panel estimated that human creativity will be achieved by generative AI within the time span of 2025 to 2030, but what did this group of leaders believe? This, for me, is an important question because the McKinsey panelists are technology experts. I have a hunch that people like them will overestimate technological progress, whereas people like me (psychologists) will overestimate human progress. 
What is fascinating is the lack of agreement among webinar attendees about whether they think human creativity at the top quartile will be achieved by gen AI from 2023 to 2030: Just 10% strongly agreed, while 34% agreed, 22% neither agreed or disagreed, 30% disagreed, and 4% strongly disagreed. I ran a Menti (a quick survey at the website Mentimeter) to collect participants’ real-time thoughts and asked why they had come to their conclusions. Within seconds, more than 80 comments had emerged: Those who agreed pointed out that creativity can be broken down into logical steps; that creativity sits on a lot of data; that prompts will be more important than AI; and that use cases, such as songs, already demonstrate creativity. Those who disagreed described how generative AI would augment, not substitute for, creative people and asserted that creativity was about empathy and vulnerability, that humans can generate new ideas, while AI pulls from the past, and that governments will provide regulation. Those who did not know said there are simply too many unknown unknowns. 
For me, the takeaway here is the sheer richness of conversation and variance in opinions about generative AI. These are debates we need to be open about and continue to have.  
I wondered, of course, how generative AI is currently being experimented with and used. My interest is in the human capital agenda and how generative AI will impact the everyday experiences of workers. One of the “promises” of AI, according to the McKinsey report, is a productivity boost from the automation of a wide variety of activities. For knowledge workers, this will come by technology either substituting for or augmenting tasks such as creating connections, retrieving stored data, personalizing content, automating activities, increasing the speed of response, and collaborating.
I asked about the current velocity of the use of generative AI in three human capital domains: talent development (like recruitment, induction, and career management), productivity (like skills training and managing collaboration), and change management (like internal knowledge management). I was interested in the current use of generative AI in each domain and the use cases. Of course, the data set of attendees comprised self-selected people who had an interest in generative AI, but still, what is clear is that there are many, many experiments currently underway.

The human capital domain with the greatest reported use of generative AI right now is “internal knowledge management.” Forty-six percent of attendees said they are experimenting in this sphere, with use cases such as creating communications, conducting market research analysis, finding resources and competencies, and engaging in employee listening. Almost as many attendees (44%) reported using gen AI for recruitment, with use cases such as creating job advertisements, developing simple approval flows, and onboarding new hires. About a third of attendees (34%) said they’re using gen AI for skills training, with use cases that include self-directed learning, the creation of learning content, and virtual reality-based training. And 23% said they’re using the technology for assessment and feedback, with use cases such as developing bespoke assessments, improving performance feedback, designing career paths, and creating chatbots for employees.
I feel that what I captured in this research webinar is a sense of the sheer depth of conversation and experimentation taking place right now across the world. How to think about and use generative AI is being debated in the C-suite as use cases are being created and tough questions (like the relationship between machines and creativity) are being debated. For organizations to be aligned with this emerging narrative, it is imperative that they experiment freely and observe closely.

White & Case Tech Newsflash

You are likely already familiar with two US recent decisions that have addressed the copyrightability of AI-generated works:
(a) On August 18, 2023, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) in Thaler v. Perlmutter, D.D.C., No. 1:22-cv-01564 (Thaler Decision), confirming that a work generated by an artificial system absent human involvement is not eligible for copyright protection under US copyright law.
(b) On September 5, 2023, the USCO's Copyright Review Board (Board) affirmed the USCO's refusal to register a work containing ""more than a de minimis amount of content generated by artificial intelligence"" where the author refused to disclaim such AI-generated content in the registration application for such work (Allen Decision).
In this Tech Newsflash, we outline five practical considerations given these recent developments:
1. So far, humans are indispensable.
Human creators have the ability to convey a proprietary interest in what they create. If you wish to use generative AI to create content, copyright law (as it currently stands in US), provides limited protection with respect to such content. Accordingly, human authors, artists, coders and other creators still have an edge, because their creative expression, assuming it meets the basic copyright requirements, is protectable under US copyright law. When using generative AI tools, consider whether, and to what extent, you wish to rely upon copyright law (or even patent law) to protect your creations, or whether other forms of protection may be available – see point 5 below.
2. Users of generative AI should consider whether they can agree to customary IP terms.
If you are using generative AI technology within your business, including in performing services for others, consider whether you can represent and warrant ownership of AI-generated deliverables or assets, or whether you can assign or transfer ownership of such deliverables or assets. Services or license agreements typically address ownership of deliverables or licensed items, and similarly, in certain corporate transactions, targets are typically required to make representations and warranties regarding ownership of IP and technology. When using generative AI tools, you should carefully assess whether you can honor your contractual commitments. Companies also often use work made for hire constructs under the Copyright Act to acquire copyright ownership of works upon creation. However, as noted in the Thaler Decision, where the work never had valid or eligible copyright, the ""work made for hire"" doctrine cannot be implicated as no property rights exist to transfer in the first instance.
3. Parts of AI-assisted works may be copyrightable.
Neither the Thaler Decision nor the Allen Decision foreclose the copyrightability of AI-developed or generated works. As clarified in the USCO's Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence (which we previously discussed), works containing AI-generated materials may be protectable where, for example, humans have selected or arranged the materials in a sufficiently creative way, or humans have modified the materials to such a degree that there is a sufficient amount of original authorship. Indeed, the USCO has granted limited copyright registration for the text and overall selection, coordination, and arrangement of written and visual elements of a comic book created in part using Midjourney's AI-powered text-to-image generator (which we also previously discussed). However, where such a work contains more than a de minimis amount of AI-generated content, per the USCO's current guidance, such content must be disclaimed in the registration application.
4. Trademark, trade secret and contractual protections may provide other avenues of protection.
In order to secure and maintain rights to AI-generated works, as creators or ""owners"" of such works, you may be able to seek protections under areas of law other than copyright, for example, protecting such outputs as trade secrets (likely more relevant to generative AI outputs such as code than images or media), imposing restrictions on disclosure and use of such works under contract and/or applying trademarks or establishing trademark protection (depending on how this is done, this is unlikely to protect the underlying work unless it comprises the trademark itself).
5. AI generated works may still infringe third party copyrights.
While US copyright law does not currently protect AI-generated works without human input, your creation and use of such works, and/or the training of an AI model that produces such works still may infringe a third party's copyrights. We have previously reported on ongoing, yet to be decided, class action lawsuits about the latter. Therefore, when using AI and AI-generated works, you cannot automatically assume that such outputs cannot infringe third-party IP rights. Indeed, over the last few months, various tech companies have made public commitments to indemnify certain customers for copyright infringement relating to use of their AI tools.
This area of law is still evolving. As noted in the Thaler Decision: ""Undoubtedly, we are approaching new frontiers in copyright as artists put AI in their toolbox to be used in the generation of new visual and other artistic works. The increased attenuation of human creativity from the actual generation of the final work will prompt challenging questions regarding how much human input is necessary to qualify the user of an AI system as an ""author"" of a generated work, the scope of the protection obtained over the resultant image, how to assess the originality of AI-generated works where the systems may have been trained on unknown pre-existing works, how copyright might best be used to incentivize creative works involving AI, and more.""
Shortly after the Thaler Decision, the USCO published a notice of inquiry seeking public comments by October 18, 2023, including on using copyrighted works to train AI models, levels of transparency and disclosure with respect to such use and training, the copyrightability and legal status of AI-generated outputs, and the treatment of AI-generated outputs that mimic personal attributes of human artists. Accordingly, we are undoubtedly going to have updates in this regard, so watch this space!

Experts have suggestions for how to manage all these unknownsBy Lauren Leffer leremy/Getty ImagesCreativityIt’s logical for humans to feel anxious about artificial intelligence. After all, the news is constantly reeling off job after job at which the technology seems to outperform us. But humans aren’t yet headed for all-out replacement. And if you do suffer from so-called AI anxiety, there are ways to alleviate your fears and even reframe them into a motivating force for good.In one recent example of generative AI’s achievements, AI programs outscored the average human in tasks requiring originality, as judged by human reviewers. For a study published this month in Scientific Reports, researchers gave 256 online participants 30 seconds to come up with imaginative uses for four commonplace objects: a box, a rope, a pencil and a candle. For example, a box might serve as a cat playhouse, a miniature theater or a time capsule. The researchers then gave the same task to three different large language models. To assess the creativity of these responses, the team used two methods: an automated program that assessed “semantic distance,” or relatedness between words and concepts, and six human reviewers that were trained to rank responses on their originality.In both assessments, the highest-rated human ideas edged out the best of the AI responses—but the middle ground told a different story. The mean AI scores were significantly higher than the mean human scores. For instance, both the automated and human assessments ranked the response “cat playhouse” as less creative than a similar AI-generated response from GPT-4, “cat amusement park.” And people graded the lowest-scoring human answers as far less creative than the worst of the AI generations.Headlines ensued, proclaiming that “AI chatbots already surpass average human in creativity” and “AI is already more creative than YOU.” The new study is the latest in a growing body of research that seems to portend generative AI outpacing the average human in many artistic and analytical realms—from photography competitions to scientific hypotheses.It’s news such as this that has fed Kat Lyons’s fears about AI. Lyons is a Los Angeles–based background artist who works in animation and creates immersive settings for TV shows including Futurama and Disenchantment. In many ways, it’s their dream job—a paid outlet for their passion and skill in visual art, which they’ve been cultivating since age four. But some aspects of the dream have begun to sour: the rise of visual generative AI tools such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion (and the entertainment industry’s eagerness to use them) has left Lyons discouraged, frustrated and anxious about their future in animation—and about artistic work in general. For instance, they were disheartened when Marvel and Disney decided to use an AI-generated, animated intro sequence made by the visual effects company Method Studios for the show Secret Invasion, which premiered in June. “It feels really scary,” Lyons says. “I honestly hate it.” Disney, which owns Marvel Studios, and Method Studios did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Like many professional creatives, Lyons now worries about AI models—which need to train themselves on vast swaths of Internet content—stealing and rehashing their artistic work for others’ profit. And then there’s the corresponding loss of employment opportunities. More broadly, Lyons fears for the future of art itself in an era when honing a craft and a personal voice are no longer prerequisites for producing seemingly original and appealing projects. “I worked so hard for my artistic dreams. I’ve been drawing since I was in preschool,” they say. “This is always what I’ve wanted to do, but we might be entering a world where I have to give that up as my full-time job—where I have to go back to waiting tables or serving coffee.”Lyons isn’t alone. Many people have found themselves newly anxious about the rapid rise of generative AI, says Mary Alvord, a practicing psychologist in the Washington, D.C., area. Alvord says her clients of all ages express concerns about artificial intelligence. Specific worries include a lack of protection for online data privacy, the prospect of job loss, the opportunity for students to cheat and even the possibility of overall human obsolescence.AI’s advance has triggered a vague but pervasive sense of general public unease, and for some individuals, it has become a significant source of stress.Curated by Our EditorsAlgorithms Are Making Important Decisions. What Could Possibly Go Wrong?AnanyaWhat the Luddites Can Teach Us about AISophie Bushwick & Elah FederChatGPT Can Get Good Grades. What Should Educators Do about It?Lauren LefferGames Rule the World—And Always HaveJen SchwartzAs with any anxiety, it’s important to manage the emotion and avoid becoming overwhelmed. “A certain amount of anxiety helps motivate, but then too much anxiety paralyzes,” Alvord says. “There’s a balance to strike.” Here’s how some psychologists and other experts suggest tackling our AI fears.First off, context is key, says Sanae Okamoto, a psychologist and behavioral scientist at the United Nations University–Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology in the Netherlands. She suggests keeping in mind that the present moment is far from the first time people have feared the rise of an unfamiliar technology. “Computer anxiety” and “technostress” date backdecades, Okamoto notes. Before that, there was rampant worry over industrial automation. Past technological advances have led to big societal and economic shifts. Some fears materialized, and some jobs did disappear, but many of the worst sci-fi predictions did not come true.“It’s natural and historical that we are afraid of any new technology,” says Jerri Lynn Hogg, a media psychologist and former president of the American Psychological Association’s Society for Media Psychology and Technology. But understanding the benefits of a new tech, learning how it works and getting training in how to use it productively can help—and that means going beyond the headlines.Simone Grassini, one of the researchers of the new study and a psychologist at Norway’s University of Bergen, is quick to point out that “performing one specific task that is related to creative behavior doesn’t automatically translate to ‘AI can do creative jobs.’” The current technology is not truly producing new things but rather imitating or simulating what people can do, Grassini says. AI’s “cognitive architecture and our cognitive architecture are substantially different.” In the study, it’s possible the AI won high creativity ratings because its answers simply copied verbatim parts of a human creation contained somewhere in its training set, he explains. The AI was also competing against human volunteers who had no particular motivation to excel at their creative task and had never necessarily completed such an assignment before. Participants were recruited online and paid only about $2.50 for an estimated 13 minutes of work.Confronting fears of generative AI by actually trying out the tools, seeing where and how they can be useful, reading up on how they work and understanding their limitations can turn the tech from a boogeyman into a potential asset, Hogg says. A deeper understanding can empower someone to advocate for meaningful job protections or policies that rein in potential downsides.Alvord also emphasizes the importance of addressing the problem directly. “We talk about what actions you can take instead of sticking your head in the sand,” she says. Maybe that means gaining new skills to prepare for a career change or learning about ongoing efforts to regulate AI. Or maybe it means building a coalition with colleagues at work. Lyons says being involved with their union, the Animation Guild, has been crucial to helping them feel more secure and hopeful about the future. In this way, remedies for AI anxiety may be akin to ones for another major, burgeoning societal fear: climate anxiety.Though there are obvious differences between the two phenomena (AI clearly offers some significant possible benefits), there are also apparent similarities. In tackling the biggest concerns about AI and in confronting the climate crisis, “we’re all in this challenge together,” Okamoto says. Just as with climate activism, she explains, meaningfully confronting fears over AI might begin with building solidarity, finding community and coming up with collective solutions.Another way to feel better about AI is to avoid overly fixating on it, Okamoto adds. There is more to life than algorithms and screens. Taking breaks from technology to reconnect with nature or loved ones in the physical world is critical for mental health, she notes. Stepping away from tech can also provide a reminder of all the ways that humans are distinct from the chatbots or image generators that might threaten a person’s career or self-image. Humans, unlike AI, can experience the world directly and connect with one another about it.When people create something, it’s often in response to their environment. Each word or brushstroke can carry meaning. For Lyons, human creativity is a “feral, primitive drive to make something because you can’t not make it.” So far, all AI can do is mimic that ability and creative motivation, says Sean Kelly, a Harvard University philosophy professor who has been examining the relationship between human creativity and AI for years. When an AI model generates something, Kelly says, “it’s not doing what the original artist did, which was trying to say something that they felt needed to be said.”To Kelly, the real societal fear shouldn’t be that AI will get better or produce ever more interesting content. Instead he’s afraid “that we’ll give up on ourselves” and “just become satisfied” with what AI generators can provide.Perhaps the better, and more characteristically human, response is to use our AI anxiety to propel us forward. Mastering a craft—be it drawing, writing, programming, translating, playing an instrument or composing mathematical proofs—and using that skill to create something new is “the most rewarding thing that we can possibly do,” Kelly says. So why not let AI motivate more creation instead of replace it? If the technology spits out something compelling, we can build on it. And if it doesn’t, then why worry about it at all?Rights & PermissionsLauren Leffer is a contributing writer and former tech reporting fellow at Scientific American.

  The automation of blue-collar and office jobs using digital technologies has been an important driver of the rise in inequality since the 1980s. A new CEPR Policy Insight argues that a ‘human-complementary’ path for artificial intelligence could contribute more to productivity growth and help reduce economic inequality. The authors suggest five potential elements for policy attention to help move the US, Europe, and other economies onto this human-complementary path.

Generative AI Is Revolutionizing Music: Loudly's Vision For Democratizing CreationAdobe Stock

In recent years, we have seen a plethora of AI music platforms emerge, including Meta’s Audiocraft, OpenAI’s MuseNet, Soundful, Soundraw, Boomy, Amper and Loudly, among others. These allow anybody to create and customize music.

Recently, I was joined by Loudly founder and CEO Rory Kenny for my podcast, covering a number of topics that I personally find fascinating.

Does AI threaten human creativity by ushering in a future where all of our art and entertainment is conjured up from digital data by super-smart computers?

PROMOTED
Or does it allow us to augment and enhance our inherent human creativity in new and exciting ways, breaking down social and technological barriers to creativity and enabling us to express ourselves in new ways?
This was just one of the questions that Kenny and I hoped to get to the root of—while also taking an overview of the fascinating technology and the business model behind the platform.

Different platforms are emerging, each with its unique capabilities and focus. For example, Soundful offers a straightforward approach, providing producers with more control over basic musical parameters, making it ideal for those requiring more than just a finished AI-generated song. Aiva, in operation since 2016, targets individuals and businesses aiming to craft soundtracks for different media, allowing for customization and versatility. Beatbot distinguishes itself by using text prompts to generate short songs, focusing on enabling users to be a part of the music creation, particularly within the hip-hop and rap genres. Each of these platforms caters to a unique need in the market, showcasing the expanding horizons of AI in music.

As for Loudly, it is an advanced AI-driven music creation platform with an extensive training set of 10 million songs and a sound bank containing 200,000 human-generated recordings. It empowers users to produce royalty-free music tailored to their needs using simple natural-language prompts, allowing them to specify the style, tempo, mood, and even individual instruments. Embracing the concept of ""music as code,"" Loudly enables deep interaction with music at a micro-level, facilitating the creation of a myriad of unique sounds. Notably, the platform holds the copyrights to all the music it's been trained on, ensuring no concerns of copyright infringements or artists feeling their original works have been misused.
AI And The Democratization Of Music Creation
Kenny strongly believes that the integration of AI into various creative tools is inevitable. He points out that AI is already influencing image generation and predicts that music creation will follow suit. Kenny anticipates that tools used for video creation and digital audio workstations will also incorporate AI features, improving user accessibility and enhancing the output.
Such advancements will provide an avenue for countless individuals who have a passion for music but might not possess the technical skills. It's an opportunity for them to express their creativity. This is a significant move in the music industry, mirroring the transformation brought about by streaming services. These platforms, such as Spotify and Soundcloud, have made music distribution accessible to everyone. As a result, a vast number of songs are being uploaded daily.
Kenny describes the forthcoming phase as the ""era of mass creativity,"" which has already commenced. He wonders about the future of this era and its implications for traditional artists. He introduces the term ""AI-first artists"" to describe the new generation of creatives who will leverage AI's capabilities. These artists can use AI-based music creation tools to produce music, design synthetic artist profiles, and even fabricate their entire career narrative. With emerging technologies like mixed reality, they might also host live performances.
AI-Powered Superstars
So, while that may give us mere mortals a chance to live out our dreams of becoming synthetic pop stars, what about actual artists who already have the technical skills to create music but want to supercharge them with AI?
Kenny illustrates the potential here with an example from the past—when Bob Dylan famously went against convention by playing an electric guitar at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. For his attempts to innovate, he was jeered and booed by conventionalists. But the occasion is now celebrated as a pioneering moment in the history of popular music.
Kenny remarks that the artist's decision was contentious. By stepping away from traditional methods and embracing new technology, the artist yielded to the allure of innovation and creativity. This move allowed him to tap into a new genre, reach a broader audience, and employ an enhanced toolkit. It also enabled him to refine his story and musical legacy, which, according to Kenny, enriched our musical history.
The theory encapsulates Kenny’s ideas about how music—and creativity in general—will evolve as new tools and technology come onto the scene. It’s what’s happened throughout history, after all. So it makes sense that AI, perhaps the most revolutionary new “toolkit” of all time, will have a similarly transformative effect. Right?
Unintended Consequences
Of course, despite the hype, excitement and optimism, we certainly shouldn’t ignore the fact that there are many people out there who are concerned that AI might impact music and creativity in less positive ways.
This is hardly surprising as the emergence of AI, and generative AI in particular, has prompted fears ranging from a decline in demand for humans in creative jobs to a “dumbing down” effect on culture stemming from a surge of AI-generated art.
Kenny speculates that the willingness to use AI tools could be influenced by age. He references surveys indicating that younger individuals, particularly those aged 16 to 25, are more inclined to use AI as an initial point of interaction to understand processes, such as identifying high-quality writing or determining the structure of a well-crafted song.
For those who might be hesitant, potentially from older generations, Kenny's main advice is not to shy away. Instead of fearing or avoiding the technology, he suggests embracing challenges and venturing into the unknown. By actively exploring, they can demystify AI for themselves.
He says, “Be like Bob Dylan, you know, pick up that electric guitar and plug it into your amplifier to hear what your music sounds like.”

The buzz around artificial intelligence (A.I.) continues to rise. But is that buzz translating into a huge A.I. job market? That’s a big question for software engineers, software developers, and anyone else who’s interested in how the increasing adoption of A.I. will impact the job market in the months and years to come.

For tech professionals, the future of work might involve using A.I.-based tools to generate and test code, analyze data, and even market new products. From financial services to manufacturing and retail, artificial intelligence will play an increasingly bigger role. 

Which A.I.-related jobs are generating the most job postings at the moment? According to new data on Dice.com, it’s the following: 

Some of these jobs (such as data scientist and software engineer) are increasingly A.I.-centric, hence their inclusion on the list. For example, data scientists rely on machine learning and automation to crunch through huge, sometimes messy datasets for crucial insights. Meanwhile, software development could hinge more and more on a new generation of low- and no-code tools, along with generative A.I. products that can write and debug code. 

Aside from common tech jobs increasingly depending on A.I. tools, the number of actual postings for A.I. jobs such as machine learning researcher or entry-level A.I. analyst is still relatively small, especially in comparison to well-established tech skills such as programming. As part of its monthly jobs report, CompTIA has a breakdown of the states with the most A.I.-related job postings—and the actual number is relatively miniscule even in gargantuan tech hubs:

While the number of A.I.-related jobs is small, these roles are absolutely critical to organizations that see “smart” apps and services as a vital part of their long-term roadmap. That’s one big reason why jobs that utilize A.I. skills pay so much. O’Reilly estimates the average salary of data and A.I. professionals at $146,000 per year (that’s from 2,778 respondents in the U.S. and 284 in the U.K.); salaries increased an average of 2.25 percent annually. Average compensation was highest in California ($176,000), home to big tech companies that are vacuuming up the best of the best A.I. talent out there. 

Moreover, the number of A.I.-related jobs will only rise. According to Burning Glass, for example, jobs that heavily involve machine learning (a critical subset of A.I.) are predicted to grow 76.3 percent over the next 10 years. A recent study of A.I. use-cases showed many companies using artificial intelligence and machine learning in sales, CRM, chatbots, cybersecurity, and marketing automation—all of which touch on millions of technologists’ jobs. If you’re involved in tech, chances are good you’ll use A.I. to do anything from writing code to forecasting trends to problem solving. 

In other words, keep an eye on how the artificial intelligence market evolves over the next few years. The technology could end up impacting your current job much sooner than you think. Artificial intelligence in employment is definitely here to stay.

From writing software code to optimizing business operations, generative AI is driving innovation and efficiency across the business world. This transformative technology comes with a steep learning curve for some businesses, which face a number of decisions. These include deciding whether to build or buy, gauging how much to spend, and considering generative AI trust and guardrails issue.
Generative AI creates completely new data from existing datasets. This data can be in a variety of formats, including text, images, music and even code—and it can produce results that weren’t in the original input. This versatility allows for an impressive range of creative problem-solving and efficiency-boosting applications.
Let’s look at five things every business leader needs to understand about generative AI to maximize their return on investment:
1) Generative AI is Revolutionizing Business and Job Functions
Generative AI is driving business innovation and efficiency. The technology’s ability to generate new data from an input  allows for an impressive range of applications.
Generative AI in the workplace isn’t merely about harnessing data or driving efficiency — it’s about fundamentally reshaping the approach to work. Yes, generative AI can make work faster and easier, but it also opens up entirely new possibilities for innovation and creativity.
What’s key about generative AI technology is its potential to be tailored to the needs of each business. Every business has its own unique or priority datasets.
By identifying their specific needs , businesses can use generative AI to gain a competitive edge. For instance, applied in healthcare, generative AI can help analyze patient data, create a summary of the key points, and then use this summary to draft an action plan for delivering better care.

2) Build vs. Buy
One critical business decision that enterprises face when implementing artificial intelligence is whether to build or buy the software. There are several factors to consider, including:

Unique data and domain expertise: Custom generative AI becomes valuable when businesses own unique data or specific domain expertise and aim to use  that data effectively.
Availability of talent: The skills required to build AI tools are specialized and in high demand. Enterprises need to consider whether they have access to this talent and whether they’re more familiar with open-source software or commercial offerings.
Project timeline: Building AI tools takes time. If an enterprise needs AI functionality ready quickly, buying it is the best bet. If the time frame is more flexible, building it might be the more practical option.
Integration with existing software: It’s crucial to consider whether the vendors an enterprise works with can integrate the AI tools under consideration. Understanding the organization’s procurement process and allowing enough time for it can save the project from unexpected delays.
Cost-effectiveness: While it may initially appear more affordable to develop AI tools internally, it’s essential to factor in expenses related to team building, software acquisition and long-term maintenance. If the tool serves as a crucial competitive advantage for the business, it may justify ongoing costs. However, if similar functionality is already available through a tool the company is currently paying for, it doesn’t make financial sense to build and maintain redundant software.

3) Identify the Industry Use Case
Generative AI has a wide range of applications across a variety of industries. Common ones include text generation for crafting captivating marketing copy, summarization for condensing extensive news articles and emails, and image generation for developing unique brand visuals or gaming characters.
AI-powered chatbots are enhancing customer service with intelligent, real-time responses in almost every industry, while translation capabilities are making information accessible across languages. In the coding world, generative AI boosts efficiency by dynamically generating comments and functions.
Healthcare is using generative AI to reduce drug discovery timelines. Game developers are using it to create dynamic game characters. The financial sector is using it to bolster security against transaction fraud and for algorithmic trading. Retail is using generative AI for automatic price optimization.
Businesses find success most quickly when they have an initial project that aligns with their unique needs. For help getting started, ask technology providers for examples they can share from companies with similar project requirements.

4) Investing in Generative AI
Implementing generative AI requires substantial financial investment. It involves procuring high-end infrastructure, hiring skilled talent, assembling the necessary software components and gathering the needed data.
That said, not every enterprise needs to invest in generative AI from scratch. Many are using pre-trained models, or foundation models, which are more cost-effective to train because businesses only have to augment the model with their own data and apply guardrails associated with their brand.
While the cost of implementing generative AI can be high, the investment return of increased efficiency, innovation and competitive advantage can make it worthwhile.
5) Ensuring Trust and Safety in Generative AI Models
As generative AI grows more advanced and widespread, guaranteeing the safety and responsible use of AI models becomes increasingly paramount. Large language model guardrail tools — software applications that keep generative AI models from deviating from their intended purpose — can help developers set boundaries on AI models. These can be set in three areas:

Topical guardrails: These prevent AI models from veering into undesired areas of use. For example, a customer service assistant powered by generative AI could be prevented from answering questions about the weather if that function isn’t within its designated scope.
Safety guardrails: These ensure that AI models provide accurate and appropriate responses. They can filter out unwanted language and make sure that references are made only to credible sources.
Security guardrails: These restrict the AI model’s connections to only known, safe external third-party applications.

Harnessing the Power of Enterprise Generative AI
Generative AI is poised to transform the world, offering vast opportunities for companies to innovate, improve efficiency and solve complex problems. As business leaders, understanding and using the power of generative AI will be vital to staying competitive in the rapidly evolving business landscape.
Following the five principles above will help businesses stay ahead of the curve and reap the rewards that this AI technology has to offer.

October 2, 2023 · 5 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email  October 2, 2023 · 5 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Let’s separate fact from fiction, and look to the futureA recent survey determined that a large majority of lawyers believe that generative AI can be readily applied to legal work, even if they disagree on whether it should be. But what do paralegals think? For many, the transformative nature of AI leaves some feeling uneasy. However, others see AI becoming a critical part of their professional toolkit. Jump to:  Fact: AI can augment the work of paralegals  Fact: Human expertise cannot be replaced  Fiction: Paralegals will become obsolete  Fiction: Job losses are guaranteed  Future: Lean in Fact:  AI can augment the work of paralegals  The work of paralegals can be both routine and strategic. For the most time-consuming tasks such as research, document review, and data entry, AI can be a powerful tool to get paralegals to high-value tasks faster. The payoff with AI is in volume. A paralegal is skilled at quickly analyzing a document to extract pertinent information. But when that paralegal needs to analyze a large number of documents, AI can accomplish this in minutes or seconds.  Few paralegals complain of a lack of work to fill their day – just the opposite is true. So, when AI can handle routine drafting and information extraction, paralegals can focus their brainpower on legal analysis, client communication, and critical thinking.  Fact: Human expertise cannot be replaced If volume is a characteristic of artificial intelligence, nuanced decision-making is not. Its output needs a human eye to review and is most often done by paralegals. While it may extract hard-to-find cases through a prompted query, a trained professional needs to review those cases to ensure they apply to the matter at hand. Paralegals also play a nuanced role in client communication. They are often a client’s daily contact, handling sensitive and personal information. While AI can initiate and organize a client intake form, it can’t console a divorce applicant or listen to a widow describe her estate wishes. These are genuinely human interactions.    Fiction: Paralegals will become obsolete The paralegal profession has never been a static one. Prior to the mid-70s, paralegals poured through law books digging for answers to prepare legal briefs. With the introduction of Westlaw, the hours they spent in the law library were converted to higher tasks. Legal document automation tools made paralegals even more efficient by simplifying the drafting process, again, freeing time to focus on analysis and case management. In neither case were paralegals deemed obsolete. In fact, they were empowered to do more. For those who embrace it, the same can be true with artificial intelligence.  An important consideration with artificial intelligence, particularly with generative AI, is trust. Do lawyers trust its output? At this point in the development of AI, most lawyers do not. However, the trust relationship between a lawyer and a paralegal is paramount. Lawyers who depend on the accurate, relevant work a paralegal provides will want to keep that professional on their team.  Fiction: Job losses are guaranteed   That some legal positions will change, shift, or be cut may be true with the adoption of AI. That’s not a new dynamic for organizations that look to improve profits by increasing efficiency and productivity in all areas. With a service that’s based on billable hours, every gain in production helps the bottom line. However, experts do not predict that AI will cause massive layoffs of the approximately 300,000 US paralegals in the foreseeable future. As legal departments embrace the technology and learn to apply it in their legal routines, efficiency gains will be welcomed.    Future: Lean in Paralegals are often tasked with testing and evaluating new technology. They should embrace this role with generative AI. Rather than viewing it as a threat, paralegals can welcome it as a valuable assistant. The more educated paralegals are in the use of AI, the better they can take advantage of its benefits. AI will continue to get “smarter,” as data scientists further develop the technology, and users provide more experiences to train it. Paralegals can be the front line of adoption – and the lawyers they work with will benefit.  AI is not the enemy of paralegals, it’s the future.  Will AI take over lawyer jobs?Here are 3 reasons to object.Read blog post   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceBusiness DevelopmentInnovationTechnology",Organization,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,,,,,,,,,,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,"['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",,,https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,,,,http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]",http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conversation surrounding artificial intelligence in the labor market has largely focused on the workforce. In what ways might AI assist humans? Where will it increase productivity or creativity? Which jobs will it make obsolete?

This framing neglects another part of the equation, according to Yunhao Zhang, SM ’20, PhD ’23, a postdoctoral fellow at the Psychology of Technology Institute. “This is the supply side of the equation, but there has been very little discussion about the demand side,” he said. “Ultimately, the work that AI does will be judged by whether or not consumers like it.”
With this in mind, Zhang and MIT Sloan senior lecturer and research scientistRenee Richardson Gosline studied how people perceive work created by generative AI, humans, or some combination of the two. These findings are detailed in a new paper, “Human Favoritism, Not AI Aversion.”
They found that when people knew a product’s source, they expressed a positive bias toward content created by humans. Yet at the same time, and contrary to the traditional idea of “algorithmic aversion,” people expressed no aversion toward AI-generated content when they knew how it was created. In fact, when respondents were not told how content was created, they preferred AI-generated content.
For the study, the researchers created two tasks: writing marketing copy for five retail products, and drafting persuasive content for five uncontroversial campaigns (“eat less junk food,” for instance). They tackled these tasks in four different ways:
For the human-only approach, they enlisted professional content creators from Accenture Research to draft the marketing copy and campaign goals.
The augmented human approach first used AI (GPT-4) to generate ideas. Human consultants then shaped them into final products.
The augmented AI approach worked the other way, with humans creating drafts and generative AI being used to mold them into final products.
The AI-only approach had GPT-4 complete the task on its own.
Participants in the experiment were recruited to evaluate the quality of this work and were split into three groups. One group knew nothing about the content creation process. A second group knew about the four different approaches but was told nothing more. The third group knew which approach was responsible for each piece of content they viewed.
This nuanced method was essential to creating an accurate picture of the world, Gosline said. While many studies compare the work of humans against the work of AI, “in reality, our everyday experiences reflect a much more subtle gradation, where we have human decision-making shaped by algorithms or algorithms in which people are in the loop,” she said. “We wanted to get a fine-grained understanding of the various ways in which humans and AI can collaborate and, from that, get a better sense of what kinds of biases people hold.”
Two key insights emerged. First, when people had no information about the source of the marketing or campaign copy, they preferred the results generated by AI. “Generative AI is showing that it can be as good as or better than humans at these kinds of persuasive tasks,” Zhang said.

But when people were told the source of the content, their estimation of work in which humans were involved went up — they expressed “human favoritism,” as the researchers put it. Their assessment of content created by AI, though, didn’t change, undermining the notion that people harbor a form of algorithmic aversion.
“The most direct implication is that consumers really don’t mind content that’s produced by AI. They’re generally OK with it,” Zhang said. “At the same time, there’s great benefit in knowing that humans are involved somewhere along the line — that their fingerprint is present. Companies shouldn’t be looking to fully automate people out of the process.”
These findings should encourage firms to run genuine experiments on consumer perceptions of AI, the researchers said. Had Zhang and Gosline simply surveyed people about their thoughts, “they may have said something very different than what we actually observed,” Gosline said. These experiments provide a much clearer understanding of actual behavior.
This research also applies to an ever broadening part of the market as generative AI becomes increasingly easy to access and apply.
With the 2024 U.S. presidential election on the horizon, “questions of political persuasion feel very relevant, but so do applications in education, marketing, medicine, and so on,” Gosline said. “If you ask in what area information like this would be relevant, I would say I’m hard-pressed to think of an area that isn’t touched by this kind of thing. We ought to try to understand as much as we can about the ways people think about AI, given how quickly everything is moving.”

Drafting answers to hundreds of dull questions posed by a prospective customer’s request for proposals? That’s just drudgery. Mercifully for workers, after months of speculation about ChatGPT-style AI taking over white-collar work, the corporate chore of responding to RFPs is one of the first that generative AI is disrupting.In April, communications software maker Twilio introduced RFP Genie, a generative AI tool that digests an RFP, scours thousands of internal files for relevant information, and uses OpenAI’s GPT-4 to generate a suitable response. The company’s sales staff simply copy and paste the text over into a formal document and make a few adjustments.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTRFPs that once occupied a pair of staffers for two weeks or more are now done in minutes. Twilio, whose cloud tools enable companies to chat with customers, expects to be able to make more and better sales pitches, and isn’t planning job cuts. “This will free up our solutions engineers to focus on more complex problems that demand not just reasoning, but human contextualization,” says Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson of the RFP bot, which has not previously been reported.Featured VideoChatGPT Answers the Web's Most Searched QuestionsLawson’s sales team isn’t the only one enjoying a sudden windfall of free time. Generative AI RFP response bots also have launched for sales teams at Google’s cloud unit, ad-buying agency EssenceMediacom, and DataRobot, a startup developing software to manage AI programs. In August at IBM, an RFP bot was selected by CEO Arvind Krishna as the winner of an internal AI hackathon called the Watsonx challenge, beating a field of over 12,000 entries. It used a large language model from IBM’s Watsonx.ai service to write answers in a tenth of the time compared to solely by hand, and the company is studying how to adopt the system. Consulting giants such as Bain and Deloitte have been pitching clients on the RFP idea, and makers of RFP management software are trying to build in generative AI.Google expects its AI RFP tool to save its salespeople tens of thousands of hours annuallyRFPs with tedious questions asking for information such as a cloud service’s uptime or its support for multifactor authentication are an unavoidable stage in all sorts of sales processes, from software deals to light bulbs. Customers get a book of jargon, statistics, and promises to justify an eventual purchase and use in any future dispute. But no one enjoys writing or answering the questions, which in tech pulls top engineers away from more important projects. Everyone involved openly jokes—or perhaps secretly fears—that no one reads the responses before tapping the Buy button anyway.Generative AI’s arrival has brought welcome relief to many workers trapped in RFP hell—and potentially offers a counterpoint to the anxiety that AI writers will replace humans. At the same time it’s prompting questions over how much longer humans will be involved in some business admin practices. As more RFP responses are crafted by AI, bots will inevitably start writing the questions too. Before long, other bots may be scoring proposals and recommending winners, leaving humans to just do a brief double check. “The AI RFP is a baby step toward replacing the RFP with something better,” says Peter Bonney, CEO of Vendorful, which recently started selling a tool similar to that used inside Twilio.Ask the GenieWhen Lawson laid off 11 percent of Twilio’s several thousand employees in September 2022 and an additional 17 percent in February, he said the company had to become more efficient. Generative AI is a central pillar of his plan to boost productivity. He started toying with the technology during nights and weekends in 2020, using text generators to brainstorm and to compile silly dinner recipes. When OpenAI began selling access to GPT-4, the large language model powering the paid version of ChatGPT, Lawson asked his staff to work on tools to streamline Twilio’s operations.To create the RFP bot, a handful of data scientists and a solutions engineer at Twilio began experimenting with augmenting GPT-4’s inherent vocabulary, which comes from scraping the text of websites and books. They devised a method that pairs a program that retrieves snippets relevant to the questions in an RFP from technical documentation and other sources inside in the company with a system that directs GPT-4 to summarize those snippets in a clear and professional tone. GPT-4 proved capable of generating extremely accurate responses—though solutions engineers and technical experts still review or edit every answer before sending them off to a prospective client.The tech industry has begun calling systems like Twilio’s retrieval augmented generation, or RAG. Browse, a new option in paid ChatGPT, functions similarly by summarizing search results from Microsoft Bing to help answer users’ questions. It cuts down on large language models’ so-called hallucinations, where they make up information when there are gaps in their knowledge. Jay Schuren, chief customer officer at DataRobot, compares RAG to handing someone a cue card with some facts listed and asking them to make a speech. “The language model tells a coherent story, but it sticks to the script,” he says. The RAG approach is also, in many cases, much cheaper than training or fine-tuning a large language model to a specific task.I don't have personal preferences or feelingsTwilio's bot for responding to RFPs sticks to businessTwilio’s RFP Genie, as it’s unofficially known internally, operates globally and in multiple languages. Account executives can now solicit more business because they can respond to RFPs they would have previously lacked time to pick up. By Twilio’s estimate, the bot handles about 80 percent of an RFP and staff fill in the rest while reporting and categorizing their corrections. “We’re not reducing these roles, because with the time saved these teams can address more RFPs and spend more time interacting with and helping more customers than before,” company spokesperson Miya Shitama says.The company is working on having the tool automatically improve based on staffers’ edits to AI-generated answers. It also hopes to give the tool some more character. When asked by a company staffer about its favorite question to answer, the bot dryly replied, “I don't have personal preferences or feelings” before noting, “I particularly excel at answering questions related to Twilio's features, customer stories, and use cases.”Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanGearCMF's Phone 1 Is Better Than Any $199 Smartphone Should Ever BeBy Julian ChokkattuThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyPoliticsStaffers Were Told Biden Was Leaving Race in Email Telling Them to Check XBy Makena KellyTwilio developed similar chatbots—details of which could not be learned—to help other teams in its salesforce gather information about the company’s offerings. Its overall cast of chatbots answer more than 12,000 questions each month, including roughly 5,000 directed at the RFP tool, according to Shitama.Roll Your OwnDataRobot’s RFP bot lives inside Slack, where since July account executives can type tricky questions from a prospective client, like “does the product support containerization natively as a delivery capability?” From there, the bot powered by OpenAI’s technology via Microsoft’s cloud functions similarly to Twilio’s but also shows the salesperson a confidence score for every answer. “Knowing whether you can or can’t rely on the results is critical,” DataRobot’s Schuren says. In August, the company unveiled an AI platform that enables customers to build their own responder for RFPs.Google Cloud began working on its RFP bot earlier this year after Phil Moyer, global vice president of its AI business, recognized the tool as a perfect first use of generative AI. “We must get asked a hundred times a month, ‘How do we adhere to GDPR?’” he says, referring to the European Union’s massive privacy law. Automating responses spares talented workers from drudgery, he says. Google has just begun rolling out the RFP tool to its salespeople and expects to save tens of thousands of hours of labor annually. In July, ad buying agency EssenceMediacom introduced its own version using Google Cloud technology.AdvertisementTackling RFPs is seen as a low-risk use case for generative AI at many companies, which have been automating parts of the process for years. Some companies use systems that pluck relevant responses from a pool of thousands of pre-written answers. Secureframe, a major developer of software for buying security tools, offers a product to do that but is planning to add generative AI. The technology should perform well enough that it seems like “your security team is actually answering the questions,” says Ruoting Sun, vice president of product at Secureframe.So far, AI-generated responses appear to be passing muster—and perhaps passing as human-written. Executives who review RFP submissions at four big companies from different industries told WIRED they have not noticed any that appeared to be written by generative AI. “To be honest, I hadn’t thought about it. I may have,” says Michael Schlosser, senior vice president for care transformation and innovation at US hospital giant HCA Healthcare.As RFP bots help sales teams get more done, executives like Schlosser can probably expect their own workload to rise. Smaller companies are pitching for opportunities they had never considered before because of limited staff, says Mac Liu, CEO at Vultron, which helps companies automate bidding for government contracts. Generative AI is enabling “a whole new set of products and solutions to work with the government,” Liu says.Bonney, at the startup Vendorful, still has nightmares about a 700-question RFP that he filled out several years ago, stuffed with queries that were outdated in the cloud computing era. Halfway in, Bonney’s cofounder turned to him looking deflated and said, ""We're not going to win this, but we're too far in to stop."" Buyers are scared to prune back their questions, Bonney says, fearing they will remove something that proves crucial later.He now dreams of focusing on the more complex and rewarding work of solving sales prospects’ problems, while bots swap information about buyers’ priorities and vendors’ capabilities. Bonney recently got a glimpse toward that possibility when a questionnaire came in that he suspected had been generated by ChatGPT, based on its length, topics, and tone. “And guess what?” he says. “We responded with our own AI.”WIRED has teamed up with Jobbio to create WIRED Hired, a dedicated career marketplace for WIRED readers.

When OpenAI began selling access to GPT-4, the large language model powering the paid version of ChatGPT, Lawson asked his staff to work on tools to streamline Twilio’s operations.
To create the RFP bot, a handful of data scientists and a solutions engineer at Twilio began experimenting with augmenting GPT-4’s inherent vocabulary, which comes from scraping the text of websites and books. They devised a method that pairs a program that retrieves snippets relevant to the questions in an RFP from technical documentation and other sources inside in the company with a system that directs GPT-4 to summarize those snippets in a clear and professional tone. GPT-4 proved capable of generating extremely accurate responses—though solutions engineers and technical experts still review or edit every answer before sending them off to a prospective client.
The tech industry has begun calling systems like Twilio’s retrieval augmented generation, or RAG. Browse, a new option in paid ChatGPT, functions similarly by summarizing search results from Microsoft Bing to help answer users’ questions. It cuts down on large language models’ so-called hallucinations, where they make up information when there are gaps in their knowledge. Jay Schuren, chief customer officer at DataRobot, compares RAG to handing someone a cue card with some facts listed and asking them to make a speech. “The language model tells a coherent story, but it sticks to the script,” he says. The RAG approach is also, in many cases, much cheaper than training or fine-tuning a large language model to a specific task.
Twilio’s RFP Genie, as it’s unofficially known internally, operates globally and in multiple languages. Account executives can now solicit more business because they can respond to RFPs they would have previously lacked time to pick up. By Twilio’s estimate, the bot handles about 80 percent of an RFP and staff fill in the rest while reporting and categorizing their corrections. “We’re not reducing these roles, because with the time saved these teams can address more RFPs and spend more time interacting with and helping more customers than before,” company spokesperson Miya Shitama says.
The company is working on having the tool automatically improve based on staffers’ edits to AI-generated answers. It also hopes to give the tool some more character. When asked by a company staffer about its favorite question to answer, the bot dryly replied, “I don't have personal preferences or feelings” before noting, “I particularly excel at answering questions related to Twilio's features, customer stories, and use cases.”
Twilio developed similar chatbots—details of which could not be learned—to help other teams in its salesforce gather information about the company’s offerings. Its overall cast of chatbots answer more than 12,000 questions each month, including roughly 5,000 directed at the RFP tool, according to Shitama.
Roll Your Own
DataRobot’s RFP bot lives inside Slack, where since July account executives can type tricky questions from a prospective client, like “does the product support containerization natively as a delivery capability?” From there, the bot powered by OpenAI’s technology via Microsoft’s cloud functions similarly to Twilio’s but also shows the salesperson a confidence score for every answer. “Knowing whether you can or can’t rely on the results is critical,” DataRobot’s Schuren says. In August, the company unveiled an AI platform that enables customers to build their own responder for RFPs.
Google Cloud began working on its RFP bot earlier this year after Phil Moyer, global vice president of its AI business, recognized the tool as a perfect first use of generative AI. “We must get asked a hundred times a month, ‘How do we adhere to GDPR?’” he says, referring to the European Union’s massive privacy law. Automating responses spares talented workers from drudgery, he says. Google has just begun rolling out the RFP tool to its salespeople and expects to save tens of thousands of hours of labor annually. In July, ad buying agency EssenceMediacom introduced its own version using Google Cloud technology.
Tackling RFPs is seen as a low-risk use case for generative AI at many companies, which have been automating parts of the process for years. Some companies use systems that pluck relevant responses from a pool of thousands of pre-written answers. Secureframe, a major developer of software for buying security tools, offers a product to do that but is planning to add generative AI. The technology should perform well enough that it seems like “your security team is actually answering the questions,” says Ruoting Sun, vice president of product at Secureframe.
So far, AI-generated responses appear to be passing muster—and perhaps passing as human-written. Executives who review RFP submissions at four big companies from different industries told WIRED they have not noticed any that appeared to be written by generative AI. “To be honest, I hadn’t thought about it. I may have,” says Michael Schlosser, senior vice president for care transformation and innovation at US hospital giant HCA Healthcare.
As RFP bots help sales teams get more done, executives like Schlosser can probably expect their own workload to rise. Smaller companies are pitching for opportunities they had never considered before because of limited staff, says Mac Liu, CEO at Vultron, which helps companies automate bidding for government contracts. Generative AI is enabling “a whole new set of products and solutions to work with the government,” Liu says.
Bonney, at the startup Vendorful, still has nightmares about a 700-question RFP that he filled out several years ago, stuffed with queries that were outdated in the cloud computing era. Halfway in, Bonney’s cofounder turned to him looking deflated and said, ""We're not going to win this, but we're too far in to stop."" Buyers are scared to prune back their questions, Bonney says, fearing they will remove something that proves crucial later.
He now dreams of focusing on the more complex and rewarding work of solving sales prospects’ problems, while bots swap information about buyers’ priorities and vendors’ capabilities. Bonney recently got a glimpse toward that possibility when a questionnaire came in that he suspected had been generated by ChatGPT, based on its length, topics, and tone. “And guess what?” he says. “We responded with our own AI.”

Source: Getty.October 2, 2023ShareSave Late last month, after a year-plus wait, OpenAI quietly released the latest version of its image-generating AI program, DALL-E 3. The announcement was filled with stunning demos—including a minute-long video demonstrating how the technology could, given only a few chat prompts, create and merchandise a character for a children’s story. But perhaps the widest-reaching and most consequential update came in two sentences slipped in at the end: “DALL-E 3 is designed to decline requests that ask for an image in the style of a living artist. Creators can now also opt their images out from training of our future image generation models.”The language is a tacit response to hundreds of pages of litigation and countless articles accusing tech firms of stealing artists’ work to train their AI software, and provides a window into the next stage of the battle between creators and AI companies. The second sentence, in particular, cuts to the core of debates over whether tech giants like OpenAI, Google, and Meta should be allowed to use human-made work to train AI models without the creator’s permission—models that, artists say, are stealing their ideas and work opportunities.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

Generative AI is reshaping the enterprise technology estate, sparking discussions around adoption strategy, raising architectural issues and pushing IT leadership in new directions.







Those shifts are happening at shocking speed. While cloud computing adoption unfolded at a brisk pace, the uptake of generative AI is still happening faster. Most organizations are either evaluating or actively deploying the technology, which became readily accessible starting in late 2022.
An August 2023 report from TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group found 54% of the 600-plus organizations it polled will have adopted generative AI in the next 12 months. Likewise, 59% of business executives PwC surveyed cited ""embedding new technologies in their business model"" as the No. 1 strategic priority over the next three to five years; 46% of the respondents specifically identified generative AI.
""With generative AI, this is something that's brand new,"" said Neil Dhar, U.S. vice chair and consulting co-leader at PwC, speaking at an online presentation. ""Every company in every sector is doing an inward analysis of how generative AI impacts their companies. It's clear that no one has run away from the pack here. And we're all figuring this out together, including ourselves.""

GenAI and adoption strategies

Make vs. buy
Walmart, which tops the Fortune 500 list with more than $600 billion in revenue, is among the enterprises navigating generative AI. The retailer launched a GenAI Playground in June and released a generative AI tool, My Assistant, to some 50,000 campus associates in August.
David Glick, senior vice president of enterprise business services at Walmart, views generative AI as a ""transformative technology."" Its sudden arrival prompted a make-versus-buy decision at the retailer. Walmart has traditionally been a buy shop but shifted to making its own technology with the arrival of CTO Suresh Kumar in 2019. The company's GoLocal service delivery platform and relaunch of Walmart.com's digital storefront were both in-house efforts, for example.
Generative AI, however, calls for a best-of-both-worlds approach, according to Glick. The plan: Use the best of the available large language models (LLMs) and add its own customization layer.
""It's hard to train the LLM from the ground up,"" he said, noting that OpenAI and other companies in the AI sector have already done the foundational work.
""If they can do all the heavy lifting and the plumbing and the scaffolding, and we can build things that delight our customers -- either associate customers or [external] customers -- I think that's the sweet spot for us,"" Glick said.



More than half of the business and technology executives surveyed will have adopted generative AI within 12 months.





Walmart aims to add its own data to fine tune the tech providers' LLMs. Glick pointed to the company's internal benefits help desk and its 300-page benefits guide, which agents may struggle to memorize. Incorporating that document into an LLM could augment a help desk agent's employee interactions, boosting efficiency and increasing accuracy.
This buy-and-customize method tracks with how the company has tailored ERP and HR products to suit its needs, Glick noted.
Industry executives anticipate most enterprises will follow the route of tuning publicly available LLMs rather than building their own.
""I think the level of effort and scale that it takes to build those becomes cost prohibitive, and there's already so much innovation going on,"" said Merim Becirovic, global CTO of Accenture's IT organization.
Vikrant Karnik, cloud and technology services leader at Genpact, a professional services firm based in New York, said the meteoric rise of generative AI has captivated corporate boards and sparked discussions on whether it's better to build AI infrastructure or tap what's available. The latter choice is winning out, even among organizations pushing generative AI's cutting edge -- about 5% of Genpact's customer base.
""Even in those cases, they are depending on models that already exist,"" Karnik said.



Enterprises see generative AI influencing their operations with the cloud serving as an onramp.





The case for speed
While emerging technologies often inspire caution and gradual adoption, industry executives believe speed is important when it comes to generative AI.
""I think now is the time and we all know that we have to experiment, we have to pilot,"" said Chris Bedi, chief digital information officer at ServiceNow. ""The sooner we get started on it, the sooner we're going to realize material business outcomes from it. Waiting on the sidelines for this one, which is what a lot of people did -- and maybe rightfully, with things like the metaverse and blockchain -- doesn't feel like the right answer.""
The difference between those other hot-then-not technologies and generative AI revolves around the latter's obvious and plentiful practical applications.
""I think blockchain and metaverse often became a solution in search of a problem versus generative AI, where use cases just jump off the page,"" Bedi said.
ServiceNow, which is creating its own generative AI models, has deployed the technology in a dozen in-house use cases.
Key use cases include those that simplify the task of finding information. ServiceNow houses much content in several different places.
""We have knowledge bases,"" Bedi said. ""Many companies around the world have invested in knowledge bases and content stores. It's still hard to find stuff.""
Generative AI, however, makes it possible to focus on content ""in a very human-readily way and not get a 10-page document but the one paragraph you are interested in,"" he added.


Generative AI in the IT shop
Generative AI can support a wide range of enterprise functions, including IT.
Bedi cited developer productivity as one immediate opportunity for generative AI within the technology function. ""How much more can you increase developer productivity -- which, by the way, is the labor pool that's the hardest to find,"" he said.
ServiceNow found its internal use of text-to-code technology has resulted in about a 20% productivity improvement among its software engineers. Bedi said this use of generative AI raises budgeting questions: For example, if the IT department had planned to write 1 million story points of code in 2024, will it now aim, with generative AI, to write 1.2 million story points of code with the same number of developers or generate that amount of code with 20% fewer developers?


Becirovic also supports rapid adoption of generative AI.
""I think speed is paramount,"" he said. ""I'm a big fan of hands-on-keyboard, as fast as possible, because it gives people perspective and understanding. They're not spending years analyzing.""
Becirovic also advocated for speed in cloud adoption, helping quickly grow the technology's penetration at Accenture. He believes widespread cloud deployment will now facilitate fast-paced generative AI uptake. Generative AI services live in the cloud. Cloud qualities such as elasticity and rapid innovation play into the new capabilities arising from generative AI, he noted.
""Cloud is a high-performance engine, and generative AI is your gas pedal,"" Becirovic said.
A September 2023 report from HCLTech, a technology company offering digital business services, provides another data point. Of the 500 business and technology leaders it surveyed, 85% said they recognized ""the cloud's role in enabling generative AI and agree it can only be deployed with the right cloud strategy.""

GenAI and IT architecture
New patterns ahead
Enterprises opting for existing models in their accelerated pursuit of generative must determine how best to access such offerings.
Becirovic framed the question as, ""How can they make sure they've got the right architecture patterns internally to connect with and consume all the different components and services?""
Organizations must decide how to consume a service and make it available in a centralized catalog for companywide availability, he noted. Other service considerations include privacy, security, cost and internal use. He said the overarching task of understanding a service may be viewed as a certification process or governance certification.
""Every organization should be thinking about [certification] in this new world,"" Becirovic said. ""Because today's the slowest day it's ever going to be. There's only going to be more services, more capability.""
Decisions on architecture patterns stem from the certification process, he added. At this point, business and technology leaders decide where generative AI will fit in their organizations -- employee enablement, infrastructure automation or help desk operations, for example.
Structuring for scale
At ServiceNow, Bedi said his last quarterly business review covered the AI architecture topic.
""We actually spent a chunk of time on what is our AI architecture, including generative,"" he said. ""What does that look like? What's the same, and what's different?""
Bedi said the meeting also brought up the need for a concept of ""LLMOps"" along the lines of machine learning operations. MLOps provides practices and tools for managing machine learning in organizations.
Interaction among LLMs is another aspect of creating an architecture.
""You're going to think about having large language models talk to other large language models directly,"" Bedi said. ""What does that architecture look like? What does that security look like? What does that data protection look like?""
As for AI governance, technology adopters need to consider issues such as model drift and bias, he noted. In Bedi's opinion, organizations don't have to dig into architecture and governance as they experiment with generative AI. But those elements will become necessary when it's time to expand beyond pilots.
""If you're preparing to go from experiment to scale pretty quickly, you're looking at the architecture. There are a few building blocks that have to go in place; LLMOps [is] one of them,"" he said.


Cloud providers vie to build AI infrastructure
Cloud providers are bulking up their AI infrastructures to deliver advanced compute for customers.
Forrester Research's ""The Future of Cloud"" report, published in July 2023, cited that trend as the ""next horizon of innovation"" for cloud platforms moving beyond commodity infrastructure. Hyperscalers are competing to scale their pricier AI infrastructures, Forrester Research reported, with high-performance computing (HPC) workloads becoming a priority.
""HPC will be part of a broader push around specialized workloads,"" said Lee Sustar, an analyst at Forrester Research.
Cloud providers are putting considerable effort into acquiring GPUs to run those workloads, he noted. In addition, hyperscalers are working to ensure they can deliver specialized services in the regions customers request while also meeting country-specific data sovereignty requirements. He said the task is more challenging for cloud providers than delivering more generalized x86 or Arm-based workloads.




GenAI and IT leadership
Enabling business users
While IT leaders puzzle over how to harness generative AI, they have also begun to think about how their roles might change because of the technology.
Keyur Ajmera, CIO at ICIMS, a talent acquisition platform company, envisions a ""shift up"" approach when it comes to managing enterprise IT. Where the concept of shifting left refers to moving technology closer to external customers, shifting up brings technology closer to internal business users, he said.
Emerging technologies such as generative AI will provide a catalyst.
""Generative AI is a game changer, as more vendors come out with their own versions of [Microsoft] Copilot or embedded generative AI capabilities,"" Ajmera said. ""These will be enabling technologies that business users and anyone in the organization can leverage to drive a lot of the technical innovation for the company. That frees up tech and IT teams to focus on governance, security, frameworks and establishing a really good cadence around how you use technology.""
Essentially, shifting up changes the IT department's role from doing things for users to enabling them to take on more technical tasks. At ICIMS, Ajmera began exploring this approach in data and analytics, which are among the IT fields where tech talent is hard to find.
""I can't hire 30 business intelligence analysts,"" Ajmera said. ""But what I can do is train up various operations folks and folks within the business who have technology savvy to effectively do some of this work.""
Shifting up lets the business side take control of activities such as creating data visualizations -- without depending on IT, he noted.
Karnik said the trend toward pushing more technology power to business users has been going on for a while, citing visualization and low-code/no-code platforms as examples.
""That process was already happening,"" he said. ""Generative AI is just one more step in that process.""
Karnik doesn't anticipate the IT department evolving into a strictly governance function that hands out tools to business users. Security and data protection will remain a critical function, he said, citing the potential for data leakage. Users must enter data to obtain insight from a generative AI tool. But if they provide sensitive data, they could be giving away an organization's proprietary knowledge.
It's up to tech leaders to inform business users on how to properly use generative AI, according to Karnik. ""The responsibility of the IT department becomes heightened and sharpened.""
Widening the scope of responsibility
That responsibility also becomes highly distributed, as the effects of generative AI ripple across enterprises.
""We're created a generative AI roadmap for each department in the company,"" Bedi noted.
He's worked with ServiceNow's HR leadership to consider how generative AI could reimagine the recruiting functions. ""It's everything from improving job descriptions to generating tailored interview guides,"" he noted.
Marketing is exploring how generative AI could provide intelligence that might have taken hours for people calling on customers to collate on their own. In cybersecurity, generative AI could scan through event logs to ""find the needles in the haystack,"" Bedi said.
The application of generative AI could see a dual role in the CFO's office. On the one hand, the task is determining what can generative AI do for the finance function, ""but it's also, 'How do we think about bending the cost curve in certain departments?'"" he added.
Ajmera also pointed to the CIO's broad responsibility for generative AI diffusion. He believes gaps could emerge within organizations, as some pockets of employees engage with generative AI and others don't.
""It's up to every CIO to bring the organization along on this journey,"" he said.

Published: 03 Oct 2023


 
SAP SuccessFactors and Ceridian are holding user conferences this week, and like the just-concluded Workday conference, generative AI will be a topic of discussion. Coming into sharp focus among HR vendors is how they plan to use the technology.







Over the next 12 months, major HR vendors are planning to release generative AI-based tools to make HR applications more conversational. Features will include summarizing and creating content, such as writing job descriptions; helping conduct performance reviews; and personalizing learning materials.
As SAP illustrated last week with a planned product, conversational user interfaces will be one of the most noticeable changes ushered in by generative AI.
SAP SuccessConnect conference attendees will likely hear about Joule, a generative AI assistant that will act as a conversational AI interface. Joule will be integrated into SAP's cloud product portfolio, including SuccessFactors, and will pull enterprise data to answer plain-language queries as well as suggest ways to improve or fix something. SAP has yet to roll out Joule but said it plans to start with SuccessFactors later this year.
Similar to SAP, Workday is planning conversational AI interfaces. Oracle has outlined generative AI plans, as has UKG. Ceridian will outline its plans at its Insights conference, which started Monday.
In detailing Joule, SAP said generative AI is past its initial hype, a comment asserted by other HR vendors.
Generative AI is ""one of the biggest technology changes we've seen in our industry in my lifetime,"" said Joe Korngiebel, Ceridian's chief product and technology officer. ""It's rival to the cloud and the push to the cloud; it's rival to the PC era.""
There have been many ""big shifts"" in technology, ""but this one is different,"" said Aneel Bhusri, co-founder and co-CEO of Workday. He told attendees at last week's Workday Rising that AI ""certainly feels like the most important shift since the emergence of the cloud.""



A look at generative AI functionality in HR.






Deliver unexpected results
Sayan Chakraborty, Workday co-president who leads its product and technology organization, told Rising attendees that generative AI can deliver unexpected results and have conversations ""that feel very natural, unlike previous AI-powered assistants.""



Generative AI is one of the biggest technology changes we've seen in our industry in my lifetime.


Joe KorngiebelChief product and technology officer, Ceridian




""This is truly a moment that we'll remember with a before-and-after,"" Chakraborty said, comparing it to the arrival of the smartphone, cloud computing and even electricity.
The vendors contend generative AI will increase productivity, but they make the claim before the technology has been deployed. That may be why Workday invited Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist and director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, to present at its user conference.
Brynjolfsson was one of the researchers who looked at generative AI's use in a system used by 5,000 call center agents.
The study found that the ""least experienced operators got the biggest benefit,"" with a 35% gain in productivity in two to three months, Brynjolfsson said at Workday's conference. But most skilled workers ""didn't get nearly as big a benefit as the less-skilled workers because most of them already knew how to solve the problem,"" he said.

Asana Intelligence, powered by the Work Graph®, drives greater clarity, impact, and scale for executives, departments, and entire organizations

 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 3, 2023--
Today Asana, Inc. (NYSE: ASAN) (LTSE: ASAN), a leading enterprise work management solution, announced new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that drive greater clarity, impact, and scale for executives, departments, and entire organizations. Through Asana’s Work Graph®, these new enterprise-grade AI capabilities empower leaders to steer their organizations toward reaching goals and driving outcomes faster.



“We stand at the precipice of a new golden age of innovation, where humans and AI together can achieve more than ever,” says Dustin Moskovitz, Asana CEO. “Yet, so many leaders still find themselves without the right tools to save time and resources, drive impact, and hit their goals. With our new AI capabilities – powered by Asana’s Work Graph – our customers can now harness AI at work to drive greater clarity and accountability, and maximize impact at scale. Asana brings AI and human innovation together to help leaders understand how work gets done within their organizations in real-time and find ways to work more efficiently.”


Asana’s latest AI innovations offer leaders:



A smarter way to maximize impact



(Starting today) Smart fields: Organize projects to support cross-functional collaboration with auto-generated custom fields.



(Starting today) Smart editor: Write clearer, more compelling drafts that strike the appropriate tone (for example, polite vs. direct or concise vs. detailed).



(Starting today) Smart summaries: Surface highlights from task descriptions and comments, along with key action items. In the future, make video calls actionable by turning meeting transcripts from calls into summaries and action items.



(What’s ahead) Smart workflows: Create workflows with simple, natural language instructions that are optimized over time to match specific goals and best practices.



(What’s ahead) Smart digests: See project updates with a feed that tracks recent changes or what may require priority attention.




A smarter way to drive clarity and accountability



(Winter 2023) Smart status: Create more comprehensive status updates faster with AI, pulling from real-time work data to identify risks, open questions, and roadblocks standing in the way of hitting goals.



(Winter 2023) Smart answers: Use natural language to ask Asana questions, and get timely answers and insights about projects, identify blockers, and determine next steps.



(Summer 2024) Smart goals: Write more effective goals by starting with a plain description of what to achieve and let AI draft it based on previous goals and performance.



(What’s ahead) Smart planning: Visualize potential outcomes with scenario planning based on timelines, resource allocations, and approved budgets.



(What’s ahead) Smart workload: Monitor and adjust team resourcing based on historical and future capacity to meet changing goals.




A smarter way to scale



(What’s ahead) Smart search: Use natural language to search and pull relevant information from Asana’s Work Graph data (for example, “show tasks assigned to me in the last month”).



Asana AI Technology Partner network: Leverage leading foundation models from OpenAI and Anthropic, tailored for the enterprise in a trusted, secure, and ethical way. Asana also integrates with services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) AppFabric to improve collaboration at scale.



Asana AI Channel Partner network: Support customers at scale in AI implementation through leading global solutions and systems integrator experts, like Slalom, CPrime, and West Monroe.



Enterprise security & control: Keep data safe, secure, and compliant with enterprise-grade security and permissions, while providing admins with controls over the role of AI at work.




Asana’s new AI capabilities are designed to help entire organizations – individuals, departments, and leaders – work smarter and drive outcomes faster. From marketing executives wanting to drive clarity around annual planning and goals; to operations leaders looking to maximize impact by scaling strategic initiatives across departments; and IT executives eager to standardize work management on one enterprise-grade platform that is trusted, secure, and uses AI in a transparent way, Asana’s new AI capabilities help enterprises around the world work smarter.



“At IPG Mediabrands, we use technology to empower all 18,000 of our employees across more than 130 countries. Asana has been instrumental in helping our teams work smarter,” says Jarrod Martin, CEO at KINESSO (IPG Mediabrands’ global performance marketing agency). “It has freed up time for employees to focus on innovation and strategic thinking, helped us understand where our processes can be improved, and reduced the amount of joyless work we do – the work that impacts our bottom line and the happiness of our people and clients. We are excited by the potential of AI to further reduce joyless work and enhance productivity.”


Asana’s Work Innovation Score


Asana also launched The Work Innovation Score, a proprietary, first-of-its-kind AI-driven benchmark developed by its Work Innovation Lab. The Work Innovation Score, which is now available to Asana’s enterprise customers, enables companies to benchmark their performance against industry peers across four key metrics: cohesion (how well employees work together), velocity (how quickly work moves forward), resilience (stability during employee turnover), and capacity (employee bandwidth). The Work Innovation Score shows how effectively teams are working together within an organization and suggests ways to improve collaboration, accelerate productivity, maximize employee impact, and increase competitive advantage. Developed by industry-leading experts on the science of work, the score is powered by Asana’s Work Graph®, state-of-the-art neural networks, and predictive AI. Because the Work Graph connects data across the whole enterprise – work, functions, teams, and people – Asana’s Work Innovation Score is uniquely able to assess innovation potential.



“Asana’s Work Innovation Score provides a lens into how teams work together, predicting challenges in how employees are collaborating in order to proactively address them. At AWS and through our joint research with Asana’s Work Innovation Lab, we’ve seen that employees are struggling with ‘collaboration overload,’ which comes at the cost of productivity,” says Federico Torreti, head of product for AWS AppFabric at AWS. “With The Work Innovation Score and services like AWS AppFabric—which connects multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications for better security, management, and productivity—companies have new visibility into how to streamline collaboration and productivity to drive employee impact and gain a competitive advantage.”

Artificial intelligence has helped some people in their roles at work. 
The chief economist of LinkedIn said employers want people to be AI literate, not necessarily experts.
Other experts told Insider it's important to embrace the technology as it becomes more pervasive.

Employers want their employees to know how to use artificial intelligence. Since ChatGPT took the web by storm last year, the pervasiveness of AI has ballooned as a pop culture fascination and a powerful workplace tool. Financial markets, too, have taken notice, with mentions of AI on earnings calls surging 366% from this year's first quarter to the second quarter, according to a study by WallStreetZen.

Karin Kimbrough, chief economist of LinkedIn, said at a fireside chat on Monday that there's not a lot of job talent who are considered AI proficient.""It's not that employers want everyone to become an AI expert,"" Kimbrough said at the event. ""They just want people to become AI literate.""

Kimbrough told Insider in an interview that AI literacy means ""the ability to make use of tools to help you do your job better.""That could mean ""shedding some of the routine tasks that prevent you from doing more interesting work,"" she said, or it could mean using generative AI to help with summarizing information. It could also mean understanding when human judgment should come into play, she said.Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, said this week companies must lean into the technology or risk getting left behind. To that point, Sinclair Schuller, the co-founder of Nuvalence, a consulting firm that uses generative AI, said the nascent technology is on the fast-track to widespread adoption in the workplace. Hiring managers and bosses across sectors, he told Insider, are going to soon expect employees to embrace it.

""The bottom line is that having an AI-centric mindset — by considering AI as a collaborator, and hiring and upskilling accordingly — is the key to getting the most value out of these tools,"" Schuller said.But even as employers rush to adopt AI tool, there are deep concerns over the impact AI might ultimately have on society. An analysis from Pew Research Center said 52% of US adults are feeling ""more concerned than excited about the increased use of artificial intelligence"" based on a survey done this past summer.

A 2022 survey from Pew shows mixed results from US workers on whether they think AI will help or hurt them in the workplace over the next 20 years. ""I think the biggest shift for I think people in thinking about the impact on jobs of generative AI compared to all of the other AI that exists is that it is primarily people who thought their jobs were safer from AI that are more anxious today than ever before,"" Chris Hyams, chief executive officer of Indeed, told Insider.

Over the last year, the labor market has remained surprisingly resilient amid the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. Unemployment held steady at 3.8% in September, and there were still about 1.5 job openings per unemployed person as of August. Hyams said the jobs where face-to-face interaction isn't needed or where a worker doesn't have to engage in much physical activity, for instance, are the ones where artificial intelligence and especially generative AI are ""capable of doing a larger part of the job that you're doing right now."" He clarified that this doesn't mean these jobs are necessarily more likely to vanish, but they could be susceptible to big changes.""Imagine having unlimited, on-demand access to nearly infinite business knowledge,"" Schuller added. ""Your team could use it to do anything from automating mundane tasks to streamlining processes, even developing new, intelligent insights. Used in the right way, AI could enable a 500-person company to achieve the output of 1000 employees.""

Financial markets, too, have taken notice, with mentions of AI on earnings calls surging 366% from this year's first quarter to the second quarter, according to a study by WallStreetZen. Karin Kimbrough, chief economist of LinkedIn, said at a fireside chat on Monday that there's not a lot of job talent who are considered AI proficient.""It's not that employers want everyone to become an AI expert,"" Kimbrough said at the event. ""They just want people to become AI literate.""Kimbrough told Insider in an interview that AI literacy means ""the ability to make use of tools to help you do your job better.""That could mean ""shedding some of the routine tasks that prevent you from doing more interesting work,"" she said, or it could mean using generative AI to help with summarizing information. It could also mean understanding when human judgment should come into play, she said.Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, said this week companies must lean into the technology or risk getting left behind. To that point, Sinclair Schuller, the co-founder of Nuvalence, a consulting firm that uses generative AI, said the nascent technology is on the fast-track to widespread adoption in the workplace. Hiring managers and bosses across sectors, he told Insider, are going to soon expect employees to embrace it. ""The bottom line is that having an AI-centric mindset — by considering AI as a collaborator, and hiring and upskilling accordingly — is the key to getting the most value out of these tools,"" Schuller said.But even as employers rush to adopt AI tool, there are deep concerns over the impact AI might ultimately have on society. An analysis from Pew Research Center said 52% of US adults are feeling ""more concerned than excited about the increased use of artificial intelligence"" based on a survey done this past summer.A 2022 survey from Pew shows mixed results from US workers on whether they think AI will help or hurt them in the workplace over the next 20 years. ""I think the biggest shift for I think people in thinking about the impact on jobs of generative AI compared to all of the other AI that exists is that it is primarily people who thought their jobs were safer from AI that are more anxious today than ever before,"" Chris Hyams, chief executive officer of Indeed, told Insider.Over the last year, the labor market has remained surprisingly resilient amid the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. Unemployment held steady at 3.8% in September, and there were still about 1.5 job openings per unemployed person as of August. Hyams said the jobs where face-to-face interaction isn't needed or where a worker doesn't have to engage in much physical activity, for instance, are the ones where artificial intelligence and especially generative AI are ""capable of doing a larger part of the job that you're doing right now."" He clarified that this doesn't mean these jobs are necessarily more likely to vanish, but they could be susceptible to big changes.""Imagine having unlimited, on-demand access to nearly infinite business knowledge,"" Schuller added. ""Your team could use it to do anything from automating mundane tasks to streamlining processes, even developing new, intelligent insights. Used in the right way, AI could enable a 500-person company to achieve the output of 1000 employees.""",,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Max Adams'}",,,,,

His agents gave generic responses to clients’ issues. Faced with difficult problems, they often sounded stumped, he said.But when Shah saw that ChatGPT could respond to questions with intricate, lifelike responses, he knew it could fix the customer service hotline of his India-based e-commerce platform, Dukaan.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeShah used the software to improve his in-house customer service chatbot Lina, training it largely on his company’s help center content. In December 2022, he let the ChatGPT-powered bot field nearly all messages and found his customers were largely happy.By June, he had fired 27 of his customer service agents and replaced them with Lina.Story continues below advertisement“It was [a] no-brainer for me to replace the entire team with a bot,” he said in an interview, “which is like 100 times smarter, who is instant, and who cost me like 100th of what I used to pay to the support team.”ChatGPT took their jobs. Now they walk dogs and fix air conditioners.Call centers, which started becoming popular in the late 1990s, provide cheap offshore labor to handle mundane corporate tasks for Western companies. Now, amid a larger wave of automation, this work is being outsourced once again: to artificial intelligence.AdvertisementBacked by advanced technology, chatbots can interact directly with customers and solve problems independently — no human necessary.💻Follow TechnologyFollowStart-ups, banks and consumer goods corporations say the technology can help them cut costly customer service costs while providing clients with personalized service. They argue AI will give remaining call center workers more support, helping them feel fulfilled in their jobs.Story continues below advertisementBut economists and workforce development experts say the shift could have a profound effect on economies across the world, especially in countries like India and the Philippines, where call centers provide millions of people with modest-paying work and where surveys have shown automation could render over a million jobs obsolete. The change is sparking a debate in the Global South about what, if anything, they can do to prevent a mass workforce disruption.Advertisement“You will … end up seeing a lot of jobs be eviscerated,” said Sharad Sharma, co-founder of the iSPIRT Foundation, an Indian nonprofit technology think tank. “And the fewer jobs that will remain will be different kinds of jobs.”GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextWhat to know about the Democratic convention now that Biden’s out of raceMany Democrats endorsed Vice President Harris, but they must make a formal nomination.

American companies, looking to control costs, began shipping jobs that were necessary — but not core — abroad, where cheap labor was in ample supply.Story continues below advertisementCountries such as India, with well-educated, English-speaking young workers, became a popular destination for these back-end jobs — most notably in customer service, information technology and data-processing roles.The economic impacts were significant. In the early 2000s, Western companies employed just a few thousand people in the Philippines, but as of 2023 that number has ballooned to over 1.6 million, according to industry analyst figures. In India, outsourcing jobs now contributes to nearly 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, industry analysts said.AdvertisementThe emergence of generative artificial intelligence — technology that undergirds AI chatbots, image makers and voice-cloning software — threatens the industry. Customer issues are likely to be solved by software that can analyze millions of data points to find the most common solution to a problem, rather than human ingenuity.Story continues below advertisementIn a September survey of more than 300 IT and call center leaders, 80 percent said conversational AI products will be a “must have” for their companies going forward, with 52 percent of polled firms reporting they had already invested in the technology.See why AI like ChatGPT has gotten so good, so fastThe shift has countries who rely on call center work bracing for change, politicians, economists and workforce development experts said.In May, Imee Marcos, a senator in the Philippines called for an inquiry into the potential displacement of workers by technology, especially in the country’s outsourcing sector. She noted an Oxford Economics and Cisco study, which estimated that digital automation could render 1.1 million jobs in her country obsolete by 2028.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“AI is developing faster than most people can comprehend,” she said in a news release, “and is threatening to take away jobs and turn employment growth upside down.”In India, companies are already testing out how to replace customer service workers and call center agents with large language models, said Sharma, though he declined to disclose which companies he was aware of that were doing these kinds of tests.He noted that with agents using AI to augment their work, the amount of workers needed to handle the same volume of calls will dwindle.The effect to the economy will be undeniable, he said, and Indian outsourcing companies will need to adapt artificial intelligence into their operations quickly if they seek to keep jobs from going elsewhere. “India has to embrace augmentation faster than any other country,” Sharma said. “That is the conversation that is taking place.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut AI and labor rights experts are torn on the impacts.Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, said automation could be a boon to the industry. As part of his research on AI’s impact on call centers, he found that many companies are augmenting their agents’ jobs with AI software instead of fully automating them.Brynjolfsson said a suite of AI software tools help call center workers do their jobs better: transcription software analyzes call conversations in real-time and provides agents with ideal solutions; other tools identify angry customers and provides techniques to calm them down.This support allows workers to tackle difficult problems with far more ease, he said, leading to higher customer satisfaction and lower worker turnover. In his study surveying more than 5,000 call center agents using artificial intelligence software, access to the tools increased productivity by 14 percent, with novice workers seeing the largest gains and highly experienced workers finding negligible improvement.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHe said companies should take note of these findings. “Don’t look first to automate,” he added. “Think about where you can augment things.”ChatGPT ‘hallucinates.’ Some researchers worry it isn’t fixable.Virginia L. Doellgast, a labor relations professor at Cornell University, argued the technology will make jobs more difficult: Easy customer service problems will be handled by artificial intelligence chatbots, leaving more complicated issues for humans to deal with.Remaining workers will deal with more difficult tasks that take longer to solve. If corporate compensation structures are tied to metrics, such as shorter call volume, they could be financially penalized.If artificial intelligence makes it easier for novice workers to perform better, she said, that could also justify companies hiring less expensive, less experienced talent, leading to wage deflation across the industry and less satisfying customer service.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“Why would you need to hire a really experienced center worker who costs more money for their skills when you could get the same performance out of a less experienced one,” she said.But for entrepreneurs like Shah, cost matters above all. After the success of his Dukaan chatbot, he created a spinoff product that allows others to transition to an all-AI-powered hotline.Not every customer service employee should worry about being replaced, but those who simply copy and paste responses are no longer safe, according to Shah.“That job is gone,” he said. “100 percent.”Share427 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

As HR turns to generative AI, 2 ways to mitigate the risks



By Dawn Kawamoto

October 3, 2023 

Generative AI’s game-changing capabilities stand to offer transformational benefits for HR leaders; however, the technology does bring real dangers that HR needs first to address, experts warn.

HR uses generative AI for everything from drafting job postings to tackling the laborious task of matching employees’ skills to open positions. While only 5% of HR leaders say their function is currently using generative AI, 9% are conducting pilot tests and more than half are exploring how to use it in the future, according to a Gartner report that surveyed more than 100 HR leaders.
But, like with any transformational tech, generative AI can pose a threat, such as inserting bias in hiring and promotions, which can derail an employer’s efforts to expand diversity among its workforce. Amazon in 2018, for example, nixed using an AI tool for recruiting because it showed a bias against women.
Aneel Bhusri, Workday
“Is there truth to some of these claims about the dangers of AI? I believe, yes, those are true if the technologies are not used in an ethical and responsible way,” said Aneel Bhusri, co-founder and co-CEO of Workday, at the company’s Workday Rising conference last week.
In addition to potentially introducing bias into processes, AI can deliver incorrect data that may appear correct on the surface, or AI hallucinations, warns Sayan Chakraborty, co-president at Workday. According to a report by NBC, such instances may come from the technology trying to connect dots when information is too sparse. If HR uses generative AI to draw insights from a small employee survey, for example, incorrect analysis can create big problems for people strategy.
2 ways to minimize hazards when using generative AI
Despite these dangers, Bhusri and Chakraborty say HR can harness the power of the technology if they take steps to reduce the risks.
Chakraborty says one approach calls for feeding high-quality data gleaned from “enterprise allies” into an employer’s generative AI. This type of data comes from a known source and adheres to regulatory, privacy and security requirements, compared to harvesting data straight from the internet, he says.

“We’re mostly aware of these very large language models with billions or even trillions of parameters like GPT, which are trained on massive amounts of data straight from the internet and built in an opaque way. We don’t really know what training and fine-tuning went into these models,” Chakraborty says. “And, inevitably, these models reflect all the good and all the bad things on the internet, which can be a great place where you can get things done but also a dark place for misinformation.”
Instead of populating their gen AI tools with data from the internet, Workday clients, for instance, can rely on the firm’s own data set—built from 65 million users who are under contract and using the same version of its software to generate over 600 billion transactions, says Bhusri. “It’s a very clear, clean and coherent data set,” he notes.
A second step HR teams and employers can take is the uncommon approach of keeping humans involved when using generative AI.

“Humans are the ultimate decision-makers anywhere AI is applied,” Bhusri says. It’s uncommon because many organizations are looking to use the technology to fully automate tasks for speed and cost reduction without human involvement.
However, lawmakers are increasingly becoming concerned about generative AI without human oversight. For example, New York requires employers that use AI in the hiring process to undergo a bias audit within a year of launching the technology.
Despite concerns about generative AI’s potential for harm, its potential for transforming how organizations, including HR functions, perform their work is prompting employers to run toward the technology.
“I’ve been around the technology industry for a long time and there’s been a lot of big shifts. But this one is different,” Bhusri says. “It certainly feels like the most important shift since the emergence of the cloud.”

Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

Asana is weaving generative AI into Work Graph, its data model for work management organization, to bring workflow insights to customers faster.
The project management platform vendor on Tuesday released and unveiled a series of new capabilities to help businesses generate content and also extract more information about project management efficiency.








Bringing AI to Work Graph
The aim of Work Graph technology is to capture patterns in and information about work processes within an organizations.
By merging Work Graph with generative AI, Asana can potentially sharpen its work pattern capture capabilities, said Chris Marsh, an analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
""Rather than just making individual task management more efficient, [AI] should give a boost to how work can be conceived of, planned and managed,"" Marsh said.
Generative AI is an apt addition to Asana's toolbox because it can better unearth specific problems and determine concrete ways in which teams can address them, he added.
""The [Work] Graph has needed AI to make it tangibly useful and many of the things Asana is announcing show that it is ready to play a more prominent role in Asana's overall value proposition,"" Marsh said.


Status updates and project blockers
Asana also unveiled a few generative AI tools to help teams create more accurate status updates and identify steps to stay on track.
Asana's Smart Status uses real-time work data to pinpoint possible risks and roadblocks the project team could face in pursuit of the goal. Similarly, another new tool named Smart Answers lets users type questions for specific insights about projects' progress and determine the best next steps.
Smart Answers can also help project managers identify where their assistance would be most useful by reducing the need for emails or text messages with team members that could lead to micromanaging, Asana chief product officer Alex Hood said. Instead, project managers can ask the data directly.
""You can interrogate the underlying project data or portfolio and get good answers,"" Hood said.
Smart Status and Smart Answers will be generally available next month, Hood said.

Asana's generative AI Smart Answers tool can quickly answer questions about projects' roadblocks and next best steps.







Text generation and summarization
In addition, the vendor released some new generative AI tools that are now generally available. These tools mainly focus on text generation.
One tool, Smart Editor, helps users draft content with a particular tone, with prompt descriptors that range from polite or direct to concise or detailed.
Another tool, Smart Summaries, collects the most essentials details from comments, key tasks and task descriptions and compiles them for quicker interpretation. In the future, Asana also plans to extend this capability to video calls by applying the tool to call transcripts.


Entering an AI-heavy market
Many project management vendors of all sizes are incorporating generative AI into their offerings. Asana must make intentional decisions about how they wield AI will be helpful to customers, Marsh said, especially as generative AI technology is still in its relative infancy.



Rather than just making individual task management more efficient, [AI] should give a boost to how work can be conceived of, planned and managed.


Chris MarshAnalyst, S&P Global




""They need to begin to show more strategic kinds of implementation from their larger enterprise customers,"" Marsh said of Asana.
He observed that many project management vendors have had to redirect their efforts toward enterprise customers because other markets are becoming too crowded.
For example, Smartsheet last month unveiled scalable offerings and released its own generative AI capabilities. Other project management platform vendors include Wrike, Trello and Monday.com.
""With the lower end of the market beginning to look saturated and the middle more competitive, the focus from Asana and its core competition has had to shift to the enterprise,"" Marsh said. ""Strategic implementations there -- where the benefit from its investments in its Graph infrastructure and AI -- now needs to become more visible.""

      Key Takeaways    



        A recent report by LinkedIn found a 2.2X increase in global job postings related to artificial intelligence and generative AI between July 2021 and July 2023. 
      


        LinkedIn's report also reveals 17% higher growth in postings that mention AI or generative AI.
      









    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

With the emergence and widespread use of artificial intelligence over the past year, questions loom over how the technology will impact the job market — but according to a new report, it already has.A recent report from the job and networking platform LinkedIn found a significant surge in job postings worldwide that reference AI or generative AI. In fact, between July 2021 and July 2023, such job listings more than doubled globally.Moreover, the increase of AI-related roles isn't industry-specific, but rather spans a myriad of sectors, Olivier Sabella, vice president of talent solutions at LinkedIn, told CNBC.



""These job posts vary from roles where professionals will directly work on AI development, such as AI engineer, to job postings where AI is listed as a required skill — for example, a digital product manager or cyber security consultant,"" Sabella told the outlet.The report also found that it's not just employers warming up to the implementation of AI, but the new tech is also piquing job seekers' interest.Related: Netflix is Hiring an AI-Focused Role—and the Starting Salary is up to $900,000Job postings that mention AI or generative AI have seen 17% ""greater application growth"" over the past two years.""As for the popularity of job posts mentioning AI, candidates are savvy,"" Erin Scruggs, vice president of global talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said in the report. ""They're showing they want to go where opportunities are.""And some companies are willing to shell out big bucks for those who fit the bill.


A report by ResumeBuilder earlier this year found that of 1,187 business leaders in the U.S., 92% are hiring, and 91% are looking for ChatGPT experience. One in four is willing to offer starting salaries exceeding $200,000, and 17% of respondents said they'd surpass a $300,000 salary for AI ""prompt engineers.""Related: Hiring Managers Are Looking for ChatGPT Experience — And Some Are Willing to Pay Up to $800,000 For It

    Listen to this article    0:00 / 5:22 1X  BeyondWords Since the November 2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers), the issue of AI technologies-related job displacement is receiving renewed economic impact scrutiny.     For example, in March 2023, technology firm OpenAI released a report that found at least 80% of the U.S. labor force could have at least 10% of their work-related tasks affected by the introduction of GPT, while another 19% of employees may see at least 50% of these work-related tasks impacted. While GPT influence impacts all wage levels, the higher-income jobs potentially face the greatest exposure, concludes OpenAI. Also in March 2023, researchers at investment banker Goldman Sachs, after collecting data on occupationally-oriented tasks in Europe and the U.S., found that roughly two-thirds of current occupations are exposed to varying degrees of generative AI automation (such as found in ChatGPT), and that AI could substitute for nearly one-fourth of current work performed.  Pew Research found that ""jobs with a high level of exposure to AI tend to be in higher-paying fields where a college education and analytical skills can be a plus."" (iStock)  In July 2023, the McKinsey Global Institute issued a report estimating that without generative AI, automation could take over tasks accounting for 21.5% of the hours worked in the U,S. economy by 2030; but with generative AI, that share increased to 29.5%.   WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?  Also in July 2023, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development reported that ""when considering all automation technologies including AI, 27% of jobs are in occupations at high-risk of automation."" Later in July 2023, Pew Research reported that ""in 2022, 19% of American workers were in jobs that are the most exposed to AI, in which the most important activities may be either replaced or assisted by AI."" Furthermore, Pew Research found that ""jobs with a high level of exposure to AI tend to be in higher-paying fields where a college education and analytical skills can be a plus."" These jobs are generally classified as ""professional, scientific and technical services; finance, insurance, and real estate; and public administration.""  How do American workers view AI’s impact on their workplace?  VideoIn an August 2023 poll of 1,000 Americans, The Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State University asked Americans for their feelings on AI job displacement generally and then with their job specifically. ""Generally,"" 79% of Americans are worried about AI displacement – either ""somewhat"" or ""very worried.""   However, when CGO asked whether they are worried about their own job being displaced by AI, 62% of Americans are ""not worried at all,"" and only 15% ""very worried.""     AI JOBS WITH MIND-BLOWING PAYCHECKS OF $375K A YEARThese seemingly contradictory opinion poll results, however, track closely with the results of a 2020 poll conducted by The Center for Growth and Opportunity on the future of work, where three-of-four Americans believed that their job would exist in 30 years.Is AI a ""general purpose technology""? Definitely, as it is a group of technologies that will have widespread effects across industries and sectors, resulting in significant economic, social and public policy impacts.  Video    Will it likely have disproportionate effects on certain occupations? Yes, the above-mentioned studies forecast both negative and positive impacts. But it is important to differentiate whether AI (GPT) will ""eliminate"" - or deeply reduce - the demand for certain occupational skill sets (which it may), or will it ""complement"" many occupations, resulting in occupational productivity increases and organizational cost savings. ""Generative AI’s ability to 1) generate new content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and 2) break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects,"" reports Goldman Sachs.  HOW AI TOOLS COULD TURN INTO JOB-KILLING MACHINES  According to Goldman Sachs’ researchers, the combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation (due to the emergence of new occupations following technological innovations), and higher productivity for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of generative AI potentially raising annual U.S. labor productivity growth by just under 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period following widespread adoption.     Moreover, the McKinsey Global Institute views ""generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright.""  VideoFive years ago, billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban warned America of the impending ""Job Terminator"" known as AI: ""Literally, who you work for, how you work, the type of work you do is going to be completely different than your parents within the next 10 to 15 years.""   CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONYet, the so-called ""rapid"" adoption of artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) by industry has gradually evolved over the last decade. While there are legitimate reasons to be concerned about the effects of a potentially ""disruptive"" technology like AI-GPT in the longer term, the projections for near-term widespread ""displacement"" of jobs or occupations will occur are less likely for those employees embracing AI-GPT tools as a complement to their existing skill sets - thus evolving their job scope and opportunities by creating new value-added skill sets.   Americans have successfully embraced similar technological challenges in the past, and they will confidently adapt to this latest occupational challenge.

While GPT influence impacts all wage levels, the higher-income jobs potentially face the greatest exposure, concludes OpenAI.&nbsp; Also in March 2023, researchers at investment banker&nbsp;Goldman Sachs, after collecting data on occupationally-oriented tasks in Europe and the U.S., found that roughly two-thirds of current occupations are exposed to varying degrees of generative AI automation (such as found in ChatGPT), and that AI could substitute for nearly one-fourth of current work performed.  In July 2023, the&nbsp;McKinsey Global Institute&nbsp;issued a report estimating that without generative AI, automation could take over tasks accounting for 21.5% of the hours worked in the U,S. economy by 2030; but with generative AI, that share increased to 29.5%.&nbsp; WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Also in July 2023, the&nbsp;Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&nbsp;reported that ""when considering all automation technologies including AI, 27% of jobs are in occupations at high-risk of automation."" Later in July 2023,&nbsp;Pew Research&nbsp;reported that ""in 2022, 19% of American workers were in jobs that are the most exposed to AI, in which the most important activities may be either replaced or assisted by AI.""&nbsp; Furthermore, Pew Research found that ""jobs with a high level of exposure to AI tend to be in higher-paying fields where a college education and analytical skills can be a plus."" These jobs are generally classified as ""professional, scientific and technical services; finance, insurance, and real estate; and public administration."" How do American workers view AI’s impact on their workplace?&nbsp;  In an August 2023 poll of 1,000 Americans,&nbsp;The Center for Growth and Opportunity&nbsp;(CGO) at Utah State University asked Americans for their feelings on AI job displacement generally and then with their job specifically. ""Generally,"" 79% of Americans are worried about AI displacement – either ""somewhat"" or ""very worried.""&nbsp; However, when CGO asked whether they are worried about their own job being displaced by AI, 62% of Americans are ""not worried at all,"" and only 15% ""very worried.""&nbsp; AI JOBS WITH MIND-BLOWING PAYCHECKS OF $375K A YEAR These seemingly contradictory opinion poll results, however, track closely with the results of a 2020 poll conducted by&nbsp;The Center for Growth and Opportunity&nbsp;on the future of work, where three-of-four Americans believed that their job would exist in 30 years. Is AI a ""general purpose technology""? Definitely, as it is a group of technologies that will have widespread effects across industries and sectors, resulting in significant economic, social and public policy impacts.&nbsp;  Will it likely have disproportionate effects on certain occupations? Yes, the above-mentioned studies forecast both negative and positive impacts. But it is important to differentiate whether AI (GPT) will ""eliminate"" - or deeply reduce - the demand for certain occupational skill sets (which it may), or will it ""complement"" many occupations, resulting in occupational productivity increases and organizational cost savings.&nbsp; ""Generative AI’s ability to 1) generate new content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and 2) break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects,"" reports&nbsp;Goldman Sachs.&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW AI TOOLS COULD TURN INTO JOB-KILLING MACHINES According to&nbsp;Goldman Sachs’ researchers, the combination of significant labor cost savings, new job creation (due to the emergence of new occupations following technological innovations), and higher productivity for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of generative AI potentially raising annual U.S. labor productivity growth by just under 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period following widespread adoption.&nbsp; Moreover, the&nbsp;McKinsey Global Institute&nbsp;views&nbsp;""generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright.""&nbsp;  Five years ago, billionaire entrepreneur&nbsp;Mark Cuban&nbsp;warned America of the impending ""Job Terminator"" known as AI:&nbsp;""Literally, who you work for, how you work, the type of work you do is going to be completely different than your parents within the next 10 to 15 years.""&nbsp; CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Yet, the so-called ""rapid"" adoption of artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) by industry has gradually evolved over the last decade. While there are legitimate reasons to be concerned about the effects of a potentially ""disruptive"" technology like AI-GPT in the&nbsp;longer term, the projections for&nbsp;near-term&nbsp;widespread ""displacement"" of jobs or occupations will occur are less likely for those employees embracing AI-GPT tools as a complement to their existing skill sets - thus evolving their job scope and opportunities by creating new value-added skill sets.&nbsp; Americans have successfully embraced similar technological challenges in the past, and they will confidently adapt to this latest occupational challenge.

Some fear that AI will wreak havoc on the job market.A report by Goldman Sachs in March predicted as many as 300 million jobs could be disrupted by the new technology, and the tidal wave of AI advances has left many workers worrying that their jobs could soon be replaced by technology.For some working in art and design this future has alread yarrived.

Artists were among the first to encounter generative AI. Image generators such as Dall-E and Stable Diffusion have also quickly gained traction. As the popularity of these tools grows, some artists say work and opportunities have begun to dry up.

Eva Toorenent has been working as a freelance artist and illustrator since 2019. Late last year, she was shocked to discover that another artist had taken artwork she'd posted on Instagram and used it to ""fine tune"" the AI model Midjourney to produce AI art in her style. The other artist then sold the artwork to a gallery.

""It was hurtful,"" she told Insider. ""My work has been stolen before, but this was a new kind of violating feeling that I haven't felt before.""Since then, she has increasingly encountered generative AI in her work, and says that the technology is being used to cut corners and costs, leaving freelance artists to pay the price.""It's scary to see,"" she said. ""But honestly, it feels inevitable.""

Entry-level jobs vanishingArtists told Insider that it's these freelance and entry-level jobs, particularly in film, TV and gaming, that are increasingly being done by AI.

""I noticed as early as last summer work was starting to dry up a little bit,"" said Reid Southen, a concept artist and illustrator who mainly works in the film industry. He said the downturn was partly due to the worsening economy, but that AI likely played a role too.Reid told Insider that he was aware of production companies turning to AI during the ""blue sky"" period where concept artists are brought on to produce mood boards and flesh out the look of a film.""AI seems to be taking a big chunk of that work,"" he said. ""Companies can use generative AI to throw a bunch of stuff at the wall and churn out thousands of concepts in an afternoon.""

Concept artist and professional illustrator Karla Ortiz told Insider she'd been involved in three productions where generative AI had been used at the concept stage.""I'm a freelancer and so I charge by the hour, and these things were used in a way that 100% lessened my hours working on those projects,"" she said. ""It's being adopted quietly in a lot of different productions. It's alarming.""Eva believes that the shift toward AI-generated concept art is likely to hurt smaller artists at the start of their careers.""The beginning jobs are moving away,"" she said. ""If game companies use Midjourney to generate concept art and mood boards, it cuts off opportunities for up-and-coming artists to get noticed.""

Companies using AI to cut costsWhile the debate over AI rages, companies are already including it in layoff announcements and using it as an excuse for downsizing.IBM has paused hiring in roles that could be replaced by AI, and BT announced plans to replace 10,000 cut jobs with AI earlier this year.Something similar is happening in the art world. Ben Zhao, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago, told Insider that the explosion in generative AI has sparked a ""race to the bottom"" as companies cut expenses and lay off low-level art roles.""There's a lot of actual replacement going on, but many companies are just using generative AI as a way to argue for downsizing, to try to drive down costs and maximize profits,"" he said.

Reid worries that the economic outlook and the growing presence of AI have created a ""perfect storm"" that is pushing many companies to cut jobs.""I think they're looking at numbers and they're seeing cost saving measures, and they're seeing tools that can aid their businesses without necessarily thinking about the human costs,"" he said.

The vanishing opportunities are especially galling considering that many of the AI image generators artists are losing work to are trained on artwork scraped from the internet.After she first encountered generative AI, Eva used the Have I been Trained tool and found that several of her artworks had been used to train AI models.

""It's scary to think that somebody could just take my work without my consent and train an AI on it,"" she said. ""Without our work this technology could not exist. It feels like we are being replaced with our own labor.""Artists fear for the futureKarla Ortiz is one of three artists who have launched a lawsuit against Stability AI and Midjourney over claims the companies violated copyright laws by scraping their work to train AI models.""I'm hoping it'll set a very clear precedent on what actions are ok, and what actions are not ok when developing these technologies,"" Ortiz said.She fears that the uncertainty and concern surrounding generative AI is putting off people from going into careers in the creative industry: ""I don't blame them because I'm worried about my job prospects too.""

                                  Karla Ortiz is suing Midjourney and Stable Diffusion over their use of her works to train AI models.

Artists say it's already happening.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,"Some fear that AI will wreak havoc on the job market.A report by Goldman Sachs in March predicted as many as 300 million jobs could be disrupted by the new technology, and the tidal wave of AI advances has left many workers worrying that their jobs could soon be replaced by technology.For some working in art and design this future has alread yarrived.Artists were among the first to encounter generative AI. Image generators such as Dall-E and Stable Diffusion have also quickly gained traction. As the popularity of these tools grows, some artists say work and opportunities have begun to dry up.Eva Toorenent has been working as a freelance artist and illustrator since 2019. Late last year, she was shocked to discover that another artist had taken artwork she'd posted on Instagram and used it to ""fine tune"" the AI model Midjourney to produce AI art in her style. The other artist then sold the artwork to a gallery.""It was hurtful,"" she told Insider. ""My work has been stolen before, but this was a new kind of violating feeling that I haven't felt before.""Since then, she has increasingly encountered generative AI in her work, and says that the technology is being used to cut corners and costs, leaving freelance artists to pay the price.""It's scary to see,"" she said. ""But honestly, it feels inevitable.""Artists told Insider that it's these freelance and entry-level jobs, particularly in film, TV and gaming, that are increasingly being done by AI.""I noticed as early as last summer work was starting to dry up a little bit,"" said Reid Southen, a concept artist and illustrator who mainly works in the film industry. He said the downturn was partly due to the worsening economy, but that AI likely played a role too.Reid told Insider that he was aware of production companies turning to AI during the ""blue sky"" period where concept artists are brought on to produce mood boards and flesh out the look of a film.""AI seems to be taking a big chunk of that work,"" he said. ""Companies can use generative AI to throw a bunch of stuff at the wall and churn out thousands of concepts in an afternoon.""Concept artist and professional illustrator Karla Ortiz told Insider she'd been involved in three productions where generative AI had been used at the concept stage.""I'm a freelancer and so I charge by the hour, and these things were used in a way that 100% lessened my hours working on those projects,"" she said. ""It's being adopted quietly in a lot of different productions. It's alarming.""Eva believes that the shift toward AI-generated concept art is likely to hurt smaller artists at the start of their careers.""The beginning jobs are moving away,"" she said. ""If game companies use Midjourney to generate concept art and mood boards, it cuts off opportunities for up-and-coming artists to get noticed.""While the debate over AI rages, companies are already including it in layoff announcements and using it as an excuse for downsizing.IBM has paused hiring in roles that could be replaced by AI, and BT announced plans to replace 10,000 cut jobs with AI earlier this year.Something similar is happening in the art world. Ben Zhao, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago, told Insider that the explosion in generative AI has sparked a ""race to the bottom"" as companies cut expenses and lay off low-level art roles.""There's a lot of actual replacement going on, but many companies are just using generative AI as a way to argue for downsizing, to try to drive down costs and maximize profits,"" he said.Reid worries that the economic outlook and the growing presence of AI have created a ""perfect storm"" that is pushing many companies to cut jobs.""I think they're looking at numbers and they're seeing cost saving measures, and they're seeing tools that can aid their businesses without necessarily thinking about the human costs,"" he said.The vanishing opportunities are especially galling considering that many of the AI image generators artists are losing work to are trained on artwork scraped from the internet.After she first encountered generative AI, Eva used the Have I been Trained tool and found that several of her artworks had been used to train AI models.""It's scary to think that somebody could just take my work without my consent and train an AI on it,"" she said. ""Without our work this technology could not exist. It feels like we are being replaced with our own labor.""Karla Ortiz is one of three artists who have launched a lawsuit against Stability AI and Midjourney over claims the companies violated copyright laws by scraping their work to train AI models.""I'm hoping it'll set a very clear precedent on what actions are ok, and what actions are not ok when developing these technologies,"" Ortiz said.She fears that the uncertainty and concern surrounding generative AI is putting off people from going into careers in the creative industry: ""I don't blame them because I'm worried about my job prospects too.""Zhao is also concerned about how generative AI may impact the next generation.

Several companies are laying off and plan to let go of their employees due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). 
However, IBM doesn’t foresee the technology impacting its programmers’ jobs. 
Check out what the company’s CEO has to say.

On the one hand, big companies like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and T-Mobile are laying off people. A few reasons include uncertain economic conditions, reduced revenues and profits, and technological advancements like artificial intelligence (AI). On the other hand, another tech giant, IBM, has confirmed that it doesn’t intend to lay off any programmers due to AI. In fact, while some people may lose their jobs, the company plans to hire more people. That said, the company does intend to stop hiring people for jobs that AI can perform.
According to Arvind Krishna, CEO, IBM, rather than costing programmers their jobs, the technology will improve their productivity by 30%. Interestingly, Krishna had said in MayOpens a new window  this year that about 30% (almost 7,800) of jobs at the company could be replaced by AI and automation over five years.
While he now believed that the company could phase out a few back-office HR roles, it may also increase the number of software engineering and sales roles over 3-4 years. According to him, “The increase was like 8,000. The decrease was like 800.” Krishna also believes that while AI may take over 10-20% of “lower level” tasks, it is unlikely to automate a person’s complete job.

Several studies indicate that AI could impact millions of jobs worldwide. For example, a recent studyOpens a new window  by Goldman Sachs predicted that about 300 million jobs could be affected by AI. However, a few other studies indicate otherwise. For example, a study by the UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO) found that AI, specifically generative AI, will more likely augment jobs than destroy them.
What is certain, according to IBM’s recent studyOpens a new window , is that 40% of the global workforce will have to learn new skills over the next three years owing to AI implementation.

The number of jobs postings on LinkedIn that mention AI or require AI skills have increased significantly since 2021 and jobs seekers are keen to snap up these jobs, new LinkedIn data shows. LinkedIn released new research on Tuesday, viewed by Insider, which surveyed 29,937 professionals in the US, UK and Canada and 15 other countries in August. It also published its Global Talent Trends Report, which analyzed job descriptions for paid jobs in the past two years and flagged those that mentioned AI or generative AI in 10 languages including English, Spanish, and French.

It found that the skills required for jobs are estimated to change by at least significantly by 2030 due to rapid developments in the workplace including the increasing interest around AI.These changes are already showing up as job postings that mention AI or generative AI have more than doubled globally in the past two years, per LinkedIn's data. Job seekers are keen to snap up these jobs as applications for these roles have grown 17% faster, according to the Global Talent Trends Report.

Overall 89% of professionals are excited to use AI at work and 57% want to learn more about it, LinkedIn said.There's been a rapid increase in interest around AI skills in the past year since the launch of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022. It reached 100 million users in just over 2 months, becoming the fastest growing consumer app in internet history.

The hype is reflecting in job listings across the board. For example, job search engine Adzuna advertised 7.8 million open roles in the US in May and 1,496 of those mentioned generative AI, compared to only 185 listings in January. Only three job postings on Adzuna mentioned AI in May 2022.These postings are popular among job seekers in part thanks to high salaries, with companies across a number of industries offering salaries over $100,000 for jobs related to AI.

It also published its Global Talent Trends Report, which analyzed job descriptions for paid jobs in the past two years and flagged those that mentioned AI or generative AI in 10 languages including English, Spanish, and French. It found that the skills required for jobs are estimated to change by at least significantly by 2030 due to rapid developments in the workplace including the increasing interest around AI.These changes are already showing up as job postings that mention AI or generative AI have more than doubled globally in the past two years, per LinkedIn's data. Job seekers are keen to snap up these jobs as applications for these roles have grown 17% faster, according to the Global Talent Trends Report. Overall 89% of professionals are excited to use AI at work and 57% want to learn more about it, LinkedIn said.There's been a rapid increase in interest around AI skills in the past year since the launch of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022. It reached 100 million users in just over 2 months, becoming the fastest growing consumer app in internet history. The hype is reflecting in job listings across the board. For example, job search engine Adzuna advertised 7.8 million open roles in the US in May and 1,496 of those mentioned generative AI, compared to only 185 listings in January. Only three job postings on Adzuna mentioned AI in May 2022.These postings are popular among job seekers in part thanks to high salaries, with companies across a number of industries offering salaries over $100,000 for jobs related to AI. One machine learning researcher role for the trading firm Jane Street has a salary range between $250,000 to $300,000 a year. Disney is also advertising a senior machine learning engineer role with a pay range of $145,400 to $199,870 a year.",,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Will Martin'}",,,,,

In the course of writing this article, we have spoken to numerous election officials and security experts about their apprehensions and ambitions regarding generative artificial intelligence. Within the elections community, many officials have expressed grave concerns about what generative AI might mean for election security. That sentiment aligns with recent media discourse highlighting the dangers posed by AI. An illustrative May 2023 article in the Washington Post described an increase in phishing attacks attributed to AI, noting that such attacks are “just the beginning . . . as attackers use artificial intelligence to write software that can break into . . . networks in novel ways, change appearance and functionality to beat detection, and smuggle data back out through processes that appear normal.”
Other commentaries recount the ways that AI may make it easier to impersonate election officials, offices, and system vendors in order to infiltrate election infrastructure and mislead the public. Meanwhile, some election officials worry that excessive emphasis on AI’s frightening capabilities itself breeds more peril. David Triplett, the elections manager for Ramsey County, Minnesota, wonders if “all this talk about AI’s power is fueling even more paranoia and confusion about the trustworthiness of elections.” Such concerns seem valid given recent sensationalist narratives stoking public fears to propagate baseless claims of AI-driven election rigging.
How much should election offices and vendors worry about the security threats posed by advances in AI, and what steps should they take to prepare for them? This article is the inaugural piece in a series delving into AI’s potential effects on American democracy. It examines generative AI’s capacity to disrupt the security of election offices and election system vendors. Specifically, we look here at how AI changes (and does not change) the cybersecurity situation for election offices and election infrastructure. We also look at the threat that generative AI poses to the ability of election offices to function as authoritative sources of election information and records. We then detail measures that government, the private sector, and the media must take to guard against AI’s risks and build public confidence in the integrity of election outcomes in the AI age. Later pieces in this series will consider, among other issues, AI’s effects on manipulated media in political advertising, election administration, voter suppression efforts, and the public comment process.

As AI and automation usher in a new economic era, every CEO recognizes the need to invest to stay competitive. They need a digital strategy that builds resilience, drives greater efficiency and growth that also provides trust, security and reliability.
Combining AI, data, and CRM has enormous potential to transform customer experiences, better anticipating their needs and delivering personalization across every unique interaction.
In addition, incorporating AI-enhanced features across the workforce can achieve greater employee satisfaction, improve productivity and decision-making. According to Slack’s State of Work report, Indian desk workers and found that 75% of them have adopted AI in their work to help drive productivity. While company leaders want to embrace generative AI, balancing value and risk is imperative to unlocking its full potential.
Transforming how Work Gets Done
Scheduling meetings, organizing files, managing administrative tasks – automating monotonous tasks will enable teams to be more productive and efficient, freeing up valuable time to focus on more strategic and creative aspects of their work.
Marketers, for example, are already using generative AI to transform how they connect with their customers by powering more automated and effective campaigns — quickly and at scale. In addition to targeting basics like content creation and writing copy, they’re transforming the way marketers analyze data, personalize messaging content, and optimize SEO strategy.
When it comes to sales teams, consolidating all their organization’s data on a single platform and auto-crafting personalized emails tailored to their customer’s needs is making how they work faster, smarter, and more efficient. Personalization is informed by CRM data, freeing sales reps to focus on building relationships, closing business, and driving revenue.
Generative AI tools are becoming increasingly conversational, too, and taking on the role of super-powered collaborators. They’re delivering intelligence across automations, sharing knowledge, providing conversation summaries and writing email drafts. The real power of this technology is when AI can analyze and act on the most valuable data from a company’s most trusted resource, helping teams work smarter and make informed decisions faster.
Informing Better Business Decisions
In the modern business landscape, data is the cornerstone of success. When it comes to AI, it’s only as good its data. While leaders understand the importance of data, many struggle to harness its power for better decision-making and business results. For some, it’s too complex or not accessible enough; others cite inability to generate impactful insights as an issue across their organizations.
The generative AI revolution will make it exponentially easier for everyone to tap into immense troves of trusted data to do their jobs more effectively and efficiently.
The integration of AI, real-time data and CRM allows for personalized content generation and tailored experiences across sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT. This enables businesses to anticipate customer needs, engage prospects, and optimize their operations, leading to improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Take for instance a sales leader who can generate visualizations based on natural language prompts that display real-time progress against their quota, along with recommendations for helping them meet goals. Such insights, based on patterns and trends in data that might be too vast or complex for humans to analyze manually, will give employees invaluable time back to focus on how they employ the results.
All of this will drive impactful outcomes quicker, empower creativity, and boost productivity and success.
The need to put Trust at the Center of AI
Generative AI will transform the way we work, yet its accuracy and quality depend on the data that fuels it. To limit potential for bias, hallucinations, and toxic outputs it’s important that data is pulled from sources that are relevant, representative, and complete. There’s also the need to keep a human in the loop on all customer interactions to validate and ensure accuracy of the data and outputs.
Whether generating a tailored sales email or customer support chat response, training workers to take full advantage of the technology and instilling an ethics-first approach is essential for companies wanting to use generative AI to deliver against growing customer expectations.
By unifying first-party data, leveraging trusted AI innovations to provide data privacy and security, and placing people and their understanding at the forefront of the transformation, companies can ensure they put safety and trust at the center of their customer relationships.

Uzbekistan actively boasts artificial intelligence, which impacts businesses

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has gained significant importance in recent years, particularly in the United States and China, with both governments and companies recognizing its potential and investing heavily in its advancement. Popular AI products such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and China's state-of-the-art face recognition technology have emerged as a result. Uzbekistan is also among the countries that have integrated AI into their operations.According to Siyovush Muminov, a representative of Alif Holding, AI tools are purposefully designed to boost labor efficiency. As per consulting firms like McKinsey, generative AI could positively impact productivity, contributing between $2.2 to $4.4 trillion annually. PwC also predicts integrating AI technologies could have positive economic effects, potentially reaching $15.7 trillion by 2030.Photo: festival.goviral.kzAI in Uzbekistan: New OpportunitiesUzbekistan, like the United States and China, is closely monitoring the development of AI. In recent years, there has been a significant surge in interest in AI, resulting in various communities, educational courses, and conferences to raise public awareness and interest in this area. The state is actively supporting AI development by introducing the MyID biometric identification system, which remotely identifies customers of various companies. Additionally, Uzbekistan is fostering highly specialized startups, such as those focused on creating large language models specific to the Uzbek language and tools for speech recognition and synthesis in the State language. The number of people interested in AI education and job search is growing in Uzbekistan, as evidenced by the regular recruitment of the Alif artificial intelligence team. Uzbekistan recognizes the enormous potential of AI development and has supported several activities in this field in the past year, with plans to launch a machine learning course. Similarly, Uzbekistan is thoroughly committed to exploring AI's possibilities and continuously seeks new ways to further its development.AI in fintech: transforming the financial worldAI has become a prevalent tool in the fintech industry, owing to the vast data and range of services available. By optimizing costs and increasing revenue, it has proved to be valuable. At Alif, we have implemented a machine learning-powered credit scoring model for our ""Buy now, pay later"" product. This model has automated credit committee processes, decreased default rates, and improved sales by installments. The introduction of ML scoring has resulted in a significant improvement in default rates and a reduction in the decision time for payment requests. This is achieved by analyzing multiple parameters and providing a decision within seconds.Furthermore, we are developing an AI-based chatbot that processes thousands of customer requests. This reduces response time and provides round-the-clock support. Our ultimate goal is to incorporate AI into all processes and products where its effectiveness is proven. This includes recommendatory systems for marketplaces, voice assistants, advertising budget optimization, customer outflow reduction, and fraud prevention.Human AI Challenges Currently, there is a global discussion on the development of artificial intelligence, which raises concerns about its potential adverse effects. One of the primary debates is the fear of increased unemployment, with critics comparing the current AI development to the industrial revolution that led to job losses. The recent surge in generative AI development has only fueled this argument. Although there is some truth to this claim, AI has also created entirely new occupations and better-paid jobs than automated positions.At Alif, we have witnessed this in practice. With ML-scoring and chatbots, routine tasks are now automated and do not require specialized knowledge in any field. However, we still need to employ specialists in the field of AI, such as data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI researchers. The salaries of such employees are significantly higher than those of support and credit committee employees.Automation does not necessarily lead to job losses. Support and loan committee staff are usually given opportunities for growth and development. They can move to positions that require creative skills and expertise, which AI is not yet fully capable of replacing.For those who can adapt to new realities and have great expertise, there is no threat of being replaced by AI. Instead, it should be viewed as an opportunity to increase production efficiency and the creativity of professionals in various fields.Business benefitThanks to recent advancements in technology and communication tools, small and medium-sized enterprises can now enhance their competitiveness by integrating AI into their operations. Previously, this advantage was limited to large corporations such as Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (FAANG). Alif's AI development strategy focuses on incorporating AI into all processes, prioritizing areas where current technologies can provide the most significant benefits. Follow Daryo's official Instagram and Twitter pages to keep current on world news.
