Stronger legislation than the European Commission envisages is needed to regulate AI and protect workers.
In joint, human-machine problem-solving, the worker must make the decision (PaO_STUDIO/shutterstock.com)
Artificial intelligence (AI) is of strategic importance for the European Union: the European Commission frequently affirms that ‘artificial intelligence with a purpose can make Europe a world leader’. Recently, the commissioner for the digital age, Margrethe Vestager, again insisted on AI’s ‘huge potential’ but admitted there was ‘a certain reluctance’, a hesitation on the part of the public: ‘Can we trust the authorities that put it in place?’ One had to be able to trust in technology, she said, ‘because this is the only way to open markets for AI to be used’. 
Trust is indeed central to the acceptance of AI by European citizens. The recent toeslagenaffaire (allowances affair) in the Netherlands is a reminder of the dangers. Tens of thousands of families were flagged up as potentially fraudulent claimants of childcare allowances, without any proof, and forced to pay back—driving many into poverty, some to depression and suicide. All of this was the consequence of a self-learning algorithm and AI system, designed without checks and balances and not subject to human scrutiny.
In its current form, the AI regulation proposed by the commission last April will not protect citizens from similar dangers. It will also not protect workers. In its eagerness to push AI forward and position itself in the global AI race, the commission has overlooked workers’ rights. The envisaged AI legislation is framed in terms of product safety and, as such, employment is not within its legal ambit.

The only reference to employment is found in annex III, which lists ‘high-risk’ AI systems. These take in recruitment and selection, the screening and evaluation of candidates, and the elevation or termination of work-related contractual relationships and task allocation, as well as the monitoring and evaluation of the performance and behaviour of persons in such relationships.
The regulation would not however provide any additional specific protection to workers nor ensure their existing rights were safeguarded—despite the uncertainty AI will generate in these regards. The protective capacity for workers of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), although in force for almost four years and despite its potential, is not yet used to the full.
Shortcomings to address
Along with other emerging technologies, such as quantum computing, robotics or blockchain, AI will disrupt life as we know it. The EU can become an AI global leader only if it remains faithful to its democratic and social values, which implies protecting the rights of its workers.

To do that, the shortcomings of the AI regulation and the GDPR need to be addressed. Seven aspects deserve more attention:
Implementing GDPR in the context of employment: fully implementing GDPR rights for workers is one of the most effective ways to ensure they have control over their data. AI relies on data, including workers’ personal data. Workers need to use GDPR actively, to ask how such data is used (potentially for profiling or to discriminate against them), stored or shared, in and out of the employment relationship; employers need to respect their right to do so. The commission and the European Data Protection Supervisor should issue clear recommendations insisting on the applicability of the GDPR at work. There may also be a need to determine what role labour inspectors could or should play.
Further developing the ‘right to explanation’: when decisions supported by algorithms—the processing of sensitive data, performance assessment, task allocation based on reputational data, profiling and so on—negatively affect workers or are associated with a bias (in the design or the data), the right to explanation becomes an essential defence mechanism. A specific framework based on articles 12-15, 22 and recital 71 of the GDPR must be developed and apply to all forms of employment. In practice, when a decision supported by an algorithm has been made and negatively affects a worker, such framework should enable the individual to obtain information that is simultaneously understandable, meaningful and actionable; receive an explanation as to the logic behind the decision; understand the significance and the consequences of the decision, and challenge the decision, vis-à-vis the employer or in court if necessary.
Purpose of AI algorithms: in an occupational setting, having access to the code behind an algorithm is not useful per se. What matters to workers is understanding the purpose of the AI system or the algorithm embedded in an application. This is partly covered by GDPR article 35, on the obligation to produce data-protection impact assessments. Further action is however needed to make sure workers’ representatives are involved.
Involving workers’ representatives when conducting AI risk assessments at work, pre-deployment: Given the potential risk of misuse, as well as of unintended or unanticipated harmful outcomes stemming from AI systems, employers should have the obligation under the proposed regulation to conduct technology risk assessments before their deployment. Workers’ representatives should be systematically involved and have a role in characterising the level of risk arising from the use of AI systems and in identifying proportionate mitigation measures, all along the life cycle. Risk assessments should address general issues about cybersecurity, privacy and safety, as well as specific associated threats.
Addressing intrusive surveillance: workplace monitoring is increasingly being replaced by intrusive surveillance, using data related to workers’ behaviour, biometrics and emotions. Given the risk of abuse, legal provisions are needed to ban such practices.
Boosting workers’ autonomy in human-machine interactions: this entails ensuring that workers are ‘in the loop’ of fully or semi-automated decision-making and that they make the final decision, using the input from the machine. This is particularly important when joint (human-machine) problem-solving takes place. Boosting workers’ autonomy means sustaining the accumulated tacit knowledge of the workforce and supporting the transfer of that knowledge to the machine—whether it be a co-operative robot or a piece of software. This is particularly pertinent to processes that require testing, quality control or diagnosis.
Enabling workers to become ‘AI literate’: acquiring technical skills and using them ‘at work’, although necessary, is not enough and mostly serves the interests of one’s employer. Becoming ‘AI literate’ means being able to understand critically the role of AI and its impact on one’s work and occupation, and being able to anticipate how it will transform one’s career and role. Passively using AI systems does not benefit workers themselves—a certain distance needs to be established for them to see AI’s overall influence. There is scope here for a new role for workers’ representatives to flag up digitally-related risks and interactions, to assess the uncertain impact of largely invisible technologies and to find new ways of effectively integrating tacit knowledge into workflows and processes.
Two scenarios
In the negotiations over the AI regulation, two possible scenarios have emerged. The first revolves around adding ‘protective’ amendments to the text. This may not be enough, as significant fixes are required to extend its legal purview and make substantial changes to its scope.
The second scenario involves adopting complementary rules on AI for the workplace. These would add to the GDPR and the commission’s draft directive on improving working conditions in platform work, in particular when it comes to algorithmic management.
As the Dutch toeslagenaffaire has shown, algorithms can have a direct and damaging impact on people and on workers’ lives. For trust ever to exist, the AI act must be reorientated: its current focus is on enabling business and promoting the EU as a global AI leader, when the priority should be to protect citizens and workers.

The Great Resignation may be a myth or reality, depending upon your viewpoint. But one thing is clear: The labor shortage is real.
But it is likely not due to a decline in the participation rate. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the post-pandemic labor force participation rate has not declined dramatically. In fact, the core ages of the workforce, 25-54, saw a dip at the onset of the pandemic that was mild compared to other age groups – especially workers 55+.
Rather than a Great Resignation, this would suggest a Great Reallocation of the workforce. As a global search consultant, we are seeing this precipitous shift in positions, with great demand for skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML).
[ Want best practices for AI workloads? Get the eBook: Top considerations for building a production-ready AI/ML environment. ]
With that in mind, here are seven artificial intelligence (AI)-related roles to consider prioritizing right now as the workforce reallocates talent to new jobs that drive economic value for leading companies:
1. Head of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) – Director, VP, SVP
Description: This role is responsible for improving business process automation technology based on metaphorical software robots (bots) or on artificial intelligence. They lead teams in areas of process improvement, product design, and business transformation, which may involve tasks such as implementing new data sets, R&D or Revenue dashboards, and automation of NLP processes.
Why it is important: Effective management of RPA improves speed, quality, and productivity by minimizing the need for human assistance in the automation process.
[ Get the cheat sheet: How to explain RPA in plain English. ]
2. Head of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AI/ML) – VP, SVP, EVP
Description: This leader is responsible for building innovative, world-class products and capabilities by leading a team of data and machine learning engineers in building high-quality products for both internal and external use. They lead and mentor teams implementing cutting-edge Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence and analytics systems, tools, and services that operate at an unprecedented scale.
Why it is important: Every organization is challenged to remain competitive in the market, increasing revenue and reducing operating costs. AI is the single most powerful tool that organizations are using to make informed decisions, drive new lines of revenue, attract new customers, and optimize the costs of business operations. A technical leader to run this program is imperative to the success of the program.
3. Head of Customer Insights
Description: The customer insights leader strives to improve marketing by gaining a better customer understanding through both data and research. These analytics and insights apply to all marketing channels and are delivered at preferred customer touchpoints.
Why it is important: Consumer insights play a huge role in reducing inefficiency and repetitive tasks. Brand leaders can also use consumer insights to measure key performance metrics for optimizing operational excellence and product innovation. This helps reduce churn, waste, and redundancy.
4. Product Management – Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning
Description: This role is responsible for defining and owning the data science product roadmap within an organization. He or she prioritizes the research and development of optimization, statistical, and machine learning models, and takes to market new product capabilities to automate customers’ business processes.
Why it is important: A deep focus on the customer experience is critical to assure that organizations find solutions to customer challenges and keep up with market trends.

5. Chief Data Officer (CDO)
Description: The chief data officer is responsible for providing world-class information management and data operations. The CDO builds enterprise intelligence and automation capabilities to ensure that pertinent data is available, reliable, consistent, accessible, secure, and timely to support the mission and activities. This includes:

Defining an ongoing data strategy in partnership with leaders from across the organization
Implementing an appropriate and well-defined data governance approach
Creating constructs to support optimal access/retrieval, security, storage/caching, movement/transformation, and classification/encryption
Management of data across multiple teams

Why it is important: Many organizations are drowning in data, and the ability to “make data speak” with the right information at the right time is critical to organizational success. The CDO is key to building foundational data and analytics competencies and ensuring that data generates these key business benefits:

Business leaders receive advanced analytics that help decision-making that drives desired business outcomes
Business leaders are empowered to explain to the board and C-level how data is applied in their organization’s use cases
Data becomes a powerful tool to guide strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threat discussions

6. Data Scientist
Description: Data scientists are responsible for providing data, analysis, statistical modeling, and machine-learning capabilities to inform key business initiatives.
Why it is important: Data science can add value to any business that can use its data well. From statistics and insights across workflows and hiring new candidates to helping senior staff make better-informed decisions, data science is invaluable in today’s business environment.
7. Chief Digital Officer
Description: The chief digital officer is responsible for leading and building key technologies to drive digital transformation across the enterprise. This role serves as a strategic leader for key IT business processes, including the architecture committee, capital planning, and security processes.

Why it is important: Organizations need to drive growth and strategic renewal by transforming traditional analog business into digital. This role focuses on creating new value through the smart use of digital tools, platforms, technologies, services, and processes. In addition, as companies digitize, many have rushed to the cloud, with mixed results. Managing a cloud strategy is critical as improper management can cost enterprises millions.
While these seven AI roles are critical, finding talent to fill them is difficult.  AI, machine learning, and data analytics are new fields, and few people have relevant experience.
This leads us back to the fact: We are dealing with a Great Reallocation of the labor force to an AI/Machine learning, data-driven world.

My grandmother, Claire Hastings, was born in the 1920s on a farm in Armidale, northern New South Wales. That was a relatively common thing, with just 43% of the population living in cities, compared with more than 70% now. 
She lived in a small wooden hut, with a chicken coop out the front and fields out the back. When she and her siblings came home from school, they helped plough the fields with a horse-drawn plough until sundown. 
Little did she know this life would soon disappear. The “second industrial revolution” (of mass production and standardisation) was creating machines to replace human and horse power. A plough pulled by a tractor could do in hours what took Grandma and her siblings a week.

By the time she left school, age 17, she wasn’t needed on the farm. So she instead went to college, became a teacher, got married and raised a family. Now 93, she lives in a comfy suburban four-bedroom home, enjoys dining at restaurants, and loves going to the theatre and on ocean cruises. 
Her story is far from unique. Around the world industrialisation has reduced farm employment enormously. In the United States, for example, 40% of the
 labour force worked on farms in 1920; now it is about 2%
The loss of those jobs, and their replacement, is worth remembering as we now confront the “fourth industrial revolution”, with robots and artificial intelligence tipped to take up to 40% of the jobs now done by humans within two decades.

      Behind those headlines. Why not to rely on claims robots threaten half our jobs




The hit list is long, from drivers and call-centre workers to computer programmers and university lecturers like myself (we face being replaced by AI avatars, delivering animated content online).
But just as disappearing farm jobs didn’t lead to permanent mass unemployment, nor should we fear this next stage of technological development.
Improving quality of life
While industrial farming was not universally embraced as progress, the huge reductions in farming labour over the 20th century were key to a better life for most people (though poverty and glaring economic inequality still exist). 
To cite just one measure, when my grandmother was born the average life expectancy in Australia was 60 years. Now it’s more than 80.
The underlying forces driving such advances are twofold. 
First, the mechanisation of farming made food cheaper. US data shows the price of a common basket of groceries is now about 80% cheaper than a century ago. Similar trends exist for virtually every other consumable product. 
Second, spending less on food meant people could spend more on other things. New industries sprang up – automobiles, holidays, health care, finance, fitness and education and so on. Sectors virtually unknown in the 1920s now employ more than half of the population.





McKinsey



These new industries have both underpinned improvements in our quality of life and, crucially, created new jobs. 
As artificial intelligence and robotics develop, services such as banking, insurance and transport will become cheaper. As a consequence, we will have more money to spend on other items – on health and fitness, travel and leisure and possibilities yet to be conceived. 
Whatever these new or expanded industries are, jobs will evolve at the same time as quality of life improves for all.

Two lessons from my grandmother
None of this, of course, will necessarily make you feel better if you have (and love) a job under threat from automation. 
Some lessons from my grandma’s life may help. 
First, she didn’t take the changes personally. She understood that times were changing, and that she would have to change with them. She embraced the challenge rather than being defeated by it.

Second, she understood she had to develop new skills. At the same time as farm jobs were diminishing, she saw growing demand for more teachers, underpinned by government regulations requiring children to stay in school longer. So too today education is the key for future jobs.  
None of us know what the future holds. But for our collective future to replicate the advancements my grandmother has seen over her life, it’s inevitable that artificial intelligence and robots will take over jobs.
I asked grandma if we should be worried. “Life moves on,” she told me. 
And so must we.

Refereeing decisions at the World Cup have been debated decades later.

From whether the ball crossed the line in the final in 1966, through Diego Maradona’s “Hand of God” two decades later, to some of the decisions made by the video assistant referee at Russia 2018, any perceived mistake by the referee will be scrutinized by fans years later.


Referees need all the help they can get, and they could be about to be given a hand from artificial intelligence.

Over the past few years, FIFA has been trialing the use of limb-tracking offside technology, which uses AI along with a series of cameras around the stadium to follow players’ limbs and instantaneously creates virtual offside lines for referees. The technology has so far been used at the Club World Cup and FIFA Arab Cup, and FIFA expects it to be used at Qatar 2022.

Given all the issues with VAR, there could be some concerns about the use of AI in soccer.
But Dr. Patrick Lucey, chief scientist at sports data firm Stats Perform says that FIFA’s approach when it comes to limb-tracking is the right approach.
PROMOTED
He says that rather than a fully-automated decision, the AI is used to give precise measurements and create the offside lines that before would have to be drawn manually. This removes human error, but humans are still very much in the loop.
The referee or assistant referee can look at the image created by the AI and know straight away if a player is offside, but the human official can also use their own judgement to decide whether that player is interfering with play or if there is any other reason why the goal should be given or not.

Dr. Lucey says this approach combines “getting humans to do what they do really well and getting computers to do what they do really well”. That’s why FIFA’s referee committee chair Pierluigi Collina says this is not “robot offside”.

As the manual work is being done by a computer, and not a human, the decision won’t be as instantaneous as goal line technology but it should be a lot quicker than the current VAR, hopefully removing some of frustration caused by lengthy VAR decisions, as well as improving the referees’ overall decision making.

Dr. Lucey points out that player-tracking technology is nothing new, it’s been used in basketball for more than twenty years. But camera technology has improved with 4K and 8K cameras that have higher pixel density, and AI can now do things not possible before.
With more powerful AI and improvements in player-tracking technology, Dr. Lucey says that within the year, soccer data and metrics that used to be collected manually will be able to be captured directly from a live TV soccer broadcast without the need for other cameras in the venue.
While TV broadcasts don’t provide the quality for the live limb-tracking technology that is needed for accurate refereeing decisions, AI will soon be able to use TV broadcasts for real-time creation of statistics including expected goals and the estimated position of players not on screen. This is done using a footprint of player tracking data from the last twenty years combined with machine learning algorithms to estimate where the missing players are.
This technology can then be used on TV broadcasts of historical matches, collecting data from previous world cups, enabling statisticians to analyze England’s Golden Generation or Diego Maradona’s expected goals data.
One of those advanced stats that AI is able to create is called “ghosting”. This uses AI to work out whether players are in the position that they are expected to be in for particular situations. Clubs can use this to fix errors, like showing if a wingback is in the wrong position during a counter attack, or to find weaknesses in their opponents, by seeing what their players are likely to do in a certain situation.
As AI has made it possible to get create such statistics from a TV broadcast, this will make advanced statistics available to a much wider level of the game, so this could have even more of an impact than FIFA’s limb-tracking technology.

                  Artificial Intelligence
                













The last year was a busy one for Russia’s military and civilian artificial intelligence efforts. Moscow poured money into research and development, and Russia’s civil society debated the country’s place in the larger AI ecosystem. But Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February and the resulting sanctions have brought several of those efforts  to a halt—and thrown into question just how many of its AI advancements Russia will be able to salvage and continue. Ever since Putin extolled the development of robotic combat systems in the new State Armaments Program in 2020, the Russian Ministry of Defense has been hyper-focused on AI. We have learned more about the Russian military’s focus on AI in the past year thanks to several public revelations. But talk of AI has been muted since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Apart from the widespread use of UAVs for reconnaissance and target acquisition and a single display of a mine-clearing robot—all of which are remote-controlled—there is no overt evidence of Russian AI in C4ISR or decision-making among the Russian military forces, other than a single public deepfake attempt to discredit the Ukrainian government. That does not mean AI isn’t used, considering how Ukrainians are now utilizing artificial intelligence in data analysis—but there is a notable absence of larger discussion about this technology in open-source Russian media. The gap between Russian military aspirations for high-tech warfare of the future and the actual conduct of war today is becoming clear. In January 2021, Colonel-General Vladimir Zarudnitsky, the head of the Military Academy of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, wrote that the development and use of unmanned and autonomous military systems, the “robotization” of all spheres of armed conflict, and the development of AI for robotics will have the greatest medium-term effect on the Russian armed forces’ ability to meet their future challenges. Other MOD military experts also debated the impact of these emerging technologies on the Russian military and future balance of forces. Russia continued to upgrade and replace Soviet-made systems, part of the MOD’s drive from “digitization” (weapons with modern information technologies for C4ISR) to “intellectualization” (widespread implementation of AI capable of performing human-like creative thinking functions). These and other developments were covered in detail during Russia’s “Army-2021” conference, with AI as a key element in C4ISR at the tactical and strategic levels.

Meanwhile, Russian military developers and researchers worked on multiple AI-enabled robotics projects, including the “Marker” concept unmanned ground vehicle and its autonomous operation in groups and with UAVs.

Russian Scientists Say They Have A New System to Monitor Attacks on the Russian Internet


Toward the end of 2021, the state agency responsible for exporting Russian military technology even announced plans to offer unmanned aviation, robotics, and high-tech products with artificial intelligence elements to potential customers this year. The agency emphasized the equipment is geared toward defensive, border protection, and counter-terrorism capabilities.Since the invasion, things have changed. Russia’s defense-industrial complex—especially military high-tech and AI research and development—may be affected by the international sanctions and cascading effects of Russia being cut off from semi-conductor and microprocessor imports.Throughout 2021, the Russian government was pushing for the adoption of its AI civilian initiatives across the country, such as nationwide hackathons aimed at different age groups with the aim of making artificial intelligence familiar at home, work, and school. The government also pushed for the digital transformation of science and higher education, emphasizing the development of AI, big data, and the internet of things. Russian academic AI R&D efforts drove predictive analytics; development of chat bots that process text and voice messages and resolve user issues without human intervention; and technologies for working with biometric data. Russia’s development of facial recognition technology continued apace, with key efforts implemented across Moscow and other large cities. AI as a key image recognition and data analytical tool was used in many medical projects and efforts dealing with large data sets.Russian government officials noted their country’s efforts in promoting the ethics of artificial intelligence, and expressed confidence in Russia’s continued participation in this UN-sponsored work. The Russian Council for the Development of the Digital Economy has officially called for a ban on artificial intelligence algorithms that discriminate against people.Russia’s Ministry of Economic Development was asked to ""create a mechanism for assessing the humanitarian impact of the consequences of the introduction of such [AI] technologies, including in the provision of state and municipal services to citizens,"" and to prepare a ""road map"" for effective regulation, use, and implementation. According to the council, citizens should be able to appeal AI decisions digitally, and such a complaint should only be considered by a human. The council also proposed developing legal mechanisms to compensate for damage caused as a result of AI use.In October, Russia’s leading information and communications companies adopted the National Code of Ethics in the Field of AI; the code was recommended for all participants in the AI market, including government, business, Russian and foreign developers. Among the basic principles in the code are a human-centered approach to the development of this technology and the safety of working with data. AI workforce development was spelled out as a key requirement when the government officially unveiled the national AI roadmap in 2019. A 2021 government poll that tried to gauge the level of confidence in the government’s AI efforts showed that only about 64 percent of domestic AI specialists were satisfied with the working conditions in Russia.The survey reflected the microcosm of AI research, development, testing, and evaluation in Russia—lots of government activity and different efforts that did not automatically translate into a productive ecosystem conducive for developing AI, some major efforts notwithstanding.Among some of the reasons in 2021 that Russia was lagging behind in the development of artificial intelligence technologies were the personnel shortage and the weakness of the venture capital market. The civilian developer community also noted the low penetration of Russian products into foreign markets, dependence on imports, slow introduction of products into business and government bodies, and a weak connection between AI theory and practice. Russia’s likely plans to concentrate on these areas in 2022 were revised or put on hold once Russia invaded Ukraine. The sudden pull-out of major IT and high-tech companies from Russia, coupled with a rapid brain drain of Russia’s IT workers, and the ever-expanding high-tech sanctions against the Russian state may hobble domestic AI research and development for years to come. While the Russian government is trying to prop up its AI and high-tech industry with subsidies, funding, and legislative support, the impact of the above-mentioned consequences may be too much for the still-growing and evolving Russian AI ecosystem. That does not mean AI research and development will stop—on the contrary, many 2021 trends, efforts, and inventions are being implemented into the Russian economy and society in 2022, and there are domestic high-tech companies and public-private partnerships which are trying to fill the void left by the departed global IT majors. But the effects of the invasion will be felt in the AI ecosystem for a long time, especially with so many IT workers leaving the country, either because of the massive impact on the high-tech economy, or because they disagree with the war, or both.One of the most-felt sanctions aftereffects has been the severing of international cooperation on AI among Russian universities and research instructions, which earlier was enshrined as one of the most important drivers for domestic AI R&D, and reinforced by support from the Kremlin. For most high-tech institutions around the world, the impact of civilian destruction across Ukraine by the Russian military greatly outweighs the need to engage Russia on AI. At the same time, much of the Russian military AI R&D took place in a siloed environment—in many cases behind a classified firewall and without significant public-private cooperation—so it’s hard to estimate just how sanctions will affect Russian military AI efforts. While many in Russia now look to China as a substitute for departed global commercial relationships and products, it’s not clear if Beijing could fully replace the software and hardware products and services that left Russian markets at this point. Recent events may not stop Russian civilians and military experts from discussing how AI influences the conduct of war and peace—but the practical implementation of these deliberations may become increasingly more difficult for a country under global high-tech isolation.Samuel Bendett is an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security and an Adviser at the CNA Corporation.

On 4 April 2022, the Italian Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers and the Council of Europe co-organised the “High-Level Segment – Inaugural Meeting of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAI)”. This important event took place at the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rome and featured presentations on artificial intelligence and human rights by eminent academics, and representatives of States and international organisations.
Bjørn BERGE, Deputy Secretary General of the Council of Europe, in his opening speech noted the many novel challenges societies are facing through the use of AI systems in everyday life.
The high-level event was followed by the first meeting of the CAI (4-6 April 2022), which elected Mr Thomas SCHNEIDER (Switzerland) as its Chair. The Committee also held an exchange with Mr Gregor STROJIN (Slovenia), Vice-Chair elect, on the outcomes of the work of its predecessor the Ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI), which Mr STROJIN chaired, and examined the ways forward in elaborating an appropriate legal instrument on the development, design, and application of artificial intelligence, based on the Council of Europe’s standards on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and conducive to innovation.

They need to set up a foundation of empathy and connectedness.Artificial intelligence combined with a human-centric approach to marketing might seem like a contrarian model. But the truth is that machine learning, AI and automation are vital for brands today to transform data into empathetic, customer-centric experiences. For marketers, AI-based solutions serve as a scalable and customizable tool capable of understanding the motive behind consumer interactions. This is the power of artificial empathy: When brands target individual consumer needs and connect with them at a deeper level than mere transactional exchanges. When it comes to empathetic machines, Hollywood may have made us think of the likes of Wall-E: robots with emotions. But artificial empathy is fundamentally about giving technology the ability to discover and respond to human emotions. Artificial empathy and data applicationTechnology provides us with insights about what the customer has done, but also nuggets and nuances that help anticipate future needs. But to mine them means analyzing reams of data to detect wider patterns or evolving preferences. Businesses cannot just rely on research and data teams to glean what customers are throwing back at them. The need right now is to be active listeners with ears on the ground and an ability to respond in real time.Have you read?Does this artificial intelligence think like a human?Artificial intelligence is learning to interact with the world the way humans doWhy artificial intelligence is learning emotional intelligenceArtificial empathy in marketing begins with a consumer-centric perspective and is embodied in insights that reflect what data is being collected from a brand’s customers and what meaningful next steps should be taken. It combines data intelligence with artificial intelligence and predictive modelling tools for all critical moments, including websites, store visits, social media or customer service. Some examples: • AI can detect patterns of behaviour and alert consumers of price drops or new stock-keeping units for favourite items through notifications. • Delayed or wrongly addressed packages get an exclusive offer for the next order. Artificial empathy and the human touchThe digital consumer today is always on. Herein lies the opportunity to create exceptional experiences while retaining the hearts of consumers all the while. Many labs are designing software to understand and respond to how what humans say and how they feel. The applications of artificial empathy are wide-ranging, from market research to transportation to advertising to customer service. Humana Pharmacy, for example, used an empathetic AI service to help its call centre teams handle customers more efficiently through emotion analytics. The solution deciphers the emotions of clients through the mapping of behavioural patterns such as a delayed pause, a rise in speech speed, or tempo. The analysis is relayed to the teams in messages such as “speaking a little fast” or “relate to the customer a bit more”. Such examples of empathetic AI will increase in the future. Artificial empathy is beneficial to advertisers in understanding how customers emotionally connect to the brand. Insights can be utilized to evolve content and messaging to help optimize campaign performance. Machine learning algorithms combined with consumer behaviour can offer suggestions for improving campaign performance. Such algorithms can be deployed to fine-tune demand forecasting and price sensitivity across target segments along with providing information on purchase behaviour. But while artificial empathy can help businesses create more effective interactions, it cannot replace human interaction. The primary requisite that makes AI effective is human insight, contextual awareness, nuances and creativity. Businesses must identify appropriate use cases of artificial empathy, and can then strategically implement its use into the services that they provide to customers. The human touch combined with machine intelligence can drive greater return on investment for targeted campaigns.The impact on marketingMarketers need to use artificial empathy to create campaigns that are humanized and not just mass-targeted. Here is where it can be utilized to comprehend business needs and harness data that can be distilled in simple terms. Campaigns can then be focused on providing beneficial content to customers after understanding the pain points and challenges of the customer. With evolving market conditions and constant disruption, brands must demonstrate empathy. Those who fail to appreciate the consumer predicament can fail to communicate in an appropriate tone and risk entrenching negative perceptions of their brand in the consumer’s mind. An insightful survey by Dassault Systems with independent research firm CITE revealed that younger consumers prefer personalization that enhances the product experience or their quality of life. They are also ready to pay extra and share their data to get it. Large volumes of unstructured data can be difficult to manage. But this technique allows marketing teams to react accordingly with relative ease. It can also be used to compare product features. Features and attributes that resonate with the target audience can be introduced or enhanced. It can also automatically differentiate between emotions and attitudes and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral using ML (machine learning) and natural language processing (NLP).DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

Can artificial intelligence own copyright?
This question has come to the fore as technological advances lead to scenarios far beyond the imagination of those who crafted most of our current jurisprudence on copyright. Ownership of copyright by nonhumans is not allowed in China, but increasing AI capabilities could spur changes in legal thinking.
According to the Copyright Law, “the author of a work is a natural person who creates the work.” Under certain circumstances, a legal person or unincorporated organization may be considered a work’s author. There is nothing in the law, however, that would support the proposition that computer systems can be treated as authors for copyright purposes.
In the landmark Shenzhen Tencent v. Shanghai Yingxun case, the Nanshan District People’s Court considered whether an article written by Tencent’s AI software Dreamwriter was entitled to copyright protection. The court found that it was, with copyright vesting in Dreamwriter’s developers, not Dreamwriter itself. In its decision, the court noted that “the arrangement and selection of the creative team in terms of data input, trigger condition setting, template and corpus style choices are intellectual activities that have a direct connection with the specific expression of the article.” These intellectual activities were carried out by the software developers.
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has distinguished between works that are generated without human intervention (“AI-generated”) and works generated with material human intervention and/or direction (“AI-assisted”). In the case of AI-assisted works, artificial intelligence is arguably just a tool used by humans. Vesting of copyright in the humans involved in these cases is consistent with existing copyright law, just as an artist owns the copyright to a portrait made using a paintbrush or a song recorded using a guitar. The scenario in the Tencent case falls in the AI-assisted bucket, with Dreamwriter being the tool.
China’s current copyright law does not provide for nonhuman ownership of copyright
As mentioned above, China’s current copyright law does not provide for nonhuman ownership of copyright, regardless of whether the work is AI-generated or AI-assisted. This said, it does not follow that copyright in an AI-generated work must by default be owned by a human. While future AI-generated output may constitute works from a copyright law standpoint, these works may be ineligible for copyright protection due to their lack of human authorship.
This approach would be consistent with longstanding principles of copyright law. Yet it could lead to results that are undesirable, at least from the perspective of the companies developing AI, and possibly government authorities looking for the industry to be a driver of growth. Further advances in the field could inevitably lead to a growing amount of works that cannot be copyrighted, making it difficult, if not impossible, to monetize them. Given this scenario, it would be understandable if copyright law was revisited.
Zhou Bo, senior judge of the Supreme People’s Court IPR Division, has suggested that the adoption of such changes could just be a matter of time. According to Zhou, “AI has not yet developed to a level where it is truly free from human involvement in the generation of relevant products.” However,
as for the copyright protection for those autonomously generated products of AI without any human intervention, we have to be patiently monitoring the progress of technology. It is still a bit early to draw conclusions.
This is not to say that in the future China will recognize computer systems as copyright owners. A more likely outcome is for the concept of authorship to be extended, allowing copyright in AI-generated works to vest in the developers of the underlying AI, just as with AI-assisted works. This would not mark a radical departure from the traditional copyright framework. Regardless of the level of autonomy AI achieves, its outputs will still be traced back to human intelligence, however remote in time.
In sum, we may eventually see the recognition of some form of AI copyright ownership, but in a way that provides rights to certain humans. Of course, if AI develops sufficiently, Dreamwriter’s descendants may start lawyering up to enforce their own rights in court!

It’s not new that the emerging artificial intelligence technology aims to take over the writing space.
High-end and intermediate writers have expressed cynical views and even fears over the AI writing software introduction.
For proponents of the AI writing application, it’s not so! According to them, the concept behind the creation is to help lessen the workload of writers.
In the meantime, the number of AIs has surpassed expectations. From small companies to big names in tech, AIs are attempting to become the next big thing for content marketing. 
In fact, due to the improvement in its machine language and data analytics, some companies prefer AI content marketing. 
This begs the question, is AI the future of writing? Or will it replace the human writing form?
Read on!
For a start, how does an Artificial intelligence Writing tool work?
If you’ve been wondering what goes on behind every AI, it’s simple, a machine language. 
AI writing tools use natural language generation to produce written words from mere data. You just input data in, and the rest is history. 
An AI is effective when a large amount of data needs conversion into written language that anyone can understand. 
Are more AIs being produced?
Scientists didn’t stop at a mere natural language generation; more work began after the discovery in 2016. 
They rebranded and created a more advanced AI that didn’t need data labeling while saving time and money. 
In May 2020, another model was created. It’s called OpenAIs GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3). 
This new and advanced machine language is the largest neural network globally. The machine has a model with over 175 million parameters.
The GPT-3 is different from other AIs because it processes information like the human thinking faculty. 
It executes tasks like answering questions, filling in blanks, publishing articles, writing songs, jokes, and even questions about the philosophical aspect of life! 
There are even better and more advanced ALs being created. In particular, some companies have copied the language system of the OpenAIs GTP-3 and made better improvements. 
In May 2020, Google launched a new chatbot called LAMDA. It’s designed to hold meaningful, emotional, and intellectual conversations. 
What’s more, Beijing has attempted to create the first living AI. In June 2020, the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) launched a new AI called Wu Dao 2.0. 
The AI gave “life” to its first virtual student, Hua Zhubing to write songs and codes and possess a large memory. 
Is Artificial intelligence writing tools the future of writing?
This has become a lingering question in every writer’s mind and probably a writer’s worst fear, especially writers in the business of content writing or copywriting.
While AI technology keeps advancing, it’s arguably not going to be the future of writing. 
Writers are more skilled in capturing the essence and reader perception. It’ll take years of research for any AI to exhibit such traits. An AI can’t write emphatically as a human would. 
Although AI has shown great dexterity and expertise in writing, there are still major gaps that can’t be filled. 
Below are a few reasons why writers need not worry about AIs for now:
Uniqueness
An AI lacks the uniqueness human writers bring to their articles. It’s an intricate factor that distinguishes the pro from the amateur. 
AIs may be perfect for data gathering and analyzing complex words but possess poor creative analytics. 
They poorly express themselves due to a lack of cognition and emotion. Only humans can process such complexities. 
Editing
AIs produce whatever you run into them. The process is like garbage in garbage out. 
The workload still falls on a human to carefully reread and edit AI-generated articles. 
Engagement
Yes, it might be difficult to detect an AI-written article. However, AIs struggle to compose coherent and engaging content to captivate readers. Engagement is the footstone of every good content. 
Writers are more skilled in capturing the essence of every article. It may take years of research for AIs to exhibit such traits. 
Ambiguousness
If there’s one thing an AI greatly lacks in information presentation, it’s a lack of direct and multiple evaluations. 
For instance, an AI can’t interpret a proverb or an idiom. They aren’t recognizable in data analysis. 
Also, they can’t differentiate between the linguistic complexities, like when not to use offensive words.
New hope for writers?
For now, human writers have nothing to worry about. AIs and humans can coexist symbiotically without one dominating the other. 
Though many believe it’s economical and more reliable than human writers. However, the barrier to the above statement is the cost of an AI to start up. Only big tech companies can afford excellent and effective AI writing tools. 
The risk-on human writers are quite low. However, it shouldn’t stop you from honing your skill!  
Final Say
Sam Altman, CEO of Open AIs, in a tweet published in early June 2021, stated that AIs might likely affect physical jobs more than remote jobs such as coding, writing, administrative jobs, and co.
Whether we like it or not, AIs are here to stay. We can’t fight them. However, we can create a means to incorporate them into the physical fold without any job losses. 
They immensely contribute to accelerating a writer’s process and simplifying the workload.
We already use low-resource AIs like Grammarly and plagiarism checkers. Still, human editors and proofreaders are thriving.

As she was looking for a camp last summer, Yabesra Ewnetu, who’d just finished eighth grade, found a reference to MIT’s FutureMakers Create-a-thon. Ewnetu had heard that it’s hard to detect bias in artificial intelligence because AI algorithms are so complex, but this didn’t make sense to her. “I was like, well, we’re the ones coding it, shouldn’t we be able to see what it’s doing and explain why?” She signed up for the six-week virtual FutureMakers program so she could delve into AI herself.
FutureMakers is part of the MIT-wide Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education (RAISE) initiative launched earlier this year. RAISE is headquartered in the MIT Media Lab and run in collaboration with MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and MIT Open Learning.
MIT piloted FutureMakers to students from all over the United States last year in two formats.
During one-week, themed FutureMakers Workshops organized around key topics related to AI, students learn how AI technologies work, including social implications, then build something that uses AI.
And during six-week summer Create-a-Thons, middle school and high school students do a deep dive into AI and coding for four weeks, then take two weeks to design an app for social good. The Create-a-Thon culminates in a competition where teams present their ideas and prototypes to an expert panel of judges.
“We want to remove as many barriers as we possibly can to support diverse students and teachers,” says Cynthia Breazeal, a professor of media arts and sciences at MIT who founded the Media Lab’s Personal Robots Group and also heads up the RAISE initiative. All RAISE programs are free for educators and students. The courses are designed to meet students and teachers where they are in terms of resources, comfort with technology, and interests.
But it’s not all about learning to code.
“AI is shaping our behaviors, it’s shaping the way we think, it’s shaping the way we learn, and a lot of people aren’t even aware of that,” says Breazeal. “People now need to be AI literate given how AI is rapidly changing digital literacy and digital citizenship.”
The one-week FutureMaker Workshops are offered year-round. MIT trains teachers or people who work at STEM educational organizations so they can bring the tools and project-based hands-on curriculum and activities to their students. One year in, MIT has trained 60 teachers who have given workshops to more than 300 students, many from underserved and under-represented communities across the United States. Teachers and mentors choose from among four workshop themes for their training: Conversational AI, Dancing With AI, Creativity and AI, and How to Train Your Robot.
MIT worked with Lili’uokalani Trust in Hawaii to teach the How to Train Your Robot workshop during a spring break program on the remote islands of Moloka’i and Lana’i.
When the trust visited the MIT Media Lab on an East Coast study tour, “we were immediately inspired by the vast array of AI and STEM programs and decided to pilot How to Train Your Robot,” says Lili’uokalani Trust program manager Kau’ilani Arce.
The workshop introduced students to AI, image classification, and algorithmic bias, and taught them to program robots using a custom block-based coding environment built using the Scratch programming language, which was developed at the Media Lab.
On the first day, “we learned about algorithmic bias and how it can lead to deeply rooted issues, such as social and racial injustices,” Arce says. “It was a wonderful opportunity to critically think about how Native Hawaiians are equally represented in algorithms we use daily.”
The best moment for sixth-grader Yesmine Kiroloss: “When I got to program my robot!”
For students without previous AI experience, it took grit to understand the correlation between a coding environment and a functioning robot, says Arce. “There was an overwhelming sense of accomplishment.”
MIT collaborated with SureStart, a startup aimed at mentoring high school and college students in AI, for the first six-week FutureMakers Create-a-thon last summer.
The Create-a-Thon had two tracks: an MIT App Inventor track with 30 students including Ewnetu, and a Deep Learning track with 45. The 78 students hailed from more than 20 states and just over two-thirds were female.
For the first four weeks students worked in groups of eight with two graduate student mentors who summarized each day’s lessons and held office hours so the students could ask questions.
In the final two weeks, the students applied what they’d learned to create something with societal or environmental impact.
A key step was plotting out a minimum viable product: a web or mobile app that contained the minimum elements needed to illustrate their idea.
At the end of the six weeks, 15 teams of four students and a mentor showed off their ideas in an entrepreneurial-style pitch competition judged by experts form academia and industry.
Ewnetu’s team, Team Dyadic, built a prediction model to warn people about wildfires. The idea was inspired by a team member from California. The team bootstrapped a website, collected a dataset, trained a machine language model, and added an interactive map. “Our code is a prediction of how close the current conditions are to a fire condition,” says Ewnetu, who’s now a first-year student at Justice High School in Falls Church, Virginia.
The team members had a mix of experience. “There were people in the class who had a lot of [coding] experience and there were people in the class like me who had very little to no experience,” says Ewnetu. She needed a lot of help from the mentors in the first couple of weeks, but then everything clicked, she says. “It went from like an error every other line to an error maybe every other section.”
Ewnetu “is the perfect embodiment of what happens when you just provide people with support,” says SureStart founder Taniya Mishra. “[Having] high expectations is a good thing, especially if you can provide a lot of scaffolding.”
Team Dyadic made the finals. “To see all of our work culminate and then pay off just made us feel like winners,” Ewnetu says.
Meanwhile, Team Youth of Tech created the Vividly app, which allows parents to input questions for their child. When the child logs in, the app asks if they’re happy, sad, frustrated or angry, a bot named Viviana asks the questions, and the child communicates with the bot, knowing the parents can see the conversation.
The idea is to give kids a way to be open with their parents in a very comfortable environment, says Bella Baidak, a first-year masters of information student at Cornell Tech in New York City, and the team’s mentor.
“It’s a form of facilitating better communication so they can talk more,” says team member Netra Rameshbabu, now a first-year at Matea Valley High School in Aurora, Illinois.
“Our idea was to make this a routine, like brushing your teeth.”
Team Youth of Tech made the finals, then won. When they announced Team Youth, “I was screaming I was so excited! I was in tears. I was in joy,” says Rameshbabu.
The mentees did “a brilliant job,” says Kunjal Panchal, head mentor and PhD student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. “They know how to use AI and they know how to use it for the common good.”
This year’s six-week FutureMakers program starts July 6. Middle, high school, and undergraduate students can apply here.
Teachers can reach out to RAISE to learn about the one-week training workshops.
Students and teachers can also get started with AI this May 13 during the Day of AI. Students and their teachers from all over the country can learn about AI literacy through a modular, hands-on curriculum that supports up to four hours of learning per grade track. The Day of AI format can be taught by teachers with a wide range of technology backgrounds and are designed to be accessible to all students.
This year’s Day of AI, on May 13, includes teaching materials for upper elementary through high school. The program will eventually span all of K-12. Teachers can register here for a two-hour Day of AI teacher training program. Teaching materials are available under a Creative Commons license.
For this year's Day of AI, students in grades 3 to 5 will learn about datasets, algorithms, predictions and bias, and will create an AI application that can tell the difference, say, between an image of a dog and that of a cat. Middle school students will learn about generative adversarial networks, which can produce both deepfakes and art. High school students will learn about the recommendation systems used by social media and their implications for individuals and for society. Students and their teachers can register here to participate.

Robotics: which jobs will disappear with robotization?

A team of roboticists from the EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) and economists from the University of Lausanne has developed a method that calculates the probability that a job will be automated by robotics. This tool also suggests less risky job changes. The study, titled ” How to compete with robots by assessing the risks of task automation and resilient alternatives,” was published in Sciences Robotics.
The fourth industrial revolution emerged in 2011. Artificial intelligence and robotics have enabled the design of increasingly autonomous robots that can replace humans in their tasks.
A profound transformation of the entire economic and production system is taking shape, raising questions about the nature of the jobs that will disappear. This is the subject of a study by a team from the EPFL and the University of Lausanne, which has designed a tool that proposes professional reorientation towards less exposed jobs that require little retraining.
Professor Dario Floreano, director of the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at EPFL and head of this study at EPFL, explains:
“There are already different studies that predict the number of jobs that will soon be robotized, but they all focus on software robots, such as voice and image recognition, robot financial advisors, dialoguers, etc. Moreover, these predictions vary widely depending on job requirements and software capabilities. Our study considers not only artificial intelligence software, but also actual intelligent robots that perform physical work. We developed a method that systematically compares human and robotic capabilities required in hundreds of jobs.”

Assessing the risk of automation

To assess the automation risk index (ARI) of each job, the researchers referred to the Occupation Information Network (O*NET), a U.S. market database of 967 job profiles. For each job, O*NET provides a profile composed of a list of required abilities, skills and knowledge. The researchers selected 87 human capabilities.
In addition to human capabilities, they also studied a set of robotic capabilities that robots and AI are already capable of performing or will be able to perform in the future. For this, they used a list of capabilities defined in the SPARC Multi-Annual Report (MAR), a document published by SPARC, a public-private partnership between the European Commission and EU-robotics, which represents the European robotics industry. After selectively matching human capabilities from the O*net list to robotic capabilities in the MAR document, the team was able to calculate the likelihood for each existing job to be performed by a robot.
The study classified the 967 jobs: physicists are the least likely to be replaced by a robot, while people working in slaughterhouses are at the highest risk. In general, jobs in the food industry, building and maintenance, construction and mining seem to be the most exposed to robotization.
The authors then created a method to find the conversion for any job that has a significantly lower risk of automation, while being close to the original job in terms of skills and knowledge required. To do this, they used data on the U.S. workforce and simulated thousands of job conversions based on the algorithm’s suggestions.
Professor Rafael Lalive, who co-led the study at the University of Lausanne, concludes:
“Today, the major challenge for society is to prepare to deal with automation. Our work provides detailed career advice to workers facing high risks of automation, allowing them to choose safer jobs while reusing many of the skills they acquired in their previous jobs. With this advice, governments can help society become more resilient to automation.”

Artificial Intelligence is seen by many as a great transformative tech.  Will AI systems one day drive us around? Do our laundry? Mow our lawn? Raise our kids?  Fight wars? Write these articles? Create political advertisements? These questions make people shift from thinking purely about the functional capabilities to the ethics behind creating such powerful and potentially life-consequential technologies.  As such, it makes sense to spend time considering what we want these systems to do and make sure we address ethical questions now so that we build these systems with the common good of humanity in mind.


Will AI replace human workers?

The most immediate concern for many is that AI-enabled systems will replace workers across a wide range of industries. AI brings mixed emotions and opinions when referenced in the context of jobs. However, it’s becoming increasingly clear that AI is not a job killer, but rather, a job category killer. As has happened with every wave of technology, from the automatic weaving looms of the early industrial revolution to the computers of today we see that jobs are not destroyed, but rather employment shifts from one place to another and entirely new categories of employment are created. We can and should expect the same in the AI-enabled economy. Research and experience is showing that it’s inevitable that AI will replace entire categories of work, especially in transportation, retail, government, professional services employment, and customer service. On the other hand, companies will be freed up to put their human resources to much better, higher value tasks instead of taking orders, fielding simple customer service requests or complaints, or data entry related tasks. 

Indeed, the move to this new age of digital transformation is creating concerns about labor displacement, with or without the power of AI. All AI is doing is hastening digital transformation across particular business processes. As companies are looking to adapt and implement AI strategies we think it’s important to have open and honest conversations with your employees. In particular, experience and research is showing that companies that adopt augmented intelligence approaches, where AI is augmenting and helping humans to do their jobs better, rather than fully replacing the human, not only shows faster and more consistent ROI for organizations, but also is welcomed much more warmly by employees. People feel more comfortable working with machines instead of being replaced by machines.

The rise of fake media and disinformation: Will AI make this worse?
AI systems are getting really good at creating fake images, videos, conversations, and all manner of content. We already have trouble believing everything we hear, see, and read.  What happens when you can no longer tell if an image is real or AI-generated or if you’re talking to a bot or a real person? It’s been widely reported that bots had a role to play in the 2016 US Presidential elections spreading political propaganda. These automated social media accounts helped create and spread misinformation on the internet attempting to manipulate voters and fueling the fire of partisan disagreement. Unlike humans, bots never tire working 24/7 and can generate a very large amount of content in a very short period of time. Once shared and re-tweeted with others this news starts to go viral, true or not, and is virtually unstoppable. These bots are effective at spreading false or heavily altered facts, amplifying messages, and putting thoughts and ideas into people’s heads. Criminals and state actors can use fake imagery or audio to cause personal or business harm or to interfere with government operations. Now all it takes is a few malicious actors spreading false claims to traumatically alter public opinion and quickly shift the public’s view.
Governments and corporations alike will have to think about how they will reign in the potential damage done by AI-enabled content creation. In fact, we encourage companies and governments to consider fake content to be as malicious as cybersecurity threats and respond appropriately. Propaganda, disinformation, malicious interference, blackmail, and other forms of “information crime” can be just as harmful as physical and electronic attacks on systems. The world is very much unprepared for AI being unleashed on unprotected citizens. Corporations who freely traffic in user-generated content are just as liable as governments to curb abuse.

Do we want evil people to have easy access to AI technology?
While AI can do a lot of good we must be mindful about AI in the hands of malicious users. As technology continues to become more powerful, AI can cause severe damage if used maliciously. What happens when individuals, criminal organizations, and rogue countries apply AI to malicious ends?  Many companies are already asking themselves these questions and starting to take action to safeguard against malicious AI attacks.  New technologies can exploit the vulnerability of systems that are dependent on AI and machine learning technologies. As these AI systems get smarter they can change the nature of threats, making them harder to detect, more random in appearance, more adaptive to systems and environments, and more efficient at identifying and targeting vulnerabilities in systems. This should be terrifying. We need to immediately start thinking about how we are constructing and managing our digital infrastructure as well as how we design and distribute AI systems. Detecting these malicious attacks will only get harder over time.

In addition, machine learning service providers, especially on-demand cloud-based services should be mindful of who their customers are. If malicious users are using their platforms to perform distributed AI-enabled attacks or other criminal acts, then like financial institutions, governments will start cracking down on these providers and impose new forms of “Know Your Customer (KYC)” regulations. If these platform providers don’t want to be on the wrong end of the regulatory cycle, they need to get ahead of the curve and start their own efforts to make sure they know who their customers are and what they are doing on their platforms.

Is pervasive surveillance already here? Is AI our new Big Brother?
AI enables companies and governments to keep constant tabs on what humans are doing in an automated and intelligent fashion. Will a future with AI mean an end to privacy? Will “Big Brother” really always be watching? As facial recognition technologies continue to advance it’s getting easier to detect individuals from a large crowd of people at stadiums, parks, and public spaces without their permission. In 2018 Microsoft urged Congress to study it and oversee the use of facial recognition technology. Bradford Smith, the company’s president said “We live in a nation of laws, and the government needs to play an important role in regulating facial recognition technology”.  What’s striking about this statement is that tech giants rarely advocate regulation of their innovations, so for Microsoft to be urging the US Congress to regulate facial recognition they must already see how this technology can be misused.
In an AI-enabled future we assume that everyone and everything will have knowledge about everyone else. This means that the assumption will be that everyone already knows who we are, what we want, where we are, and what we’re doing. This pervasive knowledge will become part of the assumption of where we are, just like we are now expecting to be able to get Internet, electricity, and information whenever and wherever we need it without excuse. No longer will we be able to just “un-plug” for a while. We may quickly move to a world where just a few companies and government have an uncomfortable amount of knowledge and level of control over the lives of everyone.
Will intelligent machines have rights?
As machines become more intelligent and we ask more and more of our machines, how should they be treated and viewed in society? Once machines can actually simulate emotion and act similar to human beings, how should they be governed?  Should we consider machines as humans, animals, or inanimate objects? To this point, to what level do we ascribe liability and responsibility to the devices themselves over the people that are supposedly in control of them? In March 2018 an autonomous vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian. People were outraged that a machine killed a human being.
But why were people outraged by this accident? Thousands of people are killed every day in motor vehicle accidents caused by humans at the wheel. What difference should it make that it was a machine driving the vehicle? The reason for this outrage is because society hasn’t, and may never accept, when a machine kills a human. However, the likelihood of eliminating all traffic-related fatalities is almost certainly zero percent. As such, if we want autonomous vehicles on the road this scenario will happen again, and again. Despite perhaps dramatic evidence that machine-driven vehicles have overall far lower fatality rates than human-driven vehicles, the issue of liability and control is primarily one of ethics. So we need to be asking these questions, figuring out what we can accept and what’s ethical, and put laws and regulations in place now to safeguard against future tragedies.
Creating transparency in AI decision-making
There are many approaches used in machine learning, however, no machine algorithm has re-invigorated the AI market quite like deep learning. Deep learning, however, is a “black box”. We aren’t really sure how deep learning works and this can be a big problem when we rely on this technology to make critical decisions such as loan applications, who gets paroled, and who gets hired. AI systems that are unexplainable should not be acceptable, especially in high risk situations. Explainable AI needs to be part of the equation if we want to have AI systems we can trust.
Deep learning relies heavily on training data. So it should be no surprise then that when biased training data is used to teach these systems the results are biased AI systems. People wrongly assume that the training data is always “clean”, from a large pool, and represents society as a whole but results have proved this is not the case. Google’s image recognition system wrongly classified images of minorities, the Apple Card which is administered by Goldman Sachs has come under recent scrutiny for gender bias, and software used to sentence criminals was found to be biased against minorities. If we are going to use machine learning algorithms to make any sort of worthwhile decision we must demand that it be able to explain itself. Would you really allow a human driver to hit your car and when you question why they did that they have no answer? Of course you wouldn’t. We shouldn’t accept this from machines either!
Taking steps to resolve these issues
If we don’t ask ourselves these questions now and build ethical AI, implications down the road can be far more grim than people realize. Do we really trust companies to do the right thing? Do we trust governments to do the right thing? We’d like to think that with public input and ethical questions and concerns brought up now, that we can create a future that isn’t so grim. There will always be bad actors who try to influence, infiltrate, and manipulate. Enterprises, organizations, and citizens should keep asking questions, keep working towards building ethical AI, and keep trying to fight automated bots and malicious attacks because AI is coming whether or not we’re ready.

						UCF NanoScience Technology Center Assistant Professor Tania Roy and Electrical and Computer Engineering doctoral student Adithi Krishnaprasad are working to give technology brain-like computing power.  					








Researchers at the University of Central Florida are developing new devices that will allow artificial intelligence (AI) to work from anywhere, without connecting to the internet.
This means technology ranging from natural language processing programs, like Siri or Alexa to robots and other advanced applications, could work in remote regions of the globe or even on other planets.
The researchers’ latest findings, which demonstrated a new technique to create the advanced devices, were published in a new study in the journal ACS Nano.
Currently AI depends on connections to remote servers to perform the heavy computing and complex calculations needed to run AI processing or perform unsupervised learning, says study principal investigator Tania Roy, an assistant professor in UCF’s NanoScience Technology Center.
“Our goal is to make the artificial intelligence circuitry very small and compact,” Roy says. “That way technology like portable, handheld devices can have the circuitry on them and don’t need an internet connection. They can operate in remote areas, and have all of those functionalities, like image search or voice understanding, from any place on Earth.”
And while smart phone voice assistants are current technology that could benefit from having brain-like computing power as part of their hardware, robots are another.
“If somebody is stuck in a remote area, then the robots now will have the capacity of functioning and going to that remote area and rescuing the human being,” Roy says. “Or if we have elderly parents living alone in their homes, we can have devices that can monitor their health conditions all the time and give them some triage if something goes wrong. We would feel much more at peace if there is something to take care of them.”
For space exploration, this means robots, such as rovers, wouldn’t need a person telling them what to do.
“What happens now is that because the devices are not capable of doing unsupervised learning there is a supervisor,” Roy says. “We have to tell them what to do in the environment. But after years in space, rovers will need the power of unsupervised learning to adapt to changing environments.”
The complex, neuromorphic — or brain-like —devices the researchers have created are placed upon small, rectangular chips, about an inch wide.
The devices that UCF researchers are developing will allow artificial intelligence to work from anywhere, without connecting to the internet.
Although other researchers have worked to develop this type of technology, the UCF-developed devices are more reliable due to the unique engineering and nanoscale materials they used, says the study’s lead author, Adithi Krishnaprasad ’18MS, a doctoral student in UCF’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
“We grew the material in a different way compared to how other labs grow it,” Krishnaprasad says.
“We did not grow it on some other substrate and then transfer it, rather, we grew it on the main chip itself,” she says. “We fabricated within the same platform, so that reduced the anomalies brought in by the chemistry when transfer is used. So, we completely avoided that. By using this different technique, we have changed the way the current moves through the device. This provides better reliability by reducing variability within the device.”
The team’s advancements allow for parallelism and in-memory computing, similar to the brain, that’s required for AI and unsupervised learning, the researchers say.
The critical task of growing, or synthesizing, the nanoscale material on the chip was performed by UCF researcher Eric Jung’s group. Jung is a study co-author and an assistant professor with UCF Materials Science & Engineering, NanoScience Technology Center, and Electrical & Computer Engineering.
For their next steps, the researchers will work to further advance the technology, including building networks with the devices to enable new applications, such as image recognition.
The chips could appear in modern technology in the next 10 years, the researchers say.
Study co-authors also included Durjoy Dev ’21PhD, a graduate of UCF’s doctoral program in electrical engineering; Sang Sub Han and Changhyeon Yoo, both postdoctoral associates in the Jung Research Group at UCF; Yaqing Shen, with the Institute of Functional Nano & Soft Materials, Soochow University, Suzhou, China; Hee-Suk Chung and Tae-Sung Bae, both with the Analytical Research Division, Korea Basic Science Institute; and Mario Lanza, with the Department of Material Science and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.
Roy joined UCF in 2016 and is a part of the NanoScience Technology Center with a joint appointment in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Physics. Her recent National Science Foundation CAREER award focuses on the development of devices for artificial intelligence applications. Roy was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Berkeley prior to joining UCF. She received her doctorate in electrical engineering from Vanderbilt University.

How Governments are Changing the World with HPC and AI 

April 11, 2022
Sponsored Content by Dell Technologies 

A nation’s global competitiveness depends on its ability to harness high performance computing (HPC) for innovation. Here’s how HPC, bolstered by data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), is helping governments tackle our most complex issues, from medical mysteries and world hunger to interplanetary research.

How can we best protect citizens? How can we help Veterans walk again? How can we help create a more sustainable future?
These are just a few of the countless big questions spiraling through the universe. But each represents a complex computational problem that high performance computing (HPC) is hard at work to solve.
HPC empowers governments to improve the lives and safety of citizens along with their global competitiveness. Combining massive compute power and storage capacity, HPC can process billions of bits of data every second to drive scientific discoveries, improve military outcomes, and create commercial innovation. An HPC foundation is necessary for heavy-duty data analytics that use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to generate real-time, often predictive insights and enable automated actions.
Increasingly, a nation’s use of HPC reflects its global economic posture. By modeling complex behavior, HPC fuels breakthroughs in everything from aerospace development to cryptography and weapons design. The ability to process and analyze massive datasets in real time presents limitless possibilities for bettering the world around us.
Nuclear stockpile management
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) uses HPC to protect nuclear weapons. HPC simulation and modeling have become critical since the discontinuation of underground U.S. nuclear testing in the 1990s. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory plans to begin expanding processing power for its computational scientists and those at Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories this year with 40 petaflops of HPC in next-generation Dell PowerEdge servers.
The agency said its HPC expansion, expected to last through 2025, will increase compute capacity for NNSA’s Advanced Simulation and Computing program by three to four times and enable higher-fidelity 2D and 3D simulations.
Medical breakthroughs
The Cineca scientific consortium’s Human Brain Project of uses HPC to advance the field of neuroscience and develop robotics with more human-like intelligence. About 90 European and international research institutes, including a U.S. federal lab, participate.
Dell PowerEdge servers powered by Intel® Xeon® Platinum processors and Intel Optane™ memory run enhanced brain simulation software that scientists have used to enable paraplegics to regain the ability to walk with brain-stimulation treatments. The same software is helping regulate the unstable blood pressure that’s common in victims of spinal cord injuries.
Another medical science project at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) in Phoenix  uses Dell Technologies HPC systems and storage to create a full genome in just 24 hours. Sequencing the first human genome was completed in 2003 and took 13 years. HPC enables the institute to quickly identify a gene mutation, make a diagnosis, and begin developing a treatment.
Weather and climate insights
Mother Nature creates concerns ranging from dressing for inclement weather to protecting the future viability of planet Earth. The U.S.’s NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) provides HPC and data services to global weather and climate researchers. Its arsenal includes an HPC cluster built with hundreds of Dell PowerEdge servers for enabling large-scale analysis that helps researchers better understand issues such as how vulnerable or resilient various ecosystems are to environmental change.
In the shorter term, modeling gives forecasters a clearer view of the intensity, direction, and speed of a storm. Given that the U.S. now generally experiences extreme weather more frequently, these programs help governments adopt smarter disaster preparedness and recovery plans that help save lives, improve safety, and minimize damage.
Feeding the world
Between 720 and 811 million people faced hunger in 2020, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. On the forefront of agricultural transformation, New Jersey-based AeroFarms works to alleviate the systemic food crisis with indoor farming locations around the world.
It uses Dell Technologies HPC solutions, data analytics, and ML to model different types of plants and create a 100%-controlled environment that grows crops 365 days a year, unencumbered by traditional seasonal limitations. It reports having grown more than 850 different varieties of crops and estimates having achieved 390X greater productivity than commercial farming while using 95% less water.
Life on other planets?
In its quest to determine the habitability of Mars, for example, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shares data and analytics from its interstellar space missions with members of the scientific community and the public. The NASA Perseverance rover has been gathering telemetry sensor data, photos, and audio content from the Red Planet since February 2021. NASA aggregates hundreds of terabytes of interplanetary data in Dell PowerScale and Unity storage.
NASA correlates and analyzes Perseverance data in combination with data from its 30 years of space missions to advance our understanding of Mars and its potential for one day supporting human life. Scientists have discovered evidence of water, ice, and snow, for example, that the agency says are possible indicators that the planet once hosted microbial life.
These are a few ways governments and commercial enterprises are competing in the global economy using HPC and AI technologies. Visit delltechnologies.com/federal and delltechnologies.com/hpc to learn more.

Artificial intelligence is already ubiquitous in our lives and will be foundational to our future prosperity. In Australia, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has identified AI and machine learning as critical technologies of national interest. AI applications are wide-ranging and encompass many sectors, including agriculture, education, energy, finance, health care, manufacturing, transport and telecommunications.
As a general-purpose technology, AI applications in those domains may also have implications for defence and security. Indeed, the Australian Defence Force’s ability to understand the operational environment, manoeuvre and project force will be transformed through advances in AI and human–machine partnerships, employing dual-use and defence-specific AI applications.
Innovation in AI is accelerating, creating opportunities to grow the economy, solve challenging problems, accelerate discovery and enhance national security. It’s estimated that AI could exceed $20 trillion in worth to the global economy by 2030. This potential for transformative impact, and the competitive advantages offered by AI, are being actively pursued around the world. More than 30 countries and regions had published AI strategies or similar documents by December 2020; the world’s top universities are increasing their investment in AI education; and private investment in AI continues to grow. This ongoing expansion in AI activity will bring accelerating advances across the field.
With global AI investments growing, Australia will need to remain internationally competitive in a world of expanding AI capabilities and AI-enabled operations. For defence, AI will be critical in delivering strategic objectives and maintaining a capable, agile and potent defence force. Reflecting that importance, and the need for increased self-reliance, AI is included among the new ‘sovereign industry capability priorities’ critical to defence. A sovereign capability in AI ensures Australia’s stake in a key 21st-century industry and underpins the defence organisation’s future operational and training capabilities.
Australia has some world-leading AI capabilities in universities, research organisations and industry. To expand from that base, we need to focus on AI and broader STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) initiatives to build the specialist workforce required by Australian industry. Building human capacity in AI will be critical, as demand is already outstripping supply, and the need for AI specialist skills is expected to grow significantly. For sovereign activities, including sensitive work supporting the nation’s defence and security sector, the ability to draw upon an Australian AI-skilled workforce will be fundamental.
Capacity in the Australian workforce will ensure that we can maintain an effective defence force and develop the capabilities needed to meet and overcome the disruption that AI will introduce to current methods of warfare. That will require sustained investment in skills training at all levels to raise understanding of AI by managers and to further expand AI graduate and higher degree by research programs to attract and train Australian AI specialists.
Increased research and technology development, supported by long-term and sustained investments in data, tools and critical digital infrastructure, will underpin our national AI competitiveness. Through sovereign investment in AI research and development, the benefits of AI will be fully harnessed and the potential risks mitigated. Investment should include building access to sufficient computing capacity and the fast networking needed to source those capabilities.
In addition, data holdings need to be established and managed to support the development of AI applications and tools, buttressed by appropriate access and privacy protections. Issues of safety, security and bias need to be understood and actively researched to support and inform responsible AI practices and build trust in AI systems to underpin confidence in continued AI development. That will require the development of AI systems that accord with Australian values and are trusted partners across the breadth of AI applications. The ongoing development of AI standards, engaging a broad cross-section of stakeholders, will enable the widespread use of responsible AI and increase the competitiveness of Australian industry.
Through government leadership, a strong and vibrant AI ecosystem should be established to bring together partnerships with industry and academia to drive innovation, meet national priorities and expand AI exports. This will ensure strong stakeholder participation and dialogue to inform policy considerations and connect industry and academia with new business opportunities. Efforts are already being made in that direction. In the defence sector, this includes the establishment of the Defence Artificial Intelligence Research Network. The DAIRNet will work to build a research community in Australia supporting Defence, bringing together multidisciplinary teams to address AI challenges at scale. Beyond research and innovation, a sovereign capability entails the adoption and continuous upgrade of AI technologies to enhance productivity, requiring industry participation across the AI product life cycle.
