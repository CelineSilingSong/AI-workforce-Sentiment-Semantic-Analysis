Artificial intelligence has come to stay in the health care industry. The term refers to a constellation of computational tools that can comb through vast troves of data at rates far surpassing human ability, in a way that can streamline providers’ jobs. Some types of AI commonly found in health care already are:

Machine learning AI, where a computer trains on datasets and “learns” to, for example, identify patients who would do well with a certain treatment.
Natural language processing AI, which can identify the human voice, and might transcribe a doctor’s clinical notes.
Rules-based AI, where computers train to act in a specific way if a particular data point shows up–these kinds of AI are commonly used in electronic medical records to perhaps flag a patient who has missed their last two appointments.

Regardless of the specific type of AI, these tools are generally capable of making a massive, complex industry run more efficiently. But several studies show it can also propagate racial biases, leading to misdiagnosis of medical conditions among people of color, insufficient treatment of pain, under-prescription of life-affirming medications, and more. Many patients don’t even know they’ve been enrolled in healthcare algorithms that are influencing their care and outcomes.
A growing body of research shows a paradox, however. While some algorithms do indeed exacerbate inequitable medical care, other algorithms can actually close such gaps.
Popular press tends to cover AI in medicine only when something goes wrong. While such reports are critical in holding institutions to account, they can also paint the picture that when AI enters health care, trouble is always around the corner. If done correctly, AI can actually make health care fairer for more people.
Historically, much of the research in the medical sciences and in the biological sciences has relied on subject pools of white—often male—people of European ancestry. These foundational studies on everything from normal internal body temperature to heart disease become the stuff of textbooks and trainings that doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals engage with as they move up the professional ladder.
However, those studies offer a limited, one-size-fits-all view of human health that opens the door to racial bias—which patients get treated and how. The most easily graspable example of this type of knowledge gone wrong is consulting images of white skin to diagnose dermatological diseases across all skin types, when such diseases may manifest in unique ways depending on the pigmentation of someone’s skin.
When AI is trained by data that lack diversity, then it is more likely to mimic the same racial bias that healthcare professionals can themselves exhibit. A poorly structured AI training dataset is no better (and in fact is sometimes worse) than a human with a medical degree predicated on lessons learned about the health of primarily white patients.
On the flipside, when AI is trained on datasets that include information from a diverse population of patients, it can help move the health care field away from deep-seated biases.
Below are summaries of some of the research on the intersection of AI and race.  
Dissecting Racial Bias in an Algorithm Used to Manage the Health of Populations
Ziad Obermeyer, Brian Powers, Christine Vogeli, and Sendhil Mullainathan. Science, October 2019.
What the researchers focused on: This study dove into how a nationally circulated health care algorithm perpetuated the under-serving of Black patients as compared with white patients. Such algorithms have the potential to do immense harm, by replicating the same racial biases in play by humans, but at an even more massive scale, the authors write.
What they found: Commercially applied risk-prediction algorithms are among the most common types of AI the health care industry currently uses. They’re applied to the care of some 200 million Americans every year. In this study, researchers show one unnamed algorithm assigned Black patients the same level of health risk as white patients, when in reality the Black patients were sicker.
The researchers learned that the machine-learning algorithm had trained itself to to see health care costs as a proxy for a patient’s level of health, when in reality it is reflective of the health care industry’s inequitable investment in some patient populations over others.
In other words, the algorithm assumed that because it cost hospitals less to care for Black patients, Black patients were healthier and required less care. However, hospital costs are lower for Black patients even when they are sicker than white patients, because hospitals funnel fewer resources toward the care of sick Black patients. The researchers suggest that training the algorithm not to equate cost with health would undo this tripwire.   
What researchers did with their findings: “After completing the analyses described above, we contacted the algorithm manufacturer for an initial discussion of our results,” the authors write. “In response, the manufacturer independently replicated our analyses on its national dataset of 3,695,943 commercially insured patients. This effort confirmed our results—by one measure of predictive bias calculated in their dataset, Black patients had 48,772 more active chronic conditions than White patients, conditional on risk score—illustrating how biases can indeed arise inadvertently.”
Researchers then began experimenting with solutions with the algorithm manufacturer and have already made improvements in the product.
“Of course, our experience may not be typical of all algorithm developers in this sector,” they write. “But because the manufacturer of the algorithm we study is widely viewed as an industry leader in data and analytics, we are hopeful that this endeavor will prompt other manufacturers to implement similar fixes.”
AI Recognition of Patient Race in Medical Imaging: A Modelling Study
Judy Wawira Gichoya; et al. The Lancet: Digital Health, May 2022.
What the researchers focused on: Previous research has shown that AI can be trained to detect a person’s race from medical images, even though human experts who are looking at the images aren’t able to tell the patient’s race just from looking at those images. The authors wanted to find out more about AI’s ability to recognize a patient’s race from medical images.           They analyzed a total of 680,201 chest X-rays across 3 datasets where Black patients comprised 4.8% to 46.8% of the subjects, white patients 42.1% to 64.1%, Asian patients 3.6% to 10.8%; 458,317 chest CTs also across 3 datasets where Black patients comprised 9.1% to 72% of the subjects, white patients 28% to 90.9% and Asian patients were unrepresented; 691 digital radiography X-rays where Black patients comprised 48.2% of the subjects, white patients 51.8%, and Asian patients were unrepresented; 86,669 breast mammograms where Black patients comprised 50.4% of the subjects, white patients 49.6% and Asian patients were unrepresented; and 10,358 lateral c-spine X-rays where Black patients comprised 24.8% of the subjects, white patients 75.2%, and Asian patients were unrepresented. The images themselves contained no racial information and represented different degrees of image clarity, full and cropped views and other variations.   
What they found: The deep learning model was able to identify a patient’s race accurately from medical images that contained no identifiable racial information. Researchers thought perhaps the model was learning to do this by matching known health outcomes with racial information.
There is “evidence that Black patients have a higher adjusted bone mineral density and a slower age-adjusted annual rate of decline in bone mineral density than White patients,” the researchers write, so they thought perhaps they could trick the model by cropping out parts of medical images that showed such characteristic bone density information. Even still, the model was able to identify the patient’s race from the images. “This finding is striking as this task is generally not understood to be possible for human experts,” the authors write.
How they explain it: “The results from our study emphasize that the ability of AI deep learning models to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, our finding that AI can accurately predict self-reported race, even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images, often when clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging,” the researchers write. “The regulatory environment in particular, while evolving, has not yet produced strong processes to guard against unexpected racial recognition by AI models; either to identify these capabilities in models or to mitigate the harms that might be caused.”
An Algorithmic Approach to Reducing Unexplained Pain Disparities in Underserved Populations
Emma Pierson; et al. Nature Medicine, January 2021.
What the researchers focused on: Previous research has shown Black patients are more likely than white patients to have their pain dismissed and untreated. One example is knee pain due to osteoarthritis. Researchers wanted to find out if an AI could undo biases in how knee pain is diagnosed and treated.
What they found: The researchers used a deep learning model trained on X-rays of osteoarthritis in the knee of 2,877 patients —18% of whom were Black, 38% were low-income, and 39% were non-college graduates  —  to predict the level of pain a patient would be expected to have based on the progression of their osteoarthritis. The model was better at assigning pain levels to underserved patients than human radiologists. The researchers conclude that the model was able to predict pain even when the imaging did not necessarily show the expected level of disease severity. That’s because patients of color are more likely than white patients to have “factors external to the knee” that influence their level of pain, such as work conditions and higher stress, the researchers write. In other words, the same level of osteoarthritis severity can result in very different levels of pain depending on the patient population, and evaluating a patient without that context can lead to underdiagnosis for underserved patients. In this case, an AI could solve an issue that persists because of human racial bias.
How they explain it: “In addition to raising important questions regarding how we understand potential sources of pain, our results have implications for the determination of who receives arthroplasty for knee pain … Consequently, we hypothesize that underserved patients with disabling pain but without severe radiographic disease could be less likely to receive surgical treatments and more likely to be offered non-specific therapies for pain. This approach could lead to overuse of pharmacological remedies, including opioids, for underserved patients and contribute to the well-documented disparities in access to knee arthroplasty.”

Amgen’s latest podcast, ""The Generative Biology Revolution,"" follows the success of its earlier “DNA Unlocked” and “Undruggable” podcasts, which the drugmaker rolled out during the second half of 2021. (AmgenFlag)
Amgen is tapping into the rising popularity of audio streaming with its latest podcast about generative biology, an emerging field that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to discover and develop new biologic drugs.The four-part series, ""The Generative Biology Revolution,"" debuted June 22 and is hosted by Ray Deshaies, Ph.D., Amgen’s senior vice president of global research.In each episode, Deshaies chats with scientists within Amgen as well as experts from outside research institutions about how AI and machine learning can make drug discovery “more predictable, shorten timelines and increase success rates of bringing life-saving medicines to patients who need them most.”“Our primary goal with The Generative Biology Revolution is to communicate the excitement of the potential this field has for advancing drug discovery and development at Amgen and throughout the industry,” Michael Strapazon, Amgen director of corporate affairs, told Fierce Pharma Marketing in an email.RelatedPharma marketers are tuning in to audio's popularity, but there's still plenty of room to grow, experts sayThe podcast also gives the company a chance to showcase its scientists and their research, which, as we’ve seen during the pandemic, can go a long way toward boosting the industry’s standing with the public.Podcasts are a way for the public to “hear the voices of our scientists and learn about how we and others in the industry approach the discovery and development of novel medicines for the most challenging diseases,” said Strapazon.“We’re very proud of our R&D scientists and our leadership, particularly in our unique areas of strength like world-class human genetics, disease biology and the molecular engineering expertise needed to design the right medicine for the right target,” he said.Amgen partnered with The Scientist’s “LabTalk,” well known in the scientific community, to produce the podcast, which is available to stream on all major platforms. While it primarily targets scientists, Deshaies aims to explain the complex science in a way that makes it accessible to a broader audience.In the first episode, he chats with Alan Russell, Ph.D., Amgen’s vice president of biologics, about how the company is working on harnessing AI to predict new sequences of proteins “with functions that we want them to have” so they can be better suited to treat a disease.

Using a surfing analogy, Russell said scientists can either “watch the waves breaking” or “figure out what are the surfboards that will allow us to surf that wave and will allow us to harness the power and the energy behind this new science.”RelatedDefinitive Healthcare launches a new podcast aimed at 'data-driven conversations' in healthcare“What the [Amgen] team did is they simply said, ‘OK, for each one of these waves, what are the surfboards? How do we build them? What do we need to put in place? How can we do our experiments in different ways? How can we create the systems that will generate the data that will power the algorithm? How do we deploy the automation?'” he explained in the episode.Amgen is one of a long list of pharma companies that have launched their own podcasts since Genentech rolled out the industry’s first with its “Two Scientists Walk into a Bar'' back in 2016. Other pharma podcasts include Eli Lilly’s “The Elixir Factor” and Pfizer's “The Antigen” while drugmakers like ViiV Healthcare, Novartis and Merck have launched podcasts specifically for patients with HIV, psoriasis and cancer.  Amgen’s latest podcast, which has a new episode out today (July 7) and another on July 14, follows the success of its earlier “DNA Unlocked” and “Undruggable” podcasts, which the drugmaker rolled out during the second half of 2021.And it won’t be the last. Amgen has two more podcasts in the pipeline for later in 2022, focusing on clinical trial innovation and the power of harnessing human data.

The dearth of AI professors at U.S. universities is not the result of a distorted job market, according to a recent report.

When the ride-hailing company Uber sought to establish a new facility in Pittsburgh in 2015 focused on self-driving cars, it looked to the researchers and scientists at the nearby Carnegie Mellon University robotics center. Soon after, the company lured away 40 of the center’s employees, including the director, with doubled salaries and bonuses in the hundreds of thousands.
High-profile stories like these have contributed to a prevailing narrative that artificial intelligence experts leave academe for industry in droves. But the dearth of AI professors at U.S. universities is not the result of a distorted job market, according to a report issued this month from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Rather, AI experts remain interested in academic careers, but university hiring of AI faculty has not kept pace with student demand. Though big tech has stepped in to fill some of the gap, some experts urge caution given that the industry’s incentive structure differs from that of academe.
Historically, academe has delivered a steady stream of developers, engineers and entrepreneurs that has fueled an AI innovation ecosystem. This stream has been directly correlated with AI faculty teaching capacity. But while student enrollment in computer science programs has skyrocketed in the past decade, universities have not hired enough computer science faculty to meet that demand. (The researchers used student demand for computer science as a proxy for student demand in AI, as the latter is difficult to quantify.)
In an apparent response to increased student demand, universities have restricted access to AI programs by limiting enrollment in high-demand classes, reducing the number of small-enrollment classes and tightening computer science admission requirements, according to Jack Corrigan, one of the report’s authors. At the same time, burgeoning numbers of computer science Ph.D. recipients have expressed interest in academic careers, but universities have not responded with a commensurate increase in faculty positions. Contrary to the prevailing narrative that industry poaching of computer science faculty is rampant, universities generally succeed when they seek to hire AI faculty.
Technology companies, for their part, have stepped in to pick up some of the student demand by offering alternative pathways to AI education and training.
“Tech companies are becoming the new ‘cauldrons of innovation’ and functional universities where innovation occurs,” said John Nosta, Google Health Advisory Board member and World Health Organization founding member of the digital health expert roster. Nosta noted that Google, for example, does not always require prospective employees to have earned bachelor of science degrees. “The excitement is no longer coming from the universities, but from innovative companies driving transformation like SpaceX, Amazon, Apple, OpenAI and other for-profit businesses that are leaving a traditional education model in the dust,” Nosta said. His view is that the trend is especially noteworthy in artificial intelligence.
Google is not the only company to have responded to the AI workforce shortage by removing the college degree requirement for some positions. IBM and Apple have also dropped the requirement, an effort they also expect may diversify the talent pool by providing access to those who did not have as many early-life opportunities.
“The jobs are there, and there’s one structural barrier we can remove,” former IBM Corporation chief executive Virginia Rometty told The Wall Street Journal last year. In place of a degree, she said IBM screens for a “propensity to learn” and provides training. The results? The “new-collar employees”—her term for those without a four-year degree—performed at a level that was equal or better than their college-educated co-workers.
Not everyone agrees that industry is the proper training ground for AI experts.
“I’d be loath to call the tech companies ‘universities,’” said Dan Rockmore, a computer science professor at Dartmouth College. “They are really only interested in a targeted set of skills—hardly universal ones—but I do think they are becoming a new kind of focused technical school.”
Rockmore agreed that university AI curricula do not always address marketplace needs but cautioned against relying on tech companies for AI education.
“This will be a narrowly trained group of workers whose products will have extraordinary ramifications on the ways we interact and are governed,” he said. “They build technocratic ‘solutions’ without the perspective of a broad education or possibly a broad and thoughtful outlook on the implications of the work.”
Others point to the historic interplay between higher education and the tech industry. Consider, for example, the field of computer graphics, suggested Cherri Pancake, an Oregon State University computer science professor and former Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) president.
“Nowadays, the vast majority of graphics practitioners are not specialists, though their work still relies on a core of specialists at universities and companies to keep driving the field forward.” Likewise, she noted that artificial intelligence, and specifically machine learning—a high-demand subfield of AI industry—is no different. Academics worked for decades to achieve cost-effective machine learning. “Now, everyone is crying out for that specialty, but the real need is for people who can apply [machine learning] in practical settings,” Pancake said.
She noted that this necessitates a different kind of education—one focused on safe use. “Universities now recognize this need, but it takes time to establish new curricula,” she said.
Some are frustrated by academe’s slow pace. For example, the Seattle Times editorial board penned an op-ed last month in which the editors lamented that colleges and universities in Washington—home of Microsoft headquarters—are “awarding computer-related degrees at less than half the rate the state’s tech companies are adding new positions—let alone filling openings for existing jobs.” They blamed not the students, who are interested in undergraduate computer science programs and technology careers, but the paucity of accessible training programs at the state’s universities. More than 7,500 incoming University of Washington first-year students applied for admission to the computer science and engineering school, they noted, but enrollment limitations likely mean that only 550 new undergraduates will enter in a given year.
Educating the next generation of AI scientists in the U.S. and beyond also weighs on the mind of Jim Hendler, director of the Institute for Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Computation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and chair of the ACM global technology policy council.
“ACM is seeing this issue arising not just in the U.S., but around the world,” he said. “Our curriculum committees are looking at not just college education, but whether some of these gaps could be filled by new programs in K-12 and particularly high school/precollege educational programs.”
While Corrigan acknowledged that industry has a role to play in developing AI talent, he advises policy makers and academic leaders to think critically about the role that universities play.
“The incentive structure for private companies is much different than the incentive structure for universities … If we want to develop the tech workforce in an equitable, just and socially optimal way, we should consider the incentives that are driving the behaviors of each of those actors.”

Job Description of a COBOL Programmer
A COBOL programmer is a technical professional whose primary skill is writing code in COmmon, Business-Oriented Language or COBOL, maintaining and testing COBOL codebases, and using relevant tools like ENDEVOR and Xpeditor. 
Common, Business-Oriented Language (COBOL) is a computer programming language that originated as a way for programmers to build programs that could run on several computers within the same enterprise. FORTRAN was its main rival at the time of its creation in 1959. In addition, unlike FORTRAN, it was designed for business rather than scientific applications.
COBOL was invented in 1959 by CODASYL and was partially based on Grace Hopper’s FLOW-MATIC programming language. It was created as part of a project by the United States Department of Defense to create a portable data processing programming language. The objective was to develop a language centered on business requirements. This entailed having English-like commands, the ability to handle massive volumes of data (for example, customer records), and significant reporting capabilities. 
COBOL programmers are people who work with and write programs using the COBOL programming language. They are often valuable for data science and corporate data processing. Typically, COBOL programmers create, build, and set up the code for new programs, evaluate them, and make any required revisions. 
With modern languages such as Java, Python, Swift, and many others receiving more attention than ever before during the era of social media and the fourth industrial revolution, the prevailing opinion is that COBOL is a dying language. However, this may not be entirely correct.

Why is COBOL important?
Despite being around for so many decades, COBOL remains a popular programming language and an important technical skill for developers. This is due to several reasons:

Given that legacy code is vast and complex, it is often difficult to maintain. Since governments and businesses widely use COBOL, there are still numerous COBOL systems that they must maintain.
As per Tom Taulli, the author of Modern Mainframe Development: COBOL, Databases, and Next-Generation Approaches, it facilitates over 80% of in-person financial services transactions and 95% of ATM swipes. It processes $3 trillion in commerce every day. Over 220 billion COBOL code streams exist, with 1.5 billion written each year.
It is especially beneficial for simple procedures–such as percentage calculation or essential addition and subtraction – that must be applied on a large scale. 
Since COBOL is clear to read and easy to comprehend, it is impossible to hide malicious or disruptive computer code within it. In addition, programming faults are easy to detect and rectify.

As a result, a COBOL programmer’s job is both rewarding and lucrative. The typical job responsibilities of a COBOL programmer include: 
Responsibilities of a COBOL Programmer
1. Training and supervision
 A COBOL programmer’s job includes training the local programming employees in JCL and modifying COBOL coding to take advantage of the increased mainframe processing power. In some cases, programmers also provide UNIX training for new employees. In addition, they are supposed to supervise the work of junior application developers as required and provide them with valuable feedback on performance improvement. 
2. Implementing automation
COBOL programmers analyze and test code using automated techniques. In addition, they are responsible for designing a variety of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro tools to simplify reporting and assure data integrity, avoidance of overlap, and management control.
3. Code quality control
Programmers ought to set coding guidelines to protect code integrity. Apart from setting the guidelines, they check various COBOL programs for flaws and repair faulty lines accordingly. This includes modifying and running SAS, SQL, COBOL, and UNIX testing systems. Modern COBOL programmers may use test automation for this purpose. Programmers may use SQL queries to generate test data for quality assurance, and as necessary, they are also to assist with system and client integration testing efforts.
4. Leveraging code libraries for smooth functioning of systems
Programmers utilize code libraries that are compilations of different lines of code generated internally or made accessible as open-source to facilitate programming. Developing new code to handle data sharing between front-end and back-end systems lies under the responsibilities of a COBOL programmer. In addition, they also maintain the sub-system programs running in both batch and customer information control system (CICS) programming language across the system. 
5. Enhancement projects
An enhancement project is one in which new capabilities are added to an existing system. They might also involve correcting defects, adding recent reports, and modifying functionality to comply with revised business rules or needs. COBOL programmers are responsible for generating thorough analysis and design documentation for enhancement projects.

6. Department collaboration
Programmers interact with the technical department staff for software development lifecycles, planning, development, scheduling, and applications. Good communication skills are essential in effective collaboration, especially for COBOL projects in DevOpsOpens a new window  environments. 
7. Project planning
Before working on projects, programmers must collect all the appropriate data for the desired results. This involves understanding the application’s transactional requirements and collecting and defining system requirements, among other information. In other words, project management responsibilities are also part of the COBOL programmer’s job description. 
8. Web development
Importantly, COBOL programmers are expected to be proficient in web development using Web Focus, HTML, Java, and JavaScript. For those familiar with basic web application security concepts, it can be an added advantage.

Top 12 Skills to Acquire
The primary, mandatory skill to become a COBOL programmer is knowledge of COBOL as a scripting language. In addition to this, the job role requires:
Skills Required by a COBOL Programmer
1. Technical development skills 
To grasp the inner workings of computer systems and software, COBOL programmers must first and foremost acquire technical development expertise. They require these skills to troubleshoot problems and create new systems and applications. Such technical skills include math skills, knowledge of different computer programming languages (Visual Basic, CICS, TSO, COBOL, QMF, and JSL), etc.
2. Communication skills 
COBOL programmers must communicate with other team members and clients to comprehend project goals, obtain information, and present their work. Furthermore, they must provide the clients explanations about technical aspects and answer inquiries about their work. Keeping this in mind, the capacity to form constructive and productive relationships within a team or personally can come in handy. COBOL programmers with practical communication skills can effectively build trust with clients and colleagues, which can lead to promotions and professional growth. 
3. DevOps proficiency
While not a direct prerequisite, as businesses become more dependent on technology, the demand for COBOL programmers familiar with DevOps is likely to expand. DevOps is a software development approach that entails collaboration among developers and operations personnel. It seeks to increase the speed and quality of software development by combining these two professions. Aspiring COBOL programmers can also explore DevOps courses to upskill in this area.
4. Mainframe capabilities 
Mainframes are high-performance computers with plenty of memory and processors that can do billions of basic calculations and transactions in real-time. Big corporations utilize them for mission-critical applications, high transaction volumes, and reliable performance. They are built for intensive high-speed processing for large-scale computing needs that demand higher availability and security than a more miniature computer can provide. With mainframes supporting much of the world’s most critical IT infrastructure, excellent mainframe programming skills are essential for a COBOL programmer. 
5. Versatility and the ability to learn fast
Organizational needs constantly change as technology and processes evolve. To ensure that one’s work is up to date and effective, COBOL programmers must adapt to new technologies and methods. And the best way to do that is to keep up with the latest programming languages and tools as they become available.

6. DB2
IBM’s relational database management system called DB2 is a solution designed to run and operate software such as Windows, Unix, and Linux systems. This system was initially built for IBM but has now been adapted to work on various operating systems. The essential characteristic of the DB2 is its ability to handle and manage large amounts of data while allowing users to access the database engine easily.
7. XML 
XML is a data storage and transmission medium independent of software and hardware. XML is an abbreviation for eXtensible Markup Language. XML, like HTML, is a markup language for storing and transporting data. It was designed to be self-descriptive. The XML language has no predefined tags. Additionally, another advantage of XML is its extensibility. 
8. Knowledge of the software development life cycle
In software engineering, SDLC (an acronym for software development life cycle) is also called application development lifecycle. SDLC is a method that aids in the planning, testing, and administration of an information system. This method can be applied to both software and hardware and their combination. The SDLC is divided into six steps, beginning with analysis and concluding with evaluation. It also includes web application security. 
9. Excellent focus and concentration
COBOL programmers must be able to focus for extended periods while they work out problems and write lines of clean code. Furthermore, they must carefully review their code, as even a minor error can significantly impact the entire program. Thus, concentration and attention to detail are essential for a COBOL programmer.
10. Intellectual curiosity 
The most effective and successful programmers are adept at determining how something is done and devising ways to do it more effectively. A healthy sense of curiosity can aid in the consistent growth and development of a programmer. 
11. Problem-solving and mathematical skills
 Many elements of COBOL programming necessitate a more advanced understanding of math. To become proficient in programming, one must first master algebra and arithmetic. Furthermore, a code is frequently written to address a challenge. Therefore, a COBOL programmer must be able to identify problems and devise the most optimal solutions to fix them through programming. 
12. Knowledge of other programming languages
 Although COBOL programmers mainly work with one programming language, proficiency in different programming languages can go a long way career-wise. Codes are widely written in programming languages such as SQL, Java, C++, and Python. Even though programmers are expected to be experts in all these languages, knowledge in at least two of them can open up many career opportunities. A common approach amongst programmers is to first decide on an area of specialization and then focus on the programming languages widely utilized in that field.

COBOL Programmer Salary in 2022
A COBOL programmer’s compensation can vary as per their level of education, years of experience, and the sort of corporation for which they work. Aside from the regular salary, many employees also receive extra rewards in the form of bonuses. While most COBOL programmers have a bachelor’s degree, some businesses hire candidates with a vocational degree or diploma, provided they have adequate field expertise. 
In software development, one’s programming skills are far more valuable than their degree. However, businesses require a Bachelor’s degree in computer science and can give applicants an edge over those without one.
Remember that COBOL programming is no longer included in most computer science degrees. Consequently, most COBOL experts today are older generation programmers and new-age aficionados, even though COBOL is expected to become popular soon. The majority of COBOL programmer salaries range from $79,000 (25th percentile) to $100,000 (75th percentile), with top earners (90th percentile) earning $110,000 per year.
They have a wide range of opportunities career-wise going forth, and they could become software developers or managers of the software engineering department. They may also advance to become senior software engineers or lead software developers as they gain expertise. Furthermore, some may also work as project managers in information technology.
The following are various Jobs taken up by COBOL programmers and their respective salaries, as per PayScale data last updated on May 02, 2022:

Takeaway
While COBOL is now rarely used in end-user app development, it remains a staple for mainframes and enterprise backends. A gradual decline in COBOL was precipitated by the Y2K bug, which had the potential to cause computing errors due to systematic flaws in COBOL-based systems. However, despite this, COBOL remained popular and was one of the most in-demand skills in the U.S. during the pandemic. In the future, candidates who balance next-gen skills like the cloud with COBOL programming will be particularly advantageous as they can help guide end-to-end digital transformation programs.
