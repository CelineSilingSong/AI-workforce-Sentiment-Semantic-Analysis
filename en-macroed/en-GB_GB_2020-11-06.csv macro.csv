by Richie SantosdiazNovember 7, 2020November 5, 2020LinkedInTwitterFacebookWhatsAppTelegramCopy LinkShareArtificial Intelligence (AI)’s role in the Middle East is a similar trend that it faces across the rest of the world, meaning it has grown in importance, relevance and economic value.Various countries across the Middle East have placed an emphasis on AI. Clear examples of that have been nation-wide strategies around AI and part of wider government digital transformations. In the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), economic development diversifications such as Saudi Vision 2030 has prioritised wider future and innovative economies. Sectors such as fintech and AI-both fintech and non-fintech related- play a strong role in that.It is not just nation-wide economic development diversification strategies such as Vision 2030 but also, complimenting and in parallel, strategies purely around AI. For example, the UAE has its Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031. To note, the UAE has prioritised a commitment to “smart,” advocating application and adoption of exponential technologies (such as AI) to transform business, government, and society.Its commitment to wider digital transformation is pretty clear, as it ranks the highest in the Arab World (and 12th globally) in digital competitiveness. With respect to AI it was also the first country in the world to have a State Ministry of AI. Dubai, for instance, from 2015 to 2018, attracted a total of $21.6 billion in foreign direct investments (FDI) for artificial intelligence and robotics, said to be the highest in the world. Also, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala announced that it will become an investor in Group42 (G42), an artificial intelligence and cloud computing company, via the integration of Injazat and Khazna Data Centers (Khazna).Recent estimates of AI contribution to economic growth suggest significant positive impact on Middle East GDP—more than USD 300 billion by 2031, according to a report from PwC IMAGE SOURCE GETTYRecent estimates of AI contribution to economic growth suggest significant positive impact on Middle East GDP—more than $300 billion by 2031, according to a report from PwC. In the UAE, for instance, it is expected to contribute almost $100 billion USD (or around under 14% of its gross domestic product (GDP). In the GCC4 (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman), the AI contribution to the economy is expected to be almost $46 billion by 2030 – around 8.2% of its GDP.Saudi Arabia at its recent Global AI Summit in October revealed its new National Strategy for Data & AI (NSDAI); by 2030, Saudi Arabia’s vision is to become the place where the best of Data and AI is made reality. Under the strategy, Saudi Arabia will implement a multi-phase, multi-faceted plan that includes skills, policy and regulation, investment, research and innovation, and ecosystem development. During the launch, HE Dr. Abdullah Bin Sharaf Alghamdi, President of SDAIA, said, “The National Strategy for Data and AI sets the direction and foundations upon which we will unlock the potential of data and AI to fulfil our national transformation priorities and establish Saudi Arabia as a global hub for data and AI.” AI can contribute an estimated $135 billion to its GDP, which corresponds to 12.4% of the national GDP.Beyond the GCC but within the Middle East region, examples of prioritisation in AI include countries like Egypt and Israel. First, in Egypt, the government is looking to develop AI capabilities in a number of ways, including launching its first AI faculty at Kafr El Sheikh University. Egypt is aiming to have 7.7 percent of its GDP, or almost $43 billion, derived through AI by 2030.Second, Tel Aviv headquartered BlackSwan Technologies launched as the world’s first enterprise AI operating system, enabling any company to leverage the most advanced artificial intelligence for an unprecedented level of operational efficiency and data-driven decision making. This has included its recent partnership with Deloitte, to provide banks an AI-powered platform.According to BlackSwan’s founder and CEO Michael Ouliel, “We believe this represents a true paradigm shift in enterprise software, eliminating all barriers to digital transformation so that enterprises can easily harness big data and artificial intelligence to generate immediate and actionable business insights. Our aim is to completely disrupt the enterprise software market by finally making the world’s most advanced artificial intelligence available to any company.”42% of the total sum invested in high-tech in Israel went towards AI technologies in 2019 IMAGE SOURCE GETTYAs a whole in Israel, last year, 42% of the total sum invested in high-tech went towards AI technologies. Despite Israel’s strong tech and AI sector, the country has yet to adopt a national AI strategy, which many in the tech community have flagged. Last year, a report by the government’s Innovation Authority urged authorities to adopt a national strategy to include boosting Israel’s data science engineers, supercomputing infrastructure, as well as allocate more public money to R&D.Other countries such as Turkey, are also preparing to launch its own national AI strategy. From AI as a whole, Turkey, given its large population and economy, has had an active AI scene. In fact, from an AI Middle East and Africa (MEA) report commissioned by Microsoft and conducted by EY, it was Turkey, based on the relative spend on AI transactions in MEA from 2008-2018, that received the top spot $3.49 billion with 252 deals (beating second place the UAE at $2.15 billion with 160 deals).On a final note, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, AI has been important across various aspects of our lives. This has been aided of course by fintech but AI as a whole has played roles in keeping the global population safe and healthy. From thermal cameras in large shopping malls to contact tracing and other streamlined services such as with payments – the solutions seem to be endless.AI in its adopting in the Middle East is nothing unique. Nevertheless, its embracement of it as a whole, integration of its solutions and creating its own innovations are remarkable.Author Richie SantosdiazExecutive Economic Development Advisor (Emerging Markets) | Contributor LinkedInTwitterFacebookWhatsAppTelegramCopy LinkShare",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But while these changes are predicted for the future, they’re already present in many organizations for many different jobs. The situation brings to mind the William Gibson comment, “The future is already here—it’s just not evenly distributed.” The jobs and work processes described below are an example of this phenomenon. It’s a clear example of an existing set of jobs that have been transformed by AI and related tools.

You may have noticed that lots of companies today create content, and massive quantities of it. Whether a software company, an industrial company, or a healthcare company, they all create content—marketing materials, product and service documentation, website content, investor relations reports, etc, etc. In a few cases, some of this content may be generated by artificial intelligence. But the vast majority of it is created by human writers—not professional writers, necessarily, but humans who write.

That creates a series of problems for organizations. Not everybody is a great writer. Humans who write misspell words, employ bad grammar, use inappropriate tone, insert words they shouldn’t use, refer to the same thing in different ways—you’ve seen all these issues as you read content generated by companies. People who worry about these issues used to be called “copy editors,” but now they’re often called something related to “content”—content creators, content strategists, content designers, digital content writers, and even “Senior Manager, Content Systems.” Most of the companies that use these “content” titles are tech firms, but some other types of companies, including household names like Mastercard and Transamerica, also use them.

PROMOTED
 That “Content Systems” title is the job that Jennifer Schmich has at Intuit, the successful provider of personal and small business financial software including QuickBooks, TurboTax and Mint. Schmich has the responsibility of using systems—AI included—to make Intuit’s content better. Thousands of people at Intuit write content, and she has to figure out a way to improve its quality and its conformity to meet corporate standards. You can tell that Intuit cares about this because they hire people like Schmich, and the company also has a publicly-accessible website that describes various aspects of their content design approach.

Writer—the AI Software, That Is—at Intuit
One of the systems that Jennifer Schmich uses in her role as an Intuit Senior Manager of Content Systems comes from Writer, a San Francisco-based startup that has built an AI writing assistant for business writing. It uses AI (machine learning and natural language processing) to make real-time content suggestions to employees to keep their content clear and consistent with the company-approved messaging and approved terminology. In addition to Intuit, Writer has a number of tech-oriented companies as customers, including Twitter, Bill.com, and UiPath.

Writer focuses on four different aspects of content:


Foundations of great writing—Grammar, spelling, style, the correct reading level, and format (of course, word processing systems like MS Word are often used to correct grammar and spelling, but Writer goes well beyond them);
Editorial—Writing style, general and company-specific conventions, copyediting (to use Oxford commas or not, for example);
Interpersonal—Accessibility, sensitivity, inclusivity, sarcasm, and tone;
Brand—Reusable messaging describing the brand, specific terminology to use or not use, discussing a company’s value proposition in a consistent fashion.

Different functions or units within a company may care about one of these more than the others—Human Resources, for example, is primarily focused on interpersonal issues. Marketing is also a common customer of Writer, particularly for marketing and brand-oriented writing. But a “Content” function can address all of the different writing objectives and issues.

 The Writer software allows people to type their content—at Intuit, typically with a Google Docs or Microsoft Word plugin—and as they do so they get suggestions. One might say, “This is not our preferred style—use “you” to communicate with customers when possible.” The content creators don’t have to leave their workspace and workflow to use Writer. The suggestions, which are normally created by Intuit’s Style Council, can be delivered it to anybody who is writing anywhere on the Intuit network. They can accept the suggestion, ignore it, reject it, or provide feedback, such as “We need to add this term to our taxonomy.” If the content is banned, which at Intuit is the case for certain words such as “blacklist,” (considered racist) or locational cues like “bottom left,” (considered ableist) and the writer leaves in the banned content, it will be flagged for review. The document may also be flagged as needing a wholesale edit, which often happens when content from external agencies that’s submitted to Intuit is run through Writer.
Intuit was an early customer of Writer (originally known as Qordoba). Jennifer Schmich led the effort to bring in the software to Intuit. The company has a lot of different people and teams across the company that create content—including technical documentation, customer support, marketing, and product content—and some are quite large. The QuickBooks product, for example, has forty or so people producing product content alone. Many of these distributed content creators, Schmich said, are not professional writers and don’t have the same sensibilities and objectives as a writer. She saw Writer as a way to improve and scale the content creation processes without a lot of human intervention.
Schmich had originally been a copywriter, but over time became increasingly interested in how technology could improve content processes. She made up the “Senior Manager, Content Systems” job title with her boss several years ago. The Content team at Intuit was particularly interested in creating more inclusive language, including avoiding terms with racist roots. Tina O’Shea, Intuit’s Director of Content, said in a television news interview that, ""We have used black and white as metaphors for bad and good, so blacklist and whitelist, and so we have now identified terms that we're not going to use anymore as metaphors for bad and good.”
 Schmich credited content strategy guru Kristina Halvorson for “putting content systems on the map,” and she sees a growing number of jobs like hers at other companies. At Intuit, she manages a staff of three. The group maintains Intuit’s company-wide styleguide (down from about a dozen different guides when she started in 2016), voice and tone preferences, design systems, content architecture, and taxonomy management. The group is also getting more involved in the content employed by chatbots and semantic technologies. Schmich says that much of her job involves working with engineers on content taxonomies and on models of customer and user intent—typically as expressed in search engines or chatbot conversations.
 For Intuit, Writer performs two primary functions:


Writing assistant. It addresses issues like grammar, punctuation, and readability, and adds tone, inclusivity language, and customized Intuit rules for the company’s style and word choice;
Finance language. It addresses terminology and syntax for accounting, tax, and personal finance. Because Writer has machine learning, it learns as the team provides feedback about what is particular about writing at Intuit.


Producers of content around Intuit don’t have to remember all the rules, look up answers to questions, or go through old documents to find correct examples.
Schmich said that Writer improved both the quality and quantity of content creation at Intuit. She uses the Writer dashboard to track user engagement and content improvements, and compares quality across different pieces of content.
The Impact on Content Creators
Sarah Mohs is a Senior Content Designer for Intuit who works closely with the QuickBooks product. She creates and edits content for it, and also works with Jennifer Schmich’s team to edit the Writer Styleguide. As a content creator and editor, she feels that Writer improves productivity and saves time. She said,
“It’s too hard to keep everything in your brain, and looking things up only works if you know what you are looking for. The AI provides all those checks as you are writing. It definitely reduces the cognitive strain.”
AI, she believes, takes some of the burden off of correcting writing. Instead of focusing on missing commas, she can do more nuanced analysis and think more strategically about the content. It’s harder, but more satisfying, work. She said, however, that whether you like this type of change depends on your personality and job focus. “If you like copyediting, it will pose some challenges,” she notes.
Mohs said that some people in the content field worry that AI will render their jobs irrelevant, but she’s not particularly worried about losing her job because of it:
“I don’t think it will replace human editors or copywriters; it’s just a good companion. The machine learning is useful but not perfect, and context always matters—AI doesn’t always get contextual corrections right. And AI can analyze tone, but only with the information it receives from the user.”
Schmich and Mohs agree that for Intuit to get full value from Writer and other AI tools for content, the content creators and editors need education and new skills. Schmich commented,
“We are only using a small fraction of what the tool can do. At some point we will need to upskill all our content creators to learn about other capabilities, and to help us think about other use cases for it. It’s hard to get everyone out of the old mental model based on writing things down on paper.”
Mohs said,
“Writer and using AI to help with content are pretty new for us. We do need more education in what it can do. For content designers it could free us up to think about the end-to-end process of content creation and deployment.”
Writing has been around for several thousand years, and AI as an aid to writing for only a few years. It’s not surprising that we have some way to go in figuring it out. It does appear, however, that human writing will continue for at least a few more decades.

Illuminated only by a spotlight attached to a machine, she begins to move, tracing shapes with her arms.But then something odd happens: The spotlight starts to move of its own accord. Responding to the dancer, it finds its own rhythm and sways side to side. It soon becomes unclear who is leading whom. What is clear is that a dance is being made, and that one partner is 9 feet high, more than 500 pounds. Called ABB IRB 6700, it is one of the largest industrial robots in the world.The dancer and choreographer Catie Cuan is the human star of this show, “Output,” which is part of a collaboration with ThoughtWorks Arts and the Pratt Institute. And while dancing with robots may sound a bit like science fiction, to Ms. Cuan, who is completing her Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Stanford University, it “feels like an extension of my body — and of possibility.”The working assumption for most of history has been that dance is a thing done by and for humans. Yet it does not seem beyond the pale that robots will one day perform for us mortals, particularly when choreographers like Ms. Cuan are using technology to explore the outer limits of the art form.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOne of Ms. Cuan’s projects is translating basic jazz and ballet vocabulary into robot joint angles and creating what she called “a ballet for swarms of robots, mapped onto robot morphology that leverages their innate nature.”That “innate nature” has to do with their distinctive movement qualities — the precise torques of their joints, that they have no muscles to contract or relax — which totally changes the perception of weight placement and bodily distribution.ImageCatie Cuan with Rethink Robotics Baxter (big robot) and SoftBank Robotics NAO (small robot) in “Time to Compile,” performed in 2018 at the Conference for Research on Choreographic Interfaces at Brown University.Credit...Sam BerubeMeshing an art form so tied to the body with machines may seem like a paradox. But, Ms. Cuan said, “A.I. is a choreographic tool that can disrupt the habitual dance-making process.”At the forefront of this growing field is Sydney Skybetter, a former dancer and a professor of what he calls choreographics at Brown University, where his students approach dance in a way that is heavily computational — like using machine learning to create ghostly digital avatars that dance along with live performers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Skybetter and Ms. Cuan join a line of working artists who have experimented with technology to break new ground in dance. The pioneer was the choreographer Merce Cunningham who, working with the electronic artist Thecla Schiphorst, used a software program called LifeForms that could sketch movement.“Trackers” (1991) was Cunningham’s first dance made with LifeForms, and roughly a third of the movement was created on the computer. Using the software opened up “possibilities of working with time and space that I had never thought of before,” he said at the time.By the end of the 20th century, motion capture, wearable tech and virtual reality had arrived on the scene. Then came A.I. One of the first major artists to work with it was the choreographer Trisha Brown, who in 2005 employed a program that responded to her dancers’ movements by drawing graphics that were then projected onstage.In the last five years, Google Arts and Culture has been collaborating with dance artists, including the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company and the Martha Graham Dance Company. Last year, Google released the Living Archive — an interactive atlas of a half-million movements drawn from the choreographer Wayne McGregor’s repertory. The archive allows a user to choose poses and construct a dance phrase; or to dance in front of the camera and let the computer find the closest visual match that will then be a building block in a new sequence.Damien Henry, the project lead at Google, also developed a more advanced machine for Mr. McGregor to use. That machine was fed a diet of the Living Archive and 100 hours of footage of McGregor dances. In rehearsal, the algorithm could capture dancers’ movements via webcam and then immediately render onscreen a selection of 30 original McGregor-esque sequences. Mr. McGregor and his dancers could choose to adopt or develop this output.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“At times, the algorithm produced suggestions that the dancer wouldn’t want to do,” Mr. Henry said. “But then Wayne realized it was extremely useful. It forced a dancer to explore unnatural territory.”ImageJacob O’Connell, left, and Chien-Shun Liao from Company Wayne McGregor in “Living Archive: An AI Performance Experiment” at the Music Center in Los Angeles.Credit...Cheryl Mann, via LA PhilIn July 2019, Company Wayne McGregor premiered “Living Archive: An AI Performance Experiment,” a 30-minute work developed in conjunction with the program, at the Music Center in Los Angeles.“We all have biases,” Mr. McGregor said in an interview, “and ways in which we frame the world. A.I. affords more self-knowledge. It helps you play your ‘instrument’ differently.”Some dance artists are thinking about A.I. beyond its utility as a technical tool and predictor of movement. Pontus Lidberg, the artistic director of the Danish Dance Theater, set out to use A.I. as a more integral part of his choreography, in rehearsal and performance. The goal: To create a dance that articulated the tension between man and machine, by putting the two together onstage.In 2019, Mr. Lidberg began working with the computer artist Cecilie Waagner Falkenstrom. “We didn’t want to create something proving that an algorithm can find patterns,” she said. “That is boring. We wanted to create something that touches us as human beings.”To achieve this, the A.I. (affectionately called David) was fed information from myriad sources — ranging from planetary movements to the structure and semiotics of Greek tragedy.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Because the A.I. was trained on more than just my movement vocabulary,” Mr. Lidberg said, “it learned a lot, deconstructed this knowledge, and then built it up again with the dancers — this created something entirely new.” Each performance of the dance, called “Centaur” (2020), is a distinct, unpredictable event — a neat allegory to our relationship with technology. (The production is currently touring Europe).“This type of work opens an intense conversation about where the choreography is, and by whom,” Mr. Skybetter said. “With machines, it becomes difficult to point to any singular choreography by one person or system.”As more choreographers deconstruct and redefine their craft with the help of A.I., they are often faced with the question: At what point does human creation end and the machine take over?ImageDanish Dance Theater in a performance — each one is distinct — of Pontus Lidberg’s “Centaur.” Foreground, Lua Mayenco Cardenal, left, and Merete Hersvik.Credit...Per Morten AbrahamsenArguments against A.I. making art are as old as A.I. itself: It is ethically abhorrent, it cheapens art, it accelerates the redundancy of humanity — the list goes on. Sean D. Kelly, a professor of philosophy at Harvard University and the author of a book on A.I. called “All Things Shining,” wrote in a 2019 article for the M.I.T. Technology Review wrote about what worried him: “We will come to treat artificially intelligent machines as so vastly superior to us that we will naturally attribute creativity to them. Should that happen, it will not be because machines have outstripped us. It will be because we will have denigrated ourselves.”But for those working with dance and A.I., this view seems fatalistic. “What is often not clear,” Mr. Lidberg said, “is that an A.I. with a consciousness doesn’t exist. That is science fiction. However you choose to intellectualize it, the human body and mind are still central to dance.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAs the dance world continues to navigate the pandemic, Mr. McGregor stresses the importance of “finding ways that audiences can engage viscerally with work — not just cerebrally.” He suggests that haptic technologies — like virtual reality headsets and other user engagement tools primarily used in gaming — could be the way to experience what he calls a “chemical engagement” with dance.Some are already coming up with ideas. Kate Sicchio, a choreographer and an assistant professor of dance and media technologies at Virginia Commonwealth University, is developing a visual dance score created by a machine. As part of her research, she stages “live coding jams,” in which dancers respond to notations projected onscreen. There are obvious applications to our pandemic context: “You could do one of these jams distantly — I have done it once. But nothing beats being in the room.”Mr. Skybetter is similarly adamant that “none of these technologies can really exist without a human hand.” A human is needed at every stage: to input the coding, feed it with information and design the algorithm to reach creative goals. Science is not at a point where choreographic software can generate its own material. It is hard enough to translate dance to other humans, let alone a computer.“Art needs the fallibility of the human mind to recognize where the unexpected is exciting,” Ms. Waagner Falkenstrom said. Mr. Lidberg agrees: “A.I. can probably replace everybody. But a true artist, one with embodied knowledge, interested in posing questions and making aimless research — no, that cannot be replaced.”For the skeptics, it might be reassuring that there remains an instinctive bias to retain human ownership over art. Machines or virtual reality headsets will struggle to replicate the tension between artist and audience. Just like a robot will struggle to feel or mimic the training held in the bodies of dancers.Ms. Cuan said she believes that learning to choreograph and move alongside intelligent robots will fundamentally change our understanding of human locomotion — and therefore of dance. Particularly because she one day, she said, “robots will be ubiquitous, moving with us.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt is unclear if A.I. will carve out a significant space in the dance canon. But at this nascent stage, it is taking dance to fascinating, sometimes uncomfortable, places. Where this relationship goes next is largely up to science and artistic appetite.Mr. McGregor, for one, is unequivocal about A.I.’s potential. “Creatives think that their process is a mysterious thing that happens to you and it cannot be formalized,” he said. “But the more we understand about how we make our choices, the more we can make different choices.”And, he’s sure about one thing: “Nothing can replace the human heart.”See more on: Merce CunninghamShare full articleRead in appAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEnjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.6-month Welcome Offeroriginal price:   $6.25sale price:   $1/weekLearn more",2020-11-07T14:43:23.000Z,,False,"[{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'name': 'Arts', 'position': 1, 'item': 'https://www.nytimes.com/section/arts'}, {'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'name': 'Dance', 'position': 2, 'item': 'https://www.nytimes.com/section/arts/dance'}]",en,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.meteredContent'}","{'@id': 'https://www.nytimes.com/#publisher', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","{'@id': 'https://www.nytimes.com/#publisher', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",2024.0,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'The New York Times', 'productID': 'nytimes.com:basic'}",https://www.nytco.com/company/diversity-and-inclusion/,https://www.nytco.com/company/standards-ethics/,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/28/admin/the-new-york-times-masthead.html,1851-09-18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times,,,,

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

What rights does a robot have? If our machines become intelligent in the science-fiction way, that’s likely to become a complicated question — and the humans who nurture those robots just might take their side.
Ted Chiang,  a science-fiction author of growing renown with long-lasting connections to Seattle’s tech community, doesn’t back away from such questions. They spark the thought experiments that generate award-winning novellas like “The Lifecycle of Software Objects,” and inspire Hollywood movies like “Arrival.”
Chiang’s soulful short stories have earned him kudos from the likes of The New Yorker, which has called him “one of the most influential science-fiction writers of his generation.” During this year’s pandemic-plagued summer, he joined the Museum of Pop Culture’s Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. And this week, he’s receiving an award from the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation for employing imagination in service to society.
Can science fiction have an impact in the real world, even at times when the world seems as if it’s in the midst of a slow-moving disaster movie?
Absolutely, Chiang says.
“Art is one way to make sense of a world which, on its own, does not make sense,” he says in the latest episode of the Fiction Science podcast, which focuses on the intersection between science and fiction. “Art can impose a kind of order onto things. … It doesn’t offer a cure-all, because I don’t think there’s going to be any easy cure-all, but I think art helps us get by in these stressful times.”

COVID-19 provides one illustration. Chiang would argue that our response to the coronavirus pandemic has been problematic in part because it doesn’t match what we’ve seen in sci-fi movies.
“The greatest conflict that we see generated is from people who don’t believe in it vs. everyone else,” he said. “That might be the product of the fact that it is not as severe. If it looked like various movie pandemics, it’d probably be hard for anyone to deny that it was happening.”
This pandemic may well spark a new kind of sci-fi theme.
“It’s worth thinking about, that traditional depictions of pandemics don’t spend much time on people coming together and trying to support each other,” Chiang said. “That is not typically a theme in stories about disaster or enormous crisis. I guess the narrative is usually, ‘It’s the end of civilization.’ And people have not turned on each other in that way.”
Artificial intelligence is another field where science fiction often gives people the wrong idea. “When we talk about AI in science fiction, we’re talking about something very different than what we mean when we say AI in the context of current technology,” he said.
Chiang isn’t speaking here merely as an author of short stories, but as someone who joined the Seattle tech community three decades ago to work at Microsoft as a technical writer. During his first days in Seattle, his participation in 1989’s Clarion West Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers’ Workshop helped launch his second career as a fiction writer.
In our interview, Chiang didn’t want to say much about the technical-writing side of his career, but his expertise showed through in our discussion about real vs. sci-fi AI. “When people talk about AI in the real world … they’re talking about a certain type of software that is usually like a superpowered version of applied statistics,” he said.
That’s a far cry from the software-enhanced supervillains of movies like “Terminator” or “The Matrix,” or the somewhat more sympathetic characters in shows like “Westworld” and “Humans.”
In Chiang’s view, most depictions of sci-fi AI fall short even by science-fiction standards. “A lot of stories imagine something which is a product like a robot that comes in a box, and you flip it on, and suddenly you have a butler — a perfectly competent and loyal and obedient butler,” he noted. “That, I think jumps over all these steps, because butlers don’t just happen.”
In “The Lifecycle of Software Objects,” Chiang imagines a world in which it takes just as long to raise a robot as it does to raise a child. That thought experiment sparks all kinds of interesting all-too-human questions: What if the people who raise such robots want them to be something more than butlers? Would they stand by and let their sci-fi robot progeny be treated like slaves, even like sex slaves?
“Maybe they want that robot, or conscious software, to have some kind of autonomy,” Chiang said. “To have a good life.”

Chiang’s latest collection of short stories, “Exhalation,” extends those kinds of thought experiments to science-fiction standbys ranging from free will to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
Both those subjects come into play in what’s certainly Chiang’s best-known novella, “Story of Your Life,” which was first published in 1998 and adapted to produce the screenplay for “Arrival” in 2016. Like so many of Chiang’s other stories, “Story of Your Life” takes an oft-used science-fiction trope — in this case, first contact with intelligent aliens — and adds an unexpected but insightful and heart-rending twist.
Chiang said that the success of the novella and the movie hasn’t led to particularly dramatic changes in the story of his own life, but that it has broadened the audience for the kinds of stories he tells.
“Exhalation” is the latest collection of Ted Chiang’s science-fiction short stories. (Knopf Doubleday)
“My work has been read by people who would not describe themselves as science-fiction readers, by people who don’t usually read a lot of science fiction, and that’s been amazing. That’s been really gratifying,” he said. “It’s not something that I ever really expected.”
What’s more, Chiang’s work has been popping up in places where you wouldn’t expect to see science fiction — such as The New York Times, where he weighs in on the implications of human gene editing; or Buzzfeed News, where he reflects on the downside of Silicon Valley’s world view; or the journal Nature, where you can find Chiang’s thought experiments on free will and transhumanism; or Nautilus, where Chiang offers an unorthodox perspective on SETI.
During our podcast chat, Chiang indulged in yet another thought experiment: Could AI replace science-fiction writers?
Chiang’s answer? It depends.
“If we could get software-generated novels that were coherent, but not necessarily particularly good, I think there would be a market for them,” he said.
But Chiang doesn’t think that would doom human authors.
“For an AI to generate a novel that you think of as really good, that you feel like, ‘Oh, wow, this novel was both gripping and caused me to think about my life in a new way’ — that, I think, is going to be very, very hard,” he said.
Ted Chiang only makes it look easy.

Some technology firms built AI models to predict election outcomes.  Photo: michael reynolds/ShutterstockIn the months leading up to Election Day, pollsters placed voters under the microscope, parsing data from telephone surveys and past voting trends to determine probable outcomes. By Tuesday evening, as results veered from predictions, it was the pollsters’ turn under the microscope. There are alternative ways of assessing sentiment, though. Some technology experts say artificial intelligence, used increasingly by companies to gauge customer sentiment, could hold promise for better understanding the electorate.Newsletter Sign-upWSJ | CIO JournalThe Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team.PreviewSubscribe“I wouldn’t fire the pollsters, but I would direct them to try to leverage machine learning, data mining and AI in their work more to get better projections,” said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI, a nonprofit research center in Seattle.The size of this year’s polling error is still unknown as the vote count continues. But polls generally predicted clear Democratic gains, not cliffhangers.No person or algorithm can predict human behavior accurately all the time, said Heidi Messer, chairman of New York-based Collective[i], which offers AI and predictive technologies for sales teams. But the problem with traditional polls is that the designations pollsters use are based on historical classifications and averages. Polling will need to find a data source that captures actual behavior the way tech firms such as Amazon.com Inc. do. “Amazon’s algorithm doesn’t care if I’m a person or a dog, it just knows that if I buy a leash, I’m likely to buy kibble,” she said.She added: “Data reflecting behavior is much harder to amass but infinitely more useful in dynamically identifying the patterns and correlations that fuel probabilistic predictions.”A few AI companies have used their models to make election predictions.Expert.ai, an Italian software company specializing in natural-language processing, applied its technology to millions of social posts around the candidates. Its AI system, trained partly on past elections, analyzed factors such as tone and emotion and projected how that might translate into votes. Expert.ai’s system projected that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would win 50.2% of the popular vote and Republican President Donald Trump would get 47.3% of the vote, a 2.9 percentage-point margin. As of Friday afternoon, Mr. Biden had 50.5% of the popular vote compared with Mr. Trump’s 47.8%, a 2.7 percentage-point margin. (Dow Jones & Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal, is an Expert.ai customer.) Unanimous.ai ran a live survey in September asking 50 participants to predict who would win the presidential contest in 11 battleground states and by what margin. Photo: Unanimous.aiAnother company, San Luis Obispo, Calif.-based Unanimous.ai, sells what is known as swarm-intelligence software. It uses AI models to aggregate predictions and decisions from groups of people, such as investors predicting commodity prices.Chief Executive Louis Rosenberg said his team used the software to run a live survey of 50 people in the U.S. in September, asking them to predict who they thought would win the presidential contest in 11 battleground states and by what margin.As of Sunday afternoon, that September survey had correctly predicted the winner of the presidential vote in 10 battleground state races as called by the Associated Press. It is on track to correctly predict the final state, North Carolina. The survey also generally predicted which of the races would be tighter.Unanimous.ai’s live survey allows users to see what other participants are choosing in real time, and machine-learning algorithms assess who has the most confidence in their predictions, based on factors such as answer changes. The most confident answers have the greatest influence on the final aggregated answer.“Our data was 50 randomly selected voters and then the use of a swarm to amplify their intelligence; it wasn’t 100,000 poll samples,” Dr. Rosenberg said. “Again and again, we see that we’re able to outperform really huge polls.” Advertisement


But not all AI polling was that accurate.Polly, developed by AI consumer market research company Advanced Symbolics Inc., had successfully predicted some 20 elections and referendums, including the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union.ASI predicted Mr. Biden would win. However, it had him taking Florida and winning the electoral vote 372 to 166. The AP has called Florida for Mr. Trump and the AP’s electoral vote totals so far are much closer, but they do have Mr. Biden in the lead.“We got this one wrong,” said Kenton White, an ASI co-founder and the company’s chief scientist.More From CIO JournalInternet Browsers Are Getting a Makeover for the WorkplaceJuly 2, 2024CDK Global Hack Shows Risk of One Software Vendor Dominating an IndustryJune 29, 2024Goldman Sachs Deploys Its First Generative AI Tool Across the FirmJune 27, 2024To make election predictions, ASI uses machine learning to track and analyze election-related topics being discussed on major social media sites, such as Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. The company harvests public data from the sites to come up with a sample of users that represent the U.S. population.Polly also taps data on past elections and looks at how people’s posts in the past matched up against previous votes to make a prediction on which way a population might go in an upcoming election. For instance, it might see that people in past elections who talked about bringing jobs back to America leaned Republican and those talking about global warming leaned Democrat.Erin Kelly, ASI’s co-founder and chief executive officer, says using AI to predict an election is still a relatively young practice. And one of the strengths of AI is that models can learn and tend to get better over time.For Polly, she said, this year’s election “is a learning experience.”Write to Jared Council at jared.council@wsj.com and John McCormick at john.mccormick@wsj.comCopyright ©2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

 You may have seen Pepper the robot in the news. She has been introduced as HSBC Bank’s in-branch greeter and banking assistant. She currently provides bank patrons with information and entertainment, but as her technology improves, she will provide more personalization through features like facial recognition. 






 While the average person may not be greeted at the bank by an actual robot, we see artificial intelligence being used regularly in our day-to-day banking world. 


 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 
 Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to independently perform tasks normally done by humans, more specifically, things like understanding language, making decisions, or solving problems. 

 Machine learning (ML) refers to systems that can not only do the tasks but learn from experience. In banking, computer systems are fed a great amount of data about customers. Computers can sort, classify, and analyze that data. They can make predictions based on customers’ previous behavior and make decisions based on previously determined criteria. Systems can also learn from exceptions and improve over time. 








 Where Is AI Being Used? 
 Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been used in banking, to some extent, for many years. Over the last several years, as customers rely more on mobile banking and online services, brick and mortar banks have reduced their number of locations. 

 In 2020, with the onset of the pandemic, many local bank branches closed for extended periods of time. Thankfully, we were still able to complete many of our daily banking tasks. According to Statista, there are 57 million people in the U.S. alone using mobile banking. 

    

 Here are some everyday banking services where you might see AI and ML at work: 

Telephone banking: When you call your bank, you’ll need to verify your identity. AI is at work there, matching PINs or using voice recognition for authentication. Websites and mobile banking: Most banks allow you to manage your accounts, complete everyday apps online, and offer mobile apps to access accounts on the go, make bill payments, send money, and more. AI is connecting and managing all the interactions between services and keeping your transactions secure in the process.Some British banks allow customers wishing to open an account to send a selfie to validate their identity. This means you can open an account in minutes without visiting a branch or waiting days for manual verification. Chatbots: When you visit your bank online or open your mobile app, you might be greeted by an AI-powered chatbot, who can help you locate information or services. Conversational banking allows you to ask questions and get answers in real-time. Your interactions are stored so the bots can give you more personalized services each time you connect, and recommend products for you, based on your behavior and the services you already use. Budgeting: If you’re using online budget software like YNAB or EveryDollar, you’ll see AI in the way these systems interact with your banking transactions, automatically move funds into designated categories, and make future projections about your financial situation. Integration with digital assistants: In some countries, you can ask Google or Alexa, in plain language, to do simple transactions such as check your accounts or pay a bill. Retail payments: Instead of using credit or debit cards to pay for purchases, many people use their mobile devices for contactless shopping. Services like Apple Pay and Google Pay allow users to make payments securely, with mobile devices, using biometric face or fingerprint scanning technology. Lending: AI processes at your favorite lending institutions means you can apply for credit cards, loans, and even mortgages. Whether AI is involved at certain stages or during the whole process will depend on the bank. But it can mean faster and more accurate decision making and more security for you and the lender. Investments: With the ability to handle huge amounts of data, AI is transforming investment banking too. Systems can keep up with industry changes and make better predictions over time. Investors can even make voice-activated trades on their morning commute. 









 Behind the Scenes 
 No matter which banking activities you are using, you can be sure there is some aspect of artificial intelligence involved. That number is set to increase exponentially over the next several years. 

 Through automated processes, banks collect, sort, categorize, and analyze huge amounts of data to target customers through marketing, better personalize their services, and offer you the best products for your needs. 

 Considering automatic transactions are less expensive than in-branch activities, AI processes help banks to reduce their costs. 

 At the same time, AI and ML are helping banks monitor data for unusual transactions, to detect and prevent fraudulent activity, and to keep your accounts secure. 



 What’s in It for you? 
 You get 24/7 convenience to bank on your own terms, personalized service based on your previous behavior or that of people similar to you, and faster service overall. 






 You might think people would be leery about giving up their privacy for the sake of convenience, but according to Genpact, 68 percent of millennials and over 42 percent of older generations are okay with businesses using their personal data if it means they will get better customer service. 

    



 Concerns with AI in the Banking Industry 
Privacy Risks 
 Whenever organizations collect a large amount of data, there is a possible security risk. Personal information is always open to hackers, but banks and FinTech companies spend huge amounts of time and money to predict, analyze, and prepare to mitigate those risks. Data is encrypted, verification processes are becoming more complex, and security and fraud detection are very high priorities. 





Job Loss 
 As in any industry, people question whether automation in the banking industry will eliminate jobs. This may be a valid concern as many banks have reduced their brick and mortar location as online and mobile options have increased. That said, automation means that banks can offer more services so new jobs may appear in different areas. Leaders in the banking industry claim they are investing in technology, not to eliminate the human experience, but to make it better. 



 AI in the Banking Industry Is Here to Stay 
 While some banks are moving forward with artificial intelligence and machine learning at a faster pace than others, the consensus is AI in the banking industry is here to stay. As technology improves, banks will continue to provide faster, more convenient, more personalized services for you while benefiting from better marketing, reduced costs, and time savings themselves.

Same goes for AI – individuals can utilize it for creating medical diagnosis equipment or killing machines; the main thing that matters is who is utilizing it and for what. For instance, in the medical field the AI algorithms could be utilized to become familiar with the best chemical constituents that can be utilized to fix diseases. Then again, AI can likewise be utilized to build up UAVs to kill individuals (great/terrible) by learning different war skills..We have encountered similar blended emotions about AI faltering between fear, fascination, and hope. Frequently, it is depicted as the start of a startling apocalyptic age when robots will control over humankind and sci-fi bad dreams work out as expected. In a similar vein, for some individuals, AI is that scary digital monster that will greatly gobble up jobs and will prompt a jobless future. Interestingly, AI is viewed as the crucial part for staggering technological advancements and innovations such as self-driving cars, autonomous drones, or smart personal agents..It is unequivocally attached to a sentiment of expectation that AI will be the overall answer for the most challenging problems of our time. Enchanted expectations on AI lead to a &quot;technotopia&quot;, a promotion where nothing is by all accounts possible. These outrageous sentiments and conceptions are powered by intense, clingy features that virally spread in social media. However, they regularly don't reflect reality. We get charmed by new AI accomplishments, yet we overlook that these features are generally shown in explicit test settings but then not prepared to work practically..There are different kinds of friendships: friendships of utility, pleasure, and goodness. Aristotle utilized these separations to depict the inspiration driving our connections. Some are simple comfort and energized by mutual gain; others depend on partaking in exercises together, yet blur away without that external stimulus..The 'best' kind of friendships have solid basics: mutual respect and unselfish desire. We all know how unique and precious these friendships are, as they don't tag along regularly..We likewise realize that fellowship can have no justifiable purpose. Think about a lion prepping infant chick as opposed to eating down on it. In any case, what advantage do we gain from positioning the significance of friendships? It's fundamental to guarantee neither one of the parties is being exploited, but past that, as long as it brings you bliss, does it truly make a difference? If you just spend time with somebody since you need somebody to play golf with, and AI can repeat that and become your chess partner, your experience isn't debased on the grounds that one is a machine..Artificial intelligence will supplement human work as opposed to supplanting it. In numerous cases, AI algorithms are not precise enough to completely automate a particular task. Accept imaged based diagnosis for instance: A computer vision algorithm can just give proposals. A doctor constantly needs to revise the proposal since an off-base finding could be lethal for the patient. Nonetheless, AI can feature the data that is applicable for the diagnosis, empowering the doctor to be more gainful..As the lines between people and machines keep on obscuring, there's likewise whether or not seeing AI as a friend could have unfriendly impacts. Mike Elgan from Fast Company contends against teaching children to be obliging to Alexa by expressing: &quot;we don't need kids to see Alexa as a friend or having human qualities and forming attachments that will make shaping incredulity later on more troublesome.&quot; This proposes that one day machines might need to dupe us, putting the individuals who use them in danger. On the whole, we need to give them power. Giving them characters tracks into this domain – yet we never recommended the ride would be a simple one..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

From drug discovery to thermal scans, AI has transformed this sector significantly over the past decade. While we know AI's contributions to physical healthcare, AI is also easing mental health concerns too. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA)'s 2016 report on drug use and health, only 63% of adults identified as having had at least one major depressive episode reported receiving any kind of treatment..In the US alone, one in five adults suffers from a form of mental illness. Suicide rates are at an all-time high, 115 people die daily from substance abuse, and one in eight Americans over 12 years old take an antidepressant every day. The economic burden of depression alone is estimated to be a minimum of US$210 billion annually, which includes costs due to increased absenteeism and reduced productivity in the workplace. The situation is grim in other regions as well. For instance, in Europe, 83 million people are struggling with mental health. Other than this, people also have to endure stigma, lack of mental health professionals and high costs of counselling sessions too..Currently, during the world pandemic crisis, even the COVID-19 has been tangibly affecting millions of people in terms of their mental peace. Rates of depression and panic attacks are much higher than normal. Isolation due to social distancing has triggered sleep deprivation, social anxiety, and reduced happiness while also causing people to worry about their jobs. As per a report, 70% of people have had more stress and anxiety at work this year than any other previous year. This increased stress and anxiety have negatively impacted the mental health of 78% of the global workforce, causing more stress (38%), a lack of work-life balance (35%), burnout (25%), depression due to lack of socialization (25%), and loneliness (14%). A recent report by Deloitte suggests COVID-19's impact on mental health could last for years.While, AI is proving to be an effective way for clinicians to both make the best of the time they do have with patients, and bridge any gaps in access, it has also helped in early prediction and diagnosis of the diseases too. So, incorporating AI to address mental health issues can achieve similar promising results. For starters, this can be done by employing AI into digital interventions, like web and smartphone apps, to enhance user experience and optimize personalized mental health care. One can analyze modern streams of abundant data as a means to develop prediction or detection models for mental health conditions. E.g. Quartet Health, has reduced hospitalization of patients by 15-25% by screening patient medical histories and behavioral patterns to uncover undiagnosed mental health problems..Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville has created a machine learning algorithm that uses hospital admissions data, including age, gender, zip code, medication, and diagnostic history, to predict the likelihood of any given individual taking their own life. Scientists are experimenting with linear classifiers of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to risk assessment in possible PTSD cases..Also, while AI would not replace existing therapists and psychiatrists, it surely provides a medium where people can talk about their struggles without the fear of being judges or facing stigma. Further, AI can help doctors and therapists increase emotional awareness for their patients, such as in expressing empathy. Research has also proved that AI helped employees improve their mental health at work..Next, we have emotional AI-powered chatbots (like Wysa, Woebot) that can provide unprecedented accessibility by being available 24/7 at little to no cost. These apps collect data that allow them to create a level of therapeutic rapport with users and offer relevant responses. Mood tracking apps like Woebot, which is created by a team of Stanford psychologists and AI experts, uses brief daily chat conversations, mood tracking, curated videos, and word games to help people manage mental health. This is faster and comfortable than traditional practice in mental health where professionals rely on the individual to observe and self-report indicative changes. E.g. IBM's Computational Psychiatry and Neuroimaging group, alongside several universities, have built a model using NLP to predict the onset of psychosis in patients. This model can detect differences in speech patterns between high-risk patients who develop psychosis and those who did not. At present, a team of scientists at Dublin, Ireland-based startup Behavidence is currently preparing to launch an effective digital phenotyping solution that can provide an accurate psychiatric diagnosis for ADHD..Mental health will likely remain a major challenge in today's world due to various reasons. Although AI for mental health still needs to deal with many complexities, its applications and tools are doing an appreciable job in alleviating this issue for many. Soon it will be well equipped to mitigate and manage the stress, depression and trauma, things which are living hell for many..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

This AI-powered project towards recognizing work stress and fatigue aims to leverage the abilities of human-machine teams, cooperating to solve complex problems. According to MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers, much of the development of these human-machine teams focuses on the machine, addressing the technology challenges of training AI algorithms to perform their role in a mission effectively..Pointing out to the collaboration between humans and machines, Michael Pietrucha, a tactical systems specialist at the laboratory, said that in the area of human-machine collaboration, he and his team often think about the technology, such as how do they monitor it, understand it, and make sure it is working right. But he further noted that teamwork is a two-way street, and the machine can help humans to boost their performance. Pietrucha is one of the laboratory researchers that intends to develop AI systems that can sense a person's cognitive fatigue interfering with their work performance..Furthermore, Megan Blackwell, former deputy lead of internally funded biological science and technology research at the laboratory, explained that neuromonitoring is becoming more specific and portable today. &quot;We envision using technology to monitor for fatigue or cognitive overload. Is this person attending to too much? Will they run out of gas, so to speak? If you can monitor the human, you could intervene before something bad happens.&quot; she said. Using technology to read a person's cognitive or emotional state has been the laboratory's decade-long research..The stress and fatigue recognition system operates on biometric data such as video and audio recordings of a person speaking. By processing these data with advanced AI algorithms, researchers found biomarkers of various psychological and neurobehavioral conditions. These biomarkers have been used to train models that can accurately estimate the level of a person's depression, for example..As part of the study, the team will apply their biomarker research to an artificial intelligence-powered system to assess an individual's cognitive state, encapsulating how fatigued, stressed, or overloaded a person is feeling. The system will use biomarkers derived from physiological data such as vocal and facial recordings, heart rate, EEG and optical indications of brain activity, and eye movement to excerpt these insights..According to researchers, the first step will be to build a cognitive model of an individual. This will integrate the physiological inputs and monitor the inputs to see how they change as a person performs particular fatiguing tasks, according to Thomas Quatieri, who leads several neurobehavioral biomarker research efforts at the MIT Lincoln laboratory. This process will enable the AI system to establish patterns of activity and learn a person's baseline cognitive state involving basic task-related functions needed to prevent injury or undesirable outcomes, such as auditory and visual attention and response time. When this individualized baseline is established, the system can begin recognizing deviations from normal and predict if those deviations will lead to mistakes or poor performance..Currently, the project is in its early stage as researchers are collecting data to train their algorithms and develop the technology further..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
