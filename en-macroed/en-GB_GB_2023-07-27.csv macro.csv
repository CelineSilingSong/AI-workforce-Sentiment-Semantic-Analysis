  Recent advancements in artificial Intelligence have been met with anxiety that this will have large negative impacts on employment. This column examines the link between AI-enabled technologies and employment shares in 16 European countries, finding that occupations potentially more exposed to AI-enabled technologies increased their employment share. This has been particularly the case for occupations with a relatively higher proportion of younger and skilled workers.

What do hiring managers think? Can you really automate a CV?             Written by   Helena Young       Updated on     30 July 2023       Our experts     We are a team of writers, experimenters and researchers providing you with the best advice with zero bias or partiality.    Written and reviewed by:       Helena Young  Lead Writer       Direct to your inbox       Sign up to the Startups Weekly Newsletter   Stay informed on the top business stories with Startups.co.uk’s weekly email newsletter   SUBSCRIBE      From data privacy, to tech layoffs, there are few industries where artificial intelligence hasn’t caused consternation. Now, it’s the turn of the recruitment sector, as hiring managers battle it out over the latest hot topic: should job seekers be allowed to apply to a job using AI?Across the country, candidates are employing free generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, as their own personal job coach. With just a simple prompt, the tools will write out their resumes and cover letters, research interview questions, and draft email messages in mere seconds.Clearly, there are benefits aplenty for the candidate. Hiring managers, however, are less enthused. The sudden upswing in AI usage has caught many off guard, with several of the biggest advantages and drawbacks yet to be uncovered.We spoke to various HR experts about the conundrum, each of whom hold different views about the role of AI in job applications. Below, we’ll explore each line of reasoning to see if ChatGPT belongs in today’s interview room.The arguments forSupporters of AI in recruitment present a wide-range of arguments to back their claims. Largely, most of the people we spoke to said the adoption of the technology was inevitable. They contend it should be mined for its significant opportunities and growth potential.“AI removes bias in the application process”One recurring compliment given to AI was its ability to remove bias within the hiring process. Robot recruiters, supporters say, are blind to demographics and can appraise a candidate without human prejudices.This might be too bold a claim. After all, the software can only be as impartial as the data it is trained on, and there are plenty of examples of AI recruiting tools that have been swayed towards certain groups. Statistical bias is still a threat.The technology is more defensible, however, when it comes to applications. Specifically, the idea of accessibility. Generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, can assist people who don’t have the type of personality skills commonly relied upon to wow in an interview.Richard Collins is cofounder of CV Wallet, a career management app. He praises the democratisation of AI tools as a positive step towards fairer hiring practices.“Traditional application processes have been biased towards native speakers and those from certain educational backgrounds” he argues. “Someone’s ability to write a cover letter is no indicator of their ability to do the job. With AI, we can focus on a candidate’s true potential.”“It shows smart thinking”It might be tempting to view the use of AI as an example of laziness from the candidate. After all, why can’t they just write a cover letter themselves? However, this argument is a bit like asking why the inventor of the typewriter couldn’t just write by hand.Technology is constantly coming up with new ways to disrupt our traditional way of working by helping us to do things faster and more efficiently. Proponents of AI ask: shouldn’t we be congratulating those that are smart enough to take advantage of it?Charlotte is a 25 year old job seeker. She says she has been using ChatGPT to help create a large volume of cover letters at speed. According to her, this approach is evidence of lateral thinking, not laziness.“Engaging with the latest technology to streamline repetitive tasks shows good time management and an openness to changing work style,” she argues. “It also makes sure you’re hitting all the key job requirements recruiters are looking for.”Collins agrees. He admits that CV Wallet recently hired a candidate who gave a presentation written by AI during the interview process.“They were honest about it, and we found it quite intriguing,” he recalls. “We ended up hiring them because we value their honesty, and we believe that using AI could make them more productive in their role.”“Hirers are using it already”The use of AI in job submissions might have caught some recruiters unawares. But it is hardly a new addition to the industry. Tons of innovative startups have cropped up in the past few years to supercharge company hiring practices.Take the recruitment platform, Gigged.ai. Deployed in the early stages of the application process, it uses machine learning to capture information from hundreds of documents at a glance. Inarguably, this is making the process much smoother for the employer.Given the high volume of work required to apply to a job, AI can prevent applicants from spending hours labouring on a submission that might not bear career fruit. So are they simply playing catch up with their potential employers?Charlotte says she started using AI after writing several cover letters from scratch, but then hearing nothing back. “It felt like a complete waste of time to have dedicated a couple of hours to never even receiving an email of rejection,” she says.As a result of her efforts, she’s had more reward than pushback. “I’ve been called back for more follow ups and interviews as I’ve been able to complete applications faster,” she divulges.The arguments againstStartups has reported on the ‘AI skills gap’, referring to the disconnect between the availability of AI software and jobs-ready talent.Most of the arguments against allowing AI to apply to a job posting revolved around misapplication, as individuals and businesses struggle to get to grips with the technology.“Information could be inaccurate”One big concern for recruiters when it comes to the use of AI to apply for jobs is the phenomenon of hallucinations. This is when an AI tool generates false or misleading information.Since many people already include some white lies in their CVs, there is a risk that AI could worsen the problem by creating exaggerated skills and qualifications.Collins admits this could create challenges for employers looking for the right candidates. He proposes that, to tackle the problem, managers must be educated on proper verification techniques during the selection process.“Job applicants need to show their CVs are accurate and authentic to improve their chances, and employers need access to a complete overview of the verified elements such as identity, right to work, skills, qualifications, and experience,” he sets out.“If we provide jobseekers with an easy way to verify their credentials, this can minimise the impact of hallucinations, as employers will have already confirmed the candidate’s authenticity before the interview stage.”“AI applications sound the same”Artificial intelligence so far lacks human agency and creativity. If every applicant is using the same platform, they will no doubt struggle to stand out amidst a sea of uniform, automated responses.Neil Armstrong is Chief Commercial Officer at Tribepad, a recruitment tech company. Armstrong echoes the belief that using AI too much could result in a boring application.“If the company receives 100 emails that all sound the same, and one that shows a real passion and flair, who do you think they will choose?” he questions.Armstrong says that recruiters will be looking out for job seekers who are using ChatGPT to ‘fake’ interview answers, work histories, or test results. He says applicants should review and personalise anything produced by generative AI to ensure it sounds 100% human.“ChatGPT can save time, but it’s not a reliable tool,” he adds. “Rather than just use it blind, candidates should use critical thinking to question the output and elaborate and enhance to add personality, nuance and create bespoke tailoring.”If you think this seems obvious – think again. One recruiter we spoke to told us about an applicant who had pasted ‘generated by ChatGPT’ into their submission in error.“Companies might hire the wrong candidate”When it comes to AI in recruitment, the biggest threat to small business owners is that its adherents might use it to win a job they are unsuitable for.There is no guarantee that an AI tool will accurately assess a job seeker’s suitability for a role. Businesses risk wasting time and money on onboarding and employing an individual who is wrong for the role; potentially leading to hiring regret for the employer.Similarly, a company could just as easily miss out on identifying the correct candidate amongst a pool of brilliant, but ultimately fictional, contenders.Ian Nicholas is Global Managing Director at Reed. Nicholas warns that if interviewees do not factcheck AI responses, companies may end up issuing incorrect job rejections. This could cause them to miss out on qualified talent during an already disastrous labour shortage.“The AI may outline experiences which the candidate may not truly have, or it could easily undersell them,” he expands. “With more and more people using AI to help build their CV, users must be aware of best practices.”Does the job application process need updating?We’ve weighed the pros and cons of wielding AI to apply to a job. In truth, there is little that recruiters can do to stop the freewheeling artificial intelligence bandwagon. But this could be an opportunity to steer it in another direction.Indeed, Charlotte says recruiters who oppose the use of AI for job applications should adapt or be left behind. “If they don’t want people to use ChatGPT it might be time to update the application process for jobs and ask questions that AI can’t help with,” she shrugs.She might have a point. We’ve highlighted the mistakes and outdated practices that today’s managers commonly make during the hiring process. Many, such as ghosting applicants or setting overly-long assessment tasks, could be behind AI’s surging popularity.Bosses should use the advent of AI to audit their own talent strategy. Do your questions invite unique responses? Are you properly vetting a candidate’s CV? Blindly embracing AI is not the answer here, but neither is rejecting it outright.That ChatGPT is now an open tab on job seekers’ laptops proves the market is adapting. It’s time for business owners to do the same.More on this: uncover how AI can help you manage the hiring pipeline with our guide to using AI in project management.

Need to send an email? Generative AI can write it. Need to review a press release? Generative AI can edit it. Don’t want to review your meeting notes? Generative AI can summarize them.  It also didn’t take long for businesses to recognize the limitations of the public large language models (LLMs) that consumer generative AI technologies like ChatGPT are based on, leaving them and their employees searching for a secure and reliable generative AI tool.  The solution: C3 Generative AI — it’s designed for the enterprise and is distinct from consumer LLMs in several ways. It provides:  Security for an enterprise’s IP:  Yes, consumer LLMs can summarize meeting notes, but that information is at risk of being leaked since your data gets stored on external servers. C3 Generative AI eliminates LLM-leakage by isolating a business’s proprietary data from the LLM. This allows workers to submit queries and conduct data processing and analysis without fear of jeopardizing their business’s privacy and security.  Accurate answers:  While consumer generative AI can quickly return facts and figures, their answers are predicted based on the public, unverified data they are trained on, making them prone to generating false information, known as hallucinations. Relying on an enterprise’s proprietary data, C3 Generative AI ensures that answers come from the appropriate sources. When a user asks an unanswerable question, a safeguard blocks the application from hallucinating and generating an incorrect answer.  Consistent responses:  Two people can ask a consumer LLM like ChatGPT the same question, yet the LLM can produce two different answers. Rather than having the LLM predict an answer, C3 Generative AI employs a separate system, like a vector store connected to a retrieval model or a retrieval model connected to a database, to source relevant information from an enterprise’s data, which gets summarized by the LLM. Full traceability:  Even if consumer LLMs generated accurate and consistent information, workers have no way of tracing its source. With C3 Generative AI, the system shows which documents it’s using to generate answers. Complete access control:  Consumer LLMs give everyone equal access to all underlying data. This doesn’t suit the needs of a business or government agency, where what documents people can access are tied to their role. C3 Generative AI gives enterprises total control over which employees can see what. In a webinar on generative AI in the workplace, C3 AI’s lead product manager, Michael Haines, showcased these features, demonstrating how an investment banking analyst could review a lengthy financial bond document. C3 Generative AI sources information directly from a financial bond document to answer specific questions.  Through his queries, C3 Generative AI identified the purpose of the bond and located crucial information scattered throughout the document, completing the hours-long review process in seconds. If Haines wanted to further investigate where in the document answers are sourced from, the responses provide links to their exact locations.  Professionals want to use generative AI at work, but it’s important that they do so in a trustworthy and secure manner. Only by adopting generative AI designed specifically for the needs of the enterprise will professionals realize its full potential to help them work securely, efficiently, and effectively. In turn, workers can spend more time focusing on the high value and high complexity tasks that demand their attention.

Overview

        Generative Artificial Intelligence tools have been around for a while, but it was the release of ChatGPT that enabled this technology to be used by the masses on an everyday basis – an “iPhone moment” for generative AI. What impact will the increased use of (generative) AI have on our working
      














Have you found yourself asking which of your daily tasks could be done by artificial intelligence (AI) – whether at home or at the workplace? I can think of a few things. For example, I could have used ChatGPT to write this blog post for me (but I didn’t).

While artificial intelligence sifts through, structures and analyzes vast amounts of (unstructured) data, generative AI can even draw conclusions and create new content, based on the data that’s been used to train it. Since the AI-based chatbot ChatGPT was released to the general public at the end of November 2022, the topic of (generative) AI has been on everyone’s lips. After just five days, one million people had registered for ChatGPT; after two months, the number of registered users had reached 100 million. By comparison, Spotify took over four and a half years to cross the 100 million user threshold; Instagram took two and a half years and even TikTok took nine months. Only Threads, the new microblogging service, grew even faster than ChatGPT in its initial weeks.

Many people are therefore saying that artificial intelligence is having an “iPhone moment”, which is when, practically overnight, an already well-known technology is used by the masses on an everyday basis because a new, relatively simple product makes it easy for anyone to operate.

How will the increasing use of ChatGPT and other (generative) AI applications impact our working environment? And how will it change the nature of our work? Of course, at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, we are also faced with these questions. I would like to summarize my insights in four hypotheses:

1.    Automation of work processes is yesterday’s news – today, AI supports well-trained knowledge workers

Using AI is not about automated production processes in factories, i.e. robots, taking over people’s jobs. It is rather a matter of AI gathering and processing unstructured data and information. As such, it also has the potential to support well-trained knowledge workers.

A study by Goldman Sachs concludes that a good two thirds of occupations could be partially automated by AI in the future; only around 7% of jobs would be completely replaced by AI. Scientists at OpenAI – the start-up that developed ChatGPT – and the University of Pennsylvania assume that AI language models will change most jobs in some way or another. Around 80% of employees in the United States work in jobs in which at least one task could be carried out faster by generative AI. The scientists expect around 19% of employees to see at least half of their work tasks affected. Both studies conclude that AI applications will increasingly be used in offices and in administration but will see less use in skilled trades and in the operation of plants and machines where many processes are already automated.

2.    Job profiles are changing – from “creator” to “reviewer”

As AI supports our work to an ever-greater extent, the challenges we face will change. After all, some of the tasks that we’ve always had to do ourselves will be taken over by AI in the future, at least to a certain point. In the future, we will work less as “creators” of content such as letters, inventory lists and production plans because the AI can do this much quicker. Instead, we will increasingly take on a “reviewer” role and check whether the content created by the AI is correct and logical.

3.    Enabling instead of prohibiting – the management is paving the way

Since the AI can relieve us of many time-consuming activities, we need to learn to delegate tasks to it and use it as productively as possible. In other words, saying “no” to AI is not an option; quite the contrary, everyone should include these applications in their portfolio of work tools wherever they are useful and helpful.

Some companies are still trying to prohibit the use of ChatGPT out of fear that internal or even confidential information could be shared in a public network. This is understandable but also too short-sighted. Instead of blocking these innovations, I believe the more promising path forward is to enable employees to use them productively within the company in accordance with the rules. This is the path we have chosen at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, having recently installed our own version of ChatGPT. Incidentally, we’re one of the first companies to do this.

4.    ChatGPT is just the beginning – connecting it with other systems gives rise to unimaginable possibilities

Even if companies can’t get around ChatGPT, plug-ins give them a chance to freestyle. Using plug-ins – i.e., extensions that enable ChatGPT to access other programs – ChatGPT can obtain search engine results, create travel itineraries, compare prices, execute code, access documents, and much more. For example, connecting an internal chatbot, to an ERP system that manages the business processes of a company gives rise to completely new possibilities in manufacturing, logistics, supply chain, and accounting.

All of this is coming – the development towards artificial intelligence cannot be stopped. The dynamism and speed with which new AI applications are coming onto the market is massive and the expectations associated with it are great. AI will sharply increase the productivity of humans and processes and ultimately, the quality, innovative capacity, and delivery reliability of our products. We therefore see AI as a crucial instrument for maintaining a competitive edge.

Of course, increased use of (generative) AI is also associated with risks – especially of an ethical nature. For example, users looking at images and texts may no longer be able to distinguish between fact and fiction, or they might not know whether they’re interacting with a human or an AI – which can generally lead to a loss of trust in communication. At Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, we have therefore developed a Code of Digital Ethics, which provides our colleagues with clear principles on how they should handle ethical issues in a digital context. Moreover, these principles are integrated into critical processes, meaning the ethical issues are taken into consideration right from the start.

This just leaves one crucial question: How will AI impact the employment situation? At the beginning of this blog post, I quoted studies indicating that AI will change jobs rather than causing them to disappear completely. I am convinced that AI, in most cases, will not replace humans, but humans who can deal with AI will replace those who can’t or won’t.

/news/finance/how-to-get-a-hedge-fund-job pay the most

AI has the potential to become an important part of the quantitative trading process at hedge funds and this shows in their recruitment. It also shows in their pay.

/news/2022/11/leave-goldman-sachs-for-a-fintech, the former Goldman Sachs salesman turned global head of financial services at tech infrastructure firm, Databricks says he's seen hedge funds paying ""top AI talent $320-$430k out of college."" AI guys are catching up with investment professionals in terms of pay, says Nakai.  Tech has moved ""from a cost center to THE source of competitive advantage"" he adds. 

Most big hedge funds are hiring in AI. Citadel, for example, is looking for experience in any one of ""machine learning, time-series analysis, pattern recognition or NLP.""

Steve Cohen's hedge fund, Point72, has AI quant roles plus multiple roles dedicated to enhancing research in the field, such as intern and graduate machine learning researchers. It's also hiring for an associate of its private equity division to specialize in 'deep tech.'

/news/2019/07/technology-jobs-banksBanks, having more employees than hedge funds, should have a lot more AI roles on offer, right? Not necessarily. It depends how you measure it, but some banks are barely hiring AI professionals. The graph below shows how many job listings banks have that specify a number of AI related terms in the name of the role. 

/news/2023/05/jpmorgan-data-science-machine-learning-jobs has made its /news/2023/05/jpmorgan-ai-engineering-jobs-fintechclear, and has the most jobs (although it's not yet hiring for its investment advice chatbot IndexGPT). Goldman's pursuit of NLP staff is also noticeable in its current job ads.  Citi's numbers are somewhat underwhelming given its plans to /news/2023/07/technology-jobs-banks this year, however the jobs it has are interesting - including an engineering and a research lead for a generative AI project in London.

Banks have more AI jobs on offer when they're categorised as jobs with an AI tag. JPMorgan has 132 jobs with this tag, while Goldman have 23 and Morgan Stanley have 10. However, many of the listings put AI experience down as a 'nice-to-have' rather than a necessity.

AI jobs in banks pay less than AI jobs in hedge funds. A senior associate graduate hire in AI research at JPMorgan with a master's or a PhD can earn $195k, but the lower end of the salary range is just $133k. There are still high earning opportunities out there however; Goldman has advertised for a NLP engineering VP for a ""new, scalable and resilient Generative AI platform"" capable of earning up to $250k

AI jobs in Fintech

/news/2023/07/how-to-get-a-job-in-fintech is another area where machine learning is appreciated, and it's no surprise that payments giant Stripe is one of the top companies hiring. It currently has 9 unique machine learning engineer listings and its highest paying, a staff engineer/technical leader, can earn a staggering $484.6k... as /news/2023/06/fintech-pay

It's not just Stripe though, on eFinancialCareers there are 65 jobs for/jobs/%22machine-learning%22?q=%22machine+learning%22&countryCode=US&radius=50&radiusUnit=mi&pageSize=15&filters.sectors=FINTECH&currencyCode=USD&language=en&includeUnspecifiedSalary=true, with companies like Monzo, Plaid and Ramp all hiring.

Artificial Intelligence has sparked an unprecedented transformation across the global landscape. As we inch closer to a future where AI includes not just technical tasks but roles necessitating interpersonal intelligence, we find ourselves at a crucial juncture. “In all activities of life, the secret of efficiency lies in an ability to combine two seemingly incompatible states: a state of maximum activity and a state of maximum relaxation,” once said Aldous Huxley, famous English writer and philosopher.


How do we navigate a world where our economic survival is decoupled from our professional contributions?

The Evolution of Work in the AI EraAI (Artificial Intelligence) concept. Communication network.getty
PROMOTED
If we were to follow the current trajectory of AI, and assuming the pace of progress continues unhampered (projected to reach $1,345.2 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 36.62 percent according MarketsandMarkets June 2023 report), we could witness a precipitous decline in the labor participation rate by the 2030s. We could very well be steering towards a post-work society. As my fellow Forbes contributor, Rob Toews recently wrote in this very publication: “There will not be nearly enough meaningful jobs to employ every working-age person. More radically, we will not need people to work in order to generate the material wealth necessary for everyone’s healthy subsistence.”

At first stroke, a world devoid of labor participation seems dystopian, according to current experts and ethicists. The fear of being relegated to idle spectators in an AI-dominated world is palpable.

However, this perspective warrants reevaluation. It is very flawed.
The seismic shift towards a post-work society does not signify an end to human productivity or purpose. Instead, it presents an opportunity to redefine 'work' and untangle our identities from traditional employment as we see it today.

Unleashing the Human Renaissance in a Post-Work Society
Work has transformed over the centuries from being a matter of survival to becoming an economic imperative. The next evolutionary leap could reshape work as a channel for self-expression and fulfillment. The dawn of a post-work era could herald a liberation from simple tasks and a celebration of qualities that make us uniquely human: creativity, empathy, innovation, and complex social interaction.

Imagine an AI-managed hotel that delivers impeccable service but where human hosts infuse the stay with warmth and personal connection. Imagine a restaurant where AI-assisted culinary precision meets the human touch of a sommelier who personalizes your dining experience with intimate knowledge of your preferences. We will be there to enhance and delight, no longer responsible for so-called “grunt work.”
Venturing Into the Uncharted
The advent of AI does not herald an end but opens a new frontier of opportunities. By handling tasks currently beyond our imagination, AI clears the path for humans to explore careers yet to be envisioned. Consider that 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years  according April 2023 Goldman Sachs research can be attributed to technological advances creating new positions.
As the sun rises on the post-work society, we may find ourselves investing more time in activities that underscore our humanity: focusing on social needs, creating art, sharing and consuming narratives, building passion humanity projects, and even turning our sights skyward, with the colonization of the Moon and Mars transforming from distant dreams to tangible realities.
The Future is an Enhanced Human ExperienceAI (Artificial Intelligence) concept. Deep learning. Visual contents.getty
In this audacious new era, our thirst for purposeful and challenging endeavors will persist. This transition isn't about AI replacing humans; it's about AI emancipating us to focus on being more human.
The shift towards a post-work society signifies a progression from surviving to thriving. It’s about shifting from living to work, to working to live, in the most profound sense. Our future will be less about competing with AI and more about leveraging it to amplify our human experience.
As we traverse the precipice of this extraordinary future, one truth holds firm: our ability to adapt, innovate, and infuse technology with our quintessentially human spirit will guide us into this limitless era of humanity’s next evolution. Are we close to realizing Huxley’s vision of true efficiency? I believe the answer is yes, and that AI is the tool that will take us there.

If someone can type my name [into an AI tool] to make a book cover and not hire me, that affects my career and so many other people.""The new wave of generative AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data -  text, images, video, and audio files, all scraped from the internet. Content can be created within seconds of a simple text prompt.Kelly McKernanKelly McKernan has joined other artists in a lawsuit against generative AI organisationsWhat is artificial intelligence and will it take jobs?However, artists like Ms McKernan are fighting back.Together with cartoonist Sarah Anderson and illustrator Karla Ortiz, Ms McKernan has filed a lawsuit against Stability AI, the company behind Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DeviantArt, an online art community with its own generator called DreamUp.It adds to a growing stack of lawsuits against AI firms, which are testing issues of copyright.Earlier this year Getty Images filed a case against Stability AI, alleging that the company unlawfully copied and processed 12 million of the company's images without permission.Eva Toorenent, an artist creating mostly creature design, monster and fantasy illustrations, says she became concerned about AI after attending a gallery where she was surprised to see a piece of art with similarities to her own - which she describes as a ""corrupted version"". ""I remember thinking, if this can happen on a small scale, it can happen on a giant scale,"" says the artist from Zandvoort in the Netherlands. Aggrieved by the lack of protection for artists, she grouped together with five other artists to set up the European Guild of Artificial Intelligence Regulation.""The aim is to create legislation and regulation to protect copyright holders and artists from predatory AI companies,"" she says.Eva ToorenentArtist Eva Toorenent is campaigning for AI regulationMs McKernan agrees that there needs to be more regulation and protection for artists. ""As it is, copyright can only be applied to my complete image. I hope it [the lawsuit] encourages protection for artists so AI can't be used to replace us. If we win, I hope a lot of artists are paid. It's free labour and some people are profiteering from exploiting.""In December, Stability AI said that artists could opt out of the next version of Stable Diffusion, a statement that did not go down well with artists who felt that the default should be ""opt-in"".In response, Ms Toorenent says: ""Firstly, I would never put my work into it. But if artists do want to, it should be opt in. If I'm the owner, I should decide what happens to my art.""Stability AI said is not able to comment on ongoing legal proceedings, but in December 2022 chief executive Emad Mostaque tweeted that future models would be ""fully licensed"".Performing arts and entertainment union Equity says AI has become an increasing threat to artists. ""There is a legitimate fear,"" says Liam Budd, industrial official for audio and new media at Equity.He says the current rights framework for artists does not reflect the business opportunities of generative AI.Mr Budd says an artist might receive a one-off payment of £300 ($390) to have their image or voice reproduced using AI, but that original work might be used thousands or millions of times, with no financial benefit to the artist. ""We need more clarity in law and are campaigning for the Copyright Act to be updated,"" he says.Last year Equity launched a toolkit to help performers understand the issues and protect themselves.More technology of business:Do you need a degree to work in tech?Lean times hit the vertical farming businessThe quest to grow the perfect strawberryHow an autopilot could handle an emergency descentCan Amsterdam make the circular economy work?Countries are scrambling to react to these new powerful forms of AI.The EU appears to be taking the lead, with the EU AI Act proposing that AI tools will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to train their systems.In the UK, a global summit on AI safety will take place this autumn. ""AI throws up lots of intellectual property queries and because machines are trained on a lot of data and information that's protected by intellectual property, I'm not sure users or AI [companies] understand that,"" says Arty Rajendra, an IP lawyer and partner at law firm Osborne Clarke.""Courts haven't been asked to determine it yet but there's several cases in the UK and US including Getty now which will determine if it is infringement and who is liable. There's data protections and moral questions that have to be answered as well. What we might see is some kind of settlements, and maybe some licence fees.""She says there has been a number of litigation cases from photographers using small claims tracks.So what can other artists do in the meantime?Ms Rajendra explains that the giant photography firm Getty watermarked its images. So, when used in AI generative images, the watermark still shows up and it enables them to track usage of their images. She says artists could do the same.Artists could also approach the AI entity and ask for a license fee and if they don't' agree they could pursue legal action through a small claims tracker which is cheaper than a fancy law firm, she says.While regulators play catch up, some tools are emerging to help protect artists. University of ChicagoBen Zhao has developed software which can help protect an artist's workIn March, Ben Zhao, professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and his team launched a free software tool called Glaze to help protect artists against generative AI models. Glaze exploits a fundamental difference between how humans and AI models view images, says Prof Zhao.""For each image, we are able to compute a small set of pixel level changes that dramatically change how an AI art model ""sees"" the art while minimising visual changes to how humans see the art,"" he says.""When artists glaze their art, and that art is then used to train a model to mimic then the model sees an incorrect representation of the art style, and its mimicry would be useless and not match the artist.""He says Glaze is suitable for a wide range of art including black and white cartoons, classical oil paintings, flat art styles, and professional photography.He says Glaze has had 938,600 downloads and the team have received thousands of emails, tweets, messages from artists across the globe. ""The reaction has been overwhelming,"" he says.Ms Toorenent is feeling optimistic that artists may just win this fight. ""I was pretty scared at the start due to the amount of online harassment but because we united and have good support network to all this mess.""I know we're moving in right direction. Public opinion has changed a lot. Originally people were saying 'adapt or die', and now everyone like 'oh wait, this isn't cool'.""CopyrightArtificial intelligence",http://schema.org,,ReportageNewsArticle,,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66231268,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'By Suzanne Bearne '}]",New AI systems collide with copyright law,2023-07-31T23:08:53.000Z,2023-07-31T23:08:53.000Z,,,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'BBC News', 'publishingPrinciples': 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/ws/simorgh-assets/public/news/images/metadata/poster-1024x576.png'}}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 1024, 'height': 576, 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17304/production/_130408949_kellycopy.jpg'}",,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66231268,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17304/production/_130408949_kellycopy.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DDN says generative AI/ML work needs balanced read/write IO mix

Analysis: DDN says storage for generative AI and other AI work needs a balance of read and write speed, claiming its own storage provides the best balance because of its write speed superiority over competing systems.
Update. Dell PowerScale F600 write bandwidth performance added. 31 July 2023.
The company supplies its Exascaler AI400X2 array with Magnum I/O GPUDirect certification for use with Nvidia’s DGX SuperPod AI processing system. It uses 60TB QLC (4bits/cell) SSDs and has a compression facility to boost effective capacity. Some 48 AI400X2 arrays are in use with Nvidia’s largest SuperPODs according to DDN, which said it shipped more AI storage in the first quarter of this year than in all of 2022. 
SVP for Products at DDN, James Coomer, has written a blog, Exascale? Let’s Talk, in which he says that an AI storage system has to support all stages of the AI workload cycle. “That means ingest, preparation, deep learning, checkpointing, post-processing, etc, etc, and needs the full spectrum of IO patterns to be served well.”



AI processing read-write mix
What IO patterns? Coomer cites an OSTI.GOV whitepaper, Characterizing Machine Learning I/O Workloads on Leadership Scale HPC Systems, which studied: ”the darshan logs of more than 23,000 HPC ML I/O jobs over a time period of one year running on Summit – the second-fastest supercomputer in the world”. Darshan is an HPC IO characterization tool. Summit’s storage was the GPFS (Storage Scale) parallel filesystem.
The whitepaper says: “It has been typically seen that ML workloads have small read and write access patterns,” and “Most ML jobs are perceived to be read-intensive with a lot of small reads while a few ML jobs also perform small writes.” But, “from our study, we observe that ML workloads generate a large number of small file reads and writes.” 
The paper says  ~99% of the read and write calls “are less than 10MB calls. … ML workloads from all science domains generate a large number of small file reads and writes.”A chart shows their finding with GPFS-using workloads: 


There is a roughly even balance between read and write IO. Coomer’s blog has a chart showing the balance between read and write IO calls with small calls (less than 1MB) dominating the scene:

The paper’s authors say: “The temporal trend of ML workloads shows that there is an exponential increase in the I/O activity from ML workloads which is indicative of the future which will be dominated by ML. Therefore better storage solutions need to be designed that can handle the diverse I/O patterns from future HPC ML I/O workloads.”
Armed with this balanced and small read/write preponderance finding Coomer looks at the IO capabilities of different QLC flash systems using NFS compared to the DDN AI400X2 storage.
He contrasts a part-rack DDN AI400X2 system that can provide 800GBps of write bandwidth with a competing but un-named system needing 20 racks to do the same.

Coomer’s graphic showing DDN (right) and competing supplier’s QLC/NFS system (left) needed to meet his 800GBps write target. The white rectangles represent empty rack space
Coomer told us: “The servers and storage are all there (embedded inside the AI400NVX2) and no switches are needed for the back end. We plug directly into the customer IB or Ethernet network. The DDN write performance number is a measured one by a customer not just datasheet.”
What competing system?
We looked at various QLC flash/NFS systems to try and find out more. For reference, an AI400X2 system can deliver 90 GBps of read bandwidth and 65 GBps write bandwidth from its 2RU chassis. Twelve of them hit 1.08 TBps read and 780 GBps write. Thirteen would reach 1.17 TBps read and 845 GBps write bandwidth from 26 RU of rack space.
It’s necessary to include the servers and switches in the alternative systems to make a direct comparison with the DDN system.
VAST Data Lightspeed storage nodes provides 50 GBps from a 44RU configuration. We would need 16 of these to achieve 800 GBps write speed, plus the associated compute nodes and switches. Say ~20 racks roughly; it depends upon the storage node-compute node balance.
A newer VAST Data Ceres system provides 680 GBps from 14 racks, 48.6 GBps per rack, meaning 17 racks would be needed to reach the 800 GBps write speed level:
 

The slide captioning at the bottom mentions 680 GBps write bandwidth. 
A Pure Storage FlashArray//C60 has up to 8 GBps throughput from its 6RU chassis. If we assume that is write bandwidth and we have 1.3 GBps per RU and will need 14 or so racks to reach 800 GBps write speed.
Update. Forty eight Dell PowerScale F600s demonstrated 56.4GiBps sending data to 48 Nvidia GPUs, 1.175GiB/node (1.26GB/node). A node is 1RU in size and, therefore, to achieve 800GBps write bandwidth there would need to be 635 nodes; about 15 fully populated racks.
Scale-out NFS inefficiency
In Coomer’s view scale-out NFS system architectures are inefficient because they are complex:


DDN’s Exascaler AI400X2 system does away with the server-interconnect-buffer complexity because its client nodes know where the data is located:


It can provide, Coomer argues, the balanced small read and write IO performance that ML workloads, like generative AI, need, according to the OSTI.GOV research. It can do this from significantly less rackspace than alternative QLC flash/NFS systems. And that means less power and cooling is needed in AI data centers using the DDN kit.

The companies that make these systems aren’t telling us much, and may not even know themselves.Vox TechnologyGet weekly dispatches from Vox writers about how technology is changing the world — and how it's changing us.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.You may be okay with all of this, or think the good that generative AI can do far outweighs whatever bad went into building it. But a lot of other people aren’t. Two weeks ago, a viral tweet accused Google of scraping Google Docs for data on which to train its AI tools. In a follow-up, its author claimed that Google “used docs and emails to train their AI for years.” The initial tweet has nearly 10 million views, and it’s been retweeted thousands of times. The fact that this may not even be true is almost beside the point. (Google says it doesn’t use data from its free or enterprise Workspace products — that includes Gmail and Docs — to train its generative AI models unless it has user permission, though it does train some Workspace AI features like spellcheck and Smart Compose using anonymized data.) “Up until this point, tech companies have not done what they’re doing now with generative AI, which is to take everyone’s information and feed it into a product that can then contribute to people’s professional obsolescence and totally decimate their privacy in ways previously unimaginable,” said Ryan Clarkson, whose law firm is behind class action lawsuits against OpenAI and Microsoft and Google. Google’s general counsel, Halimah DeLaine Prado, said in a statement that the company has been clear that it uses data from public sources, adding that “American law supports using public information to create new beneficial uses, and we look forward to refuting these baseless claims.”Exactly what rights we may have over our own information, however, is still being worked out in lawsuits, worker strikes, regulator probes, executive orders, and possibly new laws. Those might take care of your data in the future, but what can you do about what these companies already took, used, and profited from? The answer is probably not a whole lot.Generative AI companies are hungry for your data. Here’s how they get it.Simply put, generative AI systems need as much data as possible to train on. The more they get, the better they can generate approximations of how humans sound, look, talk, and write. The internet provides massive amounts of data that’s relatively easy to gobble up through web scraping tools and APIs. But that gobbling process doesn’t distinguish between copyrighted works or personal data; if it’s out there, it takes it. “In the absence of meaningful privacy regulations, that means that people can scrape really widely all over the internet, take anything that is ‘publicly available’ — that top layer of the internet for lack of a better term — and just use it in their product,” said Ben Winters, who leads the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s AI and Human Rights Project and co-authored its report on generative AI harms. Which means that, unbeknownst to you and, apparently, several of the companies whose sites were being scraped, some startup may be taking and using your data to power a technology you had no idea was possible. That data may have been posted on the internet years before these companies existed. It may not have been posted by you at all. Or you may have thought you were giving a company your data for one purpose that you were fine with, but now you’re afraid it was used for something else. Many companies’ privacy policies, which are updated and changed all the time, may let them do exactly that. They often say something along the lines of how your data may be used to improve their existing products or develop new ones. Conceivably, that includes generative AI systems. Not helping matters is how cagey generative AI companies have been about revealing their data sources, often simply saying that they’re “publicly available.” Even Meta’s more detailed list of sources for its first LLaMA model refers to things like “Common Crawl,” which is an open source archive of the entire internet, as well as sites like Github, Wikipedia, and Stack Exchange, which are also enormous repositories of information. (Meta hasn’t been as forthcoming about the data used for the just-released Llama 2.) All of these sources may contain personal information. OpenAI admits that it uses personal data to train its models, but says it comes across that data “incidentally” and only uses it to make “our models better,” as opposed to building profiles of people to sell ads to them.Google and Meta have vast troves of personal user data they say they don’t use to train their language models now, but we have no guarantee they won’t do so in the future, especially if it means gaining a competitive advantage. We know that Google scanned users’ emails for years in order to target ads (the company says it no longer does this). Meta had a major scandal and a $5 billion fine when it shared data with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, which then misused it. The fact is, these companies have given users plenty of reasons not to take their assurances about data privacy or commitments to produce safe systems at face value.“The voluntary commitments by big tech require a level of trust that they don’t deserve, and they have not earned,” Clarkson said.Copyrights, privacy laws, and “publicly available” dataFor creators — writers, musicians, and actors, for instance — copyrights and image rights are a major issue, and it’s pretty obvious why. Generative AI models have both been trained on their work and could put them out of work in the future. That’s why comedian Sarah Silverman is suing OpenAI and Meta as part of a class action lawsuit. She alleges that the two companies trained off of her written work by using datasets that contained text from her book, The Bedwetter. There are also lawsuits over image rights and the use of open source computer code.The use of generative AI is also one of the reasons why writers and actors are on strike, with both of their unions, the WGA and SAG-AFTRA, fearing that studios will train AI models on artists’ words and images and simply generate new content without compensating the original human creators. But you, the average person, might not have intellectual property to protect, or at least your livelihood may not depend on it. So your concerns might be more about how companies like OpenAI are protecting your privacy when their systems scoop it up, remix it, and spit it back out.Regulators, lawmakers, and lawyers are wondering about this, too. Italy, which has stronger privacy laws than the US, even temporarily banned ChatGPT over privacy issues. Other European countries are looking into doing their own probes of ChatGPT. The Federal Trade Commission has also set its sights on OpenAI, investigating it for possible violations of consumer protection laws. The agency has also made it clear that it will keep a close eye on generative AI tools. But the FTC can only enforce what the laws allow it to. President Biden has encouraged Congress to pass AI-related bills, and many members of Congress have said they want to do the same. Congress is notoriously slow-moving, however, and has done little to regulate or protect consumers from social media platforms. Lawmakers may learn a lesson from this and act faster when it comes to AI, or they may repeat their mistake. The fact that there is interest in doing something relatively soon after generative AI’s introduction to the general public is promising.“The pace at which people have introduced legislation and said they want to do something about [AI] is, like, 9 million times faster than it was with any of these other issues,” Winters said.But it’s also hard to imagine Congress acting on data privacy. The US doesn’t have a federal consumer online privacy law. Children under 13 do get some privacy protections, as do residents of states that passed their own privacy laws. Some types of data are protected, too. That leaves a lot of adults across the country with very little by way of data privacy rights.We will likely be looking at the courts to figure out how generative AI fits with the laws we already have, which is where people like Clarkson come in.“This is a chance for the people to have their voice heard, through these lawsuits,” he said. “And I think that they’re going to demand action on some of these issues that we haven’t made much progress through the other channels thus far. Transparency, the ability to opt out, compensation, ethical sourcing of data — those kinds of things.”In some instances, Clarkson and Tim Giordano, a partner at Clarkson Law Firm who is also working on these cases, said there’s existing law that doesn’t explicitly cover people’s rights with generative AI but which a judge can interpret to apply there. In others, there are things like California’s privacy law, which requires companies that share or sell people’s data to give them a way to opt out and delete their information. “There’s currently no way for these models to delete the personal information that they’ve learned about us, so we think that that’s a clear example of a privacy violation,” Giordano said. ChatGPT’s opt out and data deletion tools, for example, are only for data collected by people using the ChatGPT service. It does have a way for people in “certain jurisdictions” to opt out of having their data processed by OpenAI’s models now, but it also doesn’t guarantee it will do so and it requires that you provide evidence that your data was processed in the first place.Although OpenAI recently changed its policy and has stopped training models off data provided by its own customers, another set of privacy concerns crops up with how these models use the data you give them when you use them and the information they release into the wild. “Customers clearly want us not to train on their data,” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, told CNBC, an indicator that people aren’t comfortable with their data being used to train AI systems, though only some are given the chance to opt out of it, and in limited circumstances. Meanwhile, OpenAI has been sued for defamation over a ChatGPT response that falsely claimed that someone had defrauded and stolen money from a non-profit. And this isn’t the only time a ChatGPT response levied false accusations against someone.So what can you currently do about any of this? That’s what’s so tricky here. A lot of the privacy issues now are the result of a failure to pass real, meaningful privacy laws in the past that could have protected your data before these datasets and technologies even existed. You can always try to minimize the data you put out there now, but you can’t do much about what’s already been scraped and used. You’d need a time machine for that, and not even generative AI has been able to invent one yet.A version of this story was also published in the Vox technology newsletter.

You’ve no doubt heard of ChatGPT, the amazing chatbot that can produce remarkably high quality text on any number of topics. When it first hit the scene, social media was filled with fun but non-essential uses for it, like writing bedtime stories featuring your kids, hammering out last minute wedding speeches or helping cheat on college essays. 
But it wasn’t long before ChatGPT had passed the SAT, GRE and LSAT — scoring in the 90th percentile on the bar exam. Lawyers started to take note, some cautiously experimented, while others took a more foolhardy approach preparing a court filing with it to catastrophic results. Regardless, it quickly became clear that this technology’s enormous store of knowledge, seeming ability to reason and its textual interface make it ideally suited to the legal domain.
In the coming months and years, generative AI is going to transform legal work at companies. In-house lawyers, legal operations, contract managers and paralegals will all be affected, but so will every team that interacts with legal, from sales and procurement to finance and IT. Legal is a big field so I’ll focus primarily on the day-to-day legal tasks that affect most companies.
 
How Generative AI Will Impact Legal Teams
AI is not new to in-house legal teams. Several companies, mine included, have been building AI tools for the legal domain for years, saving people thousands of hours of manual work, extracting key dates, parties and terms from tens of thousands of agreements automatically. Generative AI promises to open up a whole new set of amazing capabilities.
One of the most remarkable abilities of generative AI-powered tools is their ability to automatically review and redline a contract according to a company’s existing playbook, with a high degree of accuracy. For instance, if a company requires that all vendors must be paid 90 days after an invoice, they aren’t allowed to use the company’s logo in marketing and they must agree to the state of Delaware to settle disputes, the AI can immediately read the vendor’s contract and flag language that violates these rules and propose edits without human intervention. It can then provide a fully redlined Word document to send to the counterparty and draft an email summarizing the main points of contention. 
If this seems too good to be true, there is a catch: No matter how well generative AI performs these surprisingly challenging tasks, it doesn’t always get it right. This is why the features should be used as an assistant to an attorney who can review and correct any mistakes. Even though the AI summaries provide a great first draft, only your lawyer understands the business and relationship context required to edit unnecessary details and focus on the points that will close the deal.
Still, AI assistants are already showing time-savings of 30-to-80 percent when reviewing contracts. In addition to automatic redlining, these assistants can help draft new clauses by providing suggested legal text, modifying existing contract language based on simple directions and learning proper clause language from your existing corpus of contracts. 
When you consider how many contracts are reviewed and signed across all companies annually, it’s easy to see how much of a difference just this one feature can make.

How Generative AI-Powered Legal Tools Impact the Company
Generative AI won’t just benefit legal teams, but also all other teams that work closely with legal, such as finance, IT, and HR, and who rely on them to get critical business deals done (such as sales and procurement).
With generative AI, legal teams can create automations that can understand an email or a Microsoft Teams message requesting legal forms like a non-disclosure agreement, a customer order, offer letter, vendor agreement, generate the appropriate document, route it to the right person for review, seek approval, obtain signatures and file it away once signed. It has the ability to coordinate this whole flow efficiently, without waiting for someone to route it manually.
This has the potential to make it easier for other teams to get immediate help on simple questions with low legal risk. 
For instance, before meeting a major customer, you need to understand what they’ve been buying from you, the pricing, payment schedules, penalties on missing delivery dates and any other aspects of the deal. Instead of emailing the legal team and waiting for context, generative AI can immediately show you the relevant contracts, summarize their key details and act as a live chatbot to help you understand any nuances. With the right integrations, these insights and automations can be available in the systems your teams already use, such as CRMs used by sales teams, procure-to-pay platforms used by procurement organizations, or HRIS systems used by HR teams.
The same assistants that can review contracts within Word, can also be trained to help automatically fill out request for proposals (RFPs), data protection agreements (DPAs), and security questionnaires based on your company’s prior answers. Given that these are often negotiated, reviewed and signed together with contracts, GenAI assistants can speed up the process for legal teams as well as the IT and finance teams that are often part of the deal-making process.
AI is imperfect, however, and can sometimes provide incorrect information. This is why tools that appropriately scope answers to minimize and flag legal risk are critical. But given how these tools allow business users to self-serve, tasks that previously required legal teams to interrupt their work may now be completed more efficiently and faster.

How to Take Advantage of Generative AI-Powered Legal Tools
While generative AI has the potential to automate many different legal tasks, it’s no time to panic. Instead, lawyers should celebrate. GenAI means no more gophering to find contracts for teammates, or answering basic questions about marketing logos. And no more reviewing the same basic aspects of a contract.
Instead, it will provide legal team members with more time to coach the business on legal issues and negotiate the finer points of the deal. Like all technological waves, you can either ride on top of it, shedding the rote parts of your job to focus on higher value, or get swept under by not adapting. 
Find the time to get educated on available tools by speaking with peers at events and watching free vendor webinars. Tap into legal and legal operations communities to learn what’s coming, and what early adopters are saying. Recognize this as an incredible growth opportunity. It’s not the AI that will win vs. the human, but the human-AI partnership that will win overall.
For business leaders, this is the time to recognize that up-leveling your teams, and giving them access to these tools will build lasting competitive advantages and allow you to scale efficiently as you grow. Give your teams the time to learn, and the autonomy to invest in proof-of-concepts that focus on one or two critical pain points to test the waters, instead of boiling the ocean or decision-by-committee projects that take too long to come to fruition.

A jargon-free explanation of how AI large language models work
Want to really understand large language models? Here’s a gentle primer.

For example, one researcher asked GPT-4 to draw a unicorn using an obscure graphics programming language called TiKZ. GPT-4 responded with a few lines of code that the researcher then fed into the TiKZ software. The resulting images were crude, but they showed clear signs that GPT-4 had some understanding of what unicorns look like.

The researchers thought GPT-4 might have somehow memorized code for drawing a unicorn from its training data, so they gave it a follow-up challenge: They altered the unicorn code to remove the horn and move some of the other body parts. Then they asked GPT-4 to put the horn back on. GPT-4 responded by putting the horn in the right spot:Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

GPT-4 was able to do this even though the training data for the version tested by the authors was entirely text-based. That is, there were no images in its training set. But GPT-4 apparently learned to reason about the shape of a unicorn’s body after training on a huge amount of written text.
At the moment, we don’t have any real insight into how LLMs accomplish feats like this. Some people argue that such examples demonstrate that the models are starting to truly understand the meanings of the words in their training set. Others insist that language models are “stochastic parrots” that merely repeat increasingly complex word sequences without truly understanding them. Ars VideoHow Scientists Respond to Science Deniers
This debate points to a deep philosophical tension that may be impossible to resolve. Nonetheless, we think it is important to focus on the empirical performance of models like GPT-3. If a language model can consistently get the right answer for a particular type of question, and if researchers are confident that they have controlled for confounds (e.g., ensuring that the language model was not exposed to those questions during training), then that is an interesting and important result, whether or not the model understands language in exactly the same sense that people do.
Another possible reason that training with next-token prediction works so well is that language itself is predictable. Regularities in language are often (though not always) connected to regularities in the physical world. So when a language model learns about relationships among words, it’s often implicitly learning about relationships in the world, too.
Further, prediction may be foundational to biological intelligence as well as artificial intelligence. In the view of philosophers like Andy Clark, the human brain can be thought of as a “prediction machine” whose primary job is to make predictions about our environment that can then be used to navigate that environment successfully. Intuitively, making good predictions benefits from good representations—you’re more likely to navigate successfully with an accurate map than an inaccurate one. The world is big and complex, and making predictions helps organisms efficiently orient and adapt to that complexity.
Traditionally, a major challenge for building language models was figuring out the most useful way of representing different words—especially because the meanings of many words depend heavily on context. The next-word prediction approach allows researchers to sidestep this thorny theoretical puzzle by turning it into an empirical problem. It turns out that if we provide enough data and computing power, language models end up learning a lot about how human language works simply by figuring out how to best predict the next word. The downside is that we wind up with systems whose inner workings we don’t fully understand.

AI has set its sights on 300 million jobs around the globe, about 9.1% of all the world’s jobs, and here in the U.S., 24% of the workforce is concerned about being replaced by AI.


Yes, AI will take your job; however, it will gift two or three new jobs in its place. The thing is, we can’t be certain what those new jobs will be.

Remember when the big news was that high school students would grow up to pursue careers that didn’t exist yet? Technology promised to do that, and it kept its word. The kids rode the wave and rolled comfortably into the evolving technology economies of the past three decades. Some older workers retooled; some fell through the cracks. Innovation does that. And those high school kids? Some of them grew up to create technologies that are introducing new waves of employment unknowns.

Humans have likely been toolmakers for a solid 2.6 million years. Many of our innovations reduce the need for labor (jobs). When we mastered farming, a few people could make sure that the rest of us had enough to eat. Urban civilization bloomed. Many quit or were pushed out of their hunter-gatherer jobs. New roles emerged, including the prestigious scribe, whose descendants now fear being replaced by generative AI.

PROMOTED
In fact, no occupation is immune. This time, it’s not just about robots taking over manufacturing. The new threat of replacement extends to college-educated white-collar positions. These roles are now vulnerable to replacement by AI.
Bank tellers, postal clerks, cashiers, and data entry workers have long had reason to worry about job obsolescence. As AI use expands, workers in marketing and advertising, accountants and tax preparers, mathematicians, various analysts, writers, web designers, lawyers, and many others may be displaced. And those robots that will keep taking jobs from humans are now supercharged with AI.

The World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report offers some insight into the pace at which AI is moving. The report gathered input from 803 companies with a collective population totaling 11.3 million employees. It examined 27 industry clusters and 45 economies. What was generally found is that in the post-COVID-19 world, there are still significant barriers to job creation, and high unemployment persists in low-income economies. Innovation, environmental factors, and economic trends are shaking up employment around the globe. This May 2023 report confirms that technology, in particular AI, is reshaping job markets.

Many economies are experiencing cost-of-living crises. Women and minimally educated individuals face high unemployment. But AI is finding work. Wages are declining in many places while, elsewhere, investments in emerging technologies are on the rise. More than 85% of businesses examined for the report see adoption of big data, cloud computing, and AI as central to their development and success. And with the focus on AI, the nature of work itself is changing.
Technology has long been the giver and taker of jobs. When John Deere developed the Hawkeye Riding Cultivator in 1863, it took a job away from many (relieved) horses, oxen, and humans. It delivered new jobs in manufacturing, maintenance, repair, advertising, and many other areas. Whenever we innovate to reduce steps, lighten loads, save time, or reduce the need for manual labor, jobs are lost. But new jobs lie just beyond the innovation horizon. In the meantime, lost jobs are lost business.
If the changes are too disruptive, they can reshape purchasing power. Even in a high-income nation, the loss of jobs to AI can send negative ripple effects across the economy.
Leaders can make choices that empower their people and position their businesses to take advantage of emerging trends.
Businesses can devise scenarios and projects that let their people pilot and extend their AI skills. Exposing every level of your organization to AI can be achieved at low costs. Individual and collaborative assignments can get workers accustomed to partnering with tools like ChatGPT. Introductory use can be tied to existing tasks. But treat it like real training.
1. Capture feedback and analyze results.
2. Identify team and individual strengths and weaknesses.
3. Create and implement plans for improvement.
Upskilling your workers will benefit your bottom line. It will also enhance your reputation as some of these employees leave and go to work at other companies. Wherever they find themselves, their familiarity and skills can help reduce disruption as AI becomes more deeply integrated into work. Little improvements help keep the workforce employable and partly inoculate the economy against future talent shortage.
The fact that many people will be performing jobs that do not yet exist is way less than half of the story. The really big news is the talent shortage. In the U.S., there are not enough appropriately skilled workers or available labor to fill many technological and other positions. Fearing more than preparing may result in AI widening that talent gap.
For organizations and individuals, surviving major transitions usually means reinvention and building new skills. Brace yourself and your business. The unpredictable impact of AI will require old fashioned change management. Even if your business is not involved in areas that are directly affected, changes to paradigms and ecosystems will set off ripple effects. There is no place to hide from AI.
Areas like agriculture and education will continue to welcome humans. Analytical and creative thinking are still highly desirable and enhance employability. Someone has to create the content that the chatbots will draw from, as they generate their responses to our prompts. And remember those jobs that could not work from home during the pandemic—security, healthcare, law enforcement, firefighting, warehouse management, and logistics? They’re safe, for now. AI can enhance them, streamline them, but it cannot eliminate them.
The Future of Jobs Report indicates that businesses plan to meet their goals by training new hires and current staff and by using AI and other forms of automation. People’s fear that AI will replace them still has some merit. But what is coming looks more like a deepening partnership between humans and digital technology. AI extends individuals’ capabilities and can filter out distractions. Targeted upskilling can close the training gaps, ensure that workers transition to the emerging economy, help businesses thrive, and reduce the talent shortage that can weaken the workforce and slow down economic growth.
1. Innovation and technological advancement have often introduced new jobs and eliminated a few, so remain flexible, prepare your people, train them, and let them practice.
2. Find ways to get your workforce accustomed to using AI by applying generative AI tools to existing functions, projects, and tasks.
3. Don’t even think about opting out or dismissing AI as a passing fad or trend of the moment; AI, chatbots, and most of the high-investment emerging technologies are here for the foreseeable future, so make a plan, and engage as soon as possible.

The Future Of Art: Generative AI, Web3 And The Immersive InternetAdobe Stock

Artists have always been at the forefront of innovation and creativity, and the metaverse provides them with a new canvas to express themselves. The future internet will give artists the ability to create innovative new work, share their art with a global audience, and get compensated more fairly for their efforts.

Let’s dig into what future internet technology will mean for artists and collectors, explore its possibilities, and discuss how artists can adapt to this new digital world.

Navigating the Intersection of Art and Web3 Technologies

PROMOTED
As we venture deeper into the digital age, the canvas of creativity is becoming increasingly virtual. Artists, no longer confined to the traditional tools and spaces of their craft, are exploring and embracing new technologies that redefine their creative boundaries. In the forefront of this avant-garde movement are Web3 technologies — a set of decentralized, blockchain-based systems that promise to reconfigure the contours of artistic creation, ownership, and consumption.
Here are three of the biggest ways web3 technologies — particularly NFTs — will enable artists to take back control of their art, including how they get paid and how their work is used:


With NFTs and automatically executing smart contracts, artists can receive a portion of the sale every time their work is sold and resold among collectors.
Blockchain records will potentially add value to pieces of NFT artwork because artists and collectors will be able to see where each piece of art came from and who has owned it since it was initially sold.
Digital art will create a new class of assets that will be a better fit for people who live in the digital world just as much as they do in the physical world.

In this process, artists design algorithms or rules that AI follows to generate art pieces, leading to an exciting blend of human creativity and machine efficiency. The resulting artwork, inherently unpredictable due to the nature of algorithms, often possesses a unique dynamism, complexity, and scale that could not be achieved by human hand alone.

This innovative process can result in a near-infinite variety of art pieces; each one imbued with a singular identity by its algorithmic genesis. By tying generative AI art to Web3 infrastructure, artists can issue each of these unique pieces as NFTs, underscoring their digital authenticity and singularity. This not only redefines the concept of originality in art but also opens up exciting new avenues for artists to monetize their creativity in the digital realm. Thus, the melding of generative AI with the burgeoning technologies of NFTs, blockchain, and smart contracts is forging a vibrant new frontier in the digital art landscape.
One example comes from Art Blocks, an Ethereum-based platform where collectors can invest in unique, generative art NFTs. The platform has already facilitated over $1 billion in primary and secondary sales.
Transforming the Traditional Art Gallery
We already have metaverse galleries — virtual exhibitions where artists can showcase their work to a global audience without the limitations of physical space. Metaverse galleries can take many forms, from VR environments to simple 2D websites.
Metaverse galleries can offer immersive and interactive experiences for visitors. Viewers can explore the virtual gallery space, interact with the artwork, and even attend events and openings. This makes the experience of visiting a metaverse gallery more engaging and memorable than simply viewing artwork online.
Some NFT marketplaces (like SuperRare) are also opening physical galleries where people can look at digital art in frames on the wall. These types of physical NFT exhibitions are still experimental, but they illustrate how the metaverse can intersect with real-world experiences.
As metaverse technology continues to evolve, we will likely see more sophisticated and innovative metaverse galleries emerging, offering new and exciting possibilities for artists and art lovers alike.
Sotheby’s Enters the World of NFT Auctions
Sotheby's, one of the world's leading auction houses, has been at the forefront of the NFT market. The organization has already hosted several high-profile NFT auctions. These auctions feature curated collections of NFTs from prominent artists, musicians, and other cultural figures. Sotheby's has partnered with various NFT marketplaces and platforms, such as Nifty Gateway and OpenSea, to host these auctions.
The NFTs offered in these auctions can include digital art, music, collectibles, and other forms of digital media. The auction process typically involves a pre-sale exhibition, where potential buyers can view and inspect the NFTs, followed by a bidding period, in which buyers can place bids on the NFTs they are interested in purchasing. The auction culminates with the sale of the NFTs to the highest bidder.
Sotheby's involvement in the NFT market has been seen as a significant milestone in the mainstream adoption of NFTs. The fact that one of the world's most prestigious auction houses is now offering NFTs for sale is a testament to the growing legitimacy and value of this new form of digital asset.

Artificial intelligence is already changing the workplace in ways we never could've imagined.Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT, its conversational AI chatbot, in November, many have used it to lose weight, plan vacations, and even land dates.Now, some companies are embracing AI — though not without precaution — as business leaders begin to wake up to the technology's impressive capabilities. In a 2023 IBM study surveying 3000 executives on generative AI, 75% of respondents said it would give their businesses a competitive edge and 43% are using AI to make strategic business decisions. But not all workers are ready to use AI. In the IBM study, 57% of the executives said they had reservations about data security, while 48% said they were also concerned about bias.

Nevertheless, workers and companies are starting to deploy AI for business purposes in myriad ways. Here are 10 ways AI is changing the workforce:1. Workers are using ChatGPT to help do their jobs Workers across industries — from education to law — are using AI technology such as ChatGPT to automate their workflows to save time and boost productivity. Nick Patrick, the owner of the music-production company Primal Sounds Productions, told Insider he used ChatGPT to fine-tune legal contracts for clients. Shannon Ahern, a high-school math and science teacher, said she used the AI chatbot to generate quiz questions and lesson plans.Others have used the chatbot to write listings for luxury real estate, assist in recruiting efforts, draft social-media posts, and develop code.

In fact, many workers are even secretly using AI to help do their jobs.At the beginning of the year, Fishbowl, a workplace-discussion app, surveyed more than 11,700 workers, including those from companies such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Twitter, to gauge whether they used AI at work. Out of the 43% of respondents who said they used AI to accomplish their work tasks, 68% of them said they hadn't told their bosses they were using them.2. Companies are looking for ChatGPT expertise in their workers Companies across various industries — including healthcare, education, and insurance — are looking to hire workers with experience using AI.As of June, more than a dozen of companies were hiring workers on sites such as Indeed and LinkedIn with ChatGPT expertise listed in their job postings, paying as much as $800,000 a year for the skill. Executives at these companies told Insider that job candidates with knowledge of AI might be more productive, creative, and open to change than those without AI expertise.

The move to hire AI-savvy workers seems to be gaining traction. In a recent survey from the job site Resume Builder of business leaders who were hiring, 91% of respondents said they wanted to bring on workers who knew how to use OpenAI's chatbot to save time and enhance productivity.3. Employers are encouraging workers to learn how to use AI Executives are asking their workers to integrate AI into their workflows. That way, companies can save time and money on their business processes.

Jensen Huang, the CEO of the chip giant Nvidia, said workers should learn how to use AI to improve their performance.""Everyone is a programmer now,"" Huang said during this year's Computex conference in Taipei, Taiwan. ""You just have to say something to the computer.""

Akash Nigam, the CEO and founder of Genies, an avatar-tools company, previously told Insider he purchased ChatGPT Plus accounts for all of his 120 employees and encouraged them to make learning the AI chatbot a priority so they could ""effectively accelerate"" their departments.""You really got to find time to, like, learn this skill,"" Nigam previously told Insider. 4. Job applicants are using AI to write their résumés and improve their applications AI can help you land your next gig by improving your job application.To test his company's recruiting efforts, Neil Taylor, the founder of Schwa, a communications consultancy, said that he secretly submitted a job application written by ChatGPT to recruiters at his firm and later learned that ChatGPT was one of the few applicants chosen for an interview.

""It was more competent than a lot of the bad people who apply to us,"" Taylor told Sky News.Insider's Beatrice Nolan conducted a similar experiment, in which she asked ChatGPT to write cover letters for real jobs and sent the letters to hiring managers for them to review. The managers told Nolan they would've offered her an interview even though they said the letters lacked personality.AI enthusiasts have also expressed on social media how impressed they are with ChatGPT's ability to write cover letters, resurfacing a long-held debate on whether cover letters should be removed from the job-application process. 5. AI is being used to make hiring decisions AI-assisted hiring is nothing new.

For years, companies have used AI tools to screen résumés and cover letters, interview job candidates, and even analyze the speech and facial expressions of applicants to get a read on their personalities — processes that experts say might not be fair when making hiring decisions. But some human-resources professionals say that generative-AI tools have helped them do their jobs better. Jasmine Cheng, a recruiter who left Amazon to start her own recruiting firm called Topknack, said she used ChatGPT to do things such as finding job candidates and creating interview questions, which she said saved her at least 10 hours a week. ""With those hours back, I can reach more candidates, network, and even conduct more business development to get more clients, which leads to making more money,"" Cheng previously told Insider.6. Companies are using AI to write their performance reviews Managers may find writing performance reviews for their employees a tough task. But what if AI could do it for you?

Companies behind HR-management software are starting to integrate AI features that can help managers write performance reviews that are fair, accurate, and personalized for their direct reports. For instance, Textio, an HR-management tool with an AI-assistant feature for performance reviews, is used by companies such as Hulu, Spotify, T-Mobile, and McDonald's, WorkLife reported.

AI-generated performance reviews are nothing new. In 2018, the cloud giant Oracle launched Digital Assistant, an AI chatbot that HR professionals can use to complete employee evaluations.AI expertise may also be taken into consideration during a performance review. Nigam, the CEO of the avatar-tools company, expects to make decisions on who gets promoted based on how well they know ChatGPT, he told Insider.

7. Experts say AI could help make the 4-day workweek possibleA four-day workweek may be on the horizon thanks to ChatGPT.AI tools can help workers be more productive, which, in turn, cuts down the time it takes to accomplish any given task — a ""necessary condition for us to work less,"" Oded Netzer, a professor at Columbia Business School, previously told Insider.Carl Benedikt Frey, an Oxford economist, echoed the sentiment. He told Insider: ""Any technology that increases productivity, ChatGPT included, makes a shorter workweek more feasible."" But some experts say that AI's prospective productivity gains may not shorten the workweek. Michael Chu, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, previously told Insider that employers might expect employees to work even harder to maximize their output because of AI.

8. Companies are restricting their employees from using AI at workSome companies have set rules around how their employees can use AI in the workplace, in part, to protect their confidential data from being leaked. While firms such as Apple and Spotify have been said to restrict their workers from using AI, other companies, such as JPMorgan and Northrop Grumman, appear to have outright barred their employees from using the tech. ""Although AI, including ChatGPT and other 'conversational' AIs, can be enormously helpful and truly transformative, we want to be smart about how we implement these tools to protect ourselves, our partners, our company's information and our user data,"" executives at iHeartMedia wrote in a June memo explaining why it's restricting its workers from using AI. 9. Many are questioning whether AI will replace their jobs As AI becomes more advanced, many workers may be wondering whether the tech will replace their jobs down the line.

A recent Goldman Sachs report on the state of AI found that generative-AI tools could lead to a ""significant disruption"" in the labor market and affect 300 million full-time jobs worldwide. White-collar workers — particularly people in law and those part of an administrative staff — are most likely to be affected by new AI tools, Goldman found. Other labor experts told Insider that workers in media, marketing, and finance — jobs that require writing and number crunching — were at risk of replacement by AI. AI job replacement may already be occurring. Suumit Shah, the CEO of the e-commerce platform Dukaan, tweeted earlier this month that ""we had to layoff 90% of our support team"" because an AI chatbot was able to do its work faster. But not all experts believe AI will wipe out jobs.

Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, told Insider that AI should be viewed as an imperfect productivity-enhancing tool that could produce bias and error. Richard Baldwin, an economist, said at the 2023 World Economic Forum's Growth Summit that while AI might not replace your job, workers who know how to use AI may replace those who don't.  10. Workers are striking against the use of AI While some workers seek to embrace AI in their roles, others are speaking out against the ways the technology can harm workers. For the past three months, thousands of Hollywood writers in the Writers Guild of America have been on strike, in part, to express their concerns over the potential for AI to replace their jobs. Now actors from the SAG-AFTRA guild have joined the strike, urging studios to be extra careful with how they use AI. ""Artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions, and all actors and performers deserve contract language that protects them from having their identity and talent exploited without consent and pay,"" Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA, said during a press conference this month.

Journalists are also pushing back against the use of AI in newsrooms. In late June, the GMG Union of G/O Media — the company behind sites such as Gizmodo and Jezebel — released a statement pleading with the parent company to put the brakes on experimenting with AI-generated content. ""We urge G/O Media to cease its plans to litter our sites with AI-generated content and invest in real journalism done by real journalists,"" the letter said.

In a 2023 IBM study surveying 3000 executives on generative AI, 75% of respondents said it would give their businesses a competitive edge and 43% are using AI to make strategic business decisions. But not all workers are ready to use AI. In the IBM study, 57% of the executives said they had reservations about data security, while 48% said they were also concerned about bias. Nevertheless, workers and companies are starting to deploy AI for business purposes in myriad ways. Workers across industries — from education to law — are using AI technology such as ChatGPT to automate their workflows to save time and boost productivity. Nick Patrick, the owner of the music-production company Primal Sounds Productions, told Insider he used ChatGPT to fine-tune legal contracts for clients. Shannon Ahern, a high-school math and science teacher, said she used the AI chatbot to generate quiz questions and lesson plans.Others have used the chatbot to write listings for luxury real estate, assist in recruiting efforts, draft social-media posts, and develop code.In fact, many workers are even secretly using AI to help do their jobs.At the beginning of the year, Fishbowl, a workplace-discussion app, surveyed more than 11,700 workers, including those from companies such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Twitter, to gauge whether they used AI at work. Out of the 43% of respondents who said they used AI to accomplish their work tasks, 68% of them said they hadn't told their bosses they were using them.Companies across various industries — including healthcare, education, and insurance — are looking to hire workers with experience using AI.As of June, more than a dozen of companies were hiring workers on sites such as Indeed and LinkedIn with ChatGPT expertise listed in their job postings, paying as much as $800,000 a year for the skill. Executives at these companies told Insider that job candidates with knowledge of AI might be more productive, creative, and open to change than those without AI expertise. The move to hire AI-savvy workers seems to be gaining traction. In a recent survey from the job site Resume Builder of business leaders who were hiring, 91% of respondents said they wanted to bring on workers who knew how to use OpenAI's chatbot to save time and enhance productivity.Executives are asking their workers to integrate AI into their workflows. That way, companies can save time and money on their business processes.Jensen Huang, the CEO of the chip giant Nvidia, said workers should learn how to use AI to improve their performance.""Everyone is a programmer now,"" Huang said during this year's Computex conference in Taipei, Taiwan. ""You just have to say something to the computer."" Akash Nigam, the CEO and founder of Genies, an avatar-tools company, previously told Insider he purchased ChatGPT Plus accounts for all of his 120 employees and encouraged them to make learning the AI chatbot a priority so they could ""effectively accelerate"" their departments.""You really got to find time to, like, learn this skill,"" Nigam previously told Insider. AI can help you land your next gig by improving your job application.To test his company's recruiting efforts, Neil Taylor, the founder of Schwa, a communications consultancy, said that he secretly submitted a job application written by ChatGPT to recruiters at his firm and later learned that ChatGPT was one of the few applicants chosen for an interview. ""It was more competent than a lot of the bad people who apply to us,"" Taylor told Sky News.Insider's Beatrice Nolan conducted a similar experiment, in which she asked ChatGPT to write cover letters for real jobs and sent the letters to hiring managers for them to review. The managers told Nolan they would've offered her an interview even though they said the letters lacked personality.AI enthusiasts have also expressed on social media how impressed they are with ChatGPT's ability to write cover letters, resurfacing a long-held debate on whether cover letters should be removed from the job-application process. AI-assisted hiring is nothing new. For years, companies have used AI tools to screen résumés and cover letters, interview job candidates, and even analyze the speech and facial expressions of applicants to get a read on their personalities — processes that experts say might not be fair when making hiring decisions. But some human-resources professionals say that generative-AI tools have helped them do their jobs better. Jasmine Cheng, a recruiter who left Amazon to start her own recruiting firm called Topknack, said she used ChatGPT to do things such as finding job candidates and creating interview questions, which she said saved her at least 10 hours a week. ""With those hours back, I can reach more candidates, network, and even conduct more business development to get more clients, which leads to making more money,"" Cheng previously told Insider.Managers may find writing performance reviews for their employees a tough task. But what if AI could do it for you?Companies behind HR-management software are starting to integrate AI features that can help managers write performance reviews that are fair, accurate, and personalized for their direct reports. For instance, Textio, an HR-management tool with an AI-assistant feature for performance reviews, is used by companies such as Hulu, Spotify, T-Mobile, and McDonald's, WorkLife reported. AI-generated performance reviews are nothing new. In 2018, the cloud giant Oracle launched Digital Assistant, an AI chatbot that HR professionals can use to complete employee evaluations.AI expertise may also be taken into consideration during a performance review. Nigam, the CEO of the avatar-tools company, expects to make decisions on who gets promoted based on how well they know ChatGPT, he told Insider.A four-day workweek may be on the horizon thanks to ChatGPT.AI tools can help workers be more productive, which, in turn, cuts down the time it takes to accomplish any given task — a ""necessary condition for us to work less,"" Oded Netzer, a professor at Columbia Business School, previously told Insider.Carl Benedikt Frey, an Oxford economist, echoed the sentiment. He told Insider: ""Any technology that increases productivity, ChatGPT included, makes a shorter workweek more feasible."" But some experts say that AI's prospective productivity gains may not shorten the workweek. Michael Chu, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, previously told Insider that employers might expect employees to work even harder to maximize their output because of AI.Some companies have set rules around how their employees can use AI in the workplace, in part, to protect their confidential data from being leaked. While firms such as Apple and Spotify have been said to restrict their workers from using AI, other companies, such as JPMorgan and Northrop Grumman, appear to have outright barred their employees from using the tech. ""Although AI, including ChatGPT and other 'conversational' AIs, can be enormously helpful and truly transformative, we want to be smart about how we implement these tools to protect ourselves, our partners, our company's information and our user data,"" executives at iHeartMedia wrote in a June memo explaining why it's restricting its workers from using AI. As AI becomes more advanced, many workers may be wondering whether the tech will replace their jobs down the line. A recent Goldman Sachs report on the state of AI found that generative-AI tools could lead to a ""significant disruption"" in the labor market and affect 300 million full-time jobs worldwide. White-collar workers — particularly people in law and those part of an administrative staff — are most likely to be affected by new AI tools, Goldman found. Other labor experts told Insider that workers in media, marketing, and finance — jobs that require writing and number crunching — were at risk of replacement by AI. AI job replacement may already be occurring. Suumit Shah, the CEO of the e-commerce platform Dukaan, tweeted earlier this month that ""we had to layoff 90% of our support team"" because an AI chatbot was able to do its work faster. But not all experts believe AI will wipe out jobs.Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, told Insider that AI should be viewed as an imperfect productivity-enhancing tool that could produce bias and error. Richard Baldwin, an economist, said at the 2023 World Economic Forum's Growth Summit that while AI might not replace your job, workers who know how to use AI may replace those who don't.  While some workers seek to embrace AI in their roles, others are speaking out against the ways the technology can harm workers. For the past three months, thousands of Hollywood writers in the Writers Guild of America have been on strike, in part, to express their concerns over the potential for AI to replace their jobs. Now actors from the SAG-AFTRA guild have joined the strike, urging studios to be extra careful with how they use AI. ""Artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions, and all actors and performers deserve contract language that protects them from having their identity and talent exploited without consent and pay,"" Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA, said during a press conference this month.Journalists are also pushing back against the use of AI in newsrooms.

There is a lot of speculation regarding the future of teaching and learning in compulsory education, especially with recent developments in technology. The world-wide release of ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence platforms have created a plethora of new, even more difficult, questions. What role will these AI systems play in classrooms? What do students need to learn to succeed in an AI saturated world? How will teaching change? How do you strike a balance between teachers and machines? And obviously, will AI replace teachers or other education workers?Although teacher unions may not have the answers, they cannot stand by and let others determine the answers. The world’s education unions must come together and proactively shape the way emerging technologies are used in our schools and classrooms. If we snooze, we lose.Before we dig a little deeper, I will start where every school system must start—personal safety, online security, and ensuring equity. Although some countries and jurisdictions have strong policies to protect privacy and data, they are the exception and not the rule. Moreover, the rate at which new technologies are being developed, previous regulations and even some current proposed regulations will likely fall short. The rabbit-like way new technology comes online will always outpace the tortoise we call governmental action.“Just like we see with corporate driven privatization, schools in systems that are not run democratically and lack resources will be seen as frontiers of profit for big tech. The power of multinational corporations will overwhelm the rights of students and citizens alike.” This is where unions must step in. Yes, we must continually push for even stronger regulations, but waiting for others to defend and protect our professions is a losing strategy. And our profession cannot afford to lose.Leading AI-induced changes in the teaching and learning processUndoubtedly, the role of teachers will change in the future. Most agree teachers will not be replaced by AI, but the power of generative AI will require teachers to become less the “deliverers of content” and more coaches of learning—deeper learning. This new role is not necessarily a bad one, but that all depends on us. Even more than what is happening today, it will require teachers to develop increased higher-order thinking skills in their students. Skills such as collaborative learning, critical thinking, problem solving, multi-disciplinary approaches, and real-world application. For sure, all of these are part classroom lessons today but, using a common American saying, this part of teaching and learning needs to “go on steroids.” Whatever teachers were doing in the past needs to expand and be greatly enhanced. That is the reality of preparing students for an AI world.“AI-led instruction may allow students to learn at their own pace using adaptive algorithms that continuously adjust the content and difficulty based on student interaction. However, AI cannot teach the thinking skills that will become an integral part of future success. That is the role teachers must play.” This focus on deeper learning and advanced thinking will become part of every curriculum. Classes that emphasize understanding, motivation, and problem solving will become an essential part of educating for the future. AI-led instruction may allow students to learn at their own pace using adaptive algorithms that continuously adjust the content and difficulty based on student interaction. However, AI cannot teach the thinking skills that will become an integral part of future success. That is the role teachers must play.Teachers like to say that they don’t teach kids what to think, they teach them how to think. With the infusion of AI in every part of society, this belief system will be put to the test. The future needs strong independent thinkers who can determine good information from bad and apply that knowledge in a comprehensive way, not to solve a problem or two on a standardized test, but to solve today’s complex real-world problems, and whatever the world throws at them in the future.The implications of AI on teaching and learning starts with ensuring current teachers have the support and learning opportunities that, frankly, do not exist today—at least not at scale. Teacher preparation programs will also need to profoundly change. The interaction between administration, schools, and teachers will need to be reimagined. And importantly, the way learning will be assessed will fundamentally change. The obsession with standardized tests and other large-scale assessments will slowly come to an end. With AI in the classroom assessment will be built-in, and a fundamental part of the personalized learning process. Success will be measured in terms of individual students and not across the board averages.The days of the one teacher, one classroom model is slowly also coming to an end. There will be a mix of traditional face-to-face instruction, team teaching online learning, project-based lessons, and an emphasis on collaboration and student team-based learning. This will require not only a change in teaching, but a major rethinking of schools’ physical space. This new model will require school buildings to be reconfigured away from a hallway of single purpose classrooms we see today to a more interactive environment that allows both small and large group work. These new schools will allow teams of teachers to leverage the strengths of each in a learning format that will maximize instruction.Protecting the most vulnerable systemsThis does not mean that all countries will see schools change in the same way. Schools in democratic countries will be able to leverage the power of regulation and political expediency to help ensure AI-based changes to schools protect—to the extent possible—the privacy and security of students and adults. But that will not be the case in other parts of the world.Just like we see with corporate driven privatization, schools in systems that are not run democratically and lack resources will be seen as frontiers of profit for big tech. The power of multinational corporations will overwhelm the rights of students and citizens alike. Governments will be forced to accept corporate mandates or risk being left behind. And even worse, international monetary funds may play a significant role in this process. We have seen this type of educational blackmail before, and with the AI revolution in education, we are likely to see it again.What does all this mean? It means a lot of things are going to change in and around schools. Artificial intelligence has created both challenges and opportunities that will require lots of decisions about the future of the teaching profession in the next few years. Teacher unions must lead addressing the challenges and leveraging the opportunities. Just as the pandemic was a once-in-a-lifetime event, the AI revolution in education is a unique point in time—the outcome will influence education for decades.The artificial intelligence revolution is at the schoolhouse doorstep. As teacher unions, we must be proactive and respond. If not, we will see even more de-professionalization and commercialization of our work. All of us see a brighter future where AI can aid our educators, but we must prevent it from devaluing the educational experience, and those who work and learn in schools. Teacher unions must be at the forefront of this revolution. If not, others will determine the nature of schools, the teaching profession, and the future of education for us. In a real sense, if we snooze, we lose.

And according to a new report, it’s not coming for everyone’s jobs equally: Projections suggest women are more likely to lose their jobs to AI than men.

The report, released this week by the McKinsey Global Institute, suggests that nearly a third of hours worked in the US could be automated by the end of the decade. Thanks to automation and AI, 12 million people will need to change jobs—and women will be 1.5 times more likely to have to find new roles.

That’s because women make up more of the workforce in lower-paying industries, like office work and customer service, which the report projects will shrink more significantly thanks to automation and AI. People in lower-wage jobs, it adds, could be up to 14 times more likely to need to shift occupations than those that pay the highest. 

Among those also at risk of having to find new jobs: Black and Hispanic workers, who are “highly concentrated” in some of those shrinking jobs, along with workers without college degrees. And most importantly, those workers will probably need to pick up new skills or training before they can shift into new industries.

People are switching jobs at surging rates

From 2019-2022, the US labor market saw tremendous spikes in job shifts (or when a person moves from one occupation to another). The report counts some 8.6 million career changes among people—a 50% increase from the last three-year period, according to McKinsey. Half of those 8.6 million job changes, it adds, were in lower-wage industries, including food services, customer service, office support, and production.

“Demand for lower-wage service work remains, but fewer workers are accepting these roles,” the report writes. More high-wage jobs were added—about 3.5 million jobs that pay $57,000 or more annually—but it’s not clear if lower-paid employees were able to move up into high-paying roles, or if these jobs were filled by workers new to the market.

Who reaps the gains of AI? White-collar workers, of course

Meanwhile, while the projections see AI and automation shrinking some industries, McKinsey also suggests it could speed up the growth of others—especially for knowledge workers. “We see generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright,” it writes. 

Compare that to another report issued this week, this time by the Pew Research Center, which finds that white-collar workers are optimistic about how AI will help them. About a fifth of all US workers have a high exposure—or, in other terms, have work that can be performed by technology—to artificial intelligence. Those in jobs most exposed to AI, usually high-paying ones, are likely to say the technology will help more than hurt them.

AI can augment work, adopters argue, rather than replace it, so teams might spend more time on creative, strategic, or collaborative thinking. We’ve also seen the blunders of AI when it’s used in place of people, from lawyers submitting made-up cases to media outlets publishing error-riddled articles. Artificial intelligence isn’t equipped to be your lawyer, doctor, or architect—at least for now.

So how can we make sure lower-paid workers aren’t left behind?

A pressing question, then, is how we might extend some of those benefits to the people whose jobs are projected to go the way of automation. McKinsey sees some optimism—and urgency. “Spiking demand and labor scarcity forced many employers to consider nontraditional candidates with potential and train them if they lacked direct experience,” the report says.

But ultimately, employers and the country at large will need to lean into that equitable outlook—and offer more training, more development, and more pathways for employees to land high-earning positions. Only with that will we find our way to a future where all workers can enjoy the advantages of AI—not be eliminated by it.

Actor Sean Gunn speaks out against Netflix 











Actor Sean Gunn says Netflix ""trying to screw people over,"" as SAG-AFTRA strike continues
07:13

While creative talent is sweating it out on picket lines, Netflix is hard at work developing its machine learning infrastructure.Streaming video giant Netflix is looking to hire artificial intelligence specialists, dangling one salary that pays as much as $900,000, even as Hollywood actors and writers are in the midst of a historic strike that aims to curtail the industry's use of A.I.One job posting, for a product manager of Netflix's machine learning platform, lists a total compensation range of $300,000-$900,000. ""You will be creating product experiences that have never been done before,"" the listing boasts.  






Netflix is also on the hunt for a senior software engineer to ""[develop] a product that makes it easy to build, manage and scale real life [machine learning] applications,"" for an annual income between $100,000 and $700,000, as well as a machine-learning scientist to ""develop algorithms that power high quality localization,"" with a total pay between $150,000 and $750,000. Hollywood strikes having ripple effect on British entertainmentGeorgia movie industry hit amid ongoing Hollywood strikeHollywood strikes could fuel rise of influencer contentA spokesperson for Netflix declined to comment on the job postings and referred CBS MoneyWatch to a statement from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which is representing studios (including Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News) in negotiations with writers and actors.

McKinsey and Company is no stranger to generative artificial intelligence (gen AI): around half of the global consulting giant’s employees were said to be using the technology as of earlier this summer. 
But it’s not the only org to see a rapid uptake of gen AI. Indeed, a new annual report by McKinsey’s AI arm QuantumBlack finds that “use of gen AI is already widespread.”

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



McKinsey reached this conclusion by conducting an online survey of 1,684 participants across various regions, industries and company sizes between April 11 and 21, 2023. The majority (79%) of respondents reported “at least some exposure to gen AI, either for work or outside of work,” while 22% said they were using it regularly for their work. 
Those findings echo VentureBeat’s own informal survey conducted ahead of our VB Transform conference in San Francisco last month, which found that more than 70% of companies are already experimenting with gen AI. 
Who is using gen AI and where?
Ok, so we know companies and individuals are getting their hands on gen AI, but who is using it the most, and for what? McKinsey’s new report provides some insights worth calling out. 
So far, North America-based respondents lead the globe in terms of gen AI adoption for work, with 28% of them using the tech in their jobs and outside of work, compared to 24% of European respondents and 22% of Asia-Pacific respondents (Greater China was just 19%). 
Credit: QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey “The state of AI in 2023: Generative AI’s breakout year”
This is perhaps expected, given the gen AI craze kicked off in the U.S. in November 2022 with OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT. 
Similarly, the industries that have most rapidly embraced the technology for work and/or outside of work so far are “technology, media and telecom,” at 33%, followed by “financial services” and “business, legal and professional services,” at 24% and 23%, respectively.
Credit: QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey “The state of AI in 2023: Generative AI’s breakout year”
Again, this is not too surprising: The tech industry, which originated gen AI products, has been leading the adoption curve.
Interestingly, though, when it comes to which job titles use gen AI the most for work and/or outside of it, both C-suite and senior managers clocked in at 24% regular usage for work and outside of work, combined. Midlevel managers were close behind at 23%, although they were more likely to have had no exposure, as well (19%).

What gen AI is being used foradvertisement
The business functions most commonly harnessing these newer tools mirror those where AI use is most prevalent overall. 
These include marketing and sales, product and service development and service operations such as customer care and back-office support.
In fact, the single largest category of functions where gen AI was being used as of April 2023 was marketing and sales, at 14%, followed by product/service development at 13%.

Very low on the list were supply chain management at 3% and manufacturing at just 2%. advertisement
While these areas may prove more challenging and time-consuming for AI adoption and have some physical constraints that make them more resistant to it, supply chain management in particular would seem to be a ripe area for new gen AI products and services to take hold — as a lot of it does involve planning, analyzing market conditions and providing insights based on vast volumes of data, all of which gen AI excels at. 
In terms of what people are using gen AI to do, specifically, almost all of the capabilities so far revolve around creating, summarizing and analyzing documents. However, trend forecasting is a close second.

More than a fleeting trend
The report also revealed that gen AI is not just a fleeting trend but a strategic focus for many organizations. Nearly half (40%) of those reporting AI adoption indicated that their companies plan to ramp up their overall AI investments, thanks to gen AI. Furthermore, the technology has already made its way onto the board’s agenda for 28% of these organizations.

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). These sophisticated models are used widely in AI solutions, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, and have been designed to understand and generate human-like text, enabling them to perform various language-based tasks. People are incredibly excited by the potential of this technology which is poised to revolutionize how we live and work. However, to understand the true potential of LLMs, it is crucial that people know how they function.
LLMs, at their core, are neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data. They learn to predict the next word in a sentence by analyzing patterns and relationships within the training data. Through this process, they develop an understanding of grammar, syntax, and even semantic nuances. By leveraging this knowledge, these models can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses when given a prompt or query.




The training process involves exposing the model to a large quantity of data, such as books, articles, and websites. The model learns to identify patterns, extract meaning, and generate text based on the input it receives. As a result, LLMs acquire a remarkable ability to mimic human language, offering the potential to enhance various applications and services.
How to successfully implement Large Language Models
While large language models hold immense promise, implementing them successfully requires careful consideration. Here are some key factors to ensure their effective utilization: 
1.   Data Quality and Bias Mitigation: High-quality training data is vital for training LLMs. Curating diverse and representative datasets is essential to mitigate biases and prejudices in the source data. Additionally, continuous monitoring and evaluation are necessary to identify and rectify potential biases during model deployment.
2.   Fine-Tuning for Specific Tasks: LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific applications to enhance performance. Fine-tuning involves training the model on task-specific data to adapt to a particular domain or problem. This process can help optimise the model's output for specific use cases, such as customer support or content generation.
3.   User Feedback and Iterative Improvement: Implementing LLMs successfully requires a feedback loop from users. Collecting feedback, monitoring user interactions, and iteratively improving the model based on this feedback are critical steps to refine its performance over time.
Leveraging Large Language Models to build better virtual agents
One area where LLMs have demonstrated significant potential is in combination with conversational AI. We can achieve even greater interactive and human-like conversational experiences by integrating LLMs into already powerful virtual agents. Here's how LLMs can contribute to building better virtual agents:

Enhanced Accuracy and Creativity: By integrating LLMs with Natural Language Understanding (NLU), a hybrid system can be created that combines the strengths of both technologies. The NLU provides accurate and reliable responses within a specific business context, while the LLM optimises content generation with its vast general knowledge. 
Empowering Customer Service Agents: Customer service agents can leverage LLMs to enhance their capabilities. For instance, LLMs can scan and condense conversations between customers and virtual agents, providing human agents with a clear and concise summary. They can also help fine-tune the length and tone of responses to match the conversation and generate pre-written messages that include key information from the conversation history.
Efficient AI Training Process: The text generation capabilities of LLMs can be harnessed to streamline the AI training process. They can generate on-brand virtual agent responses, provide multiple alternatives to a single sentence for use as training data, and rewrite answers to match length and tone. This can save several days of manual work.
Facilitating Language Expansion: When expanding the virtual agent solution into new markets or languages, LLMs can provide valuable assistance. They can offer translations and provide synonym suggestions when building out a dictionary for language understanding, saving valuable time and enhancing the quality of the virtual agent.

Why a hybrid approach is the way to go
With such a varied list of benefits and abilities, it can be tempting for a business to consider going “all in” on LLMs, but as stressed earlier, responsible and considered adoption is key. The raw processing power of a large language model is exceptional, but it can also be prone to hallucinations and inaccuracies. Adopting a hybrid approach is the way to go if you want to deliver the best experience with customer-facing virtual agents. Connecting LLMs to conversational AI that is pre-trained on company-specific data, with the right guardrails in place, allows for virtual agent scalability and creativity without sacrificing accuracy and data quality.
LLMs have emerged as powerful tools with the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human-computer interaction. By understanding their functioning, implementing them thoughtfully, and leveraging them the right way, we can unlock LLMs to enhance user experiences and create more intelligent and engaging conversational systems. However, it is essential to address biases and connect these models to reliable source data to ensure the information they provide is accurate so that their potential in an enterprise setting doesn’t go unrealized.

	While the writer and actor strikes are driven by multiple concerns (questions about compensation being a big one), there’s no question that the role of artificial intelligence in entertainment has emerged as a hot-button issue.

	In a fiery speech in Times Square on July 25, actor Bryan Cranston epitomized the concerns of actors, telling the crowd of hundreds: “We’ve got a message for Mr. Iger [Disney CEO Bob Iger]: I know, sir, that you look at things through a different lens. We don’t expect you to understand who we are. But we ask you to hear us, and beyond that to listen to us when we tell you we will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots.”

	The actors fear that studios will take their likenesses or voices, and reuse them over and over for little or no pay, and with little in the way of notice. The writers fear that studios will use large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to write or rewrite scripts, harming their livelihoods. The producers, aka the AMPTP, argue that AI use should be “a balanced approach based on careful use, not prohibition.”



	While the future of AI in Hollywood is unclear, there is no question that the major studios and streaming services are intrigued by the technology. Job listings at almost every major entertainment company show that there is a veritable AI hiring spree going on as companies seek to understand how the technology can change their businesses.

	And, fittingly given Cranston’s speech, Disney seems particularly intrigued by the tech. The company has a number of open positions focused on AI and machine learning across the country, per a review of open positions by The Hollywood Reporter.

	Some are part of Disney’s “Imagineering” team, the group responsible for turning Disneyland and Walt Disney World into world-renowned attractions.

	One job, for an R&D Imagineer focused on generative AI, is looking for someone who has the “ambition to push the limits of what AI tools can create and understand the difference between the voice of data and the voice of a designer, writer or artist.” The role will “collaborate with third party studios, universities, organizations, and developers to evaluate, adopt, and integrate the latest generative AI.” The job promises a base salary of up to $180,000 per year, with the possibility of bonuses or other compensation as well.

	









	Another role, for a machine learning engineer in the Disney Streaming Advanced Research division (it’s “responsible for creating AI-enabled solutions for Disney+, Star+, and ESPN+,” per the listing) will use AI to “work on advanced personalization efforts involving digital avatars.”

	In total, THR spotted some half-dozen AI-focused jobs at Disney. But the company is far from alone in exploring the space.

	Netflix made some headlines after The Intercept noticed an AI Product Manager job that promises compensation of up to $900,000.

	“Our business is driven by Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence, which fuels innovation in content creation and acquisition, personalization, payment processing, and other revenue-centric initiatives,” the company writes in the listing.

	But Netflix has a number of job openings focused on AI and machine learning, dealing with video games, research, R&D, customer experiences and other areas.

	In fact, nearly every studio owner seems to be thinking about AI, whether it’s for content, customer service, data analysis or other uses.

	Amazon and Apple, of course, have dozens and dozens of AI and ML jobs open. But some of those jobs appear specifically geared to their media businesses, like an Amazon job for a senior project manager for Prime Video.

	“Want to define the next big thing in localizing content, enhancing content, or making it accessible using state-of-the-art Generative AI and Computer Vision tech? This is for you!” the listing blares, promising a base salary of up to $300,000.

	










	And at Sony, which owns Sony Pictures Entertainment, its “Sony AI America” division is looking for an AI “Ethics” engineer.

	“We believe in researching and developing AI techniques that empower the imagination and creativity of artists, makers and creators around the world,” the listing writes. “Our aim is to advance AI so that it augments — and works in harmony with — humans to benefit society.”

	Sony AI, the company notes, “works closely with Sony’s other business units, including Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC., Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., and Sony Music Entertainment.” The job pays a base salary of up to $160,000 (ethics, it seems, isn’t as lucrative as some other areas).

	And the list goes on. Warner Bros. Discovery has a few AI and ML jobs open, in its video game division and in corporate; Paramount has an opening for a machine learning engineer in its CBS division; and NBCUniversal owner Comcast has a number of AI and ML jobs, focused on research, customer service and other areas.

	And the hiring comes amid a larger job pullback at many of these companies. Disney just finished laying off some 7,000 employees, and Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, Amazon and others have had painful cuts in recent months. But jobs focused on AI appear to be an exception.

	Of course, the investment in AI should come as no surprise. The technology has taken all of corporate America by storm, and media companies are no exception when it comes to trend-hunting. But the role AI can play in the future of entertainment has caused much anxiety among the workers responsible for that content.

	










	“It’s like, you’ve got a house and you need to redo the kitchen, you really need to redo the bathroom, the master bedroom hasn’t been redone for 40 years, you want to do all these things,” writer, director and former actress Justine Bateman told THR’s TV Top 5 podcast earlier this month. “But AI is the front door. And you can get all of these things from the AMPTP, but if you don’t get those strong restrictions on AI, you’ve just given them the key to the front door, and none of those other gains will matter.”

	It’s also an area Iger, the strike’s villain of the moment, is well aware of. In his first town hall after returning as Disney CEO last November, an employee asked Iger about how the company plans to adapt to fast-moving technologies, referencing generative AI tech that was just becoming mainstream.

	“Nothing is going to stop technological advancement,” he replied, adding that Disney has typically embraced new technology to tell better stories. Generative AI tech, Iger added, is “something that at some point in the future the company will embrace.”

	The AI arms race may be in the early stages, but the entertainment giants are all in the mix. And regardless of the deal they cut with the unions, AI appears poised to become a part of that future.

Something similar can happen with artificial intelligence.Photo-illustration: WIRED Staff; Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveIn Isaac Asimov’s classic science fiction story “Robbie,” the Weston family owns a robot who serves as a nursemaid and companion for their precocious preteen daughter, Gloria. Gloria and the robot Robbie are friends; their relationship is affectionate and mutually caring. Gloria regards Robbie as her loyal and dutiful caretaker. However, Mrs. Weston becomes concerned about this “unnatural” relationship between the robot and her child and worries about the possibility of Robbie causing harm to Gloria (despite it's being explicitly programmed to not do so); it is clear she is jealous. After several failed attempts to wean Gloria off Robbie, her father, exasperated and worn down by the mother’s protestations, suggests a tour of a robot factory—there, Gloria will be able to see that Robbie is “just” a manufactured robot, not a person, and fall out of love with it. Gloria must come to learn how Robbie works, how he was made; then she will understand that Robbie is not who she thinks he is. This plan does not work. Gloria does not learn how Robbie “really works,” and in a plot twist, Gloria and Robbie become even better friends. Mrs. Weston, the spoilsport, is foiled yet again. Gloria remains “deluded” about who Robbie “really is.”What is the moral of this tale? Most importantly, that those who interact and socialize with artificial agents, without knowing (or caring) how they “really work” internally, will develop distinctive relationships with them and ascribe to them those mental qualities appropriate for their relationships. Gloria plays with Robbie and loves him as a companion; he cares for her in return. There is an interpretive dance that Gloria engages in with Robbie, and Robbie’s internal operations and constitution are of no relevance to it. When the opportunity to learn such details arises, further evidence of Robbie’s functionality (after it saves Gloria from an accident) distracts and prevents Gloria from learning anymore.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTPhilosophically speaking, “Robbie” teaches us that in ascribing a mind to another being, we are not making a statement about the kind of thing it is, but rather, revealing how deeply we understand how it works. For instance, Gloria thinks Robbie is intelligent, but her parents think they can reduce its seemingly intelligent behavior to lower-level machine operations. To see this more broadly, note the converse case where we ascribe mental qualities to ourselves that we are unwilling to ascribe to programs or robots. These qualities, like intelligence, intuition, insight, creativity, and understanding, have this in common: We do not know what they are. Despite the extravagant claims often bandied about by practitioners of neuroscience and empirical psychology, and by sundry cognitive scientists, these self-directed compliments remain undefinable. Any attempt to characterize one employs the other (“true intelligence requires insight and creativity” or “true understanding requires insight and intuition”) and engages in, nay requires, extensive hand waving.Featured VideoThe Future of Beauty Tech | WIRED Brand LabBut even if we are not quite sure what these qualities are or what they bottom out in, whatever the mental quality, the proverbial “educated layman” is sure that humans have it and machines like robots do not—even if machines act like we do, producing those same products that humans do, and occasionally replicating human feats that are said to require intelligence, ingenuity, or whatever else. Why? Because, like Gloria’s parents, we know (thanks to being informed by the system’s creators in popular media) that “all they are doing is [table lookup / prompt completion / exhaustive search of solution spaces].” Meanwhile, the mental attributes we apply to ourselves are so vaguely defined, and our ignorance of our mental operations so profound (currently), that we cannot say “human intuition (insight or creativity) is just [fill in the blanks with banal physical activity].”SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.Current debates about artificial intelligence, then, proceed the way they do because whenever we are confronted with an “artificial intelligence,” one whose operations we (think we) understand, it is easy to quickly respond: “All this artificial agent does is X.” This reductive description demystifies its operations, and we are therefore sure it is not intelligent (or creative or insightful). In other words, those beings or things whose internal, lower-level operations we understand and can point to and illuminate, are merely operating according to known patterns of banal physical operations. Those seemingly intelligent entities whose internal operations we do not understand are capable of insight and understanding and creativity. (Resemblance to humans helps too; we more easily deny intelligence to animals that do not look like us.)But what if, like Gloria, we did not have such knowledge of what some system or being or object or extraterrestrial is doing when it produces its apparently “intelligent” answers? What qualities would we ascribe to it to make sense of what it is doing? This level of incomprehensibility is perhaps rapidly approaching. Witness the perplexed reactions of some ChatGPT developers to its supposedly “emergent” behavior, where no one seems to know just how ChatGPT produced the answers it did. We could, of course, insist that “all it’s doing is (some kind of) prompt completion.” But really, we could also just say about humans, “It’s just neurons firing.” But neither ChatGPT nor humans would make sense to us that way.The evidence suggests that if we were to encounter a sufficiently complicated and interesting entity that appears intelligent, but we do not know how it works and cannot utter our usual dismissive line, “All x does is y,” we would start using the language of “folk psychology” to govern our interactions with it, to understand why it does what it does, and importantly, to try to predict its behavior. By historical analogy, when we did not know what moved the ocean and the sun, we granted them mental states. (“The angry sea believes the cliffs are its mortal foes.” Or “The sun wants to set quickly.”) Once we knew how they worked, thanks to our growing knowledge of the physical sciences, we demoted them to purely physical objects. (A move with disastrous environmental consequences!) Similarly, once we lose our grasp on the internals of artificial intelligence systems, or grow up with them, not knowing how they work, we might ascribe minds to them too. This is a matter of pragmatic decision, not discovery. For that might be the best way to understand why and what they do.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenThis should prompt us to look a little closer. For, come to think of it, how do I know that other humans have minds like mine? Roughly: They look like me, they act like me, and so, I reason that they must have minds like mine, which work the way I think mine does. (This is an entirely reasonable inference to the best possible explanation for their visible, external behavior.) We never, though, open the brains of other human beings to check for minds, because we would not know what to look for. More to the point, we know what we would see: a brain, and we do not know how those work. Our intentionality, our understanding, is mysterious too when viewed at this lower level of description. And so, because we cannot find physical correlates of our intelligence, and even if we did, we would find using them too cumbersome in dealing with intelligent humans, we instead observe how human beings behave and act, and how they conform to psychological generalizations. If someone wants to get into medical school, and they believe that studying hard will help them do so, then we can predict that they may be found in a library, studying away diligently. That is what “normal, intelligent” human beings do. This is the interpretive dance we engage in with humans; the language of psychology emerges from these interactions. It is how we make sense of our fellow humans.AdvertisementThis means that our fellow humans, too, are entities whose complex and poorly understood innards do not allow us to explain, predict, and understand their interactions with us in terms of their physical composition and properties (the way we can with objects like stones or glass bottles) or in terms of their design properties (the way we can with aircraft or mechanical pencils). Because we must use higher-level psychological explanations, the best way to make sense of human beings’ behavior is to anthropomorphize them! That is, the best way to make sense of these other beings distinct from me (other “humans”) is to treat them as if they were just like me in kind. The crucial point here is that I did not have to regard other human beings as being like me. I could have perhaps regarded them as curious aliens who happen to resemble me and act like me but were not really like me in some “important, crucial” sense, because I did not have conclusive proof that they had internal lives and minds like mine. Instead, we choose to anthropomorphize humans, because doing so makes interactions with them more tractable, a situation preferable to enduring a solipsistic existence, convinced that our mind is the only one that existed.This philosophical analysis matters because there is an important balancing act we must engage in when thinking about legal regulation of artificial intelligence research: We want the technical advantages and social benefits of artificial intelligence (such as the amazing predictions of protein structures produced by AlphaFold), so we want their designers to continue developing such systems. But these companies need liability cover—like the railways were provided by the Supreme Court in their fledgling days—otherwise, the designers of artificial intelligence systems would stay out of such a potentially financially risky arena. But we want society to be protected too from the negative effects of such smart programs, especially if they take actions that are not anticipated—which, of course, is also their desirable functionality.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanSecurityDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage ScamsBy Lily Hay NewmanCultureThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right NowBy Matt KamenCultureThe 49 Best Shows on Netflix Right NowBy Matt KamenSo, in legal and economic terms, we need to appropriately allocate risk and liability. One way to do so builds upon this revised understanding of artificial intelligence. When we have a conceptual sense that the artificial agents we interact with are agents in the psychological sense—that is, we understand their actions as being caused by their beliefs and desires—it will allow us to consider these systems as the legal representatives (the legal agents) of those who develop and deploy them. Much as hospitals employ doctors who act on behalf of the hospitals, whose acts the hospital is liable for, who can sign contracts and take actions on the behalf of the hospital. (The legal system does not, strictly, have to wait for such a conceptual understanding to be in place before deeming artificial agents to be legal agents, but broader social acceptance of such regulations will be easier if such conceptual understanding is widespread.) They would then be the legal agents of their legal principals—for example, the Bing chatbot would be the legal agent of its principal, Microsoft. Then, the principal is liable for their actions and consequences—as we, the broader public, would want—but only within the scope of duty which their developers and deployers would want. For instance, a driver for a public transport company is liable for things he does on the job but not off it. Transit companies can hire drivers, then, knowing that they are justifiably liable for their actions on the job, but they are protected from their employees when they “go rogue” off the job. Similarly, say a custom version of Bing, purchased by a customer to provide expert guidance on pricing, would be liable for the advice it provides on pricing, but if a customer were to use it for another task, say advising on finding suitable romantic partners, Microsoft would no longer be liable for any bad advice Bing may provide. For such advice would be out of the scope of its proposed duties. For another example, consider the case of Google’s Gmail agent, which scans emails for content it can use to provide advertisements to Gmail users. Google’s risible response to the charge of privacy violations is that because humans do not scan users’ emails, there is no privacy violation. This is not a defense Google could employ if its Gmail agent were to be considered its legal agent, because by law, the knowledge gained by a legal agent is directly attributed to its principal. Google’s “automation screen” thus fails because of the legal agent status of the programs it deploys. Here, our interests are protected by the legal status granted to the artificial agent. This does not diminish our rights; rather, it protects them.Consider what we would do if extraterrestrials alighted on this planet of ours and said, “Take us to your leader!” How would we understand and describe them? What if their innards were so mysterious that our best science gave us no handle on how they functioned? We would have to function like diligent field anthropologists, looking for behavioral evidence that we could correlate with their pronouncements, and start considering the possibility that they have minds like ours. Our lawyers would have to assess the status of these beings in our social orderings and, on seeing they filled and performed important executive roles, that people had formed personal relationships with them, perhaps think about evaluating their application for citizenship and legal status seriously. An analogous situation exists today with regards to the artificial agents and programs in our midst, with a crucial difference: We have made and designed them. This familiarity is tinged with contempt, but the nature of our interpretive dance with them can and will change, depending on how mysterious we find them. The more impenetrable they become in terms of their internal operations, the more sophisticated their functioning, the more we will have to rely on external descriptions using psychological terms like “agent.” This would not be a concession to anything but common sense.

Something similar can happen with artificial intelligence.","What is the moral of this tale? Most importantly, that those who interact and socialize with artificial agents, without knowing (or caring) how they “really work” internally, will develop distinctive relationships with them and ascribe to them those mental qualities appropriate for their relationships. Gloria plays with Robbie and loves him as a companion; he cares for her in return. There is an interpretive dance that Gloria engages in with Robbie, and Robbie’s internal operations and constitution are of no relevance to it. When the opportunity to learn such details arises, further evidence of Robbie’s functionality (after it saves Gloria from an accident) distracts and prevents Gloria from learning anymore.
Philosophically speaking, “Robbie” teaches us that in ascribing a mind to another being, we are not making a statement about the kind of thing it is, but rather, revealing how deeply we understand how it works. For instance, Gloria thinks Robbie is intelligent, but her parents think they can reduce its seemingly intelligent behavior to lower-level machine operations. To see this more broadly, note the converse case where we ascribe mental qualities to ourselves that we are unwilling to ascribe to programs or robots. These qualities, like intelligence, intuition, insight, creativity, and understanding, have this in common: We do not know what they are. Despite the extravagant claims often bandied about by practitioners of neuroscience and empirical psychology, and by sundry cognitive scientists, these self-directed compliments remain undefinable. Any attempt to characterize one employs the other (“true intelligence requires insight and creativity” or “true understanding requires insight and intuition”) and engages in, nay requires, extensive hand waving.
But even if we are not quite sure what these qualities are or what they bottom out in, whatever the mental quality, the proverbial “educated layman” is sure that humans have it and machines like robots do not—even if machines act like we do, producing those same products that humans do, and occasionally replicating human feats that are said to require intelligence, ingenuity, or whatever else. Why? Because, like Gloria’s parents, we know (thanks to being informed by the system’s creators in popular media) that “all they are doing is [table lookup / prompt completion / exhaustive search of solution spaces].” Meanwhile, the mental attributes we apply to ourselves are so vaguely defined, and our ignorance of our mental operations so profound (currently), that we cannot say “human intuition (insight or creativity) is just [fill in the blanks with banal physical activity].”
Current debates about artificial intelligence, then, proceed the way they do because whenever we are confronted with an “artificial intelligence,” one whose operations we (think we) understand, it is easy to quickly respond: “All this artificial agent does is X.” This reductive description demystifies its operations, and we are therefore sure it is not intelligent (or creative or insightful). In other words, those beings or things whose internal, lower-level operations we understand and can point to and illuminate, are merely operating according to known patterns of banal physical operations. Those seemingly intelligent entities whose internal operations we do not understand are capable of insight and understanding and creativity. (Resemblance to humans helps too; we more easily deny intelligence to animals that do not look like us.)
But what if, like Gloria, we did not have such knowledge of what some system or being or object or extraterrestrial is doing when it produces its apparently “intelligent” answers? What qualities would we ascribe to it to make sense of what it is doing? This level of incomprehensibility is perhaps rapidly approaching. Witness the perplexed reactions of some ChatGPT developers to its supposedly “emergent” behavior, where no one seems to know just how ChatGPT produced the answers it did. We could, of course, insist that “all it’s doing is (some kind of) prompt completion.” But really, we could also just say about humans, “It’s just neurons firing.” But neither ChatGPT nor humans would make sense to us that way.
The evidence suggests that if we were to encounter a sufficiently complicated and interesting entity that appears intelligent, but we do not know how it works and cannot utter our usual dismissive line, “All x does is y,” we would start using the language of “folk psychology” to govern our interactions with it, to understand why it does what it does, and importantly, to try to predict its behavior. By historical analogy, when we did not know what moved the ocean and the sun, we granted them mental states. (“The angry sea believes the cliffs are its mortal foes.” Or “The sun wants to set quickly.”) Once we knew how they worked, thanks to our growing knowledge of the physical sciences, we demoted them to purely physical objects. (A move with disastrous environmental consequences!) Similarly, once we lose our grasp on the internals of artificial intelligence systems, or grow up with them, not knowing how they work, we might ascribe minds to them too. This is a matter of pragmatic decision, not discovery. For that might be the best way to understand why and what they do.
This should prompt us to look a little closer. For, come to think of it, how do I know that other humans have minds like mine? Roughly: They look like me, they act like me, and so, I reason that they must have minds like mine, which work the way I think mine does. (This is an entirely reasonable inference to the best possible explanation for their visible, external behavior.) We never, though, open the brains of other human beings to check for minds, because we would not know what to look for. More to the point, we know what we would see: a brain, and we do not know how those work. Our intentionality, our understanding, is mysterious too when viewed at this lower level of description. And so, because we cannot find physical correlates of our intelligence, and even if we did, we would find using them too cumbersome in dealing with intelligent humans, we instead observe how human beings behave and act, and how they conform to psychological generalizations. If someone wants to get into medical school, and they believe that studying hard will help them do so, then we can predict that they may be found in a library, studying away diligently. That is what “normal, intelligent” human beings do. This is the interpretive dance we engage in with humans; the language of psychology emerges from these interactions. It is how we make sense of our fellow humans.
This means that our fellow humans, too, are entities whose complex and poorly understood innards do not allow us to explain, predict, and understand their interactions with us in terms of their physical composition and properties (the way we can with objects like stones or glass bottles) or in terms of their design properties (the way we can with aircraft or mechanical pencils). Because we must use higher-level psychological explanations, the best way to make sense of human beings’ behavior is to anthropomorphize them! That is, the best way to make sense of these other beings distinct from me (other “humans”) is to treat them as if they were just like me in kind. The crucial point here is that I did not have to regard other human beings as being like me. I could have perhaps regarded them as curious aliens who happen to resemble me and act like me but were not really like me in some “important, crucial” sense, because I did not have conclusive proof that they had internal lives and minds like mine. Instead, we choose to anthropomorphize humans, because doing so makes interactions with them more tractable, a situation preferable to enduring a solipsistic existence, convinced that our mind is the only one that existed.
This philosophical analysis matters because there is an important balancing act we must engage in when thinking about legal regulation of artificial intelligence research: We want the technical advantages and social benefits of artificial intelligence (such as the amazing predictions of protein structures produced by AlphaFold), so we want their designers to continue developing such systems. But these companies need liability cover—like the railways were provided by the Supreme Court in their fledgling days—otherwise, the designers of artificial intelligence systems would stay out of such a potentially financially risky arena. But we want society to be protected too from the negative effects of such smart programs, especially if they take actions that are not anticipated—which, of course, is also their desirable functionality.
So, in legal and economic terms, we need to appropriately allocate risk and liability. One way to do so builds upon this revised understanding of artificial intelligence. When we have a conceptual sense that the artificial agents we interact with are agents in the psychological sense—that is, we understand their actions as being caused by their beliefs and desires—it will allow us to consider these systems as the legal representatives (the legal agents) of those who develop and deploy them. Much as hospitals employ doctors who act on behalf of the hospitals, whose acts the hospital is liable for, who can sign contracts and take actions on the behalf of the hospital. (The legal system does not, strictly, have to wait for such a conceptual understanding to be in place before deeming artificial agents to be legal agents, but broader social acceptance of such regulations will be easier if such conceptual understanding is widespread.) They would then be the legal agents of their legal principals—for example, the Bing chatbot would be the legal agent of its principal, Microsoft. Then, the principal is liable for their actions and consequences—as we, the broader public, would want—but only within the scope of duty which their developers and deployers would want. For instance, a driver for a public transport company is liable for things he does on the job but not off it. Transit companies can hire drivers, then, knowing that they are justifiably liable for their actions on the job, but they are protected from their employees when they “go rogue” off the job. Similarly, say a custom version of Bing, purchased by a customer to provide expert guidance on pricing, would be liable for the advice it provides on pricing, but if a customer were to use it for another task, say advising on finding suitable romantic partners, Microsoft would no longer be liable for any bad advice Bing may provide. For such advice would be out of the scope of its proposed duties. For another example, consider the case of Google’s Gmail agent, which scans emails for content it can use to provide advertisements to Gmail users. Google’s risible response to the charge of privacy violations is that because humans do not scan users’ emails, there is no privacy violation. This is not a defense Google could employ if its Gmail agent were to be considered its legal agent, because by law, the knowledge gained by a legal agent is directly attributed to its principal. Google’s “automation screen” thus fails because of the legal agent status of the programs it deploys. Here, our interests are protected by the legal status granted to the artificial agent. This does not diminish our rights; rather, it protects them.
Consider what we would do if extraterrestrials alighted on this planet of ours and said, “Take us to your leader!” How would we understand and describe them? What if their innards were so mysterious that our best science gave us no handle on how they functioned? We would have to function like diligent field anthropologists, looking for behavioral evidence that we could correlate with their pronouncements, and start considering the possibility that they have minds like ours. Our lawyers would have to assess the status of these beings in our social orderings and, on seeing they filled and performed important executive roles, that people had formed personal relationships with them, perhaps think about evaluating their application for citizenship and legal status seriously. An analogous situation exists today with regards to the artificial agents and programs in our midst, with a crucial difference: We have made and designed them. This familiarity is tinged with contempt, but the nature of our interpretive dance with them can and will change, depending on how mysterious we find them. The more impenetrable they become in terms of their internal operations, the more sophisticated their functioning, the more we will have to rely on external descriptions using psychological terms like “agent.” This would not be a concession to anything but common sense. And our natural intelligence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'WIRED'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AI could replace 30% of work hours by 2030 











AI could replace 30% of work hours by 2030, new research finds
06:19

Low-wage jobs in the food industry and in customer service are among the positions most likely to be eliminated by generative AI by 2030, according to a new McKinsey report. In fact, jobs that make under $38,000 a year are 14 times as likely to be eliminated by generative AI technology as other types of roles, according to Kweilin Ellingrud, director of the McKinsey Global Institute.""[Jobs] that used to be in-person and have some physical interactive element are shifting to online, remote, and we're seeing a lot more delivery jobs as well,"" Ellingrud told CBS News.  






These jobs will be replaced by devices like fast food kiosks, which enable facilities to operate a single site with far fewer employees. Customer service operations could undergo a transformation, with AI-powered chatbots creating quick, personalized responses to complex customer questions. Because generative AI can quickly retrieve data for a specific customer, it operates much faster than human sales representatives.Your next job interview could be with AI. Here's how to ace it.How job seekers are using AI to supercharge their job huntBut it's not just low-wage jobs: across the entire labor market, activities that account for 30% of hours worked across the U.S. could become automated by 2030, the report indicates. To reach that 30% mark, 12 million workers in professions with shrinking demand may need to change jobs within the next seven years.


While that may seem like a huge number, about 9 million people have shifted jobs since the pandemic, a rate that is 50% higher than before the COVID health crisis.On the other hand, most higher-wage jobs that require a college degree are also likely to be altered by AI, but not completely eliminated or automated, Ellingrud said. Such fields include STEM, creative industries and business or legal professions. For instance, a graphic designer could generate a first draft faster and better with the help of AI, and then use their specialized skills to spend their time in a more valuable way. A nurse could spend less time entering medications into a computer and spend more time with their patients. ""A lot of jobs will be made more meaningful; you'll be able to spend more time doing the things your training and skills have enabled you to uniquely do,"" Ellingrud said. 


Demand for emotional skillsGenerative AI allows skilled workers to be more productive, but employees will need to adapt to these changes by reskilling — learning how to learn new things.""We will have more jobs in the future, and those jobs will be higher wage jobs but they will require higher levels of education,"" she added.Two crucial types of skills that will be in demand are technological and social and emotional skills.Tech knowledge doesn't necessarily mean coding, but workers must be able to interact with emerging technologies to get their job done more efficiently, Ellingrud said. Social and emotional skills, such as showing empathy and genuinely responding to human reactions, are critical because ""that's one of the few things that cannot be replicated by a machine or AI as well,"" she said.

Customer service operations could undergo a transformation, with AI-powered chatbots creating quick, personalized responses to complex customer questions. Because generative AI can quickly retrieve data for a specific customer, it operates much faster than human sales representatives.Your next job interview could be with AI. Here's how to ace it.How job seekers are using AI to supercharge their job huntBut it's not just low-wage jobs: across the entire labor market, activities that account for 30% of hours worked across the U.S. could become automated by 2030, the report indicates. To reach that 30% mark, 12 million workers in professions with shrinking demand may need to change jobs within the next seven years.While that may seem like a huge number, about 9 million people have shifted jobs since the pandemic, a rate that is 50% higher than before the COVID health crisis.On the other hand, most higher-wage jobs that require a college degree are also likely to be altered by AI, but not completely eliminated or automated, Ellingrud said. Such fields include STEM, creative industries and business or legal professions. For instance, a graphic designer could generate a first draft faster and better with the help of AI, and then use their specialized skills to spend their time in a more valuable way. A nurse could spend less time entering medications into a computer and spend more time with their patients. ""A lot of jobs will be made more meaningful; you'll be able to spend more time doing the things your training and skills have enabled you to uniquely do,"" Ellingrud said. Demand for emotional skillsGenerative AI allows skilled workers to be more productive, but employees will need to adapt to these changes by reskilling — learning how to learn new things.""We will have more jobs in the future, and those jobs will be higher wage jobs but they will require higher levels of education,"" she added.Two crucial types of skills that will be in demand are technological and social and emotional skills.Tech knowledge doesn't necessarily mean coding, but workers must be able to interact with emerging technologies to get their job done more efficiently, Ellingrud said. Social and emotional skills, such as showing empathy and genuinely responding to human reactions, are critical because ""that's one of the few things that cannot be replicated by a machine or AI as well,"" she said.",,,"{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 630, 'width': 1200, 'url': 'https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/07/31/5c3ca2b6-cccd-46c5-a967-ff74c711cb27/thumbnail/1200x630/26c005eee3eac8cdfd384ac18ade1b5d/gettyimages-877079048.jpg?v=e2b758f558b9b19612f3e16bc7fd9fcc'}",https://www.cbsnews.com/,1927-09-18,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Paramount Global', '@id': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'sameAs': 'https://www.paramount.com/', 'legalName': 'Paramount Global'}",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#1d4ed2b9-ade8-4203-a4e4-115dd34c0735,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#751608ae-9468-457c-9dbe-1f9400a7f428,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#a0060f90-73b0-4a57-b756-ca7a7f26cc7d,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#5fd9a80d-2c6c-4d38-8b1e-4144650d5963,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#4ffda755-6b47-49e1-b98c-24b737906aca,https://www.paramount.com/company-history,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/#de41886e-07ed-4887-ad05-4b2c79edf857,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-publishing-principles/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rise of generative artificial intelligence has been rapid – and transformative. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been quietly working away in the background for years, with many people unaware of its prevalence in daily life. However, the arrival of generative AI models last year – notably ChatGPT – has demonstrated just how influential it can be.
Over the past few months, numerous tech companies have been rolling out new, innovative generative AI models that have the potential to make a significant impact on the way people work, marking a shift in the global labour market and economy.
The uncertainty surrounding generative AI – of displacing people from their jobs, for example – is tempered by the growing understanding of the need for companies to adapt to a new technology that is set to become more sophisticated, and more mainstream. Research by Goldman Sachs suggests the threat of worker displacement from generative AI could be counteracted by a surge in productivity that may lead to a 7 per cent increase in annual global gross domestic product.
In addition to performing administrative tasks, generative AI has the potential to assist people with formulating ideas and generating analytical texts – even facilitating creative work, empowering individuals to use their time at work more efficiently. That could lead to more innovation and increased productivity.

One of the main capabilities of generative AI is its employment of machine learning to respond to user prompts. It can function much like a personal assistant, capable of generating texts, summarising meeting transcripts, planning events and even analysing documents.
Kingsoft Office Software, an office software solution provider, is leveraging its years of experience in the field of productivity software to harness the potential of generative AI to help its clients optimise their workflow.

UPDATED: The CEO for Largo.ai, the Switzerland-based artificial intelligence company behind the “100 Actors Program,” wants to amplify the intent of the company’s latest initiative that was red-flagged by Charisma Carpenter. 

	CEO Sami Arpa said the program was only meant to be a “very narrow beta release” for 100 actors, even though they received 5,000 applications. Their hope is to make the tool more public after they complete this initial “experiment.” 

	Carpenter flagged the program on social media last week after receiving a random email from Largo.ai that promised “direct connections with producers and directors (by) allowing you to receive auditions directly from them.” It also said Largo.ai “will automatically suggest matching characters to producers/directors” and “you won’t be charged any commission for the roles you secure.”

					Casting Directors React To Complaints About Fewer Roles: ""All My Friends Are Actors And They're Panicked""		
			






	Carpenter’s fear was that the program would essentially erase the role of casting directors, as well as agents and managers. 

	“Largo.AI is in full support of the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strike, this company was developed to empower and support creators through the power of technology, and not utilize AI to replace anyone,” Arpa wrote to Deadline. “Although we are known for our tools in helping both independent and established filmmakers develop their unique projects and retain their IP ownership – we launched our actors’ program only a few short months ago exclusively and are still developing during this beta process – this experience has shown us a certain misinterpretation within the acting community. We will use this as a learning tool for growth. Our mission is to provide more access and creation of job opportunities for both actors and   are not involved in Deepfake creation or any unauthorized use of actors’ performances or voices, our AI tools are totally different here. Our platform is dedicated to empowering actors, providing enhanced visibility and making AI as a part of the preliminary casting process.”



	“There are assertions suggesting that our aim is to replace all industry professionals with automation,” he continued. “However, one must consider who would then be our clients then? In reality, we actively collaborate with industry professionals such as producers, distributors, studios, and actors. Furthermore, we are keen on establishing partnerships with casting directors, and talent agencies. Our objective is to integrate the tools into their work, enhancing their capabilities with innovative technology. Using correctly, AI tools can collectively help us to make the industry better altogether, and create much more job opportunities. Our system diversifies opportunities beyond industry averages, often uncovers lesser-known talents, thus creating opportunities for those who might otherwise be overlooked. We encourage actors and industry members to contact us, share their perspectives, and engage in an open dialogue.”

	










PREVIOUSLY, July 24: There’s not much about the self-tape audition process that Charisma Carpenter likes. There’s hardly any feedback. There are no do-overs. And if she’s not paying a coach to read with her, she’s having to rely on friends in her midwestern town. 

	But she would choose that scenario — however flawed the new reality may be — than rely on artificial intelligence to help her find a job. So when she received a random email to join Largo.ai’s “100 Actors Program,” she waved the red flag on social media just as fellow SAG-AFTRA members were hitting the picket lines to fight for AI protections. 

	The email from a salesperson at the Switzerland-based Largo.ai promised “direct connections with producers and directors (by) allowing you to receive auditions directly from them.” It also said Largo.ai “will automatically suggest matching characters to producers/directors” and “you won’t be charged any commission for the roles you secure.” 

	“Welp, AI is coming for Casting Directors, Agents and Managers too,” Carpenter wrote on her Instagram account. “Seen as intermediaries.’ AI protections across the board! ✊”




	One of the actors who responded to Carpenter’s post was Yellowjackets’ Melanie Lynskey, who wrote “having ‘intermediaries’ who believe in you and think of you for those roles that might not seem 100% right for you but they know you can do it, is how an actor builds a career. This is nuts.”

	Reached by Deadline, Carpenter called the AI casting process “ridiculous” and insisted that “AI is not a belief system.” “They may take data and statistics and spit out a formula that says this person is right for this part, but there’s no foresight,” continues the actress best known for her work on Angel and Dynasty. “AI doesn’t know me, they don’t know the richness of my soul. They don’t know my life experiences. They don’t know the books I’ve read. They’ve never had those conversations with me to glean how right I am for a part that maybe data would not foresee.”

	The Casting Society declined to comment on AI casting, but a spokesperson pointed to a recent Reddit thread suggesting that it’s a possible scam. It’s not, insists CEO Sami Arpa of Largo.ai, which also has a “presence in Los Angeles, London, and Istanbul,” according to its website.

	“We can see that current reactions are quite superficial by positioning the overall AI as a direct enemy, by casting directors or voice actors,” Arpa wrote to Deadline. “Our system has nothing to do with both. Largo.ai has been mainly created for producers, studios and distributors, and many of them are already using our platform since 2019. The main goal of our platform is analyzing the content as early as the development stage from the screenplays, and provide feedback to the producers on the story, casting, and potential audience together with expected financial results.”

	“Our system is not destroying any jobs as claimed in some of those Instagram posts, which are people who do not have any idea on the platform,” Arpa continued via email. “For the casting part, the system has proposed more than 100K actors to the producers completely free of charge during past 4 years. Our new system for Actors is just an additional system that we released for actors, after getting the demand from many actors. Because our AI was already proposing the actors to the producers automatically based on their previous credits during the past 4 years, and we were getting requests if we could provide option for them to connect with the producers directly in such a connection done by the AI. That is how we started this additional service in a narrow & experimental way for the actors.”

	










	Carpenter has zero interest in exploring what Largo.ai has to offer. After she posted on IG, fans referred to it as “scary” while actor Jordan Gavaris (The Lake) called it “absolute lunacy.” “The only reason I’ve ever had a job is because casting championed me for amorphous reasons,” Gavaris wrote. “AI will never be a fan.”

	“I have had wonderful casting directors that have brought me back time and time again to get me employed,” she tells Deadline. “I really am hard pressed to see what the advantage is to actors going this route.”

Old phogie I guess

This idea smacks of huge group interviews for fast food, baristas, big box stores, etc…except that these auditions/ interviews/casting calls aren’t even giving the actors , producers and any other people involved in industry decision making the opportunity for face to face meetings of any kind. So many actors have worked in the above named fields, or are still working in these fields, to know what I’m talking about. This is NOT the way to decide who should fill any role in the film or television industry! They either have, or still doing their time in these jobs and have worked their asses off to get to the point of auditioning. They deserve so much more respect than this kind of thing could even hope to offer. It needs to stop before it’s even had the chance to start. It’s a slippery slope and is bound to continue sliding into more and more dehumanizing in these industries.

This company is a bunch of techies who have no experience as real producers. They don’t understand our work, or the market and they act as if they do. These are the mistakes they make. They got money from the Swiss government to launch this and have a platform that charges producers for a system unfit for purpose.









					Bravo

It would seem that this system is very democratic and favorable to actors. 
Everybody wants inclusivity. Well, here it is. 
Casting directors can be highly biased, preferring certain types of actors, even for unconscious reasons. New actors are desperate to get to casting directors, and producers don’t really care about the prior history of an actor if they can deliver the performance and have the look. 
So this is a good thing. casting directors may become albatrosses, but that happens with all new technology. However, it will be good for producers to get the best selection, and Actors to get a fair shot. 
Hopefully, this will occur soon for screenplay writers who can circumvent all the readers and executives who are varied in their ability to discern what is a commercial screenplay.

I totally agree. 
Largo, please soon start a sevice where writers can submit scripts for a moderate fee to be evaluated as to the commerciality on a point system, with the results available to Producers and Studios and financiers and actors and directors for their evaluation and acquisition.

It literally says “eliminating intermediaries” lol. It’s whole purpose is to eliminate casting directors and agents/managers

Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) joined the writers in strike this month, marking the first time in more than 60 years that both unions have staged a walkout.Amid battling with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) for better pay, the WGA and SAG-AFTRA are seeking reassurance that artificial intelligence won't replace humans in creative roles. Artificial intelligence has been a massive point of contention in the negotiations, as the AMPTP has refused to rule out its role in content creation. The AMPTP comprises major studios Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Warner Bros., NBC Universal, Sony and Paramount.Some studios have listed lucrative job postings in the artificial intelligence sector as writers and actors&mdash;eighty-seven percent of the guild's 170,000-plus performers earn no more than $26,000 a year, according to the guild&mdash;demand better pay. One such listing from Netflix advertising a salary of up to $900,000 came to light during the strike.The job posting is for a product manager in the machine learning platform sector and described artificial intelligence as ""powering innovation in all areas of the business.""The description went on to say that machine learning and artificial intelligence help Netflix ""buy and create great content.""""Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence is powering innovation in all areas of business. From helping us buy and create great content, helping members choose the right title for them through personalization, to optimizing our payment processing and other revenue-focused initiatives,"" the description read.However, Netflix has since changed the description in regard to artificial intelligence. The updated description is considerably shorter, eliminating the line about content creation and focusing instead on the role of artificial intelligence in Netflix viewer personalization. The updated posting also doesn't include the line about artificial intelligence ""powering innovation in all areas of the business.""""Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence is powering innovation, from personalization for members, to optimizing our payment processing and other revenue focused initiatives,"" the updated post reads.The job is based out of Netflix's Los Gatos, California, office.Newsweek reached out to Netflix by email for comment.Ken Klippenstein, a journalist at online news website The Intercept who first reported on the position, shared before-and-after screenshots of the job posting on Twitter last Thursday.""Netflix updated their $900,000 AI job posting to remove mention of the AI being used for content creation following my article,"" Klippenstein tweeted.The tweet has been viewed more than 259,000 times as 11:30 a.m. ET Monday.The ongoing strikes by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA have sidelined many Hollywood projects, causing popular late-night shows to go off the air. The release dates for countless movies, including the third installment in the Avatar series and a slew of Marvel films, have been delayed.George R.R. Martin, author of the A Song of Fire and Ice book series that inspired the hit HBO series Game of Thrones, called the strike ""the most important of my lifetime"" in a blog post written this month. Some of his projects have been sidelined by the strike, although Game of Thrones spinoff House of the Dragon is still shooting.However, tensions are still taut between the AMPTP, the WGA and the SAG-AFTRA.In a statement shared with Newsweek, representatives of AMPTP said that the trade association ""presented a deal that offered historic pay and residual increases, substantially higher caps on pension and health contributions, audition protections, shortened series option periods, and a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors' digital likenesses for SAG-AFTRA members.""A strike is certainly not the outcome we hoped for as studios cannot operate without the performers that bring our TV shows and films to life. The Union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lot of representatives accept generative Artificial intelligence will assist them with working quicker; coordinating data from various sources quicker than expected; furthermore, and diminish time spent on troublesome, exhausting, or monotonous work. Almost as many say generative Artificial intelligence will assist them with accomplishing more work (89%) and making better quality work (88%) — and 9 out of 10 business pioneers studied say something very similar..3. Business Pioneers View Reception and Utilization of Generative AI as Unavoidable:.Almost four out of five (79%) business pioneers expect their representatives will utilize generative simulated intelligence frequently in their work, with 39% expecting representatives will utilize generative Artificial intelligence consistently..Most worldwide business pioneers (76%) say their organizations are prepared to take on generative Artificial intelligence in their work processes. Of the general 25% of pioneers who say they're not ready to embrace the innovation, almost 33% (35%) say they either don't have the right security, protection, and trust guardrails set up, or they don't have the foggiest idea about how to utilize or convey the innovation successfully (34%)..Improving Human Potential and Efficiency:.As generative artificial intelligence turns out to be more normal, we're hearing reestablished worries that simulated intelligence will supplant human specialists. While there's no question that generative artificial intelligence is as of now altogether changing how we work, when applied nicely it doesn't supplant people but instead intensifies both representative efficiency and commitment..Opening knowledge:.While the shift from simple to computerized has made data more accessible and open than at any other time, it has likewise brought a pound of data that is a lot for the greater part of us to retain, not to mention use. For organizations, the test is increased across gigantic stores of chronicled archives from which they get almost no worth. At one drug organization, which stores a large number of PDF records containing basic exploration and other data, that's what a pioneer remarked: &quot;It's almost certain the remedy for malignant growth is in that information, however, we don't have a proficient method for tracking down it.&quot; Generative man-made intelligence will at long last engage each representative and each organization to give the knowledge in their archives something to do..Customizing Work Encounters:.One of the most thrilling uses of generative simulated intelligence in the working environment will be empowering more customized work encounters. Today, practically every arrangement conveys one-size-fits-all reactions given text prompts. Going ahead, a generative simulated intelligence specialist will have a background marked by working with every individual worker — and will persistently be prepared by everyone from a favored pool of data. These specialists will go about as strong individual partners and become better at addressing representatives' requirements, both in speed and in results that are really custom fitted to their necessities and work..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Against the backdrop of this excitement is apprehension over how AI will impact certain human jobs. Over the last few weeks, more data has emerged, offering a look into that impact.



In a survey of more than 200 marketing professionals from agencies, business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies, nonprofits, and publishers, 11.5% C-Suite and VPs stated they either already replaced human employees with generative AI or had plans in progress to do so, according to a report from ad platform Basis Technologies, which sells automation software. 



“I am a bit surprised with that number because we’re still in the early stages of this [technology],” said Katie Risch, CMO at Basis Technologies. 



AI Policies From Agency Holding Groups Help Win Clients and Score Major Partnerships



The report also found that 10.4% of marketers say their organization has replaced human tasks with AI solutions in the last 12 months.



For agencies, the excitement around AI has led to creating task forces and steering groups to help better serve clients. Despite the hype, not all marketers have fully embraced it. Brand safety concerns and fears of diminished brand authenticity have made some marketers cautious. Analysts assume job losses from generative AI over the next two years will be modest until questions around copyright, plagiarism, bias, ethics and accuracy are resolved.



Elsewhere, a recent report by Forrester predicted some 33,000 ad agency jobs, amounting to 7.5% of the total agency workforce, will be replaced by AI by 2030. And nearly one-third of the losses, or 11,000 jobs, will be linked to generative AI. 



The primary jobs at risk of replacement are clerical, secretarial, and administrative jobs (28% of losses), sales jobs (22%), and market research (18%), per Forrester.





Generative AI will have the most impact on scalable creative tasks, such as copywriting or photo production, said Wesley ter Haar, co-founder of MediaMonks. 



Most people agree that AI technologies will not completely replace human jobs. Instead, people must embrace and incorporate this technology into their workflows. That could inevitably lead to smaller team sizes.



""Marketers using AI will replace marketers not using AI,"" said Vincent Spruyt, chief AI officer at IPG's Mediabrands. 



Omnicom Group is already looking at replacing mundane tasks with automation. While the agency is not aiming for headcount reduction, it is exploring possibilities of generative AI to create new content, encompassing both text and images, according to the report by Forrester.



Categories most impacted by generative AI



The Basis Technologies survey found that 54.5% of marketers foresee most use cases of generative AI within content creation, like creating new blog posts, social copy or writing email templates.  



Given AI’s propensity for pattern recognition and data processing, processes such as analysis (13.9%), creative optimization (12.9%), and even media buying (8.9%) will significantly be impacted by generative AI.





More than half (52.5%) of marketers said generative AI is used to assist in drafting content, while nearly as many (48.5%) said they use it for brainstorming.



However, 70% of marketers believe people will find a brand less authentic if it uses AI-generated content in its marketing efforts.



This comes as a significant downside at a time when brand authenticity is valuable currency among younger people.



“Marketers are concerned that the content coming out of [large language] models won’t be unique,” said Risch. “Because it becomes an aggregator of all of the information that it’s scraping across the internet.”





Not all marketers are sold on generative AI



According to the survey, 28% of marketers revealed their organizations do not utilize generative AI in any capacity.



Meanwhile, among marketers who do use generative AI, the survey found a low daily usage rate of 11%, while 72% reported using generative AI tools at least once a month.





Apart from brand authenticity concerns and fear of job loss, marketers have recognized brand safety threats associated with generative AI. And 99.5% of respondents agreed that this technology poses risks for digital marketers.



In response to these challenges, Risch said that marketers may consider hiring professionals who embrace these tools and have found a way to improve the way they work using generative AI.","{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'How GenAI Is Impacting Human Jobs Across the Ad Industry', 'url': 'https://www.adweek.com/media/how-genai-is-impacting-human-jobs-across-the-ad-industry/', 'datePublished': '2023-07-27T06:00:00-04:00', 'articleBody': 'The advertising industry is increasingly adopting generative AI to improve workflow and save time on mundane tasks, albeit at uneven rates.

           Accelerated adoption of AI could automate 30% of Americans’ work hours: McKinsey Accelerated adoption of artificial intelligence could result in the automation of about 30% of hours worked by Americans in 2030, a report found  Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By  Eric Revell  FOXBusiness     close   Which industries are most at risk because of artificial intelligence? Zeta Global [NYSE: ZETA] CEO David Steinberg gives his take on AI taking human jobs on ‘Making Money.’ Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology may reshape the U.S. workforce by the end of the decade as companies increasingly adopt AI tools to help automate tasks that consume nearly one-third of Americans’ workweeks, according to a new report. The McKinsey Global Institute on Wednesday released a report on ""Generative AI and the future of work in America"" that found that advances in AI have the potential to accelerate automation in the economy.""Without generative AI, our research estimated, automation could take over tasks accounting for 21.5 percent of the hours worked in the U.S. economy by 2030,"" the report said. ""With it, that share has now jumped to 29.5 percent."" TWO-THIRDS OF US JOBS COULD BE EXPOSED TO AI-DRIVEN AUTOMATION: GOLDMAN SACHS      Accelerated adoption of artificial intelligence could result in the automation of about 30% of hours worked by Americans in 2030. (iStock / iStock)Several occupations were identified by the McKinsey report as being positioned to see a greater share of automated work hours with the aid of AI.Professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields would see the percentage of their automated work hours jump by 16 points to 30% by 2030 because of accelerated AI adoption. Education and workforce training professionals would also see a 16% increase, although those fields had a lower automation baseline without AI acceleration. So, AI-guided automation would only account for about 23% of those professionals’ hours worked in 2030. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?     The McKinsey Global Institute report finds that demand for labor in some professions may decline by 2030 due to automation accelerated by AI even if those sectors don't see net job losses. (iStock / iStock)Other job categories with notable increases include creatives and arts management, which would see a 15-point jump to about 25% of hours worked, in addition to business and legal professionals, who would see a 14-point increase to 30% of hours worked.Areas in which generative AI is projected to have a smaller impact on automating workers’ tasks over the rest of the decade include agricultural work, which would see only a 3% automation increase, while production workers and health and wellness technicians would see a 4% increase, according to the report. AI TECHNOLOGY UNLIKELY TO FULLY REPLACE FINANCIAL ADVISERS: MORNINGSTARAgriculture and production work roles have high automation baselines of 27% and 30%, respectively, as starting points – although health technicians are at roughly 15%, according to the report.Across all sectors of the economy, American workers are projected to see an additional 8% of their work hours automated by 2030 with the acceleration of generative AI, bringing the total of automated work hours to about 30%.     Agriculture work is one field that's less likely to see an increase in automation due to AI in part because the industry is already relatively highly automated. (Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images)As for whether the widespread adoption of AI will lead to the elimination of a significant number of jobs, the McKinsey report noted, ""Our research does not lead us to estimate job losses, although we cannot definitively rule out that conclusion, at least in the short term. Technological advances often cause disruption — but historically, they have eventually fueled economic and employment growth.""Customer service and sales, in addition to office support roles were the occupations the report found were most likely to see decreasing labor demand and a modest change of work activities due to AI. To a lesser degree, food services and production work were also identified as fields where labor demand would likely decline due to automation accelerated by AI.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREEven as demand for labor in certain fields declines, the report found that those declines could manifest themselves in terms of slower overall growth in those fields rather than net declines between now and 2030.""While we do not predict aggregate employment levels ourselves, we do model various drivers of labor demand to look at how the mix of jobs might change – and those results yield some gains and some losses,"" the report noted. ""In fact, the occupational categories most exposed to generative AI could continue to add jobs through 2030, although its adoption may slow their rate of growth.""

Across all sectors of the economy, American workers are projected to see an additional 8% of their work hours automated by 2030 with the acceleration of generative AI, bringing the total of automated work hours to about 30%.  As for whether the widespread adoption of AI will lead to the elimination of a significant number of jobs, the McKinsey report noted, &quot;Our research does not lead us to estimate job losses, although we cannot definitively rule out that conclusion, at least in the short term. Technological advances often cause disruption &#x2014; but historically, they have eventually fueled economic and employment growth.&quot; Customer service and sales, in addition to office support roles were the occupations the report found were most likely to see decreasing labor demand and a modest change of work activities due to AI. To a lesser degree, food services and production work were also identified as fields where labor demand would likely decline due to automation accelerated by AI. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Even as demand for labor in certain fields declines, the report found that those declines could manifest themselves in terms of slower overall growth in those fields rather than net declines between now and 2030. &quot;While we do not predict aggregate employment levels ourselves, we do model various drivers of labor demand to look at how the mix of jobs might change &#x2013; and those results yield some gains and some losses,&quot; the report noted.&#xA0; &quot;In fact, the occupational categories most exposed to generative AI could continue to add jobs through 2030, although its adoption may slow their rate of growth.&quot;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PT4M34S,,,,,,,,,,,https://vod.foxbusiness.com/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/854081161001/eca6cb1e-298c-4c91-8e3a-53277594fd5c/3cc16157-4df9-4cf1-b530-cfa570db2e43/main.mp4,2023-07-06T15:10:59-04:00,"['https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358562234112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358553809112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358551871112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358540547112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358439692112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358319648112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358318778112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6358171086112', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/apple-hits-all-time-high-morgan-stanley-touts-stock-top-pick-ai', 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6357762789112']"

And for many rural Indians like her, an Indian startup's app is no less than a revolution.How An App Is Transforming Village People's Lives                        timeUnlike her teaching job, which gives her nearly the same salary at the end of the month, the app doesn’t make Chandrika wait that long. The money lands in her bank account in just a few hours after her work is done. By just reading text aloud in her native language of Kannada, spoken by around 60 million people mostly in central and southern India, Chandrika has used this app to earn an hourly wage of about Rs 400. And in a few days, more money will arrive—a 50% bonus, awarded once the voice clips are validated as accurate, as per the TIME report.All thanks to artificial intelligence, Chandrika’s voice can fetch this money. As AI tools such as ChatGPT currently work best in languages like English, they work much less well in languages like Kannada, which is spoken by millions of people.This has created huge demand for datasets—collections of text or voice data—in languages spoken by some of the poorest people in the world. Part of that demand comes from tech companies seeking to build out their AI tools. Another big chunk comes from academia and governments, especially in India, where English and Hindi have long held outsize precedence in a nation of some 1.4 billion people with 22 official languages and at least 780 more indigenous ones. This rising demand means that hundreds of millions of Indians are suddenly in control of a scarce and newly valuable asset: their mother tongue.Indian AI Startup Helping The Poor                        karyaTo solve this, one Indian startup is testing a new model in the villages, for which Chandrika works too. It is for Karya, a non-profit startup launched in 2021 in Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) that bills itself as “the world’s first ethical data company.”  The startup Karya already has a list of high-profile clients, including Microsoft, MIT, and Stanford. While it sells data to big tech companies and other clients at the market rate just like its competitors, instead of keeping much of that cash as profit, it covers its costs and funnels the rest towards the rural poor in India.(Karya partners with local NGOs to ensure access to its jobs goes first to the poorest of the poor, as well as historically marginalised communities.) In addition to its $5 hourly minimum, Karya gives workers de facto ownership of the data they create on the job, so whenever it is resold, the workers receive the proceeds on top of their past wages. It’s a model that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the industry.The work Karya is doing also means that millions of people whose languages are marginalised online could stand to gain better access to the benefits of technology—including AI. ""Most people in the villages don’t know English,"" says Vinutha, a 23-year-old student who has used Karya to reduce her financial reliance on her parents. ""If a computer could understand Kannada, that would be very helpful.""""The wages that exist right now are a failure of the market,"" Manu Chopra, the 27-year-old CEO of Karya, said, as per a TIME report. ""We decided to be a nonprofit because, fundamentally, you can’t solve a market failure in the market.""The catch, if you can call it that, is that the work is supplementary. The first thing Karya tells its workers is: This is not a permanent job, but rather a way to quickly get an income boost that will allow you to go on and do other things. The maximum a worker can earn through the app is the equivalent of $1,500 (about Rs 1.2 lakh), roughly the average annual income in India. After that point, they make way for somebody else.

By 2030, Chopra wants it to reach 100 million. ""I genuinely feel this is the quickest way to move millions of people out of poverty if done right,"" says Chopra, who was born into poverty and won a scholarship to Stanford that changed his trajectory. ""This is absolutely a social project. Wealth is power. And we want to redistribute wealth to the communities that have been left behind.""Also, just 70 miles from the bustling tech metropolis of Bengaluru, is the village of Chilukavadi. Inside a low concrete building, the headquarters of a local farming cooperative, a dozen men and women are gathered—all of whom have started working for Karya within the past week. Kanakaraj S., a skinny 21-year-old, sits cross-legged on the cool concrete floor. He is studying at a nearby college, and to pay for books and transport costs, he occasionally works as a casual labourer in the surrounding fields. A day’s work can earn him Rs 350, but this kind of manual labour is becoming more unbearable as climate change makes summers here even more sweltering than usual. Working in a factory in a nearby city would mean a slightly higher wage, but it would also mean hours of daily commuting on unreliable and expensive buses or, worse, moving away from his support network to live in dormitory accommodation in the city.At Karya, Kanakaraj can earn more in an hour than he makes in a day in the fields. ""The work is good,"" he says. ""And easy."" Chopra says that’s a typical refrain when he meets villagers.""They’re happy we pay them well,"" he says, but more importantly, ""it’s that it’s not hard work. It’s not physical work."" Kanakaraj was surprised when he saw the first payment land in his bank account. ""We’ve lost a lot of money from scams,"" he said, explaining that it is common for villagers to receive SMS texts preying on their desperation, offering to multiply any deposits they make by 10. When somebody first told him about Karya, he assumed it was a similar con—a common initial response, according to Chopra.A Microsoft Researcher Is A Member Of The Startup                        time“The hope is that efforts like the ones Karya is enabling will help Indian-language AI projects learn from the mistakes of English AIs and begin from a far more reliable and unbiased starting point, the TIME report mentioned.“Until not so long ago, a speech-recognition engine for English would not even understand my English,” says Kalika Bali, a linguist and principal researcher at Microsoft Research who is working with the Gates Foundation on the project and is an unpaid member of Karya’s oversight board, referring to her accent. “What is the point of AI technologies being out there if they do not cater to the users they are targeting?”For the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth.
