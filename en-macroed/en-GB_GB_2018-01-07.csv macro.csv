We are living in interesting times, where digital assistants schedule meetings, chatbots work alongside humans as teaching assistants, and your suitcase can now become self driving luggage as showcased at CES, 2018.  The implications are just starting to be felt in the workplace. In 2017, I wrote about how The Employee Experience is the Future of Work. Now, as we enter 2018, the next journey for HR leaders will be to leverage artificial intelligence combined with human intelligence and create a more personalized employee experience.

Artificial Intelligence Is Transforming The Workplace 
As we increase our personal usage of chatbots (defined as software which provides an automated, yet personalized, conversation between itself and human users), employees will soon interact with them in the workplace as well. Forward looking HR leaders are piloting chatbots now to transform HR, and, in the process, re-imagine, re-invent, and re-tool the employee experience.
How does all of this impact HR in your organization? The following ten HR trends will matter most as AI enters the workplace:
1. Expect Humans To Work Along Side Artificial Intelligence
PROMOTED
My Forbes column, The Intersection of AI and HR  profiled three chatbots: Talla, Jane, and Jill Watson, and examined how artificial intelligence is working side by side with HR managers and teaching assistants. This was reinforced by a new Gartner report, predicting that  one in five workers will have AI as their co worker in 2022. 

At Georgia Institute of Technology, this is business as usual. Last year, Jill Watson, powered by IBM Watson analytics, became the ninth teaching assistant for an online course taught by Professor Ashok Goel entitled Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence. Professor Goel estimates that within a year, Jill Watson was able to answer 40% of all the students’ questions, freeing the human TAs to tackle more complex technical inquiries, such as, ""How do you define intelligence?"" In fact, one student reported, ""Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA, always there reminding us of due dates and posting questions to engage us mid-week, I find out she is a chatbot. I was flabbergasted.""
This is just the beginning as AI becomes a new member of the team. And visionary HR leaders will increasingly consider chatbots  another co-worker, helping to orient and train them, and assisting the rest of the team  in understanding how to work with them. The end result will be more time for employees to do what makes them uniquely human such as;  complex problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity, the top three skills deemed essential By the World Economic Forum.

2. Identify Which Roles On Your Team Will Be Transformed By AI 
McKinsey research finds very few occupations will be automated in their entirety, rather certain activities will be re-defined requiring business processes and job roles to change. 
In fact, according the McKinsey Global Institute,  fewer than 5 percent of occupations can be entirely automated using current technology. However, 60 percent of occupations could have 30 percent or more of their activities automated.
We are already seeing this in some key roles like mortgage loan officers, where key activities are being automated so mortgage loan officers can spend more time advising clients and providing other higher levels of customer service. The same will hold for key roles in HR like Recruiter, Training Coordinator, and HR Service Center Advisor, among others, where AI will automate routine work activities and amplify work processes allowing individuals in these roles to provide greater value to their internal customers--employees.
But the key will be for HR to develop an AI strategy and this starts by conducting research on what HR roles, processes, and workflows will be re-imagined with AI.
Figure 1 presents one way to begin thinking about the implications of AI on work tasks, key job roles, and work processes. You can start this process by asking:
Automate: What are the key activities within this role that could be automated to provide greater efficiency and effectiveness for accomplishing routine tasks?
Augment: How could more value be created by applying data analytics to identify new business insights?
Amplify: What work processes and workflows could be re-designed by machine learning?










 More job roles will change than will be become totally automated so HR needs to prepare today.
3. Transform Talent Acquisition With Artificial Intelligence
The most visible aspect of how HR is being impacted by artificial intelligence is the change in the way companies source and recruit new hires. Most notably, IBM has created a suite of tools that use machine learning to help candidates personalize their job search experience based on the engagement they have with Watson. In addition, Watson is helping recruiters prioritize jobs more efficiently, find talent faster, and match candidates more effectively. According to Amber Grewal, Vice President, Global Talent Acquisition, ""Recruiters are focusing more on identifying the most critical jobs in the business and on utilizing data to assist in talent sourcing.""
With the benefit of Watson, companies can empower recruiters to concentrate more on filling placements based on critical ""core"" skills needed across the company, such as agile, cognitive, and cloud, rather than simply screening candidates on filters like “years of experience” or specific education levels. Grewal calls this, horizontal sourcing, and sees it as the end of the requisition based sourcing model. As organizations become flatter, there is a growing need to identify talent with core, horizontal skills that can easily move across various business verticals, domains, and industries. This is truly reinventing the recruiting function.
4. Use Machine Learning to Help Employees Navigate Their Careers 
As employees stay in their roles longer, companies are leveraging machine learning to create internal career mobility platforms so employees can focus on career growth and not just promotions.
CEB Global estimates that employees at all levels are staying in their roles up to 30% longer today. This slow down in upward mobility  is causing employers such as Cisco, GE and Panasonic to take a more active role in partnering with employees to prioritize growing career experiences over the rate of promotion.
Elaine Mason, Vice President of People Planning Design and Analytics at Cisco, is leading an effort to create an internal career mobility platform so Cisco employees can ""choose their own adventure."" The platform, called My Development Space, uses machine learning so employees can build a profile showcasing their current skills, interests, and passions, and then view a range of internal roles that might be right for their next career opportunity. ""Our objective at Cisco is to create a career focused culture where employees are able to grow their capabilities through a series of lateral and vertical moves across silos and functions. The goal of My Development Space is to increase employee retention, grow employees' skills, and prepare them for both horizontal and upward positions.""
5. Hack HR To Identify New HR Solutions 
A hackathon is an event where computer programmers, software designers, graphic artists, and others come together to create a new product. The Facebook “Like” button and Facebook Chat were both first demoed at internal Facebook hackathons.
HR functions are now using the hackathon concept to identify new HR solutions. The Talent Experience team at Jet.com, a subsidiary of Walmart, used a hackathon to identify new ways to improve their candidate experience. The problem: the candidate experience took too long to match aspiring candidates with job openings. Research shows just how inefficient the process is: 85% of applicants don’t hear back after submitting an application— while 71% of employers claim that they can’t find a candidate with the right skill set.
So Jet.com used a hackathon to improve the candidate experience by bringing HR leaders together with software designers and graphic designers to create new candidate process.
The upshot: a new HR candidate solution process, dubbed Casy, uses machine learning to match job descriptions with key words in an applicant's resume, so the best candidate is identified in the shortest amount of time.
6. Explore Using AI To Be A Virtual Coach And Reinforce Learning
By now, we are all familiar with chatbots as productivity tools, for tasks like booking a hotel room using the Expedia chatbot or ordering a Taco using TacoBot. But there are a number of newly funded companies that are investing in chatbots to provide individual coaching in the workplace and to reinforce learning following a traditional training program.
MIT Media Lab startup GiantOtter is using artificial intelligence to develop and train “Coach Otto,” a bot that provides online coaching for companies. This is an interesting use case an employer can use a chatbot to participate in an extended conversation as a coach or companion amplifying a person’s ability to do their job. In the case of Coach Otto, this is preparing a manager to have a difficult conversation with a team member.
Chatbots are also being used as a learning reinforcement following a traditional training program. This is the case with Freeman, a brand experience company. Freeman trains its sales staff on the basics of selling with a course called Selling Fundamentals. But Freeman needed a reinforcement strategy to help sales people apply sales skills on-the-job. Their solution: Coach TopGun SellFun, a chatbot designed to improve the retention of new skills from the Selling Fundamentals program. AI has the power to not only carry on conversations with employees but also reinforce key learning needed for job success.
7. Use AI To Enhance Employee Communications 
Gartner predicts that by 2020, 85% of customer interactions will be managed by machines, without human input. The same may well be true for employee interactions. A recent ServiceNow survey of 350 HR leaders detailed in my Forbes column, The Intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Human Resources, found more than two thirds of HR leaders believe employees are comfortable accessing chatbots to get the information they need, at the time they need it. In fact, I am starting to think of chatbots as your newest HR team member, one that allows employees to easily retrieve answers to frequently asked questions.
The type of questions HR leaders believe employees are comfortable using a chatbot for range from the mundane and factual ones; such as how much paid time off do I have left, to the more personal ones; such as how do I report a sexual misconduct experience. And the prediction for 2020 by Deepak Bharadwaj, General Manager, HR Product Line, ServiceNow, is that the penetration of chatbots in the workplace could reach adoption rates of as high as 75% with employees accessing a chatbot to answer HR questions and access HR solutions anywhere and anytime.
 By using AI, HR leaders can create a seamless employee experience, one that mirrors their best customer experience.
8. Examine How Leadership Will Be Changed As AI Moves Into Management
AI is starting to take on tasks normally handled by mid-level managers. Chatbots can now:

Organize meetings, mimicking a “Chief of Staff,” offered by tools such as Howdy and Geekbot
Follow up after meetings, with minutes complete with highlighted keywords, offered by tools like Gridspace
Improve writing of job descriptions with machine learning platforms such as Textio 

So what happens to mid-level managers in this process? Robert Thomas, of Accenture, believes leaders will routinely include AI on their leadership team and the impact will be enhanced decision making speed and the ability to look at alternative scenarios with multiple points of view. Thomas believes this can assist leaders to become more agile in the way software developers have become accustomed to. The end result is one where AI augments mid-level managers to deliver greater value to their team.
9. Invest In The Human Experience Of Working
While technology is certainly a key element of creating a best of breed employee experience, forward looking HR leaders understand the biggest critical component in successfully implementing AI in the workplace is to have leaders who are committed to inspire teams and examine how intelligent technologies will transform HR. This starts with creating a more human experience at work, one where employees get to know each other better.
At Pandora, Kristen Robinson, CHRO, defines the employee experience journey as the ability to create an environment where employees perform, connect, and grow throughout their tenure with the company. While technology is part of the equation, Pandora is investing in creating more human connections between employees. And one of the ways they are doing this is a low tech solution: a podcast called People of Pandora, dedicated to sharing the stories of Pandora employees and their experiences both at Pandora and in their personal lives. You can listen for yourself to the podcast: People of Pandora.
Leveraging podcasts to connect employees with each other is also happening at GE Crotonville where the popular podcast, Brilliance Leadership Learning (you can find this on iTunes) regularly includes interviews with GE executives such as GE Digital Leader, GE CHRO, GE Chief Communications Officer, all sharing their personal and professional stories.
Look for a resurgence of and innovation in the power of storytelling in the digital age.
10. Identify New Roles That Will Be Created By Artificial Intelligence 
Gartner estimates that artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it eliminates by 2020.    This assumes 1.8 million jobs will be automated by 2020 but 2.3 million jobs will be created with a net gain of 500,000 new jobs created as artificial intelligence becomes widespread inside companies. The question is no longer when or if AI will transform the workplace, but how can  HR leaders prepare for a new world of work where AI augments the human workforce enabling some jobs to be more efficient and creating entirely new jobs along the way.
The team at the Cognizant Center for the Future of Work addressed this issue and identified 21 new jobs that will emerge over the next 10 years and these new jobs may well be the cornerstone of new ways of working. These jobs were organized from low tech to high tech over the 10-year horizon from 2018 to 2028. Take a peek at how they all stack up in Figure 2.










Two of my favorites include:

Bring Your Own IT Facilitator, this role acknowledges the growth of employees and intact work teams who have mastered the art of working around IT. We all know shadow IT operations are in existence, so why not make them official and give them a role in creating more automated self service solutions. Some of the tasks of this new role include: conduct a shadow IT assessment and work closely with IT infrastructure to design road maps for self-service IT solutions.
Financial Wellness Coach, this role assists employees in understanding how to live in the world of digital banking, bitcoin payments, and micro-lending. We have seen financial literacy is now part of a more holistic view of employee well-being. The financial wellness coach takes this one step further by providing coaching via a smart technology platform to optimize an employees' financial life.

The question for HR leaders is what are the new job roles in HR that are on the horizon as AI becomes integrated into the workplace? In interviews with clients, three interesting new roles have emerged:

Conversational Designer, this role creates content for conversational interfaces between an employee and HR, answering a range of HR related queries with speed and accuracy.
AI Trainer, this role makes the knowledge embedded in a job role AI ready. Creating knowledge for an AI supported workplace requires that individuals tag or ""annotate"" discrete knowledge nuggets so the correct data can be served up in a conversational interface.
Digital HR Business Partner, we all know what a traditional HR Business Partner does but how can we digitize parts of this role? This role presents HR leaders with an opportunity to automate, augment with new skills, and amplify work processes so individuals in this role can provide greater value to clients with consulting and critical problem solving.

It is an interesting time we live in! That's why it’s more important than ever to prepare yourself, your team, and your organization to develop a strategy to leverage artificial intelligence across the employee life cycle, from recruitment to learning, career development, coaching, and on-going communication. As we enter 2018, HR leaders need to lead this effort in partnership with IT and Corporate Communications to take full advantage of how to leverage intelligent technologies to provide an enhanced employee experience.
I look forward to hearing from you on how you are building your AI strategy.

The rise of artificial intelligence in the workplace poses a little-discussed question – wouldn’t it be better if the HR department, not the programmers, oversaw robots? Rob Mettler suggests the idea is not as bizarre as it sounds.

Artificial intelligence at work
Preparing for robotics and AI in the workplace
HR brings robots and people together
Is HR ready for the robot revolution?

The view that robots should report to the head of HR might sound absurd, but when the CIO of a major online retailer talks about his warehouse robots working in teams, when companies introduce “AI board members”, and robots start being trialled in social care, it’s time to reconsider lines of responsibility.
Of course, many will be of the opinion that robots and artificial intelligence (AI) aren’t human and we shouldn’t even entertain the idea.
But if we look to a future where AI agents such as IPsoft’s Amelia are fronting customer service, and robots like Aldebaran’s Pepper are undertaking manual and face-to-face tasks, we can see the essence of a changing workforce. We could argue it’s merely the next step for technology in the workplace, one following machinery in the industrial revolution, and computing in the information age.
But that argument misses a key point: the notion of intelligence. If the AI-driven customer service agent starts making decisions based on what it has learnt and experienced then who is responsible for the outcomes? Is it the Chief Information or Digital officer, or the business lines using the AI workforce? Let’s look at two scenarios to test this out.
First, let’s consider the AI board member. This challenges the perception that AI and robots will only take on blue collar work – the AI board member sits at the top table. This is not sci-fi but reality. Hong Kong-based venture capital firm Deep Knowledge was first in 2014 with Vital, and Finnish IT support firm Tieto appointed Alica T to its leadership team in 2017.
If the AI-driven customer service agent starts making decisions based on what it has learnt, then who is responsible for the outcomes?”

At first glance it might appear that these AI board members are little more than overhyped analytics dashboards bringing data and insight on demand to the board room.
But Vital has approved investment decisions and Alica T has voting rights, and in 2017 the Vital algorithm was credited with pulling Deep Knowledge back from the brink of bankruptcy, helping the company avoid investment in risky projects. Vital is treated as a member of the board with observer status, and the board have agreed not to make positive investment decisions without corroboration by Vital.
The buck stops – where?
So who takes the stick when the AI board member makes the wrong decision – is it the programmer who created it, or the CIO, or is it the business lead who commissioned it or the board for debating in front of it?
Robots in the workplace aren’t new. In 1961, General Motors introduced Unimate to the assembly line and last year global sales of industrial robots reached $13.1bn. But most of these robots are automating existing manual tasks and following processes and procedures. In this context, the robots have become the responsibility of engineering and manufacturing functions.
We are now entering a new phase of robotics where intelligence is key to their value. Pepper, a humanoid robot, is being used in a social care setting by Southend-on-Sea Borough Council, the aim being to free-up social care workers to focus on the more important components of their role. The next step on from this could be highly humanoid social care robots, as featured in Channel 4’s thought provoking sci-fi drama Humans.
On the frontline
In other examples, in 2017 Enfield Council started trialling an AI customer service agent, Amelia, on the frontline of services to respond to residents’ queries and application processes. So as these physical and AI robots become more intelligent and more common they will increasingly affect our working patterns, behaviour and workplace dynamics. Together with increasing levels of anthropomorphism, they are becoming more accountable – not to their technical genesis, but to outcomes they are brought in to deliver as well as the day-to-day managers and HR departments that support them.
We must resolve the issues of accountability and responsibility as these developments accelerate, and HR must be involved in the discussion. We are surely bound to witness a shift in reporting and accountability from robots’ technical guardians to an adapted HR function.

Since HR can’t reprogram them, the final responsibility should be the programmer’s. HR would be helpful for documenting the undesirable outcomes.

Marking the coming of the fourth industrial revolution, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is permeating every major industry from healthcare to transportation, education, finance and insurance. The McKinsey Global Institute(link is external) (pdf) says that AI is contributing to a transformation of society(link is external) “happening ten times faster and at 300 times the scale or at roughly 3,000 times the impact” of the Industrial Revolution.
In the healthcare industry, AI's ability to help clinicians make diagnoses is one major way in which patients are benefiting directly. Technology giant IBM brought AI into the mainstream of healthcare, when it offered its AI platform Watson(link is external) to cancer centres in 13 countries to aid oncologists in identifying evidence-based treatment options for patients.
The promise of AI is not limited to commercial applications. It shows great potential to help solve some of the world’s most challenging development problems that UNDP staff across the world contend with on a daily basis. A promising endeavour is the use of AI to automate UNDP’s Rapid Integrated Assessment (RIA) – a tool that helps governments assess the alignment of national development plans and sectoral strategies with the 169 targets of the Sustainable Development Goals to determine a country’s readiness for implementation of the global development agenda.  
As part of the Science for Social Good(link is external) programme, UNDP teamed with IBM Research to automate the RIA, a tedious process which typically would take experts three to four weeks to complete and entail manually reviewing hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of pages of documents and assessing alignment of national development priorities with the Global Goals for Sustainable Development.
Using AI, the initiative developed an algorithm that has been tested to evaluate the national development plans of five countries (Bhutan, Cambodia, Liberia, Mauritius, and Namibia) where manual RIAs were already undertaken. This was done to compare the results from the application of the algorithm with the results of the manual RIAs conducted by experts. The overall results have been very positive(link is external), with the system identifying a significant number of relevant national targets that align with the SDG targets. In some cases, the system has also been able to identify aligned national targets that were not picked up by experts when conducting the manual RIAs.
Similar encouraging results were seen on applying the algorithm to the national plan of Papua New Guinea, a country for which a RIA has not yet been performed. Of significance is that with the help of this system, the time taken to conduct a RIA could be substantially reduced, from three to four weeks to three to four days. The success of this endeavour is noteworthy as it will help countries to quickly identify gaps in alignment thus enabling them to better integrate the SDGs into their planning frameworks based on their specific context and priorities.
While AI has the potential to address many of the world’s development problems, there are growing concerns about the impacts of AI on labour markets and the required skill sets needed to embrace this new technology. Mitigating these challenges will require ensuring that AI is harnessed for the common good where benefits are shared broadly, particularly among those most marginalized. Ultimately, AI is not good or bad in and of itself. It’s all about how we choose to use it.

				Artificial intelligence (AI) is here to make our lives easier. Period!

Seriously, are you not bored of people like Elon Musk or Stephen Hawking, who are frequently claiming that artificial intelligence (AI) is a big threat to human society? Those discussions let people think AI is going to steal everyone’s job and start the next world war. Even worse, it fuels expectations to a point that the general public is getting the idea that AI research has recently made quantum leaps. And thanks to raising these expectations we could easily run into an AI winter again.
Keep calm: we are far away from creating a super-intelligence Musk and Hawking are talking about or what Hollywood is showing us with movies like Ex Machina, Her or AI. Let me tell you something that should concern you more. According to a Sage survey, 43 percent of respondents in the U.S. and 46 percent of respondents in the UK answered that they have no idea what AI is about. Thus, the biggest issue these days is, that the general public has no clue what AI really means.
It is absolutely important to talk about regulations and ethics in terms of AI. Indeed, Boston Dynamics’ robots “Atlas” or “Handle” are spooky. But what if Tesla’s autopilot is knocking somebody down – who is responsible? Or if the autopilot has to decide which person should survive. The driver? The old man or the young boy on the street? These are the main questions I am getting frequently from the audience. This is what people are concerned about.











 
 
 
Right now, we are living in a time of exponential technological developments. Meaning, “this will never happen” is the wrong attitude since technology research and progress is happening in ever so short timeframes. However, the most successful AI systems today are solving the game of Go or the strategy game FreeCiv.

Today, most AI projects are based on machine learning that simply helps to identify patterns within data sets and thus tries to make predictions based on the existing data. However, having the right data and quality data is what’s most important. And then afterwards to check the plausibility and correctness of the results since you can always find something in endless sets of data. And that’s also one of the drawbacks if you consider machine learning as a single concept. Machine learning needs lots of training data to learn and be able to find valuable information respectively results in patterns.
Artificial intelligence is autonomous process automation
To bring the AI discussion to reasonable deliberations. Today, AI is not about recreating the human brain. It is about building a system that acts like a human. All in all, AI means analytics, problem solving and autonomous automation based on data, knowledge and experience.











 
 
 
Just try to look at this entire AI discussion from a different angle. Consider our life as a process. Consider every day as a process that is divided into single steps. And then, consider AI as autonomous process automation that provides us with more convenience and thus makes our life easier.
Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri are AI but not intelligent
Have you ever tried to lead a simple conversation with Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri? Exactly, this is not going to go well. However, Alexa as well as Siri are AI technologies. They use natural language processing (NLP). So, machine learning algorithms powered by predictive models. For example, the algorithms are used to translate your commands into little pieces, so-called sound bites. Afterwards, these pieces are analyzed by another predictive model, that tries to predict what your request was about. However, Alexa or Siri are not intelligent or self-learning. Consider their “brains” (they do NOT have brains) like a “database” in the cloud-backend of Amazon and Apple operating a set of ready answers or action items. If you are a proud owner of an Amazon Echo device you will understand what I mean. Every Friday you get an email with the newest commands you can use to control Alexa. Besides the ever-growing database behind Alexa, the so-called “Alexa-Skills” are helping Alexa to become more “intelligent.” This is nothing else but small applications (like for your Android smartphone or iPhone) someone has to develop and equip with further commands, questions you can ask, ready answers or action items. And the more skills are activated, the more intelligent Alexa appears since you have more commands and ways to interact with her. However, the interesting story around Alexa is that Amazon has 5,000 people exclusively working on Alexa to enhance it. So, we could expect more progress soon.
The good news, self-learning systems already do exist. If you connect your iPhone via Bluetooth with your car and if you’ve set up your work and home address, soon the iPhone will tell you how long you are going to need to work or back home. In some other cases “Apple Maps Destination” has shown me predictions to locations even if I didn’t store them exclusively on my iPhone. So, just based on my travel habits. Google Now works the same way. It proactively provides information to the users they are maybe looking for. Predictions based on their search habits. However, if you are granting Google access to your calendar, Google Now may also work as an advisor. It reminds you that you have an appointment and what vehicle you should take in order to arrive at your destination on time.











 
 
 
Other AI-related services you might have been in touch with for quite some time are:

Since the 1950s, the financial service industry is using machine learning algorithms for credit scoring.
Dating websites use algorithms to provide an indication of how likely two people are a match and would probably go out on a date.
At Geneva Airport, autonomous robot KATE takes care of your luggage, checks you in and guides you through the airport. Everything based on data analytics and geo location analysis.
“Relay” from Savioke is an autonomous delivery robot that is used in some hotels for room service purposes.

Autonomous process automation in your daily life
Back to AI as an autonomous process automation that makes our life easier. Let’s discuss some ideas:

Imagine Alexa or Siri as your personal watchdog in business. Checking your phone calls, autonomously negotiating appointments with e.g. colleagues – especially with the ones who always send calendar invitations before asking. I am kind of talking about a very early version of Iron Man’s AI “Jarvis.”
Or what about Alexa or Siri as your very personal life assistant. Let’s say you are speaking at a conference. Your flight home leaves at 4 p.m. In order to reach your flight on time, your personal life assistant autonomously orders you a ride for 2:15 p.m. since your speech ends at 1:45 p.m. and the traffic information looks busy these days. The virtual assistant just sends you the details of the pickup location which is right in front of the conference venue. The assistant simply follows the entire process you would usually go through: from taking the phone out of your pocket, opening the app, searching for the target location and then ordering the ride. So, keep your hands and mind free for more important things. Of course, you have to give the AI access to your calendar, geolocation and other information.
Or imagine an intelligent version of the kitchen aid “Thermomix.” The dish advisor: Based on what the kitchen helper finds in your fridge it makes recommendations what you could possibly cook. And when some ingredients for a dish are missing it could ask for permission to order them online. The health advisor: Based on your eating behavior of the last weeks it would nicely recommend you not to cook the tiramisu you were just about to prepare, because this wouldn’t be good for your consumption of calories.

Autonomous process automation inside your organization
AI as an autonomous process automation has lots of potentials inside an enterprise as well. Let’s focus on two real world examples:











 
 
 

An AI-defined infrastructure is actually nothing else but autonomous process automation for IT operations. Those kinds of environments are capable of deploying the necessary resources depending on the workload requirements as well as de-allocating the resources when they are not needed anymore. They are constantly analyzing the ever-changing behavior and status of every single infrastructure component and thus understanding the environment they are acting in. The environment is reacting or proactively acting based on the status of single infrastructure components by autonomously taking actions and thus leading the entire infrastructure into an error-free status.
As part of business operations, autonomous process automation is already utilized in the insurance industry, autonomously creating insurance policies. In doing so, experts are teaching the AI the process, step by step, how and why they create a certain insurance policy. Besides that, the AI is also connected to partner systems that deliver further information. For the time being, the AI creates an insurance policy and hands it over to an expert. The expert checks the insurance and tweaks it if needed. After that it is delivered to the customer. In the end, a customer will directly interact with the AI and, after delivering the necessary information, will receive his/her custom insurance policy.

Keep your expectations low
On a final note. Instead of constantly discussing AI as the biggest threat to humanity, maybe we should talk about the biggest threat to AI research. The impatience of humanity! The issue: AI research has been an oscillating system between several techniques. Whenever one approach did not do “the job completely,” people get frustrated and turn to another one. You want to see amazing AI stuff in the future? Keep calm and wait. It will happen! We just have to move forward step by step. Otherwise our expectations will fail and will immediately guide us into the next AI winter.
Saying this, consider AI technologies as an approach to make your life easier. And don’t stress the term “intelligent” too much. However, always be aware of what type of data and personal information you really want to share. Once it is out, it’s virtually impossible to roll it back.

Resistance Is Futile: Embracing the Era of the Augmented Worker 


        By Nathaniel Barr and Kelly Peters 

          January 8, 2018        






























 


 J.K. Rofling 
 
This article is part of our special issue “Connected State of Mind,” which explores the impact of tech use on our behavior and relationships. View the complete issue here.


Throughout history, technological advances have revolutionized the way we work. In many cases, these innovations extended our natural abilities, enabling our bodies to do more, more easily. “Most of the greatest advances of modern technology have been instruments which extended the scope of our sense organs, our brains, or our limbs,” the philosopher and psychologist K.J.W. Craik said in 1943. “Such are telescopes and microscopes, wireless, calculating machines, typewriters, motor-cars, ships and airplanes.”
These old inventions are what Tim Brown, the CEO of IDEO, calls artifacts. Artifacts aren’t themselves “smart”—the people who use them are. Today, as the rapid rise of artificial intelligence brings us to the brink of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we face a different dynamic: Both people and technology are smart, albeit in different ways.
Though some sectors will see large scale replacement of human employees with intelligent automation, more domains will require businesses to figure out how to interface the capabilities of these new tools with the workforce—to augment workers with A.I., rather than automate business functions entirely. The prospect of A.I.-augmented workers is both promising and unsettling: How can employees and firms ensure that they get the benefits of A.I. without erasing uniquely human strengths?
The prospect of A.I.-augmented workers is both promising and unsettling: How can employees and firms ensure that they get the benefits of A.I. without erasing uniquely human strengths?
One of the foremost challenges will be getting workers to embrace augmentation. During the 19th century, groups of English workers called the Luddites resisted new performance-enhancing technologies, and overcoming that resistance was critical to industrial advancement. Now, new technology raises this same problem, but it does so at unprecedented scale: Augmenting human abilities with A.I. is more complex than using artifacts, and it’s potentially even less welcome.
Since these new technologies play a role in even thinking for us, they pose a direct and existential threat to what it means to be human. Augmentation requires employees to challenge their conception of what their role can and should be in the workplace—and how their humanity can be redefined and extended. And, because these machines can quickly process vast amounts of data, they can yield novel, counterintuitive insights that humans could disagree with. It’s one thing to extend one’s abilities with machines; it is another to use a machine that produces a different judgment or reaches a different conclusion.
Further, A.I. will also require workers to face another assumption about human advantage: People tend to think that certain areas of judgment, like moral decision-making, are best accomplished by human agents, leaving many reluctant to trust machines. Even among those who think augmented technology may aid decisions in general, trusting the output of A.I. in more specific instances is a potential obstacle.
Firms  also have a role to play. They will need to leverage behavioral science and psychological research methods to investigate empirically under what circumstances employees accept or reject A.I. advice or decisions. In areas where A.I. looms but has yet to infiltrate, they could use a contemporary “Mechanical Turk” as a testing framework. When the inventor of the original Mechanical Turk unveiled it in 1770, he branded it as a chess-playing machine, with the intent to fool human players into believing it was a powerful, even supernaturally powerful, piece of technology. In reality, there was a gifted human chess player hidden within the apparatus.
So too could people be “fooled” for science. We have imagined an experiment that would test how and when employees trust A.I. in their decision-making: A staff member would play the role of “hidden expert” and create the illusion that advice is coming from the A.I. Employees could choose to incorporate the feedback into their own decision making or not, allowing a company to measure what percentage of the staff were willing to use an A.I. device, with what frequency, and in what situations. Another important area for measurement is the characteristics of employees that are more, or less, trusting of A.I. For instance, how do we know for sure that millennials will always more readily adopt new technology than those in older generations? (Answer: We don’t).
When A.I. decision aids are adopted, analogous measurements can be made to those described above for real time monitoring of when, how, and by whom they are used. Further, firms should also evaluate whether decisions made with A.I. are empirically better than those made without. For instance, in financial trading, are the workers that demonstrate more openness to A.I. input more likely to yield larger gains? And if so, is this because they are overriding suboptimal human biases?
Gathering this data and embracing augmentation will probably be most useful in industries in which people have historically relied only on their brains to make decisions, where there is resistance to acknowledge cognitive limits and biases, and where A.I. has already demonstrated the capacity to improve human ability. Take, for instance, fields in which decisions mean the difference between life and death—such as medical decision-making, where A.I. can now read scans, classify patients by various criteria, prioritize patient care, and aid in providing complex clinical decision support—or where they mean earning or losing millions or billions of dollars, such as in financial trading or advising, where A.I. applications can do things like automatically process news and data to provide humans with insights to make more informed choices and spend more time with clients.
Building an augmented workforce isn’t a race to the finish, but rather it’s an uncertain journey with neither roadmap nor prescribed end point.
Though the benefits of A.I. are promising and openness is important, it is important to proceed thoughtfully. The algorithms and technology that underlie A.I. are imperfect and shouldn’t be accepted with unflinching faith. Rather, the optimal, but likely elusive, arrangement is that the output of A.I. is used when the human is wrong, and the A.I. is overridden when the technology is wrong. Such a tension, between trust and skepticism in the face of augmented decision-making, will require what Gordon Pennycook of Yale University and his colleagues have called reflective, rather than reflexive, open-mindedness. Rather than uncritically accepting automated answers, we must consciously deliberate and reflect, on a case-by-case basis, how best to use the intelligence of computing technology with human wisdom and discernment. Attributes connected to success in such deliberation will be increasingly prized as augmentation expands—The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report identifies critical thinking, judgment and decision-making, cognitive flexibility, and creativity as Top Skills for 2020 and for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Much as employees will need these characteristics to make the best individual decisions, firms will also need to exhibit flexibility and creativity at the organizational level. Building an augmented workforce isn’t a race to the finish, but rather it’s an uncertain journey with neither roadmap nor prescribed end point. Since we can’t be sure which systems and approaches for integrating A.I. are most effective, we must continue to experiment, measure, and innovate. Adjusting to a world characterized by accelerating technological advance isn’t a one-time investment but an ongoing battle for the optimization of extended human ability.
We predict that firms that can most effectively extend human cognitive ability with new technologies and find the ideal alignment between human intelligence and A.I. will have significant economic advantages over competitors unwilling to augment or unable to find the right equilibrium. Though this particular challenge is new, creatively leveraging technology to extend our natural ability is not. It is an integral part of the history, present, and future of how we work—and is truly and deeply human.

Machines that learn from experience, adjust to new inputs, and perform tasks once uniquely the domain of humans, have entered our daily lives in ways seen and unseen. Given the current breakneck pace of change and innovation, the question for governments and policymakers is how to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence, and not be trampled by the robot takeover of our nightmares. The answer is simple: make them work for us.
Recently, the IMF’s Managing Director Christine Lagarde convened some of the most distinguished voices in the field of artificial intelligence, including Malcolm Frank of Cognizant; Martin Ford, author of Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future; Chief Analytics Officer of IBM, Martin Fleming; and Andrew McAfee and Simon Johnson, the latter a former Chief Economist of the IMF, and both professors at MIT.  
There are four areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning of importance to the IMF’s work:

Governance: Both countries and the IMF will need to address the provenance of data, as well as matters of privacy and informed consent before basing analysis or grounding policy advice on Big Data or the algorithms used to generate findings. Big Data is dynamic, heterogeneous, and may originate in sectors that do not map cleanly to the IMF’s existing lines of responsibility or expertise. For example, data generated from e-commerce, the Internet of Things, satellite data, or supply-chain and logistics data are not yet well understood or integrated in how we assess the health of a country’s economy. Both the IMF and countries will need to develop expertise in the use of such micro-level data.
Labor markets: Labor markets will look different in the next few years. There will be fewer middle-skilled jobs, such as insurance claims processing or jobs performed in a constrained physical space, like fork-lift operator or order expeditor. These sorts of jobs have been more resistant to offshoring or automation so far. But they may disappear soon, as artificial intelligence improves and robots are more able to make decisions based on ambiguous situations. This has implications for education, retirement, and social welfare programs. Large numbers of middle-class jobs may be eliminated, leading to unemployment or underemployment. Some jobs will require extensive retraining to ensure that workers can perform the work. Many countries are already facing rapidly aging populations. Should large numbers of workers leave the labor market prematurely, governments will find it even more difficult to fund social-welfare and retirement benefits.  
Taxes: By implication, should labor markets rapidly shed middle-skilled or low-skilled jobs as many predict, the tax structures of many countries will need to reflect the decreasing share of GDP attributable to wages and salaries. Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, roughly half of government revenue is derived from individual income or social insurance taxes. If labor becomes a smaller part of developed economies, tax structures will need to change to sustain government revenues near current levels, and to avoid creating further disincentives to the creation of jobs. For example, Microsoft founder Bill Gates suggested that a tax might be levied on robots.
Social equity: Computer-driven decision-making should be open to scrutiny and inspection, and must not simply be automated versions of mental models that embed legacies of social inequality. For instance, some businesses make use of data to offer personalized pricing, based on predictive models about the future revenue stream that a potential customer might provide.  Some customers who do not match an optimal profile might be “invited to leave quietly.” Such redlining of particular groups of customers may lead to further marginalization, leading to a self-fulfilling prophesy.  

Economists generally build models and then refine them to reduce error and improve robustness. Many artificial intelligence methods are impervious to external analysis, because software based on artificial intelligence learns and adapts as it encounters new data. After millions of iterations, the algorithm itself will have changed substantially. “The algorithm told me to do it,” is unlikely to withstand public inquiry as the basis for policy development.
Next steps
There is clearly a need for all institutions to keep up as this rapidly changing world impacts their work. So, the IMF will continue to bring in experts to promote information exchange and develop training so that its staff can work with these new technologies as they emerge. In turn, this will help the IMF work with its member countries to make artificial intelligence serve the public good.

One of CFM’s goals is to help museums learn from other sectors, and help other sectors learn from us. For that reason, my colleagues and I cultivate a diverse audience for our work, drawing futurists, games designers, technologists, educators, librarians and many others into conversation with museumers. In today’s post Rhea Steele, COO at the organization that accredits P-12 educator preparation programs, offers some thoughts on how artificial intelligence, our tech focus in TrendsWatch 2017, may transform the work of accreditation programs.
 
When I read the November/December issue of Museum magazine: Museums 2040, I was energized and excited by the not-so-far-fetched opportunities presented to future museums. Reading the Accreditation Spotlight, I recalled a session focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the American Society of Association Executives Technology Conference. Not just the stuff of science fiction, AI takes computing beyond algorithms and human-created code. AI allows computers to learn from experience, adjust “behaviors” (outputs) to match new stimulus (inputs) and perform tasks of increasing complexity. This type of learning is referred to as machine learning. During the session, we discussed how AI can assist with repetitive tasks, quickly parse large data sets, and “multitask” by monitoring and responding to multiple systems and inputs simultaneously. I began to wonder what would happen if we applied machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accreditation activities. 
 
The purpose of accreditation in higher education is to improve program quality and assure public accountability, whereas in the museum space, it is to recognize adherence to the standards in the field. In both cases, accreditation systems are dependent on clearly defined rubrics to help volunteer peer reviewers make judgments on the institution’s demonstration of meeting standards. At my organization, the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation, as well as at other accreditors, our process is built on is the evaluative judgments of volunteers who are applying our guidelines and decision criteria. A significant amount of time, effort, and funding goes into ensuring volunteers are sufficiently trained and able to interpret evidence both broadly and within institutional context. As you can imagine, the quality assurance processes, including establishing interrater reliability, result in the need for many, many volunteers and a well-informed, detail-oriented staff.   
 
There is general consensus that the process of accreditation is best conducted by volunteer peer reviewers due to the depth of their knowledge of the field and the nuanced understanding needed to connect disparate pieces of evidence in the context of an individual institution. Can human peer review alone meet the demand for accreditation services? Currently about 1075 museums have been accredited by AAM, compared to the 4000 that have taken the Pledge of Excellence and the estimated 35,000 museums in the US identified by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Slightly more than 1000 people serve as peer reviewers for AAM Accreditation, and a nine-member commission makes all the final decisions regarding accreditation. Could AI enable the AAM program to increase the number of museums served, without a proportionate increase in cost? 
 
AI could help with the quality, as well as the quantity, of reviews. The challenge faced by volunteer peer reviewers is to approach each organization with true objectivity – a peer reviewer who works at a large well-funded institution must surface and set aside his/her implicit biases when reviewing an institution with a different profile. While this system has worked well in the past, can we make it work better with the application of AI?
 
Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri are all able to interpret natural language commands, IBM’s Watson won Jeopardy, and Netflix makes eerily on-target recommendations for movies and shows I will like. It’s all just algorithms, you might say, and you are correct.  But these algorithms are increasingly complex and sophisticated. Today’s AI-based programs use machine learning techniques (including rubrics and rules) to acquire information and adapt through experience. Our peer reviewers do the same. What if we shift our model and use AI to do what it does best – parse through reams of qualitative and quantitative data submitted for accreditation and provide peer reviewers with an initial assessment of alignment to the standards? How would this all work? 
 
In the same way we currently train peer reviewers, an accreditation AI would be trained using data elements, evidence, rubrics and decisions made by past peer reviewers. We would then run simulations to enable the AI to learn alongside the peer reviewers currently auditing institutions and compare the AI’s recommendations with those of the peer review team and make adjustments. Eventually, the AI would be able to provide absolute consistency in the identification of areas for improvement and misalignment with standards. It could also identify practices that correlate with positive outcomes, thus improving the flow of information on best practices throughout the field. As in many fields beginning to adopt AI (medicine, engineering, customer service), I believe the technology would supplement, rather than supplant, the human role. Peer reviewers will use the AI’s recommendations to collect and refine information requested and reviewed during the on-site visit and use the algorithm’s analysis to inform their recommendations and the decision to grant or not grant accreditation. 
 
As we move further and further into an AI-enabled future, we have an opportunity to review and reframe how we leverage technology to improve our industries. Application of AI to assist in the peer review process of accreditation is one way we can leverage the power of technology and help humans focus on high-value activities. How else can museums benefit from the novel application of technology?

Automation and artificial intelligence technologies are transforming manufacturing, corporate work and the retail business, providing new opportunities for companies to explore and posing major threats to those that don’t adapt to the times. Equally daunting challenges confront colleges and universities, but they’ve been slower to acknowledge them.
At present, colleges and universities are most worried about competition from schools or training systems using online learning technology. But that is just one aspect of the technological changes already under way. For example, some companies are moving toward requiring workers have specific skills trainings and certifications – as opposed to college degrees. 
As a professor who researches artificial intelligence and offers distance learning courses, I can say that online education is a disruptive challenge for which colleges are ill-prepared. Lack of student demand is already closing 800 out of roughly 10,000 engineering colleges in India. And online learning has put as many as half the colleges and universities in the U.S. at risk of shutting down in the next couple decades as remote students get comparable educations over the internet – without living on campus or taking classes in person. Unless universities move quickly to transform themselves into educational institutions for a technology-assisted future, they risk becoming obsolete.
Existing alternatives to traditional higher ed
Enormous amounts of information are now available online for free, ready for watching, listening or reading at any time, by anyone who’s connected. For more than a decade, private companies, nonprofits and universities alike have been experimenting with online courses, often offered for free or at low cost to large numbers of students around the world. Research has shown that it’s as effective for students to use a combination of online courses and traditional in-classroom instruction as it is to just have classes in person.



Is this the future of a college education?

Providers of massive open online courses (often called “MOOCs”) are refining ways for people who complete the classes to present their accomplishments in ways employers can understand easily. For example, students in certain classes from major MOOC provider edX can get an official Arizona State University transcript listing their courses and grades. An employer would never know the person studied online. (There’s another threat to universities’ business model, too: Students can take the classes and get their grades for free; they only need to pay if they are happy with their grades, and if they want official college credit.)
This is a period of rapid change unlike what universities have dealt with for centuries.
The evolution of the university
Medieval European universities trained would-be clergy members in canonical law, theological discussion and religious administration. These institutions amassed huge repositories of knowledge, storing and indexing them in libraries, which became the focal point of the campus.
As European countries explored the world and established overseas colonies starting in the 15th and 16th centuries, universities evolved to train officers to manage those territories, study navigation across the oceans and look after colonists’ health. After the Industrial Revolution, colleges changed again, teaching workers how to use new scientific and technological methods and tools. 
In the 21st century, the workplace is transforming once more; what businesses, governments and society need from education is shifting, and technology has made the brick-and-mortar library obsolete. It used to be that users of a technology needed to know how it works. In the early days of driving, for instance, it was important for a driver to be able to fix a car that broke down on the side of the road, perhaps far from any expert mechanic. 
But in the current post-industrial economy, that has changed: Even a car mechanic uses a computer to connect to car systems to identify what is not working properly. Very few people need to know how these internal computer systems work; they just need to be able to interpret sensor readings and error messages. 
A changing job market
Now, the number of jobs mostly involving routine skills – both physical and cognitive – is shrinking over time.
Increasing automation at factories is rapidly replacing workers at factories, even in low-wage countries like China. Artificial intelligence technologies like machine learning and computer vision are permanently eliminating high-skill jobs in offices, too. Many world economies – including in the U.S. – are turning from manufacturing to service, in which most new jobs do not require advanced education. 
The remaining jobs will involve fewer routine tasks. The people doing that work will still need some education beyond high school. But they may not have as much need to attend classes at, or even live on, a physical university campus. Colleges that are outside the very top tier of quality and name recognition – and those that have taken on large amounts of debt to build physical facilities – will suffer as demand for their services lessens.
Competition between colleges
Another factor challenging universities’ existence is the rapidly rising cost of a traditional college education. So far, in the U.S. demand for degrees from residential colleges has remained high because government-backed loans are easy to get. But student loan debt in the U.S. has reached US$1.45 trillion – and as many as 20 percent of borrowers may not be earning enough to pay them back.

Universities might highlight intangible values of in-person learning, like personal contact and nonverbal communication, but the costs are becoming a larger factor. Parents and students in the U.S. are increasingly asking whether it’s worth spending around $30,000 – or even more than $60,000 – for less than 240 days of school in an elite private residential college – more than $250 a night. 
Private colleges’ main competition at the moment comes from public universities. Their prices are two-thirds lower, but studying still involves taking many courses that are just as easily taught online.

Soon students will want to take a variety of courses from different universities, choosing each class and school for its particular merits and benefits. That will stiffen competition between institutions, lowering students’ costs – and universities’ revenues. 
Courses will become shared experiences for online learning communities. Some colleges might seek to charge students for special in-person learning experiences, but these will be extras for those who can afford them, not the higher education norm they are today.
Finding a new way to teach
Some universities – those at the top, with the most money and expertise – are responding to the coming changes to higher education. Some are forming partnerships with international universities and online teaching companies, or building remote-learning programs on their own. Some of these, like the Harvard Extension School, are high-tech adaptations of correspondence courses people used to take by mail. 
Harvard Extension School enrolls nearly 2,000 degree candidates and over 13,000 non-degree students, who take classes online, on campus or a mix of both. Students can earn a Bachelor of Liberal Arts degree in extension studies. At an estimated cost of $49,500, a four-year degree is cheaper than a single year on campus at Harvard.
But the vast majority of people who take its classes never get a degree at all. They’re just looking for one particular course, or maybe a few, customizing their own education. 
Employers will soon take advantage of options like this, too: Universities will find themselves asked to build specific programs for particular companies. And universities will find themselves needing to explore other ways artificial intelligence technologies can help reduce the cost of education.
