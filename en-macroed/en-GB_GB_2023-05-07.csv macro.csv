Openai’s chatbots, which use large-language-model (llm) technology, got the ball rolling in November. Now barely a day goes by without some mind-blowing advance. An ai-powered song featuring a fake “Drake” and “The Weeknd” recently shook the music industry. Programs which convert text to video are making fairly convincing content. Before long consumer products such as Expedia, Instacart and OpenTable will plug into Openai’s bots, allowing people to order food or book a holiday by typing text into a box. A recently leaked presentation, reportedly from a Google engineer, suggests the tech giant is worried about how easy it is for rivals to make progress. There is more to come—probably a lot more.The development of ai raises profound questions. Perhaps most pressing, though, is a straightforward one. What does this mean for the economy? Many have grand expectations. New research by Goldman Sachs, a bank, suggests that “widespread ai adoption could eventually drive a 7% or almost $7trn increase in annual global gdp over a ten-year period.” Academic studies point to a three-percentage-point rise in annual labour-productivity growth in firms that adopt the technology, which would represent a huge uplift in incomes compounded over many years. A study published in 2021 by Tom Davidson of Open Philanthropy, a grantmaking outfit, puts a more than 10% chance on “explosive growth”—defined as increases in global output of more than 30% a year—sometime this century. A few economists, only half-jokingly, hold out the possibility of global incomes becoming infinite.Already have an account?Log inContinue with a free trialExplore all our independent journalism for free for one month.

There are examples of generative AI tools “hallucinating” and fabricating information.Creative workers have raised concerns about copyright infringement by AI platforms.The long-running debate about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the future of work has thrown up very few certainties. Until recently, there was, however, one fairly solid assumption: creative jobs would be safe from automation. The sudden arrival of generative AI has changed everything - or at least that’s how it feels to millions of people working in the creative industries. In a matter of a few months, writers, designers, photographers and filmmakers, among others, have had their futures opened up to speculation. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Then along came ChatGPT, DALL-E and MidJourney - and suddenly our social media feeds were filled with content that had no human input beyond a text prompt telling the AI what to create.Much of the public discourse around generative AI and creative jobs has focused on the potential threats – but researchers are pointing out that this technology also brings opportunities in terms of enhanced productivity, efficiency and profits. The potential impact of generative AI was a major focus at the World Economic Forum’s Growth Summit 2023, held in Geneva earlier this month. How will generative AI disrupt the creative industries? The current versions of generative platforms are in their infancy, with many still in beta trial mode. What is certain is they’ll become more capable at an exponential rate and that will raise the potential for disruption in the creative and many other industries. Research from Goldman Sachs suggests that generative AI has the potential to automate 26% of work tasks in the arts, design, entertainment, media and sports sectors. AI could automate a quarter of work tasks in art, design entertainment and media. Image: Goldman SachsThe Harvard Business Review reports that generative AI already has advanced capabilities across a broad range of creative content used in the marketing industry. The report says a refined version of GPT-3 called Jasper “can produce blogs, social media posts, web copy, sales emails, ads and other types of customer-facing content”. The report states that major food manufacturers, including Heinz and Nestlé, have already used AI-generated content in advertising campaigns. A screenshot shows AI-generated artwork used by Heinz. Image: YouTube/HeinzWhen Heinz asked DALL-E 2 to create versions of ketchup bottles in a series of artistic styles, the company noted that the AI largely recreated its own distinctively shaped bottle to represent the product. It ran with the idea to produce a video campaign ad – and so one of the world’s first AI-generated advertising campaigns was born.How can AI add value in creative industries? The fact that generative AI only emerged for public use a few months ago means many companies are only beginning the process of understanding how it can be used to add value. Management Consultancy McKinsey & Company took a close look at the fashion industry to test how it might be applied in one creative sector. McKinsey sees use cases across fashion that go well beyond the automation of tasks. The researchers identified opportunities in product development and innovation, marketing, sales and customer experience. As well as speeding up laborious tasks, generative AI can analyse seemingly unconnected data to deliver new insights that can add value across creative organizations. The report urges industry leaders to “make value your North Star” as they begin the generative AI journey. This means identifying the areas that can benefit the most from AI as a matter of priority, and then developing use cases and long-term goals based on the integration of generative AI into the business, says McKinsey.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

One major concern is that proprietary information and data used in prompts on generative AI tools are stored on the servers of AI companies. This risks the same information being served in response to future prompts, creating the threat of confidential data, content or designs entering the public domain. TechRadar reports that Samsung lost control of valuable source code and confidential meeting notes when staff included them in a ChatGPT prompt. Another issue with generative AI arose at the Guardian newspaper in the UK, where it was discovered that ChatGPT had manufactured articles and added the names of the paper’s writers, suggesting they were genuine Guardian reports. The issue only came to light when a member of the public enquired about an article she had seen on ChatGPT, only to find it had never existed. For creative industries, generative AI will bring a range of rewards – but only if sophisticated guardrails are put in place to protect original content and designs.

If so, when?Unfortunately, there are no clear-cut answers to these questions. Technology develops in unpredictable ways. But a paper published last month by three scholars — Princeton’s Edward W. Felten, Manav Raj of the University of Pennsylvania and Robert Seamans of New York University — offered some helpful insight, at least in terms of artificial intelligence as we now know it.The team looked into two types of AI: One capable of generating and analyzing speech (think ChatGPT) and the other with the same capacity for images (think Midjourney). It examined dozens of skills that humans use to perform their jobs, from writing to reasoning to lifting heavy things, for the potential for artificial intelligence to enhance those skills or to supplant humans entirely.The chart below provides an example of their analysis of professions related to art, design, entertainment, sports and media:−3−2−10123Language Model(ChatGPT)Image Generator(Midjourney)← Less impactedAVERAGEMore impacted →Median salaryAI exposure score0$100k$200kArts, entertainment, sports and mediaActor, musician, designer, reporter, athleteAvg. of the groupAvg. of the groupFashion designersDancers*Public relationsspecialistsInterior designersDancers*Fashion designersDancers*Public relationsspecialistsInterior designersDancers*Researchers developed the AI Exposure score by connecting 10 AI applications to 52 human skills across approximately 800 professions.* Jobs with $0 median salary are due to occupation code change or lack of data.Each dot in this chart represents a profession.Orange dots show the potential impact of AI language models such as ChatGPT. Public relations specialists will probably be significantly affected by language models, dancers likely won’t.Green dots show the potential impact of AI image generators. Interior designers probably will be greatly impacted by image models. Dancers, again, are likely to be least affected.Language models are more likely to impact jobs that rely on communication and language skills. While image generators are more likely to alter professions that depend more on visual or spatial abilities. Many occupations may be affected by both.Higher exposure doesn’t necessarily mean these workers will be replaced by machines, however. In some areas, artificial intelligence could give workers a productivity boost. In others, it could lead to automation and job loss. For example, while people in telemarketing are clearly vulnerable to chat bots, lawyers might use artificial intelligence to help them speed their work and get more done.Now that you understand how this works, let’s see how artificial intelligence could affect your own profession.Type in your job to see how AI could affect itEnter a job−3−2−10123Language Model(ChatGPT)Image Generator(Midjourney)← Less impactedAVERAGEMore impacted →Median salaryAI exposure score0$100k$200kManagement, business and financeCEO, director, financial analyst and loan officerHover over each dot to reveal the jobMost jobs will be affected — but not at the same rateBottom line: Highly skilled, highly educated white-collar occupations, ranging from architects to astronomers to judges, are most likely to see change as a result of the development of artificial intelligence.A recent study by researchers from OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, estimated that 80 percent of the U.S. workforce would have its work-related tasks at least 10 percent affected by language models. One in 5 would see at least half of daily tasks affected by artificial intelligence, the researchers found. In some cases, workers will need to learn new software that uses artificial intelligence to expedite their tasks and increase their productivity. Other jobs might go extinct entirely.Story continues below advertisementAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAdvertisementThe charts below give some hint of the potential ramifications for different industries.

NYU’s Seamans, who is an associate professor of management and organizations, believes that it will still take a lot of time for the effect to grow large. “Whereas in 2019 [Elon] Musk was touting driverless fleets of Tesla by 2020 (still doesn’t exist), Chris Urmson, who knows AVs (autonomous vehicles) very well, was saying 30-50 years,” Seamans wrote in an email to us.Although it is clear that most jobs will be affected by artificial intelligence in one way or another, these changes won’t affect all workers at the same rate or at the same time. This gives us a bit of leeway to address some important questions: If technology allows one worker to do the work of five, who reaps the financial windfall from that? What role should the government play in fairly distributing the wealth that is created? Should we be taking universal basic income more seriously now, ahead of the disruptions that we know are coming? What can we do to help people adapt, learn new skills and find new jobs? Who will pay for that?This will not be the first time that new technology changes how we work, of course. From lamplighters to switchboard operators to video store clerks, professions have come and gone. We’ve adjusted.But artificial intelligence sure looks like a monster of a disrupter — even some of its lead creators are warning of its danger. There is still time to tame AI. We should slow it down to give people a chance to adapt and ensure that it will be a technology that benefits everyone, not just those already at the top of the food chain.Press Enter to skip to end of carouselOpinions on AICarousel - $Opinions on AI: use tab or arrows to navigateHow will Apple’s new AI change your phone?

Last week, the Writers Guild of America (WGA), went on a strike because of the proposed use of AI, specifically ChatGPT, in television and film writing. The guild argued that the use of AI would replace jobs, increase compensation disparities and lead to greater job insecurity for writers, reported Time. While this was happening, Geoffrey Hinton, the 75-year-old scientist widely seen as the godfather of AI, announced his resignation from Google, warning of the growing dangers in the field.

[+] Writers Guild of America in front of Netflix in Hollywood, California, on May 5, 2023. - The Hollywood writers' strike broke out last week over pay, but the refusal of studios like Netflix and Disney to rule out artificial intelligence replacing human scribes in the future has only fueled anger and fear on the picket lines. With their rapidly advancing ability to eerily mimic human conversation, AI programs like ChatGPT have spooked many industries recently.

The BBC reported that Hinton, whose research on neural networks and deep learning has paved the way for AI systems like ChatGPT—which according to the Wall Street Journal is causing a stock-market ruckus—expressed regret over his work and raised concerns about bad actors’ potential misuse of AI. Hinton’s departure comes at a time when AI advancements are accelerating at an unprecedented pace. For example, KPMG announced last week that they would make generative AI available to all employees, including partners, for both client-facing and internal work.

Meanwhile, during an interview with the Wall Street Journal, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis expressed his belief that a form of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could be developed within a few years. Elsewhere, implications for medical leaders are becoming apparent. According to Erwin Loh, who explained in BMJ Leader, “new technologies like ChatGPT and generative AI…have the potential to transform the way we practice medicine, and revolutionize the healthcare system.” Loh’s article provided a great explanation of AI technologies in the context of healthcare and also offered insights into how they could be used to improve delivery.

So, it’s clear there is enormous potential to revolutionize the world of work. The question now is: how do we make sure that AI works for us rather than against us? After all, the opportunities are vast and growing. For example, research published by MIT Sloan Management Review concluded that “Data can help companies better understand and improve the employee experience, leading to a more productive workforce.” But, it must be remembered that job displacement is a genuine concern. Insider reported that “CEOs get closer to finally saying it—AI will wipe out more jobs than they can count.”

One study conducted by researchers from OpenAI, OpenResearch, and the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that around 80% of the US workforce could see at least 10% of their tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers), with around 19% of workers experiencing at least 50% of their tasks impacted. Having reviewed the study, Natalia Weisz, a professor at Argentina’s IAE Business School, concluded in an interview that, unlike previous technological revolutions, higher-paying occupations with more education requirements, such as degrees and even doctorates, are more exposed compared to those that do not require a profession. “We are moving into a phase in which traditional professions may very well be disrupted”, said Weisz.

“We are living in a time of rapid technological change. We must be mindful to ensure that these advances do not lead to job losses or create an unequal playing field,” said Shrenik Rao, editor-in-chief of Madras Courier, in an interview. Rao predicted that “Bots could replace journalists and columnists. Illustrators, cartoonists and artists could lose their jobs, too. Instead of telling stories in the public interest, stories will be produced based on what will garner views or clicks.”

Rao, who is also a columnist at Haaretz, went on to probe the ethical implications of AI-driven news production. “What will happen with journalistic ethics? Will the news be produced to serve certain political agendas? Will there be an objective filter for news and images?” He concluded that a lack of transparency over how AI is used in journalism could lead to further mistrust in the media.
Governments, industries, and individuals need to engage in a collaborative effort to navigate this brave new world. By fostering open conversations, creating robust regulatory frameworks, and prioritizing education and adaptation, we can ensure that artificial intelligence serves as a force for good, empowering humanity to overcome challenges and reach new heights. Leadership is, therefore, required to ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically: it is time for all to come together and propel AI forward in a way that works for everyone.

Could humans, too, become an outmoded technology, displaced by machines that are not just stronger and more dexterous but more intelligent, even more creative? The threat, we are told, is remote. Yet this is a matter of belief. Maybe machines could do much of what we need to have done better than we could, with the exception of being human and caring as humans do.Yet even if no such revolution threatens, recent advances in artificial intelligence are highly significant.

But the locus of this new work has shifted from middle-paid production and clerical occupations prior to 1980 to highly paid professional and, secondarily, low-paid services thereafter. Thus, innovation has increasingly been hollowing out middle-income jobs.Furthermore, innovations generate new kinds of work only when they complement jobs, not when they replace them. Finally, the demand-eroding effects of automation have intensified in the past four decades, while the demand-increasing effects of augmentation have not. None of this is very cheering, especially since overall productivity growth has been quite modest since 1980. So what about the future? On this, an analysis by Goldman Sachs is both optimistic and sobering. It argues that the “combination of significant labour cost savings, new job creation, and a productivity boost for non-displaced workers raises the possibility of a labour productivity boom”. This would be similar to what ultimately followed the emergence of the electric motor and personal computer. The study estimates that generative AI, in particular, might raise annual growth of labour productivity in the US by 1.5 percentage points. The surge would be bigger in high-income countries than developing ones, though timing is uncertain. Globally, it suggests, 18 per cent of work could be automated by AI, again with larger effects in high-income countries. In the case of the US, the estimated share of work exposed to AI ranges from between 15 and 35 per cent. The most vulnerable jobs will be office and administrative, legal and architecture and engineering. The least exposed will be in construction, installation and maintenance.

 Generative AI, which is a type of artificial intelligence that can produce or create new content, has already started to impact the workplace in various ways. On the positive side, it can automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. For example, it can assist with data entry, customer service, and content creation. Additionally, it can help businesses to analyze and make sense of large amounts of data, leading to better decision-making.
However, the rise of generative AI also raises concerns about its impact on labor and employment. It is predicted that many jobs that involve routine tasks, such as data entry, customer service, and content creation, could be replaced by AI systems in the future. This means that some workers may need to reskill and transition into new roles to stay relevant in the job market.
Furthermore, generative AI has the potential to create new jobs that did not exist before. For example, it could lead to the creation of new job roles that involve working with and managing AI systems. However, it is unclear whether these new jobs will be enough to offset the job losses that may occur due to automation.
Overall, the impact of generative AI on labor and employment is complex and multifaceted. While it can bring about positive changes, it also poses challenges for workers and businesses.

For the most part, the humans have prevailed. Now, say some experts, with AI ubiquity on the horizon, the threat’s being realised: the robots really are coming for some jobs.A March 2023 report from Goldman Sachs estimated that AI capable of content generation could do a quarter of all the work currently done by humans. Across the European Union and US, the report further notes, 300 million jobs could be lost to automation. And that could be dire, says Martin Ford, author of Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything.“It's not just that this would happen to individuals, but it could be pretty systemic,” he says. “It could happen to a lot of people, potentially quite suddenly, potentially all at the same time. And that has implications not just for those individuals, but for the whole economy.”Thankfully, it’s not all bad news. The experts issue their warnings with a caveat: there are still things AI isn’t capable of – tasks that involve distinctly human qualities, like emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking. And moving into roles that centre those skills could help lessen the chances of being replaced.“I think there are generally three categories that are going to be relatively insulated in the foreseeable future,” says Ford. “The first would be jobs that are genuinely creative: you’re not doing formulaic work or just rearranging things, but you're genuinely coming up with new ideas and building something new.”Getty ImagesWhile a robot may ostensibly provide a faster diagnosis, patients will still want humans to guide and educate them (Credit: Getty Images)That doesn’t necessarily mean all jobs that are considered ‘creative’ are safe. In fact, things like graphic design and visual art-related roles may be among the first to go; basic algorithms can direct a bot to analyse millions of images, allowing AI to master aesthetics instantly. But there’s some security in other kinds of creativity, says Ford: “in science, and medicine and law … people whose job is coming up with a new legal strategy or business strategy. I think that there's going to continue to be a place there for human beings”. The second insulated category, he continues, is jobs that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships. He points to nurses, business consultants and investigative journalists. These are jobs, he says, “where you need a very deep understanding of people. I think it’ll be a long time before AI has the ability to interact in the kinds of ways that really build relationships”.The third safe zone, says Ford, “are jobs that really require lots of mobility and dexterity and problem-solving ability in unpredictable environments”. Many trade jobs – think electricians, plumbers, welders and the like – fall under this umbrella. “These are the kinds of jobs where you're dealing with a new situation all the time,” he adds. “They are probably the hardest of anything to automate. In order to automate jobs like this, you would need a science fiction robot. You’d need Star Wars’s C-3PO.”While humans will likely remain in jobs that fall within those categories, that doesn’t mean those professions are totally insulated from the ascent of AI. In fact, says Joanne Song McLaughlin, associate professor of labour economics at the University of Buffalo, US, most jobs, regardless of industry, have aspects that are likely to be automated by the technology.“In many cases, there’s no immediate threat to jobs,” she says, “but tasks will change.” Human jobs will become more focused on interpersonal skills, continues Song McLaughlin. “It’s easy to imagine that, for instance, AI will detect cancers way better than humans could. In the future, I’m assuming doctors will use that new technology. But I don’t think the doctor’s whole role will be replaced.”Getty ImagesTrade jobs and jobs that require a great deal of mobility are more likely to be insulated from automation (Credit: Getty Images)While a robot may ostensibly do a better job of finding cancer, she says, most people will still want a doctor – a real person – to be the one to tell them about it. That’s true of almost all jobs, she adds, and so developing those distinctly human skills could help people learn to do their jobs alongside AI.“I think it’s smart to really think, ‘what kind of tasks within my job will be replaced, or will be better done by computer or AI? And what's my complementary skill?’” She points to bank tellers, who once had to be very accurate money counters. Now, that task has been automated – but there’s still a place for the teller.  “The task of money counting became obsolete because of a machine,” she says. “But now, the tellers are more focused on connecting with customers and introducing new products. The social skill has become more important.” It’s important to note, says Ford, that an advanced education or a high-paying position is not a defence against AI takeover. “We might think the person in the white-collar job is higher on the food chain than someone who drives a car for a living,” he says. “But the white-collar employee’s future is more threatened than the Uber driver, because we still don’t have self-driving cars, but AI can certainly write reports. In many cases, more educated workers are going to be threatened more than the least educated workers. Think of the person that works cleaning hotel rooms – it's really hard to automate that job.” In short, seeking roles in dynamic, shifting environments that include unpredictable tasks is good way to stave off job loss to AI. At least, for a while.FeaturesHow we work",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By: Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are no longer futuristic concepts; they are now part of how we live and work. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration uses the term AI to describe a branch of computer science, statistics, and engineering that uses algorithms or models to perform tasks and exhibit behaviors such as learning, making decisions, and making predictions. ML is a subset of AI that uses data and algorithms, without being explicitly programmed, to imitate how humans learn. 

 

Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D.

AI/ML’s growth in data volume and complexity, combined with cutting-edge computing power and methodological advancements, have the potential to transform how stakeholders develop, manufacture, use, and evaluate therapies. Ultimately, AI/ML can help bring safe, effective, and high-quality treatments to patients faster. 
For example, AI/ML could be used to scan the medical literature for relevant findings and predict which individuals may respond better to treatments and which are more at risk for side effects. Conversational agents or chatbots, which are based on “generative” AI, have the potential to answer people’s questions about participating in clinical trials or reporting adverse events. Digital or computerized “twins” of patients can be used to model a medical intervention and provide biofeedback before patients receive the intervention.  
The regulatory uses are real: In 2021, more than 100 drug and biologic applicationsExternal Link Disclaimer submitted to the FDA included AI/ML components. These submissions spanned a range of therapeutic areas, and sponsors incorporated the technologies in different developmental stages.
As with other evolving fields of science and technology, there are challenges associated with AI/ML in drug development, such as ethical and security considerations like improper data sharing or cybersecurity risks. There are also concerns with using algorithms that have a degree of opacity, or algorithms that may have internal operations that are not visible to users or other interested parties. This can lead to amplification of errors or preexisting biases in the data. We aim to prevent and remedy discrimination — including algorithmic discrimination, which occurs when automated systems favor one category of people over other(s) — to advance equity when using AI/ML techniques. To address these concerns, the FDA has released a discussion paper, “Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Development of Drug and Biological Products.” 
AI and ML in the Development of Drug and Biological Products
The discussion paper is a collaboration among the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, including its Digital Health Center of Excellence. The paper aims to spur a discussion with interested parties in the medical products development community, such as pharmaceutical companies, ethicists, academia, patients and patient groups, and global counterpart regulatory and other authorities, on using AI/ML in drug and biologic development, and the development of medical devices to use with these treatments. 
The paper includes an overview of the current and potential future uses for AI/ML in therapeutic development. It also discusses the possible concerns and risks associated with these innovations and ways to address them. For instance, the paper describes the importance of having human involvement, which will vary depending on how the technologies will be used. The paper also emphasizes adopting a risk-based approach to evaluate and manage AI/ML in facilitating innovations and protecting public health. 
The paper characterizes certain risks, such as biases in data used to train ML algorithms, or inaccuracies and completeness of these data. In addition, the paper outlines the role of monitoring the performance of models to ensure they are reliable, relevant, and consistent over time. 
There are also questions to consider, and a call for engagement and collaboration among the biomedical community. As a follow-up to the paper, we are planning a workshop to discuss how the community can work together to realize the potential of AI/ML for product development while being mindful of potential challenges. We look forward to hearing from experts on this important topic. 
CDER’s Discussion Paper on the Framework for Regulatory Advanced Manufacturing Evaluation
To further address the use of AI in drug manufacturing, CDER issued another discussion paper, Artificial Intelligence in Drug Manufacturing, as part of the Framework for Regulatory Advanced Manufacturing Evaluation (FRAME) Initiative. AI technologies are important in drug manufacturing because they can enhance process controls, identify early warning signals, and prevent product losses. We are also planning a second workshop for stakeholders to discuss the questions in our AI in drug manufacturing discussion paper.
Our agency’s efforts in AI/ML extend beyond these initiatives. We consult product developers, engage patients, and promote regulatory science in this area, among other activities. As a public health regulatory agency, we hope to encourage the safe development of these technologies that are poised to help Americans gain quicker and more reliable access to important treatments. The FDA’s work also supports the Administration’s ongoing work to ensure technology improves the lives of the American people, while advancing a cohesive and comprehensive approach to AI-related risks and opportunities.

DelaneyMay 8, 2023Leer en españolBy midyear, all of Morgan Stanley’s thousands of wealth advisers are expected to have access to a new artificial-intelligence-powered chat tool.The tool, which is already in use by about 600 staff members, gives advisers answers to questions such as “Can you compare the investment cases for Apple, IBM and Microsoft?” and follow-ups such as “What are the risks of each of them?” An adviser can ask what to do if a client has a potentially valuable painting — and the knowledge tool might provide a list of steps to follow, along with the name of an internal expert who can help.“What we’re trying to do is make every client or every financial adviser as smart as the most knowledgeable expert on any given topic in real time,” said Jeff McMillan, the head of analytics, data and innovation for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.Experts disagree about whether A.I. will wind up destroying more jobs than it creates over time. But it is clear that A.I. will alter work for most knowledge workers, shifting the skills they need and changing the staffing needs of most companies. Now it’s up to business leaders to figure out how to take advantage of the technologies today, while preparing workers for the disruption that the tools present over the medium term.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMoving too slowly may mean losing out on gains in productivity, customer service and — ultimately — competitiveness, similar to what happened to businesses that didn’t embrace the internet fully or fast enough. But at the same time, leaders must guard against the mistakes and biases A.I. often perpetuates and be thoughtful about what it means for employees.“Almost no matter which sector you are in, you need to be thinking about your company as becoming an A.I.-first company,” said Alexandra Mousavizadeh, chief executive at Evident, a start-up that analyzes finance companies’ A.I. capabilities.The type of A.I. underlying Morgan Stanley’s tool for advisers is called generative A.I. It can create content — including text, images, audio and video — from information it has analyzed. In addition to answering questions, it can be used in countless other ways, such as drafting memos and emails, creating presentation slides and summarizing long documents. Early research suggests that tools built using generative A.I. could speed up many tasks and increase employee productivity.Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford researchers, for example, found that customer support staffs equipped with an A.I. tool that suggested responses resolved 14 percent more customer issues each hour on average.But the gains were not evenly spread. Less-experienced workers made greater productivity jumps, because the tools effectively “captured and disseminated” the practices of their higher-skilled colleagues. Other recent M.I.T. research similarly noted that workers who weren’t initially as good at tasks managed to narrow the gap with those who were more skilled, performing better and taking less time when aided by A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOne possible conclusion from these findings is “that the advantage that someone had from tenure in terms of their performance has now diminished because a youngster with ChatGPT can perform as well as somebody who’s had a few years’ experience,” said Azeem Azhar, chairman of Exponential View, a research group. If the research plays out in broader practice, that could potentially lead some companies to invest more in junior staff members, while going lighter on more expensive workers who have been around longer.Some companies are already starting to make staffing decisions based on the anticipated impact of A.I. tools. IBM recently said it was slowing or stopping hiring for some back-office roles, such as human-resources functions, that could be replaced by A.I. over the next several years.The speed and productivity gains from A.I. will raise customer expectations, said Bivek Sharma, the chief technology officer for PwC Global Tax and Legal Services. “It’s then about making sure we can re-skill the work force quickly enough and A.I.-enable them quickly enough to meet the obvious demand that’s going to come on the back of it,” he said.PwC is working with Harvey, an A.I. start-up creating tools for lawyers, to roll out a chat A.I. tool to its entire legal advisory practice over the next few months. It plans to extend such technology to its tax and human resources experts as well.Beyond quickly providing staff members with answers that draw on the firm’s expertise, PwC’s goal is to generate new insights, including eventually by analyzing its clients’ data as well, Mr. Sharma said. The A.I. could potentially be fed all of the contracts of two companies contemplating a merger, for example, and allow PwC experts to query for specific types of provisions and risks.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Think of this as really an augmentation play rather than a timesaving play for us,” Mr. Sharma said. “This is almost like a senior associate that is attached to every one of our legal and tax advisers augmenting what they can do day to day for their clients.”Larger companies generally need to invest in A.I.-savvy technical staff members, who can adapt the technology for their business. Already, “there are companies that can’t adopt ChatGPT because they simply don’t have the sort of basic rails upon which to run it on, which is content management and the data in order,” Ms. Mousavizadeh said.They also need to hire or train new specialists, for roles that don’t necessarily require technical expertise. Morgan Stanley’s Mr. McMillan and other corporate executives say the A.I. platforms require continuous “tuning,” with humans adjusting parameters and information sources to get the best results for users. This tuning has created a need for a new group of workers known as “prompt engineers” or “knowledge engineers.” Morgan Stanley and PwC are among those building their own versions of A.I. chat tools that draw from internal materials.Concerns about security, confidentiality, accuracy and intellectual property rights have led many companies to restrict their staffs’ access to public ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools. They want to avoid what reportedly happened at Samsung, where employees working in its semiconductor division are said to have shared confidential computer code and meeting notes while using ChatGPT. Executives are also concerned about the frequent errors and built-in biases with some A.I. tools.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut part of the opportunity with tools that use generative A.I., which allow users to type questions or commands in normal language, is to include a broader group of nontechnical staff members in figuring out how it can change a company’s business. “Your people should be using these tools really, really regularly so they can start to build up their competencies and your own internal firm competencies,” Mr. Azhar said.He suggests that A.I. public tools can be used in ways that don’t endanger confidentiality or security. For example, an employee could ask ChatGPT about the best ways to combine types of sales data to tell a compelling story without actually entering the data itself. The opportunity, he says, comes from “front-line employees of whatever seniority deciding to improve their work through generative tools.”Kevin J.

A representative for Octopus Energy told Insider: ""Our team supervises the answers AI provides, so, for example, drafting a personalized response that a team member can review and then send on.""Workers at other companies recently reported on the experience of using AI tools to help carry out their work. One worker told Vice that OpenAI's ChatGPT did 80% of their job.Jackson told the Times of London that the development was unlikely to lead to job losses at his company but that the pace of AI technology had the potential to cause ""huge and rapid dislocation"" to the job market.In March, a report from Goldman Sachs found that generative AI tools like ChatGPT could lead to ""significant disruption"" in the labor market and affect around 300 million full-time jobs globally.

Only 4% of C-suite level respondents said they consider the risks associated with using AI to be “significant,"" and less than half said they have AI expertise at the board level.These figures spotlight a concerning reality: many organizations are underprepared for AI, lacking the proper oversight and expertise from key decision-makers to manage risk. And if unaddressed, organizational blind spots around the technology’s ethical and effective deployment are likely to overshadow transformative opportunities while causing organizations to lose pace with the explosive growth of the technology. Have you read?As AI develops rapidly, what is the future ethical cost?4 ways AI is helping humans make informed decisionsHere's how companies should navigate generative AI in the world of workHow is generative AI changing the risk landscape? These days, AI-related progress and adoption is happening at an exponential rate – some argue too quickly. While this exponential growth has renewed focus on the use of AI, the reality is that academics, scientists, policy-makers, legal professionals and others have been campaigning for some time now for the ethical and legal use and deployment of AI, particularly in the workplace where existing applications of AI in the HR function are abundant (e.g., talent acquisition, administrative duties, employee training). According to our survey, 75% of companies already use AI tools and technology for hiring and HR purposes.In this new phase of generative AI, core tenets around AI adoption – such as governance, accountability and transparency – are more important than ever, as are concerns over the consequences of poorly deployed AI.For example, unchecked algorithms can result in biased and discriminatory outcomes, perpetuating inequities and dampening workforce diversity progress. Data privacy and breaches are another concern, easily occurring through the non-anonymization and collection of employee data.Generative AI has also given way to new IP considerations, raising questions around ownership of both inputs and outputs from third-party programmes and subsequent copyright infringement concerns. Broadly, we have seen governments and regulators scrambling to implement AI-related legislation and regulatory enforcement mechanisms. In the US, a key focus of emerging legislation will be on the use case of AI in hiring and HR-related operations. Litigation, including class actions, is also on the horizon. We are already seeing the first wave of generative AI IP litigation in the US, and these early court decisions are shaping the legal landscape absent of existing regulation. Organizations who implement generative AI also should assume that data fed into AI tools and queries will be collected by third-party providers of the technology. In some cases, these providers will have rights to use and/or disclose these inputs. As employers look to equip their workforces with generative AI tools, are they putting sensitive data and trade secrets at risk? In short, yes. All in all, each new development seems to open questions faster than organizations, regulators and courts can answer them.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

To stay ahead, organizations will need to move current approaches beyond siloed efforts and bring together discrete functions under the umbrella of a strong governance framework. While many organizations rely on data scientists to spearhead AI initiatives, all relevant stakeholders, including legal, the C-suite, boards, privacy, compliance and HR, need to be involved throughout the entire decision-making process.This representation gap was made clear in our survey findings. Currently, only 54% of respondents said their organization involves HR in the decision-making process for AI tools, and only 36% of respondents said they have a Chief AI Officer (CAIO) in place. In this high-risk environment, the CAIO will play a critical role in ensuring relevant governance and oversight is in place at the C-Suite level and involve HR in training and fostering a cross-functional AI team. Hand in hand with this, organizations should prepare and follow an internal governance framework that accounts for enterprise risks across use cases and allows the company to efficiently make the correct compliance adjustments once issues are identified. The risk for companies with no AI governance structure and a lack of oversight from key stakeholders – or ones that rely wholesale on third-party tools – is the use of AI tools in a way that creates organizational legal liability (e.g., discrimination claims). Virtually all decision-making, whether AI-based or otherwise, creates bias. Companies that use these tools must develop a framework that identifies an approach to assessing bias and a mechanism for testing and avoiding unlawful bias, as well as ensuring relevant data privacy requirements are met.Efforts to combat bias should be further supported by effective measures for pre and post-deployment testing.Companies who deploy AI must also ensure that there are processes in place that provide a clear understanding of the data sets being used, algorithmic functionality and technological limitations, as proposed legislation will likely include reporting requirements. The final outlook for AI The takeaway is simple: AI is being widely and quickly adopted and provides many benefits. But it is being rolled out and developed so rapidly that strategic oversight and governance become even more critical for its responsible use and risk mitigation.Many organizations both are unprepared for AI and underappreciate the risks, making the willingness to deploy this technology without proper guardrails concerning. Fortunately, by establishing strong governance and oversight structures, organizations can withstand these technological tides no matter where they are in their AI journeys.Beyond this, the longer-term solution to managing AI-related risk will rely on informed stakeholders across legal, regulatory and the private sector joining forces to advance legislation, codes of practice or guidance frameworks that recognize both the opportunities and risks the technology presents. With a secure framework in place, organizations can enable themselves to deploy AI technology and harness its benefits more confidently.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on Tech and InnovationSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Forum InstitutionalEmerging TechnologiesShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

The question ""do we really need to go to the office?"" is something many employees are asking in the face of the leadership at major companies like Amazon, Apple, Disney, Starbucks, and JP Morgan mandating three or more days a week of office-based work. Employees are adamant that they are doing their jobs effectively at home, and data supports the improved productivity of remote work. But many leaders feel concerned about a range of issues, from problematic communication and coordination to cybersecurity, which they feel remote work undermines.


However, with the advent of generative AI like ChatGPT, we are on the cusp of realizing the full potential of remote and hybrid work by reducing - while not eliminating - the benefits of office visits. AI is not just a futuristic buzzword; it's a transformative force that's reshaping the workplace and redefining the meaning of work itself.

I talk to five-ten leaders each week about hybrid and remote work, and in recent months, our conversations have centered on how generative AI can help us unlock the full power of remote and hybrid workforces. That includes enabling more effective information sharing, enhancing communication and collaboration, improving productivity and efficiency, supporting knowledge management and skill development, and ensuring security and privacy.

PROMOTED
Communication and Coordination
No more watercooler gossip, but who needs it when AI-powered tools can help us share information and coordinate more effectively than ever? AI-driven applications reduce the need for physical office spaces, making remote work a breeze by facilitating instant access to relevant data and documents, streamlining communication channels for optimal collaboration, and providing intelligent recommendations for meetings, resources, and priorities. Imagine your office as a well-orchestrated symphony, with AI as the virtuoso conductor.

By integrating AI into information sharing systems, remote workers can quickly locate the necessary resources to complete their tasks, reducing the time spent searching for documents or waiting for colleagues to respond to queries. This efficient distribution of knowledge empowers employees to work independently while still maintaining a sense of connection to their colleagues and the organization as a whole.

Loneliness and isolation can be remote work's kryptonite, but AI comes to the rescue with innovative solutions that empower communication and collaboration. By harnessing the power of AI, remote workers can leverage smart tools to enhance video conferencing, document sharing, and project management. AI can help remote workers video conference like pros by adjusting factors like lighting, the background image, and even the ""smoothness"" of participants' faces. This helps remote workers look their best on camera and ensures that they can put forward a consistent, professional appearance. AI also makes live video conferences more efficient by providing features like real-time transcription, translation, and captioning.

AI is a productivity powerhouse that can free remote workers from the shackles of repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities. With AI's help, remote workers can automate mundane tasks and streamline workflows for maximum efficiency. By analyzing patterns in employee behavior and performance, AI can identify areas for improvement and provide tailored recommendations for optimization. This enables remote workers to manage their time effectively and prioritize tasks in a way that maximizes productivity and minimizes burnout.
In a remote work environment, knowledge is power, and AI is the key to unlocking it. AI empowers remote workers to access and share knowledge by identifying experts and curating relevant content tailored to individual needs. By utilizing natural language processing and machine learning, AI can understand queries and provide personalized answers, enabling remote workers to access timely and relevant information. AI can also curate and organize information from various sources and present it in a user-friendly way, streamlining the process of locating and absorbing knowledge.
AI supports skill development by personalizing learning paths and offering customized resources for remote workers. By analyzing individual strengths, weaknesses, and interests, AI can recommend targeted training programs and learning materials that enable remote employees to continually expand their skillsets and stay competitive in the job market. AI also facilitates the exchange of best practices, feedback, and advice among peers, creating a supportive and growth-oriented remote work environment.
Cybersecurity and Privacy
Remote work often raises concerns about data security and privacy, but AI has our backs. AI-powered tools can help ensure the security and privacy of remote workers by detecting and preventing cyberattacks with advanced threat intelligence. By continuously monitoring networks and devices for any signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity, AI can quickly identify potential vulnerabilities and neutralize threats before they escalate.
Additionally, AI can encrypt data and enforce policies to safeguard sensitive information, ensuring that remote workers can confidently access and share company resources without compromising security. This is especially important in industries that handle sensitive data, such as finance and healthcare, where a security breach could have severe consequences.
Health and Wellbeing
AI can also improve the well-being and quality of life of remote workers by monitoring health indicators, providing feedback and reminders, and predicting mental health issues. By analyzing data from wearables and other health monitoring devices, AI can provide personalized recommendations for maintaining physical and mental well-being. This might include suggestions for exercise, diet, and sleep, as well as reminders to take breaks and practice stress-reducing techniques.
By identifying patterns of behavior that may indicate burnout or other mental health concerns, AI can alert remote workers and their managers to potential issues before they become serious problems. This proactive approach to mental health can help create a healthier and more supportive remote work environment, fostering long-term employee satisfaction and retention.
Managing AI Risks
While the benefits of generative AI for remote and hybrid work are immense, it's important to recognize and address the potential risks associated with the widespread adoption of AI technology. By proactively managing these risks, organizations can confidently harness the power of AI to revolutionize the way we work.
One potential risk is the legal liability associated with AI-driven decisions and actions. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated and autonomous, questions arise about who is legally responsible when an AI system makes an error or causes harm. Organizations must take steps to ensure that clear guidelines and regulations are in place to determine the extent of their liability in such cases, as well as establish robust governance frameworks for AI decision-making.
Another challenge to consider is the potential for bias in AI algorithms. Since AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data, they may inadvertently learn and perpetuate existing biases present in the data. This could lead to unfair treatment of certain individuals or groups, resulting in legal and ethical concerns. To mitigate this risk, organizations must prioritize transparency, fairness, and accountability in their AI systems by conducting regular audits, using diverse training datasets, and ensuring that stakeholders are involved in the development and deployment of AI technology.
Privacy and data protection are also critical concerns when using AI in remote and hybrid work environments. Organizations must ensure that they are compliant with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and implement robust privacy policies to safeguard personal information. This includes obtaining explicit consent from remote workers to collect and process their data, as well as implementing strong encryption and access controls to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or misuse.
Moreover, the reliance on AI technology in remote work may raise concerns about job displacement and the future of work. While AI can automate repetitive tasks and improve productivity, there's a risk that some jobs may become obsolete, leading to workforce displacement and social disruption. To address this challenge, organizations must invest in reskilling and upskilling their workforce, ensuring that employees can adapt to the changing job landscape and remain competitive in the age of AI.
Conclusion
The benefits of generative AI for remote and hybrid work are immense. By enabling more effective information sharing, enhancing communication and collaboration, improving productivity and efficiency, supporting knowledge management and skill development, and ensuring security and privacy, AI is revolutionizing the way we work and making it less important than ever to go to the office.
Still, it's crucial for organizations to proactively manage the associated risks and ensure legal liability is properly addressed. By doing so, they can confidently embrace AI technology to unlock the full potential of remote and hybrid workforces and pave the way for a more flexible, efficient, and fulfilling work experience.
The future of work is here, and AI is the driving force behind this transformation. As we continue to embrace AI technology, we can unlock the full potential of remote and hybrid workforces and pave the way for a more flexible, efficient, and fulfilling work experience. It's time to embrace the AI revolution and harness its power to redefine the very concept of work, creating opportunities for growth and innovation that extend far beyond the confines of the traditional office space.

The Hot New Job That Pays Six Figures: AI Prompt EngineeringAdobe Stock

We're now a little under halfway there, and while I’m still not sure exactly how well that prediction will play out, we’ve certainly seen some dramatic changes to the way we work.

One job that’s currently being tipped to have a bright future is the newly emerging field of prompt engineering. A prompt engineer is someone who is an expert at getting the new generation of generative AI applications such as ChatGPT or Google Bard to do what they want.

Reportedly, prompt engineers require little to nothing in the way of technical knowledge. After all, as Andrej Karpathy, former head of AI at Tesla and now working for ChatGPT creator OpenAI, puts it, ""the hottest new programming language is English."" What’s more, it’s a role that’s currently commanding salaries of up to $335,000.

These sorts of tools put a lot of power in people’s hands, but if everyone has access to the same technology, how can we use it while still expressing our individuality and creativity? And how do we make sure our work stands out above that of other people and creates a competitive edge for our businesses?

This is where prompt engineering skills come in. Learning to get the best results from generative AI is a skill that needs to be learned and honed, just like becoming professionally adept in any other computer software.
Often this can be an iterative process. A vague, general prompt will get a vague, general response, but it's a start, and from there, it can be refined. The engineer uses their human judgment and communication skills to spot what's lacking in the AI-generated work and refines their prompts until they get the result they want.
Using natural language generating (NLG) AI like ChatGPT to write the code for a useful software application is a good example.
Say you have an idea for a new app – you might want to create a tool that lets shift workers at your company arrange ride-sharing journeys to work and back home in order to reduce the business’s carbon footprint.
If you simply tell ChatGPT to write this app for you, it’s going to fall over. The code is too complex for it to output in one go, and it doesn’t have the data it needs to do the job.
It's perfectly possible that it can do it, though – if the job is broken down into appropriate chunks and if it's provided with all the necessary data.
A good prompt engineer can be thought of as a “project manager” for an AI workforce, overseeing the completion of individual tasks that make up the job and ensuring all the workers (AI agents) have the tools (data) they need to get it done.
Another useful concept in prompt engineering is roles. This allows more relevant and engaging responses to be generated by defining the “persona” of the AI. Just as a human might answer a question a different way depending on whether they are, for example, a teacher, a scientist, a philosopher, or a comedian, a prompt engineer can define a personality, traits, and beliefs that should inform the AI’s responses.

What skills are needed?
Many of the skills needed to get the best results from generative AI applications are those that we consider to be soft skills as opposed to hard, technical skills.
First and perhaps foremost are communication skills. You need to be able to express what you want the AI to do in a precise and clear way, just like if you were giving instructions or training to a human workforce.
You will need attention to detail – the greater depth you can go into about exactly what type of response or content you are looking for, the more successful you will be at prompt engineering.
Also essential are good organizational skills. You need to be able to identify the individual elements of a piece of work and instruct the AI on how to work through them systematically.
Data skills are very useful, too, as you need to be able to work out what information the AI needs to get the job done, where to find it, and what format it should be in to get the AI to process it.
Subject matter expertise is also beneficial, as not every output from generative AI applications is correct, and people with subject knowledge will find it easier to evaluate the responses.
You also need the ability to think critically in order to assess the different approaches that can be taken to getting the AI to complete a given task and decide which ones are likely to work.
And project management and planning skills are important in order to identify areas where generative AI can be useful within your organization and roll-out strategies for using it to create value.

Who is hiring prompt engineers?
Companies ranging from digital advertising agencies to software developers, healthcare providers, and utility companies are advertising for prompt engineers.
Time reports that the number of job postings containing GPT rose by 51% between 2021 and 2022.
California AI startup Anthropic says that its roles are a hybrid of ""programming, instructing and teaching"" and advertises salaries of between $280,000 and $375,000.
London-based digital agency Rehab is looking for prompt engineers who can prototype new applications of LLM technology, develop their ability to fine-tune and communicate with language models, and maintain an up-to-date knowledge of the field.
And Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts is looking for prompt engineers to deploy large language models to assist with healthcare research and clinical practice.

How Do I Learn Prompt Engineering?
Although it's a very new field, there are already a number of courses available online that will teach the ins and outs of prompt engineering.
Online course portal Udemy offers a number of courses in generative AI prompt engineering, including ones focused on mastering ChatGPT and using Midjourney to create AI images.
The Next-Level Prompt Engineering with AI online course promises to teach students to create effective prompts that will give them a competitive edge over everyone else trying to use AI to automate their tasks.
Cloud Academy has a super-short beginner-level introduction called ChatGPT Prompt Engineering that teaches the basics of chaining prompts together, as well as training ChatGPT to take on a specialist role.
Datacamp also has an Introduction to ChatGPT course that teaches best practices for writing prompts, as well as covering ways that the chatbot can be used across different businesses.
And Class Central has a number of free prompt engineering courses, including Prompt Engineering Overview, A Crash Course on Chat GPT for Beginners, Get Started with Midjourney, and Automate Useful Professional Tasks Using Open AI.

Universities have been scrabbling to understand what AI applications such as ChatGPT are capable of and introduce guidance on how they can be used - and now, they're being urged to teach students how to use them. Academics at the University of Bath have been considering the challenges and opportunities.""Our first question was, 'Could this be used by students to answer our assessment questions?'"" James Fern says of ChatGPT - an online tool that can answer questions, including producing essays and emails, in human-like language.James has been looking at how robust his department's assessments are""Multiple choice questions, for example, it will handle those very well.""We definitely were not expecting it to do as well as it did... it was getting close to 100% correct.""But with more complex questions, which require students to think critically and which he says make up the bulk of assessment, it struggles.One example, from a final-year assessment, reads: ""Why is it important to understand the timing of exercise in relation to nutrition status in people with [a technical term, according to James] overweight?""And there are tell-tale signs the answer given by ChatGPT was not written by a student. ""On first glance, it looks very good - it looks very clearly written, it looks quite professional in its language,"" James says.But some of the statements are more like those of a GCSE pupil than a university student. It has a habit of repeating the exact phrasing of the question in its introductions and conclusions, ""just written in slightly different ways"".And when citing sources of information, as is standard in academic work, it simply makes them up.""They look perfect - they've got the right names of authors, they've got the right names of journals, the titles all sound very sensible - they just don't exist,"" James says.""If you're not aware of how large language models work, you would be very easily fooled into thinking that these are genuine references.""Big Tech bosses told to protect public from AI risksAI investigated in UK over fears of dominationAI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'Since ChatGPT was released to the public, about six months ago, many students have been unsure when they can and cannot use it.""I might be tempted to use ChatGPT... but currently, I'm too scared to because you can get caught,"" says one student walking between classes on campus.""It's not clear yet what is considered cheating with ChatGPT,"" another says. ""If you copied your whole assignment from ChatGPT that's cheating - but it can be really helpful to guide.""Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said in a speech on Monday that AI was ""making a difference in schools and universities already"", and suggested it could help school teachers with lesson plans and marking.  New advice from Quality Assurance Agency, which reviews standards at UK universities, urges them to equip students with AI skills they can take into the world of work.It encourages them to explain to new and returning students, in September, how and when AI should be used - and to adapt courses where appropriate. Marketing lecturer Kim Watts calls it ""another tool in the toolbox"". And some students in her department have already started using ChatGPT this term, in coursework that asks them to produce a marketing plan.Kim says ChatGPT will help get ""students started on things""""I'm suggesting that students go to ChatGPT, those who maybe don't know where to start... and start playing around with prompts,"" she says.""It won't give them the answers - but it can give them ideas.""'Critical thinking'Kim demonstrates by asking ChatGPT to produce its own marketing plan.It responds with a series of numbered points - everything from the creation of a brand identity to the use of social media. But Kim, looking up from her screen, says: ""This will not pass.""Submitting something like this is just not detailed enough - it doesn't show us any learning, it doesn't show any critical thinking.""Neurodivergent students and those for whom English is not their first language will benefit most from ChatGPT, Kim says.But any student choosing to use it will be asked to submit their ChatGPT prompts and answers as an appendix, to make it ""really clear how far they have come"" from the chatbot answers.Summer examsAs with most universities, Bath's policy on ChatGPT and other AI tools is still in the works. It is due to be in place from September. After that, a team will meet throughout the year to ensure it keeps up with the rapidly changing technology.In the meantime, many staff are once again setting in-person, invigilated summer exams. Dr Chris Bonfield, the head of a team that helps design assessments, says the ""default assumption"" is students should not be using ChatGPT this year. And, if staff decide to allow it, they should clearly set out their expectations.The pace at which the technology is evolving poses a challenge for universities - but Bath quickly moved away from conversations about banning it.Chris says the pace at which the technology changes poses a challenge for universities""This tool is not going away,"" Chris says.""In order to ensure our students are equipped with the skills they need for the future workplace, but also that our degrees remain current, we're going to have to engage.""'Too dangerous'Last week Geoffrey Hinton, widely regarded as the godfather of AI, resigned from Google, saying he regretted his work - and chatbots could soon be more intelligent than humans.Prof Verena Rieser, a computer scientist at Heriot-Watt University who has been working in the AI field for two decades, says her own students are ""using it in very creative ways"" - but chatbots are still in the early stages of development and ""can be used to generate misinformation at [a] scale which is obviously very concerning"" when it comes to education. Previous models of ChatGPT were not released because they were deemed ""too dangerous"", she says.Its developer, OpenAI, says ""like any technology, these tools come with real risks"" and it works ""to ensure safety is built into our system at all levels"".Since ChatGPT's launch, other companies have focused their efforts on AI. Google, for example, released Bard, which is available to adults only.""I would expect that we'll soon see different flavours of ChatGPT by different companies out there and hopefully also safer models which actually mitigate for the possible dangers,"" Verena says.""At this moment we don't really know how to stop the models outputting information which is wrong or toxic or hateful - and that's a big problem.""Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

The release of generative AI tools like ChatGPT to the public has prompted consternation about privacy and the spread of misinformation and bias. Not long after Microsoft released an AI-powered version of its search tool, Bing, to a select group of users in February, Bing threatened a philosophy professor with blackmail.A month later, some of the biggest names in tech signed an open letter urging the world’s leading artificial intelligence labs to pause training their super-powerful computer systems for six months, arguing that recent advances in AI present “profound risks to society and humanity.” In an op-ed in TIME the same day, Eliezer Yudkowsky, a decision theorist who leads the nonprofit Machine Intelligence Research Institute, urged the labs to shut down their research entirely. “Many researchers steeped in these issues, including myself, expect that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI, under anything remotely like the current circumstances, is that literally everyone on Earth will die,” he wrote.But Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella isn’t worried. Microsoft has put at least $13 billion into OpenAI, the lab that launched ChatGPT in November; both Microsoft and Google rolled out products in March that they say will use AI to transform work—Google with AI powered features in Workspace that auto generate images, write and rewrite documents, and sort email; Microsoft with Copilot, an AI-based tool that works across its 365 suite of software (Word, Excel, Outlook) to summarize meetings, draft emails, and analyze data.In a May 8 interview, Nadella said Microsoft has done its best to mitigate unintended consequences of AI. Copilot, for example, does not create content or send emails without a human first entering data that guides the AI’s response. Such AI solutions, he says, will do our drudge work, freeing us to do the creative tasks where humans excel.Read More: The AI Arms Race Is Changing EverythingWhile skeptics cite big concerns about job displacement with this new wave of AI, Nadella argues that AI can democratize access to new skills, helping displaced workers find new jobs. Anyone can use generative AI—essentially algorithms that can create new content, including emails, white papers, and even code—as a partner at work, even if they don’t have a traditional education. That means that more people can become software engineers or security analysts, because they’ll be working alongside skilled AI. Microsoft thinks the world can sustain a billion professional developers and that AI can help quicken that growth.“That’s why AI is exciting,” he says. “We need new technology to help us with the economic growth that we enjoyed in the early part of the 20th century. What if we can have that type of economic growth this time around, but it’s much more even?”It’s true that productivity growth has been stunted in the U.S. After rising at an average rate of 2.8% between 1948 and 1970, productivity growth slowed to just 1.4% in the last 15 years. One reason for this slowdown, put forward by the economist Robert Gordon, is that we lack the technological advancements that came before 1970, like indoor plumbing, commercial air travel and the widespread adoption of communications technology. (The U.S. also saw a boost of productivity in the 1990s after the adoption of the PC.)Nadella thinks AI might bring productivity growth back to the halcyon days of the mid-20th century. Yes, there are risks to deploying AI, he says—jobs may be displaced, people may have to go through transitions, and AI may learn biases because the information it learns from comes from real people, who themselves have biases. But the benefits of AI could outweigh the risks.Microsoft’s own data suggests that the way we work today is broken. Microsoft’s Work Trends Index, released on May 9, shows that nearly two in three people polled say they struggle with having the time and energy to do their own job. The index surveyed 31,000 workers across 31 markets in February and March of 2023, and found that across Microsoft’s 365 software, the average employee spends a whopping 57% of their time communicating, and the rest creating. As a result, creativity is lagging; nearly two in three managers say they are concerned about a lack of innovation or breakthroughs on their teams.Of course, even if AI does alleviate some of the negative parts of people’s jobs, it might create new issues for much of the workforce in the process. AI can and probably will displace jobs. It can and probably will provide more misinformation into a world already full of it. It can and probably will exacerbate existing racial biases, since it learns from information already available in the world. And perhaps most pertinent for people already overwhelmed with information at work: it can and probably will create even more information for us to sift through.“AI is both going to be responsible for helping us manage a lot more knowledge but also creating a lot more knowledge that we will have to handle,” says Rowan Curran, an analyst at Forrester who researches AI and machine learning.Nadella contends that the benefits of AI—Microsoft’s AI, at least—will outweigh the potential negatives. After all, Microsoft put humans in the center of AI design by choice, he says, which in itself mitigates unintended consequences, he says. And, he notes, there is already healthy dialogue between governments and companies about what kind of regulation there should be on AI. “At the end of the day, I think we will all be judged by one thing alone, which is, “Do the benefits far outweigh anything that are the societal consequences?”That said, Microsoft has actively resisted European Union efforts to regulate the use of AI. The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act could ban certain uses of AI like facial recognition technologies, but Microsoft and Google have lobbied to ensure that “general purpose AI” of the kind that ChatGPT is based on is not covered in the regulations. Nadella said he was unfamiliar with what Microsoft may or may not be doing in Europe. He also refused to commit to any limits on the use of AI in military applications—relevant because competitor Google had to forgo a contract with the military that used AI to interpret video images and could have been used for drone strikes after thousands of workers signed a letter in protest.Read More: The New AI-Powered Bing Is Threatening Users. That’s No Laughing MatterOf course, we still don’t know the societal consequences of relatively unchecked AI usage. Critics say they could be dire, and that even AI developers do not understand the possibilities. Nadella says that this type of complexity or uncertainty aren’t unusual—we study science because we don’t fully understand it, after all.Today’s AI, he argues, fulfills the promise of the modern computer industry, which was founded in part to create tools to help the human mind understand more of the world around it. Way back in 1945, for example, in a seminal 1945 essay in The Atlantic, Vannevar Bush, an engineer who led the U.S. Office of Scientific and Research Development, suggested that further human advancement could only come if man mechanized his records more completely.AI may be the next step in this development, Nadella says, arguing that calls on companies to stop working with AI are, in some ways, calls to stop embracing economic growth. And this growth, because it’s so accessible, doesn’t have to be limited to Silicon Valley or even the U.S., but can be more widespread, he says.“Creating technologies that allow us as humans to be able to increase our knowledge, do science, and help the human condition is what has been core to enlightenment,” he says. “And so therefore trying to say, ‘Well, now is the time to stop,’ that doesn’t seem the right approach.”It may seem surprising that Microsoft, which not long ago seemed like it was falling behind competitors to its hoary Word and Outlook offerings, is talking about providing products that are the “core to enlightenment.” In the 2010s, as Apple and Google introduced new operating systems including web-based apps that stole Microsoft customers, some analysts were writing off Microsoft as a doomed business because of its focus on software that could easily be replaced, says Jason Wong, an analyst at Gartner. But Nadella, who took the helm in 2014, recognized the value of the cloud, and of artificial intelligence, Wong says. Microsoft’s share price has risen nearly tenfold since Nadella took the helm; the S&P 500 has merely doubled its value over the same time.The AI arms race is just beginning. For now, though, AI is showing up in something not very intimidating and perhaps even a little disappointing: applications like Word, Outlook, and Excel, the productivity software that many people have used for years and that would certainly be hard to imagine taking over the world and killing us all.That said, researchers have admitted that they don’t always understand why generative AI produces the results it does. As Microsoft lifts the lid off of its AI, releasing Copilot to more customers (its initial launch was for 20 enterprise customers) and integrating more AI like the open image generator DALL-E into PowerPoint, what is so scary is that no one—not even Satya Nadella—knows what is going to happen next.",,,,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6278179/satya-nadella-ai-concerns/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,,,2023-05-10T19:57:50.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/Lsj8tliq.m3u8,https://time.com/6278179/satya-nadella-ai-concerns/,PT7M21S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize almost every industry. It also poses significant risks to society and humanity, which is why it is crucial to have robust guidance and resources from both public and private sectors to ensure its positive impact. Along those lines, the Biden-Harris administration recently released a fact sheet about their efforts to safeguard people's rights and safety while maximizing the benefits of this groundbreaking technology.


One area where AI can either bolster or undermine progress is in corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. I spoke with several experts to explore the potential positive and negative outcomes of AI on DEI efforts, as well as how to ensure that AI is helping, rather than harming, those efforts.

Positive Potential 
There are several ways in which AI can be used to further workplace DEI efforts. These include improvements to hiring and performance management processes, bias detection in content, and identifying patterns of discrimination.

PROMOTED
""AI can be leveraged at almost every point in the recruiting process, from onboarding to pipeline management to employee experience and engagement,” shared Ariel Lopez, founder and CEO of Knac.

“AI algorithms can flag biases and improve hiring, performance management, and compensation policies helping to ensure equal opportunities for employee growth,"" added Shawn Ramirez, VP of data science at Glue. “AI recruiting tools can help companies balance the pool of candidates by improving the inclusivity of language used in job descriptions, and by sourcing candidates from underrepresented groups. AI for employee engagement can help a company surface when underrepresented groups feel disengaged, unearth root causes, and launch targeted interventions and support programs to improve retention and advancement among a diverse range of employees.”

Sarah Allali, CEO of Floode, explained, “AI models can play a crucial role in promoting diversity and equity at all stages of the employee journey. By replacing quantitative questionnaires with more nuanced analysis of employees' qualitative feedback, companies can gain a deeper understanding of their employees and identify patterns of discrimination. Also, a properly trained AI can understand individuals in a deeper and more comprehensive way than managers. AI can precisely comprehend the context and problems of each person, and take into account specific parameters to make decisions and create consensus that surpasses the limitations of managers.”

In addition to AI tools that can help companies boost DEI efforts, there are many stories from employees who have been able to leverage AI to improve their work communications. This can be particularly impactful for employees that are working in their non-native language, and neurodivergent employees that have barriers to communication. This increased ability to communicate effectively can lead to a greater sense of belonging in the workplace.

Negative Potential 
While AI can help promote DEI, there are risks involved if it is not properly designed and implemented. AI has the potential to perpetuate existing biases, and is only as good as the data that it is trained on.
""Existing patterns of bias and discrimination that lurk in the workplace also lurk in data. Without DEI-conscious development, AI will pick up these patterns and return outputs that can perpetuate and even exacerbate biases,"" shared Ramirez. ""AI systems should be carefully developed, monitored, and tested for fairness, explainability and inclusivity to mitigate these risks.""
Shirin Nikaein, co-founder and CEO of Upful.ai, added, “It's important to understand what data was used to train the AI and if the creators considered how bias in the data could impact the outcomes. When you use AI to have full control and make decisions, not just augment or help a manual process, and when folks don't fully understand how the AI is making that decision, it can perpetuate and amplify bias.”
It’s also important to recognise that AI cannot replace trained DEI practitioners – it can only be used to intentionally scale their expertise.
Latesha Byrd, CEO of Perfeqta, cautioned, ""DEI is based on human experiences, which means companies cannot let the convenience of AI override the human element when making decisions about equity.""
Risk Mitigation
To ensure that AI is helping rather than harming DEI efforts, companies should regularly audit algorithms to ensure they are free from discriminatory elements and take measures to secure and protect the data collected and used for AI systems. Companies should also have a trained human in the loop to review AI outputs and intervene when necessary.
“To ensure responsible and ethical AI innovation that supports DEI efforts, companies must adopt safeguards such as diverse and representative data sets, regular audits, transparent AI systems and clear ethical guidelines,” shared Nikita Gupta, co-founder of careerflow.ai.
Alejandro Martinez Agenjo, CEO and co-founder of Erudit, noted the importance of both public and private AI guardrails. ""As policymakers work on developing rules around AI, it's important for people-first organizations to come together and create their guidelines, to ensure ethical and equitable use of the technology,""
One of the initiatives that the Biden-Harris administration announced involves $140 million in R&D funding to launch seven new National AI Research Institutes.
Christina Blacken, founder and CEO of The New Quo, saw the potential in that funding. “One of the biggest problems with Generative AI is that it's an extreme scale AI. Extreme scale AI models are expensive to train and only so many companies can do so without outside funding. This concentrates power into the hands of a few companies, which leads to higher levels of bias and risk. This new R&D fund could potentially mitigate the financial problem of properly training generative AI, allowing smaller companies with higher levels of cultural competency to also be involved in vetting and shaping these tools, so that instead of promoting bias, the tools reduce bias.”
As with many cutting-edge innovations, it’s not the technology that is good or bad. The potential for AI to impact corporate DEI efforts in positive or negative ways comes down to how it is developed, used and monitored. The opportunity to create a more equitable and diverse workforce through the use of AI is there, and it’s up to everyone working on or with that technology to mitigate the potential risks and to leverage it for greater good.

Based on all the headlines we’re seeing about the proliferation of AI, in particular conversational chatbots and ChatGPT, the answer seems to catch some people by surprise: No … at least not yet and not in its current form.Though nobody (including those who are so eager to predict it) has any data on the future, if past technological revolutions are of any guidance, we can expect to see short-term disruption and uncertainty, followed by subsequent improvements. Indeed, we should be excited about the potential benefits of this AI revolution, notably the prospect of freeing humans to deploy their brains on more creative and intellectually fulfilling activities. Importantly, the AI age is still in its infancy – the internet equivalent of “dial-up”; we haven’t reached the wifi phase yet.Have you read?How to tell if artificial intelligence is working the way we want it toWhy artificial intelligence is vital in the race to meet the SDGsArtificial intelligence is learning to interact with the world the way humans doIf you really want to think about how this might play out in the future, look to the rise of fast food. While you can make the argument about its impact on our collective health, you can’t argue about its efficiency. Indeed, the fast food industry has made it very easy for people to get cheap and tasty food without paying much, spending time cooking and even moving from the couch. At the same time, the fast food industry has not caused the downfall of the hospitality industry, or put Michelin-star chefs out of business. Quite the opposite: it created lots of demand for slow food, farm-to-table and the gourmet experience that you get with someone who puts their full skillset and creativity on display. In other words, the more machines evolve, the more we value the unique skills and abilities only humans bring to the table – even if it isn’t in a Michelin star restaurant.ChatGPT, and more broadly AI, may well incentivize us to create and harness the intellectual equivalent of slow food; a healthier, more nutritious diet for our curiosity and hungry mind, rather than the quick fix we may get from fast food, even if most of the time we do consume fast food.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesIQ vs. EQWe have to face one potentially harsh reality: AI will probably win the battle for IQ against humans. It may have already happened. But what AI cannot do involves the key components that comprise emotional intelligence. EQ – skills such as empathy, consideration, kindness, self-awareness, self-control and caring for others – will remain 100% human qualities. We’ll need to continue to cultivate them. There will be a lot of need for human and humane validation in an age in which so much of our time is spent interacting with machines.Curiosity is a fundamental human trait that drives innovation and progress. It is the curiosity of the human mind that has led to remarkable discoveries and breakthroughs throughout history. As we embrace AI and immersive technologies, it is vital to encourage and nurture curiosity in ourselves and others. This includes asking questions, challenging assumptions, and seeking new ways of thinking and problem-solving. Curiosity allows us to explore the unknown, adapt to change, and continuously learn and grow.Creativity is another essential human skill that sets us apart from machines. It is the ability to think imaginatively and come up with new ideas, solutions and perspectives. While AI can analyze data and generate outputs based on patterns, it lacks the creativity and originality that humans possess. People that showcase human ingenuity and the power of creativity in their use of AI have the opportunity to make their jobs and lives more interesting because they are automating parts that were very boring and very repetitive, finding it’s helping to make them more productive.AI is not the enemyIt's important we don’t see AI, or any other emerging tech, including virtual and augmented reality, as a threat. There are many tasks across a multitude of jobs, including creative jobs, that are very repetitive, and we should relish the opportunity to outsource these – free up their time for more creative and intellectually sophisticated endeavors. After all, necessity is the mother of invention, and the record-breaking adoption levels of ChatGPT clearly highlight the human appetite for automating not just trivial, but also creative and intellectual tasks.While concerns are warranted, we should not fear, but experiment, learn, adapt and decide how to use and not use this tool, as well as the next version and generation of tools. Instead of making this a contest between humans and machines, we should ask how we can upgrade ourselves and have a more efficient and productive life, but also better lives with the help of machines. AI is only as smart as they people who program and prompt it. There are ways AI can, has and will surpass us. But it’s just a tool that could also help us lead a more human-centric life.AI is here to stay, and people are preparing for the change. During a recent poll on the ManpowerGroup LinkedIn page, we asked people which tech of the future they thought would most impact their career. Seventy-four per cent of respondents said AI tech, such as ChatGPT would have the biggest effect, followed by blockchain and the metaverse.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum ensuring the responsible use of technology?

In the event of a conflict with China or Russia, what U.S. forces may be able to hear and receive will be critical. That includes the data that they will seek to mine for tactical and strategic insights using artificial intelligence (AI). At a recent conference in Austin, Texas, Ms. Moore said that simple connectivity is “at the core of anything related to” AI’s real-world adoption.

If that connectivity and a working, layered infrastructure for passing data from forward platforms and operating locations back to places where AI can be applied is impaired or disrupted then even the best algorithms are of little use.

PROMOTED
Aiding Connectivity and Computing 

Moore breaks down the means by which CENTCOM and the broader military implement AI into two chunks - connectivity and computing.
“Connectivity means, can I receive the data I need in order to apply artificial intelligence and can I send the outputs of that where they need to go?” Computing, she says, is a question of whether users can run algorithms where needed.

When discussing AI infrastructure, starting on the computing side is useful Moore suggests. To bring AI to bear, she explains, we have to ask where we are trying to do computing and processing of raw data? Is it done on a physical system whether on a Navy ship or with a soldier out in the field holding a device? Is it [done] at a headquarters?

Depending on where AI analytics are run there are associated size, weight and power (SWaP) issues. Having right-sized hardware becomes critical. And while having the ability to apply AI on-the-spot would be welcome, it’s not currently practical.

But there is work being done at CENTCOM and elsewhere to disperse processing power so that data can initially be run through limited AI at the tactical edge. “Then you can push that data back to another point that has a bit more computing power where they can run advanced analytics,” Moore says.
The commercial sector is leading the charge on improving computing capacity in small packages, Moore adds, which may allow CENTCOM and others to do denser AI processing near the front lines or at them. In fact, connectivity, or the lack thereof, may force a reliance on edge processing.
“Our ability to access bulk data determines where the processing has to happen,” Moore observes. “For example, imagine an unmanned aerial vehicle collecting video feed in a certain area. Depending on the bandwidth available, it may only be able to push so much data back to its headquarters if it’s beyond line of sight. That means you need to be very specific about what data you’re sending back. That creates demand for processing at the edge.”
Processing more data at the edge could relieve bottlenecks but so, obviously, could creating more bandwidth, more connectivity to ensure that more data can be pushed to a centralized processing location. “We’ve experimented with that at CENTCOM [using] radio-mesh networks, low earth orbit satellite networks and a number of other solutions that allow us to attack that problem,” Moore says.
The results have been encouraging. Moore explained that radio-mesh network experiments have largely been done with the Navy.
“We’ve been seeing how far we can extend unmanned surface vessels at sea and have them still be able to push back meaningful data to headquarters. Those experiments have been promising. We’ve had the ability to have UAVs aloft serving as network nodes, other surface vessels serving as network nodes. The more stuff you get out above, on and below the water, the more robust you’re network and the higher the odds of being able to push back data.”An MQ-9 Sea Guardian unmanned maritime surveillance aircraft system flies over Independence-variant ...

Moore acknowledges that such a “radio-repeater” type of arrangement is stronger if some processing is done at the edge, reducing the volume of bulk data that must be transported back to a headquarters for AI processing. The combined edge-mesh approach dovetails with the agile combat employment (ACE) concept the Air Force is pushing and similar dispersed operational concepts the other services are evaluating to adapt to the challenging distances and tactical obstacles of the Indo-Pacific.
Finding a Place for AI Data
While these experiments and others CENTCOM has undertaken offer promising potential to expand connectivity in support of AI, they still rely on the physics of the RF spectrum. Adversaries and allies alike understand the high and low frequency options for such data transport intimately and understand that in any conflict bandwidth demand will be at a premium, limiting “space available” for data transport for AI.
Disrupting connectivity is at the top of the to-do list for any U.S. adversary and for American forces themselves so figuring out how much bandwidth will practically be available in a serious fight is a matter of speculation. Recent experience in Ukraine has demonstrated that cyber conflict may be more limited and attritive than originally thought but the manner in which the war is Ukraine being fought likely differs substantially from how a conflict in the Pacific may be waged.
Moore won’t comment on what chunks of spectrum AI infrastructure may most heavily rely on. I asked if CENTCOM had experimented with photonic communication. Moore replied that CENTCOM is testing “a range of spectrum options and are encouraged by the results we’ve seen”.
The Army sees line of sight, beyond line of sight, fiber, host nation, 5G, and SATCOM with LEO

0.0%, MEO, GEO satellites as communications/data pathways for its Integrated Tactical Network and the Integrated Enterprise Network which endeavor to create a “Unified Transport Network” combining command and control with a ubiquitous data layer.
Units from the company up through the battalion and brigade to division, with other maneuver type elements sprinkled in, will seamlessly access the UTN and AI data/processing would reside therein. It’s a construct similar to the Pentagon’s broader Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) effort, popularly referred to as an internet-of-military-things. But an awful lot has to go right for such seamless connectivity to remain seamless in time of war.
While Moore won’t be pinned down on how much space-based assets will be relied upon for enabling the connectivity that increasing AI use may require, she acknowledges that space will be important. Even if CENTCOM and others rigorously seek to exploit alternate pathways for data and processing, the position, navigation and timing (PNT) data necessary to accompany meaningful application of AI is at risk and it is largely space based.
Increasing edge processing- effectively localizing AI compute functions combined with human analysis in edge environments - may take some of the data transport burden away. But it too can be compromised if the space layer cannot yield the accurate PNT awareness needed to for AI inputs.
Moore adds an appreciated dose of reality to the infrastructure discussion when explaining CENTCOM’s outlook on the demand for AI output.
“Our view is that sometimes people incorrectly regard AI as giving you the answer to your homework. The reality is that it can point you in the right direction or cut down on some of the research time but at the end of the day, decision-making has to sit with a human operator. We’re learning where AI is most effectively and efficiently deployed.”
That includes considering the risk that bad data - regardless of how effectively it is transported and processed - may lead to faulty AI insights. For now, it’s not a large risk Moore says because “We’re applying it in such limited circumstances right now that you’d be hard pressed to say that decision-makers are overly influenced by it.”
“We are experiencing live,” she adds, “what the benefits and risks associated with algorithmic applications are and I think that because we’re taking an incremental approach it’s allowing us to set expectations for our leaders accordingly.”
As CENTCOM and others try to strike a balance between the discrimination needed to make the most effective use of AI with the means of processing it, they more clearly see the importance of the connectivity it requires and the challenge of maintaining it.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can increase productivity, boost economic growth, alter existing occupations and generate new ones. Without a doubt, AI will result in some job displacement in the short term, but there are numerous reasons to think that AI will also contribute to creating new jobs and economic growth in the long run.
Artificial intelligence can also help workers become more effective and productive by giving them access to real-time data and insights, enabling them to enhance their performance and make better decisions. In addition, AI can generate new employment opportunities in the creative and artistic industries by nurturing new modes of expression and creativity. For instance, artificial intelligence can produce original works of literature, music and art, allowing creators to work with AI systems to explore new kinds of creativity.

Similarly, by assisting organizations in identifying and averting cyberattacks, AI can create new jobs in the cybersecurity sector. For example, AI can spot behavioral patterns that could be signs of a cyberattack, enabling organizations to take proactive steps to stop or lessen the attack. Cybersecurity experts who are proficient in employing AI and machine learning techniques to protect against cyber threats may find new employment prospects as a result.

Enabling new products, services, industries and jobs with AI
By enabling the development of new products and services previously unattainable or unfeasible, AI can also create new jobs. For instance, AI can create personalized medicinal treatments, precision farming and sophisticated industrial methods. These new products and services can lead to new responsibilities in research, development and marketing, along with new skills and experience requirements.
AI can potentially generate new jobs by enabling new sectors and business models. For instance, the emergence of AI-powered digital assistants and smart home appliances has opened up new career prospects for hardware engineers, data analysts and software developers. Similar to how autonomous vehicle and drone research has opened up new career prospects for engineers, technicians and logistics specialists.
AI automation and the transformation of existing jobs
Automating tedious and normal chores allows people to concentrate on more difficult and creative tasks, which is one example of how artificial intelligence might create jobs. For instance, AI-powered chatbots can respond to routine customer service questions, freeing up human customer service agents to handle more complicated situations that call for interpersonal connection and problem-solving abilities.
In addition, businesses can engage with clients and partners in new areas thanks to language translation services enabled by artificial intelligence. As a result, there are more opportunities for linguists, software developers and localization experts to create and enhance these systems.
Similarly, AI-powered drones are now being utilized for inspecting infrastructure, and surveying and monitoring crops. As the demand for software developers, data analysts and drone operators increases, new job possibilities will arise in these fields.

Some concerns and the call to action
However, there are fears that AI may result in significant job displacement in some businesses and areas. Automation fueled by AI, for instance, may result in considerable job losses in the industrial, retail and transportation industries, and some administrative and white-collar positions. Automating low-skilled occupations and creating new opportunities for highly trained individuals at the expense of workers with less education and training could also worsen already-existing disparities.
Related: Ethical considerations in AI development and deployment
Policymakers, educators and business leaders must collaborate to address these issues, ensuring people are ready for the evolving nature of work in the AI era. Focusing on education and training will be necessary, especially in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics professions, and other areas where there will likely be a significant need for competent individuals. To facilitate the development and commercialization of new products and services, it will also be necessary to make investments in infrastructure and innovation.
Additionally, authorities need to make sure that society as a whole benefits from AI. New laws and regulations may be required to address the issues of income inequality and job displacement, and ensure employees are protected with access to social safety nets.

For this report, Edelman Data x Intelligence, commissioned by Microsoft, surveyed 31,000 full-time employed or self-employed people in 31 countries and analyzed trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals across organizations, as well as labor trends from the LinkedIn Economic Graph. Data was gathered between February 1, 2023 and March 14, 2023. Survey results indicated that jobs will change but not necessarily be replaced.
The tech giant also announced its own AI-powered product, Microsoft 365 Copilot, will be available in an invitation-only paid preview program with a gradual rollout starting in May. The new version of Copilot includes some expanded capabilities geared toward enterprise, such as collaboration and idea generation in Whiteboard; the image generator DALL-E; and generative AI assistants for Outlook, OneNote and Viva Learning.

Employers could support, not lighten, their workforce with AI
The Work Trend Index report found business leaders are more likely to want to use AI to increase employee productivity (31%) rather than to reduce head count (16%) (Figure A). Other popular uses include helping employees with necessary but repetitive or mundane tasks (29%) and increasing employee well-being (26%).

AI is a digital tool, and like any tool, it will take time for people to learn how to use it optimally. As of May 2023, 70% of employees surveyed said they would use generative AI to lighten, not fully automate, their workloads. Meanwhile, 49% of the people surveyed are worried AI will completely replace their jobs.
Microsoft found 87% of people in creative roles would like to use AI for the creative aspects of their jobs, but there are some caveats here. This percentage includes only people who are “extremely” familiar with AI already. In addition, creative fields were defined as product development, creative/design, or marketing and public relations.

Microsoft seems confident in AI’s ability to relieve pressure at work. However, some of the problems Microsoft wants to relieve with its new products and services come from the proliferation of communication itself. Of the people surveyed, 68% of workers say they don’t have enough uninterrupted focus time. From data pulled from Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft found the average employee spends 57% of their time in meetings, email or chat.
“Inefficient meetings” are the top culprit for disrupting productivity in workers’ day-to-day roles. The next most common productivity breakers include “lacking clear goals,” “having too many meetings” and “feeling uninspired.”
Microsoft’s proposed solution is “AI-powered intelligent meeting recaps, transcripts and recordings” so employees can fit in meetings on their own time and in the formats they prefer.

How business leaders can prepare for using AI
Microsoft asked workers to look ahead to an imagined 2030 in which AI has proliferated throughout the workforce. When asked what AI-driven workplace changes they would value most, many responded with “producing high-quality work in half the time” (33%), understanding the most valuable ways to spend their time (26%) and energy (25%), and avoiding unnecessary or irrelevant information (23%).
Shaping what the future of work looks like with AI will require careful decision-making and a balance between human and machine strengths. Like any digital transformation, it will be a process of learning which changes are practical and which are not. Microsoft recommends organizations establish guardrails for employees’ interactions with AI, deploy AI where people need the most relief, and delegate carefully to be sure AI is applied to specific disciplines, processes and workflows under specific team leaders.

New hiring criteria for businesses using AI
If a business uses AI, relevant AI skills will likely become part of new hiring criteria, Microsoft said – and those skills aren’t all technical. Employers said that, if AI were to “usher in a new era of technological advancements,” employees will need to learn more analytical judgment (30%), flexibility (29%) and emotional intelligence (27%) (Figure B).

“We’re in the next phase of change with the introduction of generative AI, and it’s already starting to reshape the labor market,” said Karin Kimbrough, chief economist at LinkedIn, in the Work Trend Index. “While it’s still early days, this shift will expand opportunities, create new roles, and augment productivity.”

Generative AI is Disruptive, But More Copyright Isn’t the Answer.Progress in artificial intelligence seems to be something that happens, to paraphrase Ernest Hemingway, in two ways: gradually, then suddenly. 



By Nicholas GarciaMay 11, 2023
Progress in artificial intelligence seems to be something that happens, to paraphrase Ernest Hemingway, in two ways: gradually, then suddenly. A slow trickle of developments as well as surprising bursts of astonishing new capabilities have characterized the AI news cycle for as long as it has existed.
The latest burst of sudden developments relates to generative AI, or GAI — machine learning systems that are capable of outputting new material. GAI is a broad and descriptive term about what the system does, not a particular technology or approach to AI system design. GAI is being used to produce writing, conversation, art, music, video, and more. Systems like these have existed for years, developing gradually, but suddenly systems like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney are producing remarkably high-quality content that rivals human work.
We now need to develop policies to ensure that the benefits of these new technologies are broadly and equitably shared, while protecting the existing openness and vitality of the internet and our creative communities.Unlike existing discriminative AI systems (those that analyze, sort, and process data), GAI raises unique concerns, especially about how human work, including the work used in training datasets, is recognized and valued. For photographers, visual artists, and musicians — especially freelance and independent creators who already struggle with economic precarity — the prospect of a flood of AI-generated content that rivals their work represents real economic risk. The people on the front lines of this disruption right now are artists and musicians, but thanks to large language models like ChatGPT, Sydney, and Bard, this wave of change could soon extend to many kinds of knowledge workers — especially if LLMs’ ability to go beyond simple text generation towards acting as independent agents continues to develop.

Concern regarding this disruption has people casting about for solutions to slow, mitigate, or prevent the potential harms of AI systems. One approach that is being considered — and litigated in two high-profile cases (see Andersen v. Stability AI and Getty Images v. Stability AI) — is how to apply the United States’ existing copyright system to limit GAI systems. 
This could be a disastrous mistake. Applying our existing copyright laws to our best understanding of GAI systems leads to the conclusion that while this technology is new, and there may be flaws in design and execution that create instances of copyright infringement, its core elements and essential ideas do not run afoul of copyright law. Most importantly, reinterpreting or expanding copyright specifically to use it as a bludgeon against GAI will instead threaten the openness and accessibility of the internet, throw up barriers to creativity, and primarily benefit the biggest publishers, distributors, and content creators while leaving small and independent creators to struggle with economic precarity and disruption.
Many artists, creators, and consumers have already adopted stances on GAI ranging from skepticism to outrage. It is thus not enough to merely state the above conclusions; they must be backed up with informed and accessible public analysis that breaks down the copyright law, technology, and implications of proposed solutions. 
Let’s start with copyright. Copyright is not a magic spell that can be invoked anytime someone interacts with a creative work; it is actually a bundle of specific, enumerated (and limited) rights. These rights vary slightly based on the nature of the work, but generally include the rights to control the reproduction, distribution, and public display of the work, as well as to authorize derivative works. Copyright only grants the holder the legal ability to defend those specific rights, and is further limited by other legal doctrines like “de minimis” usage (meaning so little of a work was used that there is no infringement) or fair use.
Turning to the technology, it is useful to analyze the copyright issues related to GAI systems in terms of inputs and outputs. The GAI systems have three inputs: the training datasets; the training process that creates the machine learning model; and user inputs including text prompts, uploaded images, or other user-uploaded or linked reference material. From all of those inputs, the GAI system generates an output: text, images, audio, video, and so on.


GAI systems are built on huge datasets. These vast swathes of data are used for training the machine learning models because more data results in more useful, well-rounded models; the more data the system can learn from, the better it gets. Most GAI systems use training datasets assembled through the crawling and scraping of the publicly accessible internet. 
This isn’t a new practice or novel legal issue. Instances of commercial web crawling have been challenged — and consistently found permissible — under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. That’s because commercial web crawling is largely geared toward the collection of data and statistics, not the full copyrighted content of a website, so commercial web scrapers tend to avoid infringing the reproduction right of the copyright holders. In other instances, building large digital datasets of copyrighted material is unavoidable for the functionality of a project. A good example of this is the Google Books project and internet search more broadly. Google Books specifically came under fire from authors, publishers, artists, and photographers over the digitization and display of copyrighted content. The project was ultimately found to be a fair use that promotes copyright law’s very purpose: to expand public knowledge and understanding. 
The datasets on which GAI systems like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion rely are more like Google Books than commercial web crawlers that gather data; GAI systems need writing and art in its complete form to train from. And the comparison to Google Books doesn’t stop there.  Many GAI systems are built using third-party public datasets like Common Crawl and LAION that are distributed under fair use principles and provide a real public good: archiving and making accessible the aggregated content of the internet for academics, researchers, and anyone else that may want it. These are free, non-commercial datasets collected by nonprofit organizations for use by researchers and the public. Web crawling and scraping also underlie the operation of search engines and archiving projects like the Internet Archive’s popular Wayback Machine. 
In other words, the same practices that go into collecting data for GAI training are currently understood to be non-infringing or protected by fair use. Considering how vital these practices are for an open and accessible internet, we should ensure that they stay that way.


As a threshold matter, it is critical to understand that accessing, linking to, or interacting with digital information does not infringe any copyright. Reading a book, looking at a photograph, admiring a painting, or listening to music is not, and never should be, copyright infringement. This is not a “fair use” issue; the ability to use, access, or interact with a creative work is outside a copyright owner’s scope of control. Based on the best explanations of how GAI systems work, training a GAI system is generally analogous to these kinds of uses.
A GAI model does not contain an archive or directory of the works it trains on that the system queries, searches, or references. Rather, during training the system processes the work, deconstructing it using math to learn from it. To vastly oversimplify, this learning takes the form of building and modifying the strength of connections between a model of datapoints, resulting in a collection of mathematical weights that define the model. The work being analyzed is not reproduced or stored in the model; instead, the model uses each work to improve its overall understanding of whatever it is training on (art, photographs, writing, and so on).
In Andersen v. Stability AI,  the class action lawsuit against Midjourney and Stable Diffusion (two of the most widely used GAI art systems), the plaintiffs conceptualize the training process differently. They characterize the training process as a mechanism for storing the training images in a compressed state. Ultimately, this interpretation will be tested in litigation, but the generalization process that training images go through does not result in any conventional kind of storage. 
There are two facts that make this apparent. First, in an ideal model, none of the content used in training can be reproduced by the system with any reliable fidelity. Second, the simple reality of the quantity of information these systems are trained on, compared to the size of the models themselves, should make that obvious. One can download the fully trained Stable Diffusion model weights at the size of 4 GB, while the LAION-2B dataset it is trained on — the smallest version — contains around 80,000 GB of images; no amount of compression would allow for the model to contain all that information. Simply put, the model does not contain its training data within it. 
The best understanding of the technology therefore points to the model (in its own way) really learning from training images and not merely reproducing and storing them in compressed or abstract mathematical form. Of course, this evaluation relies on information about a highly technical, insular, and rapidly developing field of study. It might be the case that the architecture of the existing or future systems is different from what is described here, but either way, the essence of the training process itself does not involve infringement of copyrighted work.


From a copyright liability perspective for GAI systems, user inputs are not a real concern. Naturally, users can misuse tools, even existing ones like image editing software, to infringe copyright or get up to other mischief, but that does not make the tool infringing. And the user inputs themselves, divorced from the outputs they may produce, do not violate any of the bundle of rights that copyright holders can claim. Even if a user were to feed copyrighted content into a GAI system as a prompt or priming material, this is merely use—not reproduction or distribution. In addition, while the outputs of GAI systems are not protected by Section 230, a user’s inputs to a GAI system certainly are.


GAI systems are defined by their outputs. The writing, images, and other content that they produce raise a collection of copyright-related concerns. These concerns can be distilled to a single question: Do the outputs of GAI systems pass the “substantial similarity” test to not qualify as reproductions, and if they do, do they still incorporate enough major copyrightable elements from existing works such that the output could be characterized as an unauthorized derivative work?
Image-generating diffusion models in particular suffer from “overfitting” and “memorization.” When a specific work appears in similar form many times throughout a training dataset, that image’s combination of characteristics can become overly well-connected in the model. The result is sometimes called “memorization” because the model is able to output a fairly good copy of that work if prompted to. This is an example of “overfitting” in training — where a model cleaves too closely to its training data instead of being able to generalize from its training. These overfit outputs, depending on their quality, can and should be considered infringing reproductions. While this may seem fatal, it is ultimately a red herring. Generalization is the ultimate design goal of these systems, and instances of memorization and overfitting — which raise copyright alarm bells — are essentially bugs, not features. After all, finding a copy of something that already exists online is a simple matter of search; the value of a GAI system is that it makes something new.
Relatedly, some might argue that since GAI systems are trained on copyrighted material and lack human agency and creativity, that all of the outputs are derivative works. A derivative work is a new work that is based on an original work, and shares major copyrightable elements with the original, but which has its own copyright protection because of the new elements in the work. But this is where the ability of these systems to genuinely generalize is the critical factor. When the model is training on, for example, a portrait, it is learning general compositional information about portraits, faces, and so forth. So when a user prompts it to produce a specific kind of portrait, it isn’t pulling from any work or works specifically, but from its whole corpus of training, so none of the works in the training data are original works for the purpose of a derivative works analysis. Put another way, in a well-generalized model, the influence of any one work in the training set should be regarded under the de minimis doctrine as insignificant in its overall contribution to the new work.
Another narrative echoing across creative communities is concern about the ability of a GAI system to produce new works in an artist’s style. Generally, copyright law doesn’t protect style, ideas, or concepts. For a work to be an infringing reproduction, there must be substantial similarity between two specific works in terms of expressive content. That means that a work just having a similar vibe, style, characteristics, or subject matter is not infringement. Another angle from which to approach the issue of style is that copyright holders have the right to control derivative works. The copyrightability of work created using GAI is a whole separate issue, so, the only element of the doctrine that is relevant here is whether some works produced using GAI systems pass the “substantial similarity” test to not qualify as reproductions, but still incorporate enough major copyrightable elements from an existing work such that the output could be characterized as an unauthorized derivative work. So, again, it cannot be a matter of similar style, subject matter, or general features — there must be specifically identifiable elements from particular works — and that still doesn’t describe the situation artists are worried about with GAI producing new works in existing styles.
In light of the threat of competition from these machines, and the value we have for art, there may be a temptation to deviate from the established copyright canon and expand the notion of what can be protected, but this is a dangerous idea.
All creative work is the product of a process of copying, transforming, and combining our experiences, inspirations, and influences. Every form of art, culture, and invention is rife with examples of celebrated works that reimagines, riffs on, or downright knocks off existing work. No one can, or should be able to, enforce a copyright on the basis of style, concept, or feeling alone. It is the free exchange of ideas and inspirations, and the ability to reimagine and remix existing work, that allows artists to build on existing ideas and push creative boundaries. Trying to enforce copyright protection on styles or ideas would short-circuit the creative process and stifle artistic development.
Left, a panel from Russ Heath’s All-American Men of War #89 and an AI-generated work in his style… oh wait no, it’s actually Roy Lichtenstein’s “Blam” from 1962. (Photo credit “WHAAM! BLAM! Roy Lichtenstein and the Art of Appropriation” Hussey-Cotton Films, 2023.)
And while some small and independent creators are on the frontlines of the fight against GAI right now, it is important to remember that there are, and always have been, significant inequalities in what work is valued, whose work is respected, and who will have the power and resources to aggressively defend their work. For instance, hip-hop music was initially criticized for its use of sampling from other artists’ work and faced repeated copyright challenges which restricted the right of artists to use samples without paying for licenses. Anti-sampling cases resulting in mandatory licensing transformed a counter-cultural, democratized, method of making art into yet another tool that only established artists and record labels could leverage. Today, underground hip-hop artists using uncleared samples and mashup artists still find themselves locked out of key revenue streams like streaming platforms because of these restrictive copyright rules. 
There are obvious parallels between sampling and artists using GAI tools today, but even artists working traditionally ought to consider how existing industry power dynamics would play out if there were vastly expanded “stylistic” copyright rules. Record labels, music studios, and established artists would have the resources and power to go after any creator that encroached on their “style,” potentially locking up whole genres and aesthetics behind licensing structures. Reducing every shred of human originality to copyrightable units that must be bought and sold is a far greater threat to creativity than new automated tools will ever be.
Expanding Copyright Law Won’t Protect Artists from GAI’s Disruption
Copyright is enshrined in the Constitution with the phrase: “To promote the progress of science and useful arts…” Taking that purpose seriously, it should be clear that copyright and GAI should not be set at odds with one another. Like the internet — another disruptive technology that forced us to grapple with copyright concerns — GAI is rich with possibilities for redrawing the lines of creativity, productivity, and prosperity. 
This is not to say that there aren’t challenges: Overfitted, infringing reproductions of existing works and concerns about how to navigate consent, credit, and compensation for creators are uncannily reminiscent of early concerns about file sharing and web search indexing. Indeed, to some extent, these concerns about the internet have always lingered and are now crossing over and combining with concerns about GAI. But, as the Copyright Office already determined when it recommended against creating special ancillary copyrights for news content, even when there are serious concerns about the future of important human activities, expansions of copyright aren’t necessarily the effective solution — and would necessarily mean limiting fair use and free expression. 
This impulse to expand or redefine copyright law to allow others to control the ability to use, access, interact, and learn from creative works cannot be the solution to these fears. If we lose the right to freely use and enjoy creative works, we open the way for a new world of extreme commercialization where artists must pay for the privilege to create, and people find the costs and barriers to information and culture rising ever upwards. Generative AI presents the possibility of disruption — let’s embrace this opportunity for change by finding solutions that enhance the ability to create freely, transform traditional economic structures to ensure prosperity, and lower the barriers to enjoying the fruits of our diverse and vibrant shared culture.

Generative A.I.: Friend or Foe for Cybersecurity Job Seekers?

For months, the tech and business worlds have been obsessed with generative artificial intelligence (A.I.), especially the virtual chatbot ChatGPT and its ability to produce human-like text and decent code snippets. This focus has raised questions (some serious, some not) about whether this technology will create or destroy jobs, essentially rendering humans obsolete.

The potential growth and possibly disruptive nature of generative A.I. are still being calculated and hotly contested. A recent article published by Goldman Sachs finds that the technology could raise global gross domestic product (GDP) by 7 percent. A Gartner report that looked at OpenAI’s ChatGPT finds these types of virtual chatbots will have a major impact on marketing and video content by 2025.

During April’s RSA Conference in San Francisco, one of the world’s largest gatherings of cybersecurity professionals, talk of generative A.I. and its role in the cybersecurity field filled the exhibition halls. Experts quickly noted, however, that the ultimate future of the technology is still being written.

In these early stages, significant questions about generative AI remain: What about cybersecurity jobs and careers? Will tech and cybersecurity pros need to significantly upskill to keep pace? Will generative A.I. reduce or eliminate a skills gap that finds over 700,000 open security positions in the U.S. alone?

There was consensus among the cybersecurity experts who attended the 2023 RSAC or watched the proceedings online: While generative A.I. has potential, the technology will not eliminate or destroy cybersecurity jobs, especially in the short term. Instead, these virtual chatbots and other applications should be viewed as useful tools for tech and security professionals that can augment cybersecurity work and help in the protection of data and networks.

“It’s unlikely that A.I. will completely take over cybersecurity functions, as human operators bring intuition and ethical decision-making to the task, skills which will be difficult if not impossible to fully replace with A.I.,” Dave Gerry, CEO at crowdsourcing security firm Bugcrowd, told Dice.

“That said, A.I. will continue to play an increasingly important role in cybersecurity as it becomes more advanced, and a human-machine combination will be necessary to effectively defend against evolving threats,” Gerry added. “While A.I. won’t replace human creativity and resiliency, it does hold the potential to fill some of the current talent gaps we see in the industry by automating tasks that will allow human defenders to focus on higher priority concerns.”

Learning to Live with Generative A.I.

Although generative A.I. in its current incarnation is not ready to eliminate positions and upend careers, tech and cybersecurity professionals must learn to live with the technology, especially as companies incorporate more of these applications into their daily workflows. 

At RSAC, companies such as Google announced that they are building generative A.I. and large language models (LLMs) technology into their security and cloud computing products, meaning tech pros must learn how to make these work and incorporate the tech into their security plans.

“Artificial intelligence in one form or another has been part of the cybersecurity landscape for years, with ‘A.I.’ and ‘machine learning’ being buzzwords that got a lot of attention but often had less impact than the marketing hype would imply. Now though, advances in machine learning, deep learning and the introduction of large language models, have made the technology much more functional,” Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at security firm Vulcan Cyber, told Dice.

“We’ll see the impact of these new capabilities in multiple areas,” Parkin added. “Improved A.I. will make it easier for security teams to parse the massive volumes of data they are dealing with, letting them focus more on the highest risks with the resources they have. That is already happening now but will continue to improve.”

As with previous iterations of machine learning, experts note that the biggest current benefit of generative A.I. is helping to automate manual processes, which can then free up tech and security pros for other tasks. Tech pros need to learn these skills now to take advantage of potential benefits.

“We already see A.I. providing tangible benefits in the areas of automating access requests, both in terms of accelerated routing of requests as well as the informed setting of entitlements based on extenuating circumstances,” Piyush Pandey, CEO of security company Pathlock, told Dice. “The same goes for periodic access reviews—A.I. has shown considerable value in recommending role optimization to reduce risks. Acquiring skills that relate to understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning algorithms is crucial, as they form the backbone of A.I. systems.”

Putting A.I. to Work for Security Teams

While generative A.I. apps are in the developmental stage, security experts already see real-world scenarios where the technology can provide assistance. For Georgia Weidman, a security architect at Zimperium, this includes helping with blue- and red-team exercises.

“Models can run against specific targets and identify the higher probability of successful attacks and lateral movements,” Weidman told Dice. “On the blue-team side, what machine learning models do best is sift through tons and tons of information to better discern the usable, actionable data. Both will have the ability to potentially make security practitioners more productive because these models can remove quite a lot of root work from day-to-day execution.”

While useful, Weidman warns that any use of generative A.I. technology as part of the security process requires skilled tech pros who know what it can do… as well as its limits.

“For the foreseeable future, generative A.I. requires a skilled user who can discern the difference between a sentence that reads well from a sentence that is presenting correct information,” Weidman added. “As some security firms are already using ChatGPT to assist with writing penetration testing reports, there are inevitably privacy concerns involved, especially around feeding a customer’s private data into a public chat API.”

Security leaders also see the promise and limitations of generative A.I. in its current form. “When we talk to our customers, CISOs representing several industries, they collectively agree that A.I. tools help their teams work more efficiently but will not replace security professionals,” Patrick Harr, CEO at SlashNext, told Dice. “Generative AI tools will enable security organizations to improve security, automate manual, time-consuming tasks, and give them the time to focus on the security and availability of data in their organization.”

Calculating Adversaries’ Skills

For several security observers, developing skills to make generative A.I. work is only one part of the process. Another concern is how malicious actors are using this technology and how these new threats will require tech and security pros to rethink their ability to react.

Already, tools such as ChatGPT are being used to write malicious code and phishing emails. In addition, future developments may require security professionals to prevent A.I. from escaping a data center or accessing specific types of information—shifting how the industry defines an adversary, said Davis McCarthy, principal security researcher at Valtix, which is part of Cisco.

“A.I. will scale threat actor resources, reduce their time-to-compromise, shorten malware development cycles and lower the bar for affiliate cybercriminals,” McCarthy told Dice. “Because the output from an A.I. system is benign until the prompt engineer makes it actionable, the true change to the threat landscape is in how efficient the skilled hackers will become, and how effective the unskilled hackers will be.”

This is another area where some experts see generative A.I. falling short: the business realm that requires security teams to assess risk. That risk can affect an organization; it can come from a malicious incident, a business or regulatory decision or an unforeseen issue, which will then require a more creative, human response.

“As we’ve seen throughout the course of history, and despite concerns to the contrary, whenever there’s a new advancement in technology, more jobs are created than replaced,” Timothy Morris, chief security advisor at Tanium, told Dice.

“The bottom line is that while A.I. can consume a great deal of information, it cannot replace human intuition and experience and take into account more than what is presented by the data,” Morris added. “The most successful security professionals display a great deal of collaboration and empathy in their interactions with customers and teammates—these displays of emotional intelligence cannot be effectively replicated by A.I.”

Many biopharma companies are rapidly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for a number of applications, from preventative healthcare to drug discovery. But whether the biotechnology industry will suffer similar purges as those in tech is still unknown, said Jeff Morton, a biotechnology patent law attorney and partner at Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves, & Savitch. “The jury’s still out on how AI will impact things,” he told BioSpace. While data analytics may increasingly become more automated, Morton said that ultimately, companies still need to prove drugs or treatments work for patients. This involves complex, creative research, he added, “and I think that will still rely on humans.” “Most people I’m talking to on a day-to-day basis in biotech are senior scientists” and executives who will likely enjoy more job security as AI becomes increasingly integrated into biopharma, Morton said. But people in other roles or students who are looking to get a job in the biotechnology field might have a different perspective, he said. The role of AI in biotechnology is broad and heterogeneous, meaning different sectors might be differently affected, Morton said. AI algorithms could potentially find new targets for existing drugs, speed up drug development, sift through clinical and research data, monitor patients and analyze market trends. While AI in biotech is nothing new, in recent months generative AI has captured media attention, the most notable example being GPT-4, the engine that runs ChatGPT. Generative AI can use existing data to produce original content. GPT-4 has demonstrated an ability to complete a wide variety of tasks and generate new content, including working code and legal briefs.\u202f A Human Touch Raj Indupuri, CEO of eClinical Solutions, told BioSpace that he expects generative AI to change many roles in biotech, but he is skeptical that AI will replace humans in clinical research and drug development. Companies need human actors to validate algorithmic outputs, especially in the life sciences, he said. “You still have to verify the things that AI and ML are predicting,” Indupuri said. “The consequences for getting something wrong are significant.” In other words, because AI makes mistakes and contains bias, it requires validation and thoughtful implementation. Generative AI is particularly difficult to validate, meaning there will need to be human input at multiple steps in the clinical development process for the foreseeable future, Indupuri said. AI algorithms learn from existing data, then either classify or generate new data based on what they know. However, “clinical development is extremely complex, with minimal commonalities,” said Indupuri. This means that an algorithm would be hard-pressed to generalize and generate an accurate output from data from past successful trials, especially for rare diseases, where the datasets are small. Therefore, Indupuri said, companies still need research teams to analyze data and make decisions during each step in the drug development process, from initial drug studies to clinical research. He added that AI can eliminate “inefficiencies” in drug discovery and data analytics. This may result in job losses, he said, but likely “not to the same extent” as in the tech sector. The Silver Lining Indupuri added that AI may also create a number of new roles, or simply change old ones. In addition, some people might report higher job satisfaction, as many manual tasks can be “eliminated or transformed by using AI,” he said. As artificial intelligence use increases, Indupuri and Morton agreed that upskilling—training existing employees to interface with AI and ML technologies—will be necessary to keep up with labor demands in the future. “There’s quite a bit of retraining going on already,” Morton said. Still, both he and Indupuri said they believe that AI will play a large role in the biopharma sphere in years to come. “It seems to me that there is a general consensus that things are going to change, but it’s hard to predict how,” Morton said.', 'articleSection': 'Business, News', 'author': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/natalia-mesa/#person', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/natalia-mesa/'}, 'name': 'Natalia Mesa', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/natalia-mesa'}], 'copyrightYear': '2024', 'datePublished': '2023-05-10T14:12:12.000Z', 'dateModified': '2023-05-10T14:33:31.000Z', 'headline': 'Will Advancements in AI Lead to Job Loss in Biotech?', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#article', 'image': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 350, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/e9d1eb7/2147483647/strip/false/crop/625x350+0+0/resize/625x350!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF6BF77C2-D42D-4AA0-A81E-80026BA4E785.jpg', 'height': 625}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/5def0e7/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF6BF77C2-D42D-4AA0-A81E-80026BA4E785.jpg', 'height': 1200}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#webpage'}, 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#webpage'}}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Website', 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'WebPage', 'potentialAction': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech'}], 'breadcrumb': {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'itemListElement': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/news', 'name': 'News', 'position': 1}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/business', 'name': 'Business', 'position': 2}]}, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#webpage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#primaryimage'}, 'name': 'Will Advancements in AI Lead to Job Loss in Biotech?', 'datePublished': '2023-05-10T14:12:12.000Z', 'dateModified': '2023-05-10T14:33:31.000Z', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'caption': 'Pictured: Close-up of a microscope/Kkolosov/iStock', 'width': 675, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-advancements-could-result-in-job-loss-upskilling-in-biotech/#primaryimage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/5def0e7/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF6BF77C2-D42D-4AA0-A81E-80026BA4E785.jpg', 'height': 1200}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rise of advanced artificial intelligence will upend the white-collar job market and result in a large number of “very unhappy” workers who will be forced out of their professions, according to a co-founder of the Google-owned AI lab DeepMind.
Mustafa Suleyman, an AI pioneer who left Google last year, joined a growing list of experts – including his former boss, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai – who has warned that rapid advancements in the technology could result in significant job losses.
“Unquestionably, many of the tasks in white-collar land will look very different in the next five to 10 years,” Suleyman said during an event at GIC’s Bridge Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, according to the Financial Times.
“There are going to be a serious number of losers [and they] will be very unhappy, very agitated,” he added.

Last month, Goldman Sachs released an analysis stating that AI tools “could drive a 7% (or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.”

Suleyman asserted that the US and other governments will need to consider ways to support workers who lose their gigs due to AI.
He floated the idea of a universal basic income as one way of addressing the problem – a view he shares with billionaire Elon Musk, who suggested last year it would become necessary as AI and robotics changed labor dynamics.
Suleyman said impacted workers will need “material compensation.”

“This is a political and economic measure we have to start talking about in a serious way,” he added.
Since leaving Google, Suleyman has launched his own chatbot initiative called Inflection AI.
Suleyman’s warning came weeks after Pichai told CBS’s “60 Minutes” that society needs to brace for major changes caused by AI in the coming years.

Notable critics include the “Godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton, who quit his job at Google last month so he could speak freely about the technology’s risks.
Aside from potential job losses, Hinton warned AI was likely to be exploited by “bad actors” for various nefarious purposes.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the workplace, creating both opportunities and challenges for employees, and at this stage, leaving you with more questions than answers. Will AI enable you to work smarter or render you redundant? Will it create more jobs or lead to mass unemployment? 






 Whatever the answers to these questions are, you can't ignore that AI is rapidly rising in the workplace. And so, flexibility and adaptability will be key to remaining relevant in this AI-dominated workplace. Here are some valuable insights into surviving and thriving in the AI-dominated workplace. 


 1. Learn What AI Is and How AI-Powered Tools Work 
    

 It helps to start with understanding what AI is, the dangers it poses, and how it can help you. Understanding the basics of AI and how it works will help you know its strengths and limitations, as well as how to use it to thrive in your workplace. 






 In simple terms, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of computer systems to simulate human intelligence and carry out a wide range of tasks. Some of the most common use cases of AI in the workplace include automating hiring processes, optimizing customer service, inventory management, or data collection and analysis, to name a few. 

 Although AI systems have been used in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and sales for quite some time, their use is increasing exponentially due to technological advancements and the release of AI-powered tools like ChatGPT. 

 ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that relies on vast amounts of training data to generate natural-sounding text. This AI chatbot is used for tasks such as content creation, programming, and translation, to name a few. In fact, this tool is so good that people wonder if generative AI will take over their jobs. 








 2. Know the Difference Between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence 
 Having gained a basic understanding of what AI is and how it works, knowing how it compares to human intelligence will help you appreciate their limitations, discover how they can complement each other, and how you can use both to achieve your work goals. 

 Human intelligence can be defined as the capacity to think, learn, and use information to solve problems or adapt to a new environment. Human intelligence relies on cognitive processes like perception, problem-solving, memory, and creativity. It can be limited by factors like the amount of information available or one's ability to recall information, cognitive biases, and limited attention spans. 

 Although humans and artificial intelligence use data to solve problems, AI relies on complex algorithms to process and analyze vast amounts of data at a higher pace without getting tired. AI-powered systems also have limited capabilities, as they rely on the set of instructions and the data fed into their systems to carry out tasks. 





 On the other hand, humans possess the unique ability to use their senses and emotions and apply knowledge and logic in creative ways to solve complex problems. 



 3. Develop Skills AI Can't Replicate 
    

 As good as generative AI tools like ChatGPT are, they have limitations, and AI is still far from replicating the unique skills, insights, and creativity that humans possess. As such, it is vital to invest in future-proofing skills that AI can't replicate to survive and thrive in the AI-dominated workplace. 






 Some of these AI-proof skills include empathy, creativity, problem-solving abilities, adaptability, resilience, communication, and collaboration skills. Investing in these skills will empower you to bring unique insights and solutions. Additionally, as AI solutions continuously improve, you can use your creativity to find innovative ways to use the technologies in your workplace. 



 4. Learn How to Work With AI Tools 
 Although many people believe that artificial intelligence can't replace humans in the workplace, others believe that digitally literate workers who use AI-powered tools may gain a competitive edge over those who don't. That said, you can become an asset in the AI-dominated workplace by learning how to use generative AI tools. 

 So, let's start with how to use OpenAI's ChatGPT, as it's free and also one of the most popular AI-powered tools out there. It's worth mentioning that the output you get from ChatGPT and other generative AI tools largely depends on the massive corpus of data it was trained on and your prompts. That said, learning to write good ChatGPT prompts is one of the best ways to get better responses. 





 There are several prompting techniques you can use to improve your ChatGPT responses, including writing grammatically correct prompts with enough context and details. In addition, you can also assign it a role to get more relevant and tailored answers. 



 5. Build a Robust Professional Network 
    

 Building strong connections with people who share similar interests and goals can be a great way to solidify your career prospects. As AI technologies continuously evolve and become inevitable in the workplace, staying updated on the latest trends, tools, and technologies can help you remain relevant. Building a solid professional network is one of the best ways to achieve this. 






 There are several ways creatives can network professionally, including attending in-person and virtual networking events, joining online forums and communities, attending conferences and meetups, or building a professional network on LinkedIn. Undoubtedly, some of these connections will prove invaluable in helping you thrive in your workplace. 



 6. Become a Lifelong Learner to Keep Up With Upcoming Tech 
 As mentioned above, adaptability and flexibility are vital skills in an AI-dominated workplace. That's because there's a growing consensus that artificial intelligence is moving too fast—so fast that tech innovators like Elon Musk want to pause AI development. This means you will need to swiftly learn new skills to remain competitive in this AI-dominated workplace. 

 One of the best ways to achieve this is by becoming a lifelong learner and continuously upskilling and reskilling yourself. This includes anything from staying on top of AI news to attending conferences and workshops or taking courses to learn about the latest tools. 







 Future-Proof Your Career in the AI-Dominated Workplace 
 The increasing use of artificial intelligence in the workplace is a double-edged sword, as it presents both opportunities and threats. By following these tips and investing in future-proofing skills that AI can't automate, you will be better positioned to survive and thrive in an AI-dominated workplace.

        Artificial intelligence, agriculture technologies, digital platforms and apps, e-commerce, etc. have been projected to cause significant labour market disruption, the World Economic Forum “Future of Jobs Report 2023” has revealed.
The recently released report indicated that the disruption will come with substantial proportions of companies forecasting job displacement in their organisations, offset by job growth elsewhere to result in a net positive.
According to the WEF, generative AI has received particular attention recently, with claims that 19 per cent of the workforce could have over 50 per cent of their tasks automated by AI and job losses making headlines, while others expect the technology to enhance jobs.
WEF explained that as the usage of AI and machine learning drives spurred industry transformation, it would increase the demand for AI and machine learning specialists by 40 per cent or create one million jobs. 






Recent research on generative AI showed it may affect a significant proportion of total worker tasks, adding that it did not distinguish between tasks being augmented and those automated.
The research also revealed that this was most likely to affect higher-wage roles and jobs with greater barriers to entry.
“Only robots, whether humanoid or non-humanoid, are forecast to have a net negative overall impact on employment in our data, with roughly equal cohorts of companies expecting growth, displacement, and neutral impact.        
“Big data analytics, climate change and environmental management technologies, and encryption and cybersecurity are expected to be the biggest drivers of job growth.
“Looking specifically at robots, Future of Jobs Survey data highlights the electronics (83 per cent), energy technology and utilities (72 per cent), and consumer goods (71 per cent) industries as likely top adopters,” the report stated.
Data from the International Federation of Robotics showed that the number of industrial robots per 10,000 workers had continued to increase rapidly over the last five years across countries. According to the federation, industrial robot density has nearly doubled over the last five years, reaching 126 robots per 10,000 workers on average.
The research further showed that regarding robots’ impact on employment, the strongest sectoral picture emerged for the adoption of non-humanoid robots, adding that while 60 per cent of companies operating in information and technology services foresaw job creation in the next five years, 60 per cent of companies operating in the production of consumer goods and the oil and gas industry foresaw job displacement.
WEF added, “The fastest-growing roles relative to their size today are driven by technology, digitalisation, and sustainability. The majority of the fastest-growing roles are technology-related roles. AI and machine learning specialists top the list of fast-growing jobs, followed by sustainability specialists, business intelligence analysts, and information security analysts. Renewable energy engineers, solar energy installation, and system engineers are relatively fast-growing roles, as economies shift towards renewable energy.
“The Fourth Industrial Revolution has accelerated the pace of adoption of technologies and shifted the frontier between humans and machines across sectors and geographies. Technology is altering the way we work, but also changing job content, skills in need, and which jobs are being displaced.
“Understanding how technologies will impact labour markets is crucial for determining whether people will be able to transition from declining occupations to the jobs of tomorrow. As in previous years, big data, cloud computing, and AI feature near the top of this list, with approximately 75 per cent of companies looking to adopt these technologies in the next five years.

Therefore, it seems that the first workers who are in danger of being replaced by artificial intelligence are the workers who today perform these jobs while they learn, gain experience and become more professional - the juniors. The twist in the plot is provided by those same artificial intelligence systems since they are also able to shorten the learning and training time and give the juniors an advantage. ""People are the engine behind a company. The juniors are a tremendous workforce, they come with contemporary knowledge and a lot of energy. They are a growth engine for the company, but they arrive without sufficient knowledge to develop products and it takes them several years to learn the profession and develop,"" says Dr. Rafi Yoeli, a lecturer in artificial intelligence at the School of Continuing Education at the Technion. ""There are AI tools within the organization which are designed to preserve the knowledge of people who have retired or have advanced to management positions, and these systems serve as mentors for the younger people. These systems include 70-80% of the expertise of the person who left. There is a revolution here within the organization that will allow a junior to take on a project and act as if they have years of experience and knowledge.""   According to him, not only will organizations not give up on the juniors because of the introduction of artificial intelligence tools, but they will lead the assimilation of the new technologies. ""Such integration of new AI technologies among the company's employees requires managers to deal with new variables in a space that is not yet familiar to them or their employees,"" says Aviv Hooker, CRO and co-founder of Faddom, a company that develops software that maps hybrid IT infrastructures, focusing on business applications and the impacts of changes in IT architecture. ""Such an integration process requires a strategy that examines how these innovative technological capabilities can be utilized to gain an advantage over the competition. In this environment, it is often possible to harness the juniors. These young employees who are more connected to technology and are also considered a cheaper workforce can examine these tools and determine how to properly integrate them within the organization."" Just last week it was revealed that IBM will freeze the hiring of 7,800 employees, as their tasks can be completed by artificial intelligence. According to CEO Arvind Krishna, hiring will be slowed or frozen mainly in back office departments such as human resources. Krishna also said that 30% of positions that do not require meetings with clients could be replaced within five years. IBM's announcement may be populist and an attempt to ride the AI wave, while the real reason for reducing the workforce is the economic crisis and the crisis in high-tech in particular. The same crisis that led to mass layoffs in small and large companies and also reached Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Google. However, it is nevertheless clear that we are facing far-reaching changes in the employment market.   There is quite a bit of irony in the fact that it was IBM that was a pioneer in the development of AI tools that is announcing that it will replace potentially 7,800 of the company's employees with machines. ""About a decade ago, IBM developed Watson, an artificial intelligence software that allows even inexperienced and young doctors from Africa, who do not have much access to Western medicine, to be able to make a diagnosis like the best doctors in New York. What is new today is that artificial intelligence not only performs an effective search in information databases but creates and thereby helps in assisting the creative skills of employees,"" says Prof. Avigdor Gal from the Faculty of Data and Decision Sciences at the Technion. According to Gal, generative artificial intelligence is entering creative fields and therefore workers in these positions feel threatened. Studies also show that AI can replace and improve inexperienced workers in various fields. ""Artificial intelligence creates a competitive job market of a new type. A market where success does not necessarily depend on experience but on the realization of the ability to utilize the technology,"" says Gal. ""Juniors will be able to successfully compete with those with experience and in fact the overall level of the entire market in terms of creativity and products will rise and we will have a more efficient and advanced labor market."" ""Just as the introduction of the use of computers to schools enabled a transition to teaching more abstract subjects, and just as the industrial revolution enabled a transition to the production of more sophisticated products, so the artificial intelligence that will be created will upgrade the job market and open up more fields to juniors that until now were closed to them due to lack of experience,"" says Yair Snir, Managing Director of Dell Technologies Capital Israel and Europe.   Juniors will remain in companies, but what will change will be their assignments. ""The introduction of the new technology will see the machine do many things that people used to do manually. The goal is to create more productive organizations that manage to generate more value within the existing resources,"" says Snir. ""The tasks of the organization will always be divided between the juniors, the seniors and those in between. The level will rise and it is already happening."" The implementation of the AI systems will lead to internal organizational evolution, says Snir. The integration will start with very simple tasks that someone will have to control. In the same way that there is a training period for a new employee, the machine will also be given time to learn. ""The price of integrating the machines may actually be higher than estimated, but in the end there will be a rearrangement of tasks that are technical and the machine can perform and tasks that it cannot."" Flesh and blood juniors When new employees start working in a company they have to learn, experiment and fill in gaps. Many times, because they are new to the organization, they are uncomfortable asking questions and yet, they need knowledge to move forward and be effective. Now, when juniors have access to artificial intelligence tools - the picture is changing. They don't have to ask their senior employees questions. They can turn to AI tools. ""Instead of a junior asking a colleague or manager, or spending a lot of time researching a problem or question on the Internet, with ChatGPT they can get an answer in seconds. Our juniors in the research team use it for initial assistance in writing code, and in the marketing team they use it to help answer technological questions, in writing content - such as proofreading, improving English, or drafting drafts,"" says Liat Dvir, Chief People Strategy Officer at Ermetic. The AI tools that exist today are already changing the job market. Despite the threat, as of now, the juniors do not seem to be in danger. On the contrary, they are the main beneficiaries of the use of artificial intelligence at work. A new study of workplaces using artificial intelligence tools designed to improve the work of customer service personnel found that the use of AI especially helped the new or inexperienced employees. A study by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that AI tools improve work efficiency especially for new hires. The study examined customer service personnel's use of an AI chatbot and found that employees with two months of experience performed their jobs similarly to employees with six months of experience using the AI. Learning time has shortened. The authors of the study concluded that the artificial intelligence tools help inexperienced employees to communicate with customers like experienced employees. What's more, the study found that juniors with less than half a year of experience became more productive and were less likely to leave their jobs after using the AI tool. For the more experienced workers, the artificial intelligence tools were much less helpful in their work. At Sisense, for example, they implemented an AI plugin into the developers' work environment called CoPilot and reported an improvement of between 30-50% in productivity. According to Eitan Sofer, VP Engineering at Sisense: ""This is especially dramatic for the juniors who fill in knowledge and experience gaps using AI tools. The meaning here is enormous, because the juniors can actually learn faster from the experience of others. If, for example, they write code, they are exposed to agreed sources that 90% of the developers agreed on. These tools are relevant for juniors in all areas - juniors in the product management field at the company recently started using advanced AI tools like ChatGPT for writing characterization documents and marketing content that usually takes a long time to do. The products have proven to be of very high quality and saved very valuable work time. Similar to switching to using Waze versus maps, the danger of using these tools too much is losing the independent ability to develop code in cases where it is required.""    The danger for an organization using an AI tool is a dependence that will eventually cause a loss of control over decision-making. To prevent this situation, explains Snir, the intention is to create a system of checks and balances. Although not for reasons of retaining capabilities or losing control, Samsung announced this week that it will prohibit employees from using generative artificial intelligence tools. The company is concerned about how services such as ChatGPT and Google Bard store user data. In other organizations, the technologies are adopted and the young workers are the ones who lead the trend. ""At the same time as the beginning of my role as the director of Elad's studio, we also started experimenting with AI tools,"" says Netanel Kosovsky, Head of Netcraft at Elad Software Systems. ""They were quite experimental at the time but slowly improved. Those who especially adopted those tools are our younger employees who make up 75% of the team. They are the ones who test them and then they are naturally brought to the older and more experienced team, so their role in adopting the new technologies is very important and they lead us to change and innovation. However, I don't see AI as fundamentally changing the job market. I see it as a trend like many trends I've experienced during my career.""",1763,,,,,,,,,,,2024-07-04T14:56:30.000Z,,,PT5M33S,,[],,,,,,"{'@type': 'InteractionCounter', 'interactionType': {'@type': 'http://schema.org/WatchAction'}, 'userInteractionCount': 29184}",0,5211.Ctech-5220.ctech.News,"{'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews', 'name': 'CTech'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/category/5220', 'name': 'News'}}]}",,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence jobs in finance need people who can create programs that mimic human intelligence to guide investment and banking decisions. For example, a University of Florida AI research suggests ChatGPT can predict stock price trends.
Education: Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes artificial intelligence will significantly change education. That’s why more companies and institutions adopt AI into their curriculums. As a result, more schools and online learning platforms want AI professionals.
Marketing: Nowadays, more businesses use AI chatbot marketing. Consequently, they require more employees who can build and maintain these programs. It is also a boon for customer service representatives because these chat apps need human agents for complaint escalation.
Advertising: Artificial intelligence reduces the time needed to create and launch advertising campaigns. For example, modern companies publish online ads that target specific audiences using AI. That is why businesses need more people to create and optimize these ads.
Healthcare: AI promotes the creation of new medical solutions. For example, a Cornell University student developed AI glasses that help people with speech problems. Hospitals also need AI jobs to maintain these systems.

There will be two types of artificial intelligence jobs that will become more prevalent in the future. First, more companies will hire AI researchers, data scientists, and other specialized roles.
They will help the largest firms create and maintain proprietary AI systems. After all, more companies help smaller ones adopt these technologies.
For example, the Chinese eCommerce company Alibaba announced it would build AI networks for other businesses. It promises to significantly lower development and maintenance costs with its cloud network. Amazon will do the same with the launch of Bedrock.
Second, small businesses would hire less specialized artificial intelligence jobs, like prompt engineering and writing. The free version of ChatGPT and other generative AI already empowers businesses. Also, the paid versions are more accessible to ordinary people.
These technologies are surprisingly easy to use, and you do not need advanced skills to use them properly. For example, prompt engineers mostly rely on English proficiency. More schools will offer AI education so that their countries can prepare for the age of AI. That means you will have more ways to adapt to the shifting job market.
As a result, we will have more opportunities for career growth, thanks to AI. You will perform jobs that were not available years ago. Even better, you can easily adapt to this future of work!
