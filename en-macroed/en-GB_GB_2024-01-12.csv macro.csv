Industries led by media and entertainment, banking, insurance and logistics were most likely to predict job losses because of cutting-edge AI tools, according to the poll of top directors conducted by PwC ahead of this week’s World Economic Forum. Engineering and construction firms were least likely to anticipate cuts because of automation, alongside technology companies.

Some 46 per cent of those surveyed said they expect the use of generative AI — systems that can spew out humanlike text, images and code in seconds — to boost profitability in the next 12 months, the survey added. However, 47 per cent said the technology will deliver little or no change.

The findings, based on interviews with 4,702 company chiefs spread across 105 countries, point to the far-reaching impacts that AI models are expected to have on economies and societies, a topic that will feature prominently at the annual meetings.

Executives at the forefront of AI, including Sam Altman, the recently reinstalled chief of OpenAI, and Satya Nadella of Microsoft are among those slated to attend. While many economists say they expect AI to lead to productivity gains as it becomes more pervasive, it will also lead to workforce upheaval.

The PwC survey showed that a rising share of executives envisage strengthening economic growth in 2024, but at the same time are exercised by the need to respond to revolutionary developments including generative AI and climate change.

“As business leaders are becoming less concerned about macroeconomic challenges, they are becoming more focused on the disruptive forces within their industries,” said Bob Moritz, global chair of PwC.

“Whether it is accelerating the rollout of generative AI or building their businesses to address the challenges and opportunities of the climate transition, this is a year of transformation.”

A growing number of executives are planning to deploy generative AI in the coming months, the survey showed, after 32 per cent reported they had adopted it across their company in the past year. Some 58 per cent said they expect it to improve the quality of their products or services in the next 12 months, while 69 per cent said their employees will need to learn new skills.

Last year Goldman Sachs predicted that the latest breakthroughs in AI could lead to the automation of a quarter of the work done in the US and eurozone, while sparking a productivity boom that will eventually lift annual gross domestic product around the world by 7 per cent over a decade.

When it comes to risks stemming from AI, the PwC survey showed executives are most worried about cyber security and the spread of disinformation.

In the shorter term, the study pointed to receding anxiety about the broader outlook, with less than a quarter of directors reporting that their firm is “highly/extremely” exposed to the threat of inflation, a steep drop from last year’s 40 per cent reading.

Some 38 per cent thought the global economy will enjoy better fortunes this year, double the 18 per cent who responded similarly in 2023. This is well below the optimism for growth that accompanied the ending of Covid lockdowns in previous years.

The findings reflect hopes that the worst of the inflationary upsurge that hit economies from 2021 onwards has now passed, and comes amid investor speculation that central banks led by the US Federal Reserve will start cutting policy rates as soon as this spring.

Of all the regions covered by the PwC survey, executives in Asia and North America were least concerned about inflation, with around 20 per cent reporting they are extremely or highly exposed to price growth, PwC said. Those in Africa were among those most anxious about how vulnerable their companies were to spiking prices.

Nevertheless, inflation and macroeconomic volatility trumped other threats, according to the survey, ahead of cyber risks, geopolitical volatility and climate change.",684,"{'@type': 'Organization', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'name': 'Financial Times', 'legalName': 'The Financial Times Ltd.', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@context': 'http://schema.org', 'url': 'https://im.ft-static.com/m/img/masthead_main.jpg', 'width': 435, 'height': 36}, 'url': 'https://www.ft.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.twitter.com/FT', 'https://www.facebook.com/financialtimes', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/financial-times', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/FinancialTimesVideos', 'https://www.instagram.com/financialtimes']}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Companies', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/companies'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Europe', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/europe'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Technology', 'item': 'https://www.ft.com/technology'}]",Financial Times,FT.com,http://www.ft.com,N/A,N/A,"Executives at the forefront of AI, including Sam Altman of OpenAI and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, are among those expected to attend © BloombergGenerative artificial intelligence will lead to job cuts this year, CEOs say on x (opens in a new window)Generative artificial intelligence will lead to job cuts this year, CEOs say on facebook (opens in a new window)Generative artificial intelligence will lead to job cuts this year, CEOs say on linkedin (opens in a new window)Generative artificial intelligence will lead to job cuts this year, CEOs say on whatsapp (opens in a new window)

We are on the brink of a technological revolution that  could jumpstart
productivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the  world. Yet
it could also replace jobs and deepen inequality.


The rapid advance of artificial intelligence has captivated  the world,
causing both excitement and alarm, and raising important questions  about
its potential impact on the global economy. The net effect is difficult  to
foresee, as AI will ripple through economies in complex ways. What we can
say with some confidence is that we will need to come up with a set of
policies  to safely leverage the vast potential of AI for the benefit of humanity.


Reshaping the Nature of Work

In a new analysis, IMF staff examine the  potential impact
of AI on the global labor market. Many studies have predicted  the
likelihood that jobs will be replaced by AI. Yet we know that in many cases
AI is likely to complement human work. The IMF analysis captures both these
forces.


The findings are striking: almost 40 percent of global  employment is
exposed to AI. Historically, automation and information  technology have
tended to affect routine tasks, but one of the things that sets  AI apart is
its ability to impact high-skilled jobs. As a result, advanced  economies
face greater risks from AI—but also more opportunities to leverage  its
benefits—compared with emerging market and developing economies.


In advanced economies, about 60 percent of jobs may be  impacted by AI.
Roughly half the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration,  enhancing
productivity. For the other half, AI applications may execute key  tasks
currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to
lower wages and reduced hiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these
jobs  may disappear.


In emerging markets and low-income countries, by  contrast, AI exposure is
expected to be 40 percent and 26 percent,  respectively. These findings
suggest emerging market and developing economies  face fewer immediate
disruptions from AI. At the same time, many of these  countries don’t have
the infrastructure or skilled workforces to harness the  benefits of AI,
raising the risk that over time the technology could worsen  inequality
among nations.


AI could also affect income and wealth inequality within  countries. We may
see polarization within income brackets, with workers who can  harness AI
seeing an increase in their productivity and wages—and those who  cannot
falling behind. Research shows that AI can help less experienced
workers enhance their productivity more quickly. Younger workers may find it
easier to exploit opportunities, while older workers could struggle to
adapt.


The effect on labor income will largely depend on the  extent to which AI
will complement high-income workers. If AI significantly  complements
higher-income workers, it may lead to a disproportionate increase  in their
labor income. Moreover, gains in productivity from firms that adopt AI  will
likely boost capital returns, which may also favor high earners. Both of
these phenomena could exacerbate inequality.


In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall  inequality, a troubling
trend that policymakers must proactively address to  prevent the technology
from further stoking social tensions. It is crucial for  countries to
establish comprehensive social safety nets and offer retraining  programs
for vulnerable workers. In doing so, we can make the AI transition  more
inclusive, protecting livelihoods and curbing inequality.


An Inclusive AI-Driven World


AI is being integrated into businesses around the world  at remarkable
speed, underscoring the need for policymakers to act.


To help countries craft the right policies, the IMF has  developed an AI
Preparedness Index that measures readiness in areas such as  digital
infrastructure, human-capital and labor-market policies, innovation and
economic integration, and regulation and ethics.


The human-capital and labor-market policies component,  for example,
evaluates elements such as years of schooling and job-market  mobility, as
well as the proportion of the population covered by social safety  nets. The
regulation and ethics component assesses the adaptability to digital
business models of a country’s legal framework and the presence of strong
governance for effective enforcement.


Using the index, IMF staff assessed the readiness of 125  countries. The
findings reveal that wealthier economies, including advanced and  some
emerging market economies, tend to be better equipped for AI adoption than
low-income countries, though there is considerable variation across
countries.  Singapore, the United States and Denmark posted the highest
scores on the  index, based on their strong results in all four categories
tracked.


Guided by the insights from the AI Preparedness Index,  advanced economies
should prioritize AI innovation and integration while  developing robust
regulatory frameworks. This approach will cultivate a safe  and responsible
AI environment, helping maintain public trust. For emerging  market and
developing economies, the priority should be laying a strong  foundation
through investments in digital infrastructure and a digitally  competent
workforce.


The AI era is upon us, and it is still within our power  to ensure it brings
prosperity for all.

When you read or listen to anything about generative AI and its impact on jobs, it's often a story of job losses. Massive waves of job losses as more and more tasks are given over to machines.

But the truth is more complicated – and more optimistic – than that. Because, rather than job displacement, the biggest impact of generative AI is likely to be job augmentation. In this article, we’ll look at what that means in practice and help you uncover how your own job might be impacted.




Generative AI Is Accelerating Automation
There is no doubt about it: generative AI tools like ChatGPT are accelerating the wider trend for AI-driven automation. A 2023 McKinsey report found that, by 2030, activities that add up to 30 percent of hours currently worked across the US economy could be automated. That’s a pretty big chunk, and yet, some jobs will be more affected than others.

PROMOTED
If we look at Indeed’s 2023 AI At Work report, the findings suggest that roughly 20 percent of jobs could be considered “highly exposed” to generative AI automation – meaning the technology is considered good or excellent at 80 percent or more of all skills for that job. At the other end of the scale, 34 percent of jobs were “low or minimally” exposed – but even that means that generative AI is good or excellent at up to 50 percent of the work.
In other words, almost every job will be impacted by generative AI to some extent. Some jobs will cease to exist, but many more will be augmented or altered by AI tools. And, of course, new jobs will be created, just as they have before in previous waves of transformation.

Customer service representative is a job that faces one of the highest risks of being displaced thanks to generative AI. Many customer service tasks are already automated through chatbots – and this will only increase. ChatGPT, for example, is far more impressive than your average customer service chatbot and is getting better all the time. Looking ahead, generative AI chatbots will routinely talk to customers and help them solve their problems.

But even in this highly exposed field, it doesn’t mean everyone who works in customer service is on a one-way route to redundancy. While many tasks within customer service can be automated, there will still be scenarios that require the human touch. Complex issues, sensitive topics, or situations requiring empathy and judgment will always be better handled by humans. Most likely, then, the role of customer service representative will evolve, with a smaller group of humans working alongside AI tools. In this scenario, humans will oversee AI operations and handle the more complex interactions.

At The Other End Of The Scale: Job Augmentation
What exactly do we mean by “job augmentation”? Augmentation means that rather than human workers being replaced by generative AI systems, job roles will adapt to incorporate generative AI. Indeed, many jobs – including knowledge work and creative roles – will increasingly integrate generative AI tools.
For the most part, this will mean automating certain tasks that are repeatable and straightforward – the sort of work that doesn’t really require the human touch. This allows people to focus their time and effort on aspects that require uniquely human skills.
Teaching, for example, is a role that will always need the human touch. A good teacher’s ability to inspire young minds and really connect with students is special. But can teachers use generative AI to help streamline lesson planning? Absolutely. Similarly, doctors can use generative AI tools to interpret medical images or generate medical notes more quickly, freeing up more time for patient care. Lawyers can use generative AI to automate certain research and contract analysis tasks. And software developers can use generative AI to automate parts of the code creation and testing process.

So What About Your Job?
I’d advise anyone to take a good, long look at their job to see which parts of the role are exposed to automation and which require the human touch. A good starting point is to ask yourself questions like:
· How does my work add value?
· Which of my tasks can be automated?
· And, importantly, how can I use generative AI to add greater value/deliver a better service/do a better job?
That last question is crucial. Because this process isn’t just about assessing your level of risk – it’s about finding new ways to do your job better and easier by tapping into generative AI tools.
And if you find that your job is highly exposed to automation, ask yourself, how would you like to add value in the world? To put it another way, what would you rather be doing? In her book Next! The Power of Reinvention in Life and Work, Joanne Lipman sets out a four-step reinvention road map that helps people transition to a new way of working and/or living:
· Search: this stage is about identifying the information and experiences that will inform your transition. For example, this could be a side hustle, a hobby, or a topic that you're particularly passionate about.
· Struggle: This stage is where you're starting to disconnect from your previous identity, but perhaps you don't yet know where you're going. We often overlook this stage in favor of the dramatic ""I quit my job, and now I run yoga classes in the woods"" stories. But the truth is, this stage takes time. And it's a struggle, hence the name.
· Stop: This is the thing that finally stops you in your tracks – such as a change in circumstances, or something like a global pandemic, or a decision to quit your job.
· Solution: And in this final stage, the transition is complete.

Dan Milmo Global technology editorMon 15 Jan 2024 05.53 ESTLast modified on Mon 15 Jan 2024 15.43 ESTShareArtificial intelligence will affect 40% of jobs around the world and it is “crucial” that countries build social safety nets to mitigate the impact on vulnerable workers, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund.AI, the term for computer systems that can perform tasks usually associated with human levels of intelligence, is poised to profoundly change the global economy with advanced economies at greater risk of disruption.Analysis by the IMF, the international lender of last resort, says about 60% of jobs in advanced economies such as the US and UK are exposed to AI and half of these jobs may be negatively affected. But the technology will also help to enhance some humans’ productivity as AI improves their performance, it said.Horrified by Horizon? Then get ready to be totally appalled by AIRead moreAccording to the IMF, the safest highly exposed jobs are those with a “high complementarity” to AI, meaning the technology will assist their work rather than displace it entirely. This includes roles with a high degree of responsibility and interacting with people – such as surgeons, lawyers and judges.High-exposure jobs with “low complementarity” – meaning the potential for being displaced by AI – include telemarketing, or cold-calling people to offer goods or services. Low-exposure occupations include dish washers and performers, the IMF said.AI jobs exposure is 40% in emerging market economies – defined by the IMF as states including China, Brazil and India – and 26% for low-income countries, with an overall total of just under 40%, according to the IMF.Generative AI – the term for technology that can produce highly plausible text, images and even voice from simple hand-typed prompts – has risen up the political agenda since the emergence of tools such as the ChatGPT chatbot.Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF managing director, said AI’s ability to affect highly skilled jobs means that advanced economies face greater risks from the technology. She added that in extreme cases some jobs in major economies could disappear.“Roughly half the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity,” wrote Georgieva, in a blogpost accompanying the IMF research. “For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labour demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.”She added that in most scenarios AI would probably worsen overall inequality across the global economy and could stoke social tensions without political intervention. AI is expected to feature prominently as a topic of discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, which top executives from the tech industry will attend.“It is crucial for countries to establish comprehensive social safety nets and offer retraining programmes for vulnerable workers,” Georgieva said. “In doing so, we can make the AI transition more inclusive, protecting livelihoods and curbing inequality.”The IMF analysis shows that higher-wage earners whose jobs have high complementarity with AI can expect an increase in their income, leading to an increase in inequality.“This would amplify the increase in income and wealth inequality that results from enhanced capital returns that accrue to high earners,” the IMF report said. “Countries’ choices regarding the definition of AI property rights, as well as redistributive and other fiscal policies, will ultimately shape its impact on income and wealth distribution.”The report said workers in the UK, with its high proportion of graduates, might be better prepared to switch from jobs at risk of displacement to “high complementarity” jobs, although older workers may struggle to adapt and move to new jobs or retrain.Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, which is the biggest investor in OpenAI, the US company behind ChatGPT, said on Monday there would be jobs in the future but the question remained about what would be “the shape of these jobs”. Speaking at an event hosted by the Chatham House thinktank in London, Nadella said AI could help with “mid-career transitions”. He added: “I think this is the age where this is about expertise at your fingertips. So if anything, anyone can become an expert in anything because you have the AI assistant helping you.”Last year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the occupations at highest risk from AI-driven automation were highly skilled jobs and represented about 27% of employment across its 38 member countries, which include the UK, Japan, Germany, the US, Australia and Canada. It said skilled professions such as law, medicine and finance were most at risk.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)International Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsDavos 2024newsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysWhen a bad Trump joke becomes an affair of state, Germany has lost more than its sense of humourFatma AydemirSunday was world’s hottest ever recorded day, data suggests‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s a question on the minds of many workers across industries: “Is generative artificial intelligence (genAI) going to take my job?”
Yes and no, experts say.
There’s no doubt that the technology is set to be the most disruptive in recent history. And, while on the one hand it will disrupt roles well-suited for automation, on the other it will bolster leaders and creatives and lead to entirely new job functions and career opportunities, many experts say..

ALEXANDER NICHOLAS'}]","n an age dominated by technological breakthroughs, Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is emerging as the most impactful. This transformative technology—which is reshaping nearly every sector—signals a future where mastery of Gen AI could dictate who holds global influence and power.

We have arrived at a crucial junction, magnified by the pandemic and rapid technological advancements. We now face a decision that will shape generations. Do we allow these changes to perpetuate global disparities or find ways to harness them to create a world abundant in opportunities for all?

The development of Gen AI has been predominantly concentrated in the Global North, creating a significant digital divide. This chasm places the Global South at risk of lagging further behind, with two primary challenges: access to Gen AI technology and ensuring its relevance to diverse global populations. In many regions of the Global South, the lack of infrastructure and educational support hinders the full realization of Gen AI's potential. Moreover, the suitability of Gen AI solutions, primarily designed in the tech hubs of the Global North, for the unique challenges of the Global South needs to be investigated.

The world needs a “Global Manhattan Project” for Gen AI in the Global South where the global community collaborates to accomplish one of the most significant events of the 21st century. This initiative would entail nurturing local AI ecosystems and forging global partnerships to encourage technological innovation. Through this, Gen AI could be tailored to revolutionize areas like agriculture in climate-sensitive regions, expand educational access, and strengthen public governance.

The urgency for inclusive Gen AI investment in the Global South cannot be overstated, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic underscored the interconnectedness and vulnerability of our global systems. A haphazard deployment of Gen AI could precipitate a crisis far exceeding the pandemic's impact, exacerbating poverty, widening gender disparities, and undermining democratic institutions.

By ensuring that Gen AI serves the global community, we can harness its immense potential to safeguard existing progress and propel humanity towards a more equitable and resilient future. The challenge is significant, but the potential benefits for our collective prosperity and stability are too substantial to overlook.",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Diplomatic Courier'}",,Diplomatic Courier,,https://www.diplomaticourier.com,N/A,N/A,N/A,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'www.diplomaticourier.com/posts/making-generative-ai-work-global-south'}",,,,,,,,,,,https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fa4da31b6c3a4e610fd2d5a/5fa4da31b6c3a467a9fd2ddb_dc.logo.white.full.svg,,,,,['https://diplomaticourier.com'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence may displace very large numbers of workers from their jobs, research published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warns.Worldwide, almost 40% of workers are  exposed to the impacts of the technology, Mauro Cazzaniga and colleagues say in a discussion note published on January 14. They say AI’s impact is likely to differ according to workers’ incomes.  They looked at International Labour Organization data on 142 countries.Workers in advanced economies – some 60% –

In the rush to establish technical strategies for making good on the promise of generative AI, many CIOs find themselves running headlong into what may be their most challenging task yet: preparing their organization’s end-users — from knowledge workers and assembly line laborers to doctors, accountants, and lawyers — to co-exist with generative AI.
Although many analysts, thought leaders, vendors, and chief executives view and position large language models (LLMs) and tools such as Microsoft Copilot as assisting rather than replacing workers, the flood of generative AI products that have hit the market and speedy implementation of LLMs in production to perform many human tasks has challenged that argument, outlining a complex relationship between artificially intelligent machines and the humans who must work with them.
Given the disruptive potential of generative AI, the stakes are high, as Reuven Cohen, strategic AI advisor to Baxter International, a Fortune 500 company, points out.
 
 
 













 
 

“The struggle is augmenting your workforce or replace it altogether,” he says. “Step one is likely a question of empowering the most capable people in your organization with highly tailored AI; the next step is removing the less capable altogether.”

But what will be defined as ‘less capable’ will likely be impacted by the technology’s evolution, as well as the evolution of human-machine partnerships wherever the technology is implemented. After all, one increasingly common adage is that generative AI will not replace humans but “humans who are using generative AI will replace humans who are not using generative AI,” as Teradyne CIO Shannon Gath said on a September episode of CIO Leadership Live.
For now, most CIOs are deploying generative AI to enhance productivity and efficiency. Gartner pegs this number at 77% of CIOs. Jamie Holcombe, CIO of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, is one.
 
 
 













 
 

“I consider AI an augmented intelligent tool. I don’t feel you collaborate with a tool — you use it,” Holcombe says. “Our examiners are welcoming the help from AI tools to take away the clerical and administrative functions so they can focus more on thoughtful analytics that cannot be merely programmed.”
Consequently, one of the CIO’s top priorities for 2024 is discovering and uncovering the added value human workers can concretely achieve using LLMs — and much of this remains unknown.
Mike Mason, chief AI officer at Thoughtworks, believes CIOs must remain critical when considering new generative AI tools for their workforces in light of this issue.
 
 
 













 
 

“Even as AI becomes more advanced and integrated into software and everyday tasks, an influx of AI tools is causing confusion among employees,” he says. “CIOs must remember that it is their workforce who will be using this AI technology, and consider the impact of AI on their workforce, ensuring proper management, training, and integration to make the most of their investment.”

The makings of a close partnership
Even as industry luminaries call for caution on AI, most corporate giants, including Goldman Sachs, Fidelity Investments, Procter & Gamble, American Express, Gilead Sciences, and many others, have gone public about developing and deploying LLMs internally to boost productivity and innovation.
At Fidelity, early returns are proving fruitful for cost savings and increased efficiencies, said Vipin Mayar, the finserv’s head of AI innovation, at the Chief AI Officer Summit in Boston in December.
 
 
 













 
 

While he acknowledged LLMs are not on par with human intelligence, Mayar sees the pace of innovation in generative AI as unparalleled. “It’s only been 13 months and it made time nonlinear,” he quipped.
Still, to ensure workers gain the most out of the tools, Mayar suggested multimodal LLMs combining structured datasets and unstructured data should be designed smaller and for specific tasks.
Yvonne Li, vice president of AI, data engineering, and decision science at Advanced Auto Parts, agrees that the technology — and how humans will make use of it — is still in its early stages.
 
 
 













 
 

“Gen AI is not a magic bullet,” she said at the summit. “Gen AI can pull data together and gives data scientists a different lens, but it can’t ideate for us. People are using gen AI for efficiency and as a tool for diagnostic problems.”
Thomson Reuters is one organization targeting gen AI for efficiency. The company recently released a generative AI platform that makes it easier for its developers to create solutions like AI-Assisted Research on Westlaw Precision. Westlaw with generative AI enables legal editors to produce document summarization of legal research in minutes that used to take days or weeks to complete, says Shawn Malhotra, head of engineering at Thomson Reuters.
Thomson Reuters’ legal drafting with Microsoft Copilot, another aspect of the platform, unlocks higher functionality for legal editors as well. But observers say innovations such as these will require CIOs to develop upskilling and governance strategies to ensure employees can benefit from new generative AI implementations, wherever they reside. This is fast becoming crucial, as the push for productivity gains is putting pressure on workers across the enterprise to learn to collaborate with LLMs, many of which remain in pilot testing.
 
 
 













 
 

“LLMs in many ways can and will exceed human capabilities, but I’m a firm believer that AI will continue to augment humans,” says John T. Marcante, US CIO in residence at Deloitte, and former global CIO at Vanguard. “I think AI will be man’s very close companion now and in the future.”
To ensure an amicable relationship, Marcante stresses the importance of considering stakeholder workflows when implementing generative AI.
“It’s important to remember that using AI to accelerate an outdated or onerous process could be the wrong answer. More benefit may come from a process or technology improvement instead of broad application of AI to ‘fix’ problems,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

Changing how work gets done
Evolutions in the technology, as well as its use, are sure to transform how workers make the most of the tools over time.

At CES this week, Accenture released a public statement that generative AI tools are more “human by design,” pointing to refined conversational user interfaces, robots that respond to English commands, and software that augments how humans work naturally, such as Adobe Photoshop’s Generative Fill and Expand features.
Late last year, Gartner kicked off its annual IT Symposium/Xpo detailing how generative AI is revolutionizing the human-machine relationship.
 
 
 













 
 

“It’s more than just a technology or a business trend. It really is shift in how we interact with machines,” said Mary Mesaglio, a Gartner analyst. “We are moving from what machines can do for us to what machines can be for us. Machines are evolving from being our tools to becoming our teammates. “
Machines are not only evolving into work partners but also into customers, Mesaglio said. For instance, connected to a service that monitors usage levels, HP printers are capable of purchasing ink when needed. Tesla automobiles are also capable of ordering parts when a self-diagnosis surfaces a malfunction.
USPTO’s Holcombe also believes that evolutions in interfaces will help workers be more effective with the tools, with the next iteration of human-to-machine interface being audio with natural language rather than keyboards and the mouse. But he still does not see LLMs replacing human cognition any time soon.
 
 
 













 
 

“Human thinking and analysis have not been overtaken by machines because the algorithms themselves are at best iterations and trial and error for guessing,” he says. “I’ve never seen a machine make an intuitive leap without it being programmed by a human.”
Usama Fayyad, executive director of Northeastern University’s Institute for Experiential AI, sees conversational AI becoming increasingly important in the enterprise, providing more substantial answers to questions over time. Content generation, document summarization, as well as enhanced analysis and insight extraction tools and decision-making algorithms that require human augmentation will also be important use cases for enterprises across industries, he says.  
But for these tools to reach their full potential, how — and how often — they are put to use by humans is important. Such is the nature of the technology.
 
 
 













 
 

Joe Atkinson, chief products and technology officer at PwC US, sees generative AI applications helping to create a more tech-savvy workforce. But it remains unclear how workers will add value to the tools themselves, which, by design, learn as they go. No doubt human creativity will be necessary to elevate the quality of application, he says.
To that end, Gartner advises CIOs to establish “lighthouse” principles that define how workers and machines will interact in the year ahead — a priority that the firm puts on par with making data AI-ready and implementing AI-ready security.

After all, generative AI is not a set-it-and-forget-it tool — at least not yet. It requires human oversight and experience to assure accuracy, quality outcomes, and safety.
 
 
 













 
 

As part of this push, CIOs are gearing up with education and training sessions, implementing generative AI tools into the workplace gradually, and reassuring workers that AI tools are designed to augment their work and not replace them.
Sreenivasan Narayanan, executive vice president of Nous Infosystems, an enterprise technology consultancy in Dallas, has attended an AI program at the Wharton School of Business and has trained 42% of Nous’ workforce on Level 1 AI skills.
“We were dabbling with GitHub, PowerApps, Teams, M365, and Security Copilots so far in our digital labs a while back,” he says. “In the last few months, we have deployed this to production-grade client environments to provide solutions around code generation, case document summarization, voice answering, language translation,” he adds. “The workforce will embark on Level 2 [training] while more inducted in this organizational transformation.”
 
 
 













 
 

The human factor
But not all are taking their employers’ word for it.

Microsoft and the AFL-CIO recently announced the creation of a partnership, described as a first of its kind, designed to keep the dialogue open about AI development and how it may impact workers’ needs and roles, incorporate worker feedback, and shape public policy that supports the technology skills and needs of frontline workers, according to Microsoft.
And at its IT Symposium, Gartner led off with what it says was an unusual, but necessary call to arms: that machines are taking on different roles, and in some cases, human roles, and this cannot be ignored.
Moreover, the rapid pace of innovation of ChatGPT and development of capabilities such as DocLLM — which would be far more accurate in extracting data that is unstructured, such as images and video — has some wondering whether human-like artificial capable intelligence (ACI) and artificial super intelligence (ASI) will arrive sooner than expected and alter the value equation in the machine’s favor.
 
 
 













 
 

In the meantime, the daily evolution of generative AI platforms is exciting to developers and eagerly awaited by enterprise executives. For CIOs and CTOs, it’s a balancing act of cost vs ROI. Generative AI solutions are expensive to build and deploy and that will temper enterprise adoption, observers say.
“As CTOs, we need to work on quickly evaluating new tech, and whether it makes sense for our companies and what we need for our users,” says Jeremy King, SVP and CTO of engineering at Pinterest. “It’s a lot to evaluate — from whether to ‘buy or build’ to ensuring it works with existing foundations.”
Chief among those foundations — at least for now — is the company’s workforce. CIOs should strategize accordingly.

From jobs to skills, and regulations and governance, AI permeated conversations like never before. The impact it will have on jobs is on the radar of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which has just released its Staff Discussion Note Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work.It finds almost 40% of employment globally is exposed to AI, which rises to 60% in advanced economies. Among workers, those that are college-educated and women are more exposed to AI, but also more likely to reap the benefits, while strong productivity gains could boost growth and wages.Countries around the world have been exploring regulation and governance around AI, including the European Union, where a draft deal on AI rules was agreed in December.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesWe also held our own AI Governance Summit, in response to rising concerns about the technology’s impact, released a set of recommendations, and explored the impact of AI and large language models on jobs.As we look ahead to 2024 at Davos, AI as a driving force is one of our four key themes.

This session brought together the chief executives of Deloitte, Sanofi, L'Oréal, and Exponential View, to explore the most likely scenarios for jobs and productivity. Emerging technology has the potential to have a significant impact on jobs.  Image: World Economic Forum360° on AI RegulationsMicrosoft President Brad Smith joined Arati Prabhakar, the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Vera Jourová, Vice-President for Values and Transparency at the European Commission, and Josephine Teo, Singapore's Minister for Communications and Information, to discuss the future of AI governance.There are diverse approaches to regulating AI, from the US, EU and multi-nationally to date, but Brad Smith said he expects more convergence in the future.""We won't have a world without divergence, but people actually care about a lot of the same things and actually have similar approaches to addressing them.""Jourová said AI promises ""a lot of fantastic benefits for people"". “The regulation is the precondition to cover the risks, but the rest remains to be free for creativity and positive thinking - and in Europe we are well placed. ”— Vera Jourová, Vice-President for Values and Transparency, European CommissionEthics in the Age of AIPhilosopher Michael Sandel explored the ethical questions AI poses, beyond jobs, fairness, privacy and democracy to whether technology would affect what it means to be human.If we can digitally de-age the actor Harrison Ford in the latest Indiana Jones movie, it is OK to bring back actors such as Humphrey Bogart from the dead?Sandel showed the audience a video interview of him and director and actor Michael B Jordan discussing casting deceased actors.It boiled down, he said, to a deep human value of authenticity and presence.He concluded: ""Will new technologies lead us, or are they already leading us and our children to confuse virtual communities and human connection for the real thing? Because if they do, then we may lose something precious about what it means to be human."" What to know from Day 4 Education Meets AIAI has the potential to change education and the way we learn.

Partovi said when people think about job losses due to AI, the risk isn't people losing their job to AI. ""It's losing their job to somebody else who knows how to use AI. That is going to be a much greater displacement. It's not that the worker gets replaced by just a robot or a machine in most cases, especially for desk jobs, it's that some better educated or more modernly educated worker can do that job because they can be twice as productive or three times as productive.""“The imperative is to teach how AI tools work to every citizen, and especially to our young people.”— Hadi Partovi, Founder and CEO, Code.orgAgendaWill copyright law enable or inhibit generative AI?Gen AI: Boon or Bane for Creativity?Generative AI presents a future where creativity and technology are more closely linked than ever before.

Login     Listen to this article 6 min    Does generative artificial intelligence – such as ChatGPT which is capable of generating content such as text and images – represent a big threat to your job security?It’s a question even people in previously “safe” professions are asking themselves as companies look to harness the cutting-edge technology to replace existing workers.AI is coming to the professional services sector at a rate of knots. David RoweEven software companies – which are expected to be the big beneficiaries of AI – could reduce their headcount. After all, if generative AI can boost the productivity of existing workers by 50 per cent to 100 per cent, these companies won’t need to hire as many workers as in the past.And the process is already under way. According to the Financial Times, “a quarter of global chief executives expect the deployment of generative artificial intelligence to lead to headcount reductions of at least 5 per cent this year,” according to a PwC survey of 4702 company bosses, spread across more than 100 countries.“Industries led by media and entertainment, banking, insurance and logistics were most likely to predict job losses because of cutting-edge AI tools”, the FT reported.AdvertisementIn contrast, “engineering and construction firms were least likely to anticipate cuts because of automation, alongside technology companies”.Of course, the potential of generative AI technology to revolutionise workplaces has long been recognised.Productivity boomLast year, Goldman Sachs predicted that generative AI systems would lead to the automation of a quarter of the work done in the US and eurozone.The US investment bank said generative AI could spark a productivity boom that would eventually boost annual global gross domestic product by 7 per cent over a decade.But it warned that the technology would also bring “significant disruption” to the labour market, exposing about 300 million full-time workers in big economies to automation.AdvertisementThe International Monetary Fund has also weighed into the debate, warning that about 40 per cent of jobs around the world could be affected by AI. It says workers in affluent economies – where there are more cognitive task-oriented jobs – face greater risks than those in emerging markets and developing countries.In a blog post, IMF boss Kristalina Georgieva noted that “in advanced economies, about 60 per cent of jobs may be impacted by AI”.“Roughly half of the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity. For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labour demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring.“In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.”A new IMF discussion paper, Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work, points out that AI differs from previous technological revolutions because higher-income earners now find themselves at risk of displacement.“AI challenges the belief that technology affects mainly middle and, in some cases, low-skill jobs: its advanced algorithms can now augment or replace high-skill roles previously thought immune to automation.”AdvertisementAs a result, the IMF paper says, “even high-skill occupations, which were previously considered immune to automation because of their complexity and reliance on deep expertise now face potential disruption”.“Jobs that require nuanced judgment, creative problem-solving, or intricate data interpretation – traditionally the domain of highly educated professionals – may now be augmented or even replaced by advanced AI algorithms, potentially exacerbating inequality across and within occupations.”So what’s at risk?The first step is to break down individual occupations into their various tasks, and then consider which of these can be replaced or complemented by technology. This determines the AI “exposure” of particular occupations.The IMF researchers then consider the social, ethical and physical context of various occupations to determine how likely an occupation is to be shielded from AI-driven job displacement.For instance, they note that “because of advances in textual analysis, judges are highly exposed to AI, but they are also highly shielded from displacement because society is currently unlikely to delegate judicial rulings to unsupervised AI”.AdvertisementAs a result, “AI will likely complement judges, increasing their productivity, rather than replacing them.”In contrast, the IMF researchers say “clerical workers, who are also very exposed to AI but have a lower level of shielding, are more at risk of being displaced”.That means there will be an uneven impact across the labour market.“Occupations with high exposure for which AI can autonomously complete tasks may see reduced human labour demand, leading to lower wages.”On the other hand, “jobs that require human supervision over AI may experience a boost in productivity, which would raise labour demand and wages for incumbent workers”.The corollary is that AI could exacerbate income and wealth inequality – workers who can harness it will enjoy a boost in their productivity and wages, while others fall behind.AdvertisementWhat’s more, if AI significantly complements higher-paid occupations, it could lead to a disproportionate increase in their salary levels.And the productivity gains enjoyed by companies that adopt AI will lift capital returns, which will tend to favour the more affluent.Educational levels and age will also be important factors.According to the IMF researchers, “college-educated workers are better prepared to move from jobs at risk of displacement to high-complementarity jobs: older workers may be more vulnerable to the AI-driven transformation”.On a more optimistic note, they point out that if AI results in a productivity surge, “higher growth and labour demand could more than compensate for the partial replacement of labour tasks by AI, and incomes could increase along most of the income distribution”.RelatedWhat could derail this ‘risk on’ rally?RelatedWhy Howard Marks doesn’t believe in GoldilocksKaren Maley writes on banking and finance, specialising in financial services, private equity and investment banking.

Oliver Wyman Forum Finds Challenges Remain in Training Current and Future Workforces 
DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Oliver Wyman, a business of Marsh McLennan (NYSE: MMC), announced today findings from a new report entitled ""How Generative AI is Transforming Business and Society,"" released at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
The report, from Oliver Wyman's think tank, the Oliver Wyman Forum, found that more than half of employees globally now use generative AI at work and that adoption is far higher in some countries. The Forum also found that adoption has not necessarily translated into higher levels of productivity – yet.
""The adoption rate of generative AI has been nothing short of remarkable,"" said John Romeo, CEO of the Oliver Wyman Forum. ""ChatGPT achieved mass adoption in less than one year -- a stark contrast to the internet, which took 17 years, smartphones 21 years, and electricity which took three decades, but training is not keeping up and we are facing an AI productivity disconnect.""
Forecasting business impact over the next decade, the report shows generative AI-trained junior employees will climb into management ranks faster than ever before. And senior-level leaders express the greatest levels of concern about losing their jobs to generative AI automation, according to the report.
Key workplace findings from the report are below:

Developing Countries Ahead: India leads 16 countries in employee adoption with 83% surveyed reporting daily or at least weekly use of generative AI. By contrast, weekly use by North American and European employees is below 50%.
Explosive Growth Among Pink & Blue Collars: Between June and November 2023, generative AI use exploded among white-collar knowledge workers as well as pink-collar workers. Doctors, nurses, and life-sciences employees increased weekly use by 264%. Weekly adoption among pink-collar education employees grew 144%, and blue-collar retail worker use increased by 71%.
Productivity Gains Are Years Away: As many as 20% of employees who report generative AI has not increased their productivity say they are bogged down by corporate guidelines and ""unsatisfactory output"" which adds review and editing time to projects. The full potential of generative AI's productivity gains is still six to 10 years away, according to the report.
Generative AI Training Gap: Lack of productivity may be linked to insufficient training. Employees at all levels seek more upskilling than employers currently provide. Among white-collar employees, 80% want more or better AI training, but only 64% currently say they receive it. This gap is wider among pink-collar employees.
Job Loss Concern: Across the 17 industries and job types studied, 60% of employees express increasing concern their jobs will be replaced by generative AI. Globally, 30% of all job seekers say generative AI is motivating their job search. Employees who worry about AI are 57% more likely to feel their productivity is declining and 78% more likely to believe they don't matter to their employer, according to recent data from the American Psychological Association.

Consumer findings include:

Bias concerns: In all 16 countries studied, most consumers are concerned generative AI is producing biased content. People are most concerned in India (92%) and least concerned in France (73%) while 83% of US respondents report being are concerned.
Trust is shaken: When asked if organizations using generative AI are untrustworthy, 29% said ""yes,"" with 18% saying generative AI tools ""are not trustworthy at all"" or ""not very trustworthy.""
Privacy, cybersecurity and more: Privacy, cybersecurity and overreliance on generative AI are the top three concerns for over 30% of consumers, but many cited additional worries, including job loss (29%), environmental impact (15%) and mental health (14%).

Ana Kreacic, COO of the Oliver Wyman Forum and Chief Knowledge Officer of the Oliver Wyman Group commented: ""Automation is no longer just a narrative of blue-collar workers. Many white-collar workers fear their roles will become displaced with generative AI, and this anxiety is having a direct impact on productivity. It's a misconception for businesses to wait a year or two and hope to hire a fully generative AI trained workforce. Companies need to reskill the employees they have now by focusing on areas with the most near-term applications.""
About the report
Oliver Wyman Forum conducted the survey to enhance its understanding of generative AI, specifically in the context of the workplace, the consumer economy, and risk. The survey was conducted in June and November 2023 among a total of 25,000 respondents across 16 countries including: the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, China (Hong Kong), India, Indonesia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia.

New Microsoft Copilot tools will enable retailers to take the first steps with generative artificial intelligence, says Microsoft.
“Retailers are looking for ways to begin working with generative AI that will allow them to learn quickly and scale effectively,” said Shelley Bransten, corporate vice president of global retail, consumer goods and gaming industries at Microsoft, in a recent blog post. “I’m excited to share new tools that help retailers more easily incorporate AI across the shopper journey.”
Retailers can use the Microsoft Cloud for Retail copilot template on Azure OpenAI Service, currently in public preview, to build individualised shopping experiences across their existing websites and applications.



The copilot template enables retailers to provide personalised customer experiences


Another copilot template has been designed to help store associates to work more productively and improve their customer service.
“Our copilot template for store operations helps build a generative AI-powered large language model-based assistant that enables Q&A from store documentation such as store operating procedures and natural laungague-based task creation,” said Bransten. “Store associates can use natural language to quickly and easily access the information they need in the flow of work, increasing their productivity and efficiency.”



Another copilot template helps store associates to work more efficiently


New copilot features, which will be available in the first quarter of 2024, will also help retailers to plan, develop and monitor marketing campaigns with the capabilities.
Retailers can also optimise their media captions with the Microsoft Retail Media platform, which is available for preview in January 2024, and collect and analyse their data with Microsoft Fabric.
Microsoft plans to expand on the possibilities of generative AI-powered retail tools at NRF 2024, with a talk on ‘Retail Unlocked: Achieve more with Microsoft’ hosted by Bransten and a session on ‘Unlocking true customer-centricity: Optimising touchpoints across the shopper journey with AI’ by Kathleen Mitford, corporate vice president of global industry marketing at Microsoft, and more.

Generative AI Enterprise Use Cases
Some enterprises, like marketing and sales-driven companies, have quickly added generative AI to their workflows because of the speed and scale AI tools can bring to content production and customer relationship management efforts. Other industries that have more legal and compliance hoops to jump through — such as healthcare, insurance, and education — have been more hesitant to add generative AI, which is growing quickly but without much transparency or regulation.
Enterprise companies across these industries and more are looking to today’s top AI companies for assistance — most enterprises cannot produce or support artificial intelligence without external support. Below, learn about some of the top ways AI companies are fulfilling enterprise use cases that take maximum advantage of generative AI capabilities.
To learn more about the growth of this powerful emerging tech, read our guide: Generative AI Landscape: Current and Future Trends
Code Generation, Documentation, and Quality Assurance
For software developers and programmers, generative AI can write, complete, and vet sets of software code. Quality assurance is perhaps the most important emerging use case in this area, with generative AI models handling bug fixes, test generation, and various types of documentation.
As they mature, generative AI coding tools are increasingly assisting non-developers by creating code from their natural language scenario-based queries. This particular feature of AI coding tools is a promising development in a business world that’s pushing for greater tech democratization and accessibility.
But what many people don’t realize is that these tools can also supplement the work of experienced developers and coders. Particularly if developers are looking to move through a coding project more quickly or with fewer errors, generative AI tools can make well-informed recommendations to support their efforts. For example, many generative AI coding tools provide code autocompletion, error detection and correction, and even code refactoring to make complex code more readable and efficient.

Product Development and Management
Generative AI is now being used to code various apps, write product documentation, and manage user experience and new iterations throughout the product lifecycle. Generative AI is also increasingly being implemented for generative design, or the act of using AI to generate different design concepts at scale so product designers can more effectively determine their optimal design.
Developers and product managers can use generative AI tools to autocomplete, improve, and consolidate data for their various requirements. For example, a product developer or designer might use a generative AI tool to brainstorm new code and designs that they wouldn’t have considered otherwise. A product manager, on the other hand, may use generative AI tools that consolidate and summarize user feedback from various data sources so products can be improved with relevant data.
Most commonly today, generative AI foundation models and APIs are being used to develop new and fine-tuned generative AI models and products. Several enterprises have built customer service and chatbot generative AI tools based on OpenAI foundation models.

Blog and Social Media Content Writing
With the right prompts and inputs, large language models (LLMs) are capable of creating appropriate and creative content for blogs, social media posts, product pages, and business websites. Existing content can be modified, shortened, or expanded upon with generative tools, and many of these tools can also generate entirely new content with the right user prompts and contextual information.
Generative AI models that focus on this type of content generation enable users to give instructions on article tone and voice, input past written content from the brand, and add other specifications so new content is written in a way that sounds human and relevant to the brand’s audience. However, users need to remember that generated content could contain inaccuracies or unsubstantiated claims; particularly for content that is journalistic or fact-driven, writers, editors, and/or QA analysts should take the time to personally fact-check AI outputs before publishing them.

Inbound and Outbound Marketing and Sales
Inbound and outbound marketing campaigns frequently require employees to send contextualized emails and chat threads to prospective and current customers on a daily basis. Generative AI solutions can create and send the content for these communications to lessen the load. In some cases, they can also automate the process of moving these contacts to the next stage of the customer lifecycle on a CRM platform.
These types of assistive generative AI tools are increasingly popping up in both CRM and project management platforms, but there are also many independent generative AI tools for sales and marketing workflows. If your team of sales development representatives, marketers, salespeople, or other members who focus on outreach are getting minimal results with their current outreach strategies, the right tool can help them generate better content at a greater scale. Even better, a growing number of these sales and marketing tools include AI-powered analytics so you can develop a deeper understanding of what is and isn’t working with your current tactics.

Project Management and Operations
Project management platforms are in the early stages of incorporating generative AI into their toolkits, but many have already released public betas or full versions of AI suites to their users. These tools can support users with everything from task and subtask generation and recommendations to note-taking to project risk prediction, and use cases continue to expand, particularly for automation workflows. Project management AI tools also help users manage and summarize documents, datasets, and other assets so both internal resources and client-submitted information can be processed and applied to projects more efficiently.
Several generative AI tools have also emerged for assistive and secretarial tasks, both within project management platforms and as standalone solutions. With these tools, users can use a voice assistant to take notes and jot down ideas on their mobile devices, create smart and quick email replies, complete smart searches and summaries of important business documents, and automate certain communication workflows. The goal of this type of technology is to save time, giving users the ability to focus their efforts on higher-level strategy rather than day-to-day business and data management.

Graphic Design and Video Marketing
 
Generative AI is capable of generating realistic images, animation, and audio that can be used for graphic design and video marketing projects. Some generative AI vendors also offer voice synthesis and AI avatars so you can create marketing videos without actors, video equipment, or video editing expertise.
Generative AI video marketing tools are some of the earliest pioneers in multilingual content generated by artificial intelligence. While video avatars in particular will need some work before they can believably replace human speakers, this development is an exciting one, especially for global enterprises that need to send out video marketing or communication messages in languages they don’t speak.
In general, this type of generative AI lowers the barrier to entry for accessing technologies and products that have traditionally been cost-prohibitive. For example, generative AI tools can be used to not only edit headshots but also create believable background imagery and other edits so companies don’t need to pay for professional headshots. As another example, several generative AI tools are emerging that can create a relevant social media graphic or image based on user inputs.

Entertainment Media Generation
As AI-generated imagery, animation, and audio become more and more realistic, this type of technology is being used to create the graphics for movies and video games, the audio for music and podcast generation, and the characters for virtual storytelling and virtual reality experiences. With many of these tools, an actual human does not need to go on camera, edit footage, or even speak in order to create believable content.
Some tech experts predict that generative AI will constitute the majority of future film content and script writing, though creatives are understandably pushing back on that assumption. Right now, these tools are primarily used to supplement existing scripts and create more interactive non-player characters (NPCs) in the entertainment industry.

Performance Management and Coaching
Generative AI can be used in several business and employee coaching scenarios. For example, contact center call documentation and summarization, when combined with sentiment analysis, gives managers the information they need to assess current customer service rep outreach calls and coach employees on ways to improve.
Generative AI coaching and performance management tools can support both managers and their direct reports. Business leaders can use generative AI tools to inform — and even structure — performance reviews for their employees, while employees can use conversational AI tools to get feedback on their performance and areas for improvement independently.
However, while these kinds of AI solutions are trained to give thorough feedback and utilize ample data to back that feedback, not all employees will be comfortable with or trust this performance management approach. It’s important to supplement any generative AI you use in business performance management with direct manager feedback, catered training, and other personal touches that earn and maintain employee trust.

Business Performance Reporting and Data Analytics
 
Because generative AI can work through massive amounts of text and data to quickly summarize the main points, it is becoming an important tool for business intelligence and performance reporting. It’s especially useful for unstructured and qualitative data analytics, as these types of data usually require more processing before insights can be drawn.
Generative AI data analytics tools may be standalone products or embedded features within well-established data analytics platforms, such as Power BI. Generative AI enables traditional data analytics platforms to go beyond manual workflows and visualizations by supplementing the data scientist’s ideas with suggestions for improved visuals, easier-to-read reports, and cleaner data.
One of the most interesting areas being explored with this technology is data narratives, which are highly contextualized AI explanations of datasets. This goes beyond typical visualizations and dashboards into explainable data, which is particularly helpful for less technical business stakeholders and other key players who need straightforward information about business performance.

Customer Support and Customer Service
For many of the most straightforward customer service engagements, generative AI chatbots and virtual assistants can handle customer service questions at all hours of the day. Chatbots have been used for customer service for many years, but generative AI advancements are giving them additional resources to provide comprehensive and more human answers without the help of a human customer support representative.
Many early adopters of this technology are building custom service solutions with the help of OpenAI’s API and ChatGPT Enterprise. Customer service generative AI solutions are dramatically changing the chatbot landscape by offering longer service hours at far cheaper costs while also offering users higher-quality, real-time responses to more complicated queries than ever before.
Similar to AI-driven performance coaching, enterprise users must strike the right balance between AI transparency and a human touch with customer service. For example, you may want to state upfront if a generative-AI-informed chatbot is handling a customer’s initial questions, but to keep them from getting frustrated, make it clear that a human is available to support them if the questions go beyond the chatbot’s frame of knowledge. Being transparent and aware of what customers want still allows you to save time with repeated or simple questions but simplifies the handoff if a human support representative needs to step in.

Medical Diagnostics and Pharmaceutical Drug Discovery
Generative AI in medicine and pharmaceuticals is still nascent, but that is changing quickly. Image generation and editing tools are now increasingly used to optimize and zoom into medical images, allowing medical professionals to get a better and more realistic look at certain areas of the human body. Some tools even perform medical image analysis and basic diagnostics on their own, though it’s important to view this success cautiously and bolster results with actual medical professionals who can check results for quality.
On the pharmaceutical side, generative AI technology is being used to make drug discovery and design processes more efficient for new drugs. With this new development, scientists are beginning to generate novel molecules, more effectively discover disordered proteins, and design and predict clinical trial results.
AI-driven drug discovery is one of the areas of generative AI that is receiving the most funding right now, so expect this particular enterprise use case to grow significantly in the coming months and years. Few tools have been officially brought to market, but a number are in beta and early adopter trials. However, there has also been fairly significant churn among both medical and pharmaceutical AI companies, so it’s unclear who the leading players are in this segment or who the leaders will be in the coming months and years.

Consumer-Friendly Synthetic Data Generation
 
Although generative AI poses some crucial security concerns, it can also be used to heighten data and consumer privacy when used strategically for synthetic data generation.
For example, generative AI can be used to create synthetic data copies of actual sensitive data, allowing analysts to analyze and derive insights from the copies without compromising data privacy or compliance. With these accurate data copies, data analysts and other members of an enterprise team can develop AI models and score those models without exposing actual business or consumer data to their efforts.
A range of different tools are available for generating synthetic data, but one of the most interesting tool formats is the generative adversarial network (GAN). With this type of generative tool, two different neural networks compete against each other to learn intricate data patterns and structures for duplication. This competition-driven learning framework enables generative models to develop a more complex understanding of source data so they can effectively create synthetic data for a variety of enterprise use cases, including data augmentation, image generation, drug discovery, anomaly detection, and voice generation.

Smart Manufacturing and Predictive Maintenance
Generative AI is quickly becoming a staple in modern manufacturing, helping workers create more innovative designs and meet other production goals. In the realm of predictive maintenance, generative models can generate to-do lists and timelines, make workflow and repair suggestions, and simplify the process of assessing complex data from sensors and other parts of the assembly line.
Generative AI copilots are taking off in diverse enterprise settings and use cases, including manufacturing. With these types of copilots, both engineers and frontline workers are given real-time data about system performance issues and optimizations, how current assembly lines and tasks can be optimized, and what data needs to be considered for more efficient outcomes in the future.
In medicine, manufacturing, and other materials-based industries, generative AI is also being used in a process called inverse design. With inverse design, generative AI assesses missing materials in a process and generates new materials that fulfill the required properties for that environment. With inverse design and other innovations in the background, generative AI is going into projects like semiconductor chip development and design, which makes it a helpful solution for creating the materials generative AI models themselves need to operate effectively.

Fraud Detection and Risk Management
AI-powered fraud detection and risk management technology can analyze large amounts of transaction or claims data, quickly summarizing and identifying any patterns or anomalies in that data. With these capabilities, generative AI is a great supporting tool for fraud detection, underwriting, and risk management in finance and insurance scenarios.
For insurance in particular, generative AI can benefit both insurers and their customers. Both underwriters and claims adjusters can use generative AI tools to scour previous policies and claims — both their own and third-party data sources — to optimize coverage and claim outcomes for their customers. This process gives customers more reasonable and well-fitted plans for their needs and also saves insurers time, as they can quickly pull together the right plans and settlements because of how generative AI collects and summarizes massive amounts of relevant data.
The flip side of this solution is a potential concern for enterprises, as bad actors can take advantage of generative AI tools to commit fraud and other crimes more effectively. At this phase in generative AI development, companies need to invest in fraud and threat detection solutions to mitigate this risk.

Optimized Enterprise Search and Knowledge Base
Both internal and external search are benefitting from generative AI technology. For employees and other internal users of business tools, generative AI models can be used to scour, identify, and/or summarize enterprise resources when users are searching for certain information about their jobs or projects. These tools are designed for not only searching typical sources, like company files, but also company applications, messaging tools, and web properties.
Similarly, generative AI models can be embedded into company websites and other customer-facing properties, giving visitors a self-service solution for finding answers to their brand questions. Many companies have long invested in chatbot support tools, but with generative AI-powered search, these chatbots now have a much larger library of resources to reference when answering user questions.
Creating smarter versions of self-service search tools can save time for every member of your team. Leaders can shift their focus to higher-value projects and tasks rather than focusing their energy on routine employee training and information sharing. On the flip side, employees still receive the information and training they need. If the same technology is applied to customer service, customers can independently find the answers to their most important questions so your team can focus on other areas of business growth and management.

For employees who frequently travel or book travel for their colleagues, Expedia’s travel planner can smooth out the planning process and free up time for more important tasks.
E-commerce and Retail: Shopify Use Case


Shopify now offers Shopify Magic to help retailers generate product descriptions and other product-related content with artificial intelligence. Users can input a verbal tone and a handful of keywords that they want to be represented in the product description. From there, Shopify generates a description that matches those parameters.
Shopify is one of the few retail and e-commerce enterprises that has tapped into generative AI at this time. Although Shopify Magic is still fairly new, it is being integrated with other Shopify features so Shopify customers can better incorporate AI assistance at every stage of product development and selling.
Fintech and Software Development: Stripe Use Case


Stripe, a financial services SaaS company, is using OpenAI’s GPT-4 to power better documentation, summarization, and query management for developers that use Stripe Docs. Stripe Docs is set up so users can input natural language queries about documentation. Stripe Docs then responds by summarizing and extracting important pieces of that content in a user-friendly format.
Stripe is also helping OpenAI and several other generative AI companies better monetize their products with Stripe Billing, Stripe Checkout, Stripe Tax, Revenue Recognition, and Link. These tools help OpenAI, Runway, Diagram, Moonbeam, and other generative AI companies create a smoother subscription and checkout process for customers, all while managing compliance and finances for these AI companies.

Generative AI Use Cases: Ethics and Compliance
Generative AI is an emerging technology, and there are still many unknowns that significantly impact its use in the enterprise. For example, most users aren’t familiar with how the models are trained or what data goes into their training.
Additionally, these models have wide-ranging capabilities that can both help and harm cybersecurity postures. And finally, generative AI models are quickly growing in their skill sets, posing a threatening alternative for many skilled workers’ careers.
So what can enterprises do to make sure they’re using generative AI responsibly, ethically, and in compliance with security and privacy regulations? We believe best practices for using generative AI ethically will evolve rapidly as the technology matures, but these tips are a good way to get started with responsible use:

Only input depersonalized and nonsensitive data into large language models. Otherwise, your most sensitive data could become part of the tool’s training dataset and be exposed to third-party users and companies.
Stay current with generative AI news and trends. The generative AI space is changing daily, and with that change comes regular news about companies that are getting the technology right and others that are taking dangerous and/or unethical steps in their AI development efforts. Staying updated on all of these changes will ensure you only use the most credible tools and work with the most ethical AI providers.
Create an AI usage and ethics policy for your business. Your policy should cover how internal users in your organization are allowed to use AI tools and also how your business is allowed to invest in third-party tools. For reference, several AI policy templates are already publicly available.
Offer career training to all employees. Employees are understandably afraid that parts of their jobs will soon be outsourced to AI. To combat this fear and build up their career prospects, offer training and certifications that will help employees use AI in their jobs and build skills that cannot easily be replicated by AI models.

From the creation of new art to the bolstering of cyber security, the technology will soon be ubiquitous — and the moment is historic.AI has been compared to the printing press or the steam engine — two technologies that brought about once-in-a-generation advances and fundamental changes in how we operate. Speakers on panel at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting unanimously agreed with the premise of the session: Generative AI: Steam Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.And they had words of advice for all of us on surviving and thriving in the new age of AI:Have you read?AI - artificial intelligence - at Davos 2024: Rolling coverage and what to know“If you embrace Artificial Intelligence, you will be complete. If you do not and you're late, you'll be finished. And if you reject it altogether, you will be completely finished,"" said Omar Sultan Al Olama, United Arab Emirates Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence.IBM Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna said generative AI's impact on jobs would be huge.""It is the first technology that goes after the white collar work or what I will call the lower half of cognitive work ... It doesn't matter whether you're a physicist, mathematician, a computer scientist, a doctor, a writer,"" he said.So what will be the one key skill we all will need to thrive in the age of AI?""If the lower half of cognitive work gets taken over by genAI, it implies that you've got to learn critical thinking. That means critical thinking, regardless of which domain you're in, becomes the skill that is far, far more needed,"" Krishna said.Accenture Chair and CEO Julie Sweet said the ability to keep learning was key, and that was something Accenture demanded of all its employees, even at the interview stage:""We ask one question to every person, regardless of whether you're a coder or you're a strategist or you're a doctor or you're working in HR. We ask one interview question to everyone. We say: what have you learned in the last six months?""We don't care if it's how to bake a cake, but we have to have people who like to learn. And that question is incredibly insightful, you have to have people who want to learn and build a learning culture,"" she said.The World Economic Forum's most recent Future of Jobs report said: ""Analytical thinking and creative thinking remain the most important skills for workers ... Analytical thinking is considered a core skill by more companies than any other skill.Continuous learningAll the panelists in Davos stressed the need to adapt education to the coming changes.""We actually deployed AI education within our schooling,"" the UAE's Omar Sultan Al Olama said.""So from grade five onwards, people learn how to code. From grade nine onwards, kids in schools actually learn what artificial intelligence is, what are the ethics of it, and they also understand, whatever their career path is going to be, how AI is going to affect it.""Beyond school, we need to keep learning, said IBM's Krishna.""Continuous learning, I think, is a hallmark,"" he said.""A statistic: The half-life of skills used to be 30 years. It's now seven years. So if you think about that, that means that an average career, you're going to change five times your overall skills.""Accenture's Sweet told the Davos audience: “AI will create a lot of new jobs, but you won’t be able to take the current people and put them in the jobs unless you partner together — governments and companies — on reskilling.”Accenture has already prioritized a minimum level of digital literacy across the board — their staff must understand concepts like cloud technology, for example, at a minimum — giving the company an advantage when it comes to building an AI-ready workforce.It’s not just businesses that can bring their people along in the AI revolution.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
AI is transforming the future of work, with potential disruptions and the need for reskilling. While some jobs may be automated, AI can enhance human capabilities and productivity. Reskilling is crucial to adapt to changing demands, and collaboration is needed for comprehensive programs. AI has economic implications, creating new industries and addressing inequality, but also poses challenges. Upskilling, social safety nets, and worker protections are necessary for an equitable future of work.




In the rapidly evolving age of artificial intelligence (AI), the future of work is undergoing a profound transformation.
This article delves into the potential job disruptions, the significance of reskilling, and the economic implications accompanying this new era of work.
Job Disruption and AI: Adapting to a Changing Landscape
As AI evolves and automates tasks previously performed by humans, professionals need to take on the challenge of adapting to this changing landscape. Here are some key aspects of this transformation.
The Complex Relationship Between AI and Employment
The impact of AI on employment sparks concerns about job displacement and automation. For example, a recent report by investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.
However, it is essential to note that the relationship between AI and employment is multifaceted.
Instead of merely replacing humans, AI technologies have the potential to enhance and complement human capabilities. According to a recent research paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), for example, customer support agents who utilized a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) AI tool experienced an approximate 14% boost in their productivity.Advertisements




This is because AI can assist workers in completing tasks more efficiently, allowing them to focus on their work’s more creative and innovative aspects. This way, AI can empower individuals and increase their productivity rather than replace them.
Vulnerable Occupations and Automation
It is also true, however, that certain types of jobs are at a higher risk of automation than others, depending on the industry.
Jobs that involve repetitive manual tasks or data processing, such as assembly line workers or data entry clerks, are particularly susceptible to automation. These roles often consist of routine activities that AI systems can easily replicate.
An insightful Forbes analysis suggested finance & banking, media & marketing, and legal services are/will be the sectors most affected by AI automation.
On the other hand, jobs that rely heavily on skills like creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence are less likely to be automated. Professions in healthcare, education, and the arts, for example, require human empathy and judgment, which are challenging for AI systems to replicate accurately.
The Forbes report corroborates some of these assumptions, explaining manufacturing & factory workers, agriculture, and healthcare are the sectors more resistant to automation and less likely to be replaced by AI technologies.
Reskilling and Upskilling: Thriving in the AI-driven Workforce
Reskilling and upskilling are crucial not only for individuals but also for organizations to thrive in the AI-driven workforce. As mentioned above, the transition to an AI era brings a significant shift in the job market, with automation replacing routine tasks.
The Importance of Reskilling in the AI Era
With AI increasingly automating routine tasks, workers need to acquire new skills that complement and enhance these technologies. Effective prompt engineering capabilities, for instance, are one of them.
While AI excels at processing large amounts of data and performing repetitive tasks, it lacks problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence. Therefore, individuals must engage in learning and continuous skill development to stay relevant in the job market.
Additionally, organizations must prioritize reskilling efforts to ensure their workforce can effectively utilize AI technologies and adapt to changing industry demands.
Collaborative Efforts for Reskilling
Successful reskilling outcomes require collaborative efforts from various stakeholders.
Governments play a crucial role in creating an enabling environment for reskilling initiatives by implementing policies that promote accessible and affordable education and training opportunities.
Additionally, educational institutions must adapt their curricula to include AI literacy and offer training programs that equip workers with the skills needed to collaborate effectively with AI technologies.
Through collaboration between governments, educational institutions, and other stakeholders, comprehensive reskilling programs can be developed and implemented, ensuring the workforce is equipped with the skills required to thrive in the AI era.
Economic Implications: Unleashing the Potential of AI
As AI advances rapidly, its economic implications become increasingly significant. Unleashing the full potential of AI holds the promise of transforming industries, driving innovation, and revolutionizing productivity.
Creating New Industries and Opportunities
The advent of AI technology can potentially give rise to entirely new industries and job opportunities.
Integrating the technology into various sectors can increase productivity as mundane and repetitive tasks are automated. This automation allows human workers to focus on more value-added activities that require creativity and critical thinking skills.
Adopting AI can create a positive feedback loop, where increased innovation, enhanced efficiency, and greater economic output further fuel the development of new industries and job opportunities.
Addressing Inequality and Job Polarization
While AI can create new employment opportunities, it also poses challenges related to job polarization and income inequality, as recently expressed by economist Daron Acemoğlu.
For context, job polarization refers to the division of the labor market between high-skilled, well-paid jobs and low-skilled, low-paid jobs, with a decline in middle-skilled positions.
Additionally, AI automation may lead to job displacement in certain occupations. Inclusive policies and support mechanisms are essential to ensure the equitable distribution of AI benefits.
Collaboration between governments, businesses, and society at large becomes crucial to create a future of work that is accessible to all.
Measures such as upskilling and reskilling programs, social safety nets, and regulations protecting workers’ rights can help mitigate the negative impact of AI on inequality and job polarization, fostering an environment where everyone can participate and benefit from AI tools.
The Bottom Line
Embracing the future of work in the age of AI presents both opportunities and challenges.
While some jobs may be disrupted and automated, AI technologies have the potential to augment human capabilities and create new and exciting job prospects. Reskilling and upskilling the workforce are crucial for adapting to changing job market demands.
By embracing AI and investing in human capital, we can shape a future where humans and machines work together to create a more productive, innovative, and equitable society.

A recent Financial Times essay argued it is time to start discussing a targeted tax on artificial intelligence companies to address expected job losses from AI. While the intentions behind such a proposal may seem well-meaning, an AI tax at this juncture would be premature and also sets a dangerous precedent.


First and foremost, projections of massive job losses stemming from AI are highly speculative. It is true that some studies forecast widespread employment losses. A report from the consulting firm McKinsey estimated that 30 percent of current work hours in the U.S. could be automated by 2030. The IMF says about 40 percent of workers worldwide are in high-exposure occupations with respect to AI.

Yet while AI will inevitably destroy some occupations, it will also lead to new kinds of work. History shows that technology often creates as many or more jobs than it destroys, just different kinds of jobs and usually higher-paying ones as well. For example, new positions at AI companies and roles like “prompt engineer” are likely to emerge, while the AI systems themselves will also require human oversight and maintenance. Rather than displace all workers, AI will augment jobs, allowing people to focus on higher-value tasks.

PROMOTED
Meanwhile full automation—where humans are completely removed from decision making—is typically challenging and rarely cost-effective. Until the extent of displacement is better understood, an AI tax is jumping the gun. Rather than upend the tax code, policymakers should instead wait to see what AI’s actual effects are on the labor market and then tailor a response, if one is needed, to conditions on the ground.

Relatedly, the hypothesized “transition” to an AI economy could be abrupt or it could be very gradual. A short transition, based on a “singularity” moment where rapid innovation transpires in an extremely compressed time period could indeed result in considerable disturbance to the labor market. In that case, the situation might well require some adjustment assistance for some workers. On the other hand, a long, drawn out transition would leave ample time for the labor force to adapt.

Predicting the pace of AI’s impacts is essentially just guesswork. Progress rarely follows a straight line. Breakthroughs happen alongside delays and dead ends. Rushing to support displaced workers before it is even clear who benefits and who loses from technology be could prove a mistake, especially if AI integrates relatively less smoothly into business activity as part of a slow and deliberate process.

Moreover, workers themselves are not helpless victims of progress. Ample opportunities exist for mid-career skill development even without government retraining programs, which are rarely effective anyway. Policymakers should trust workers’ resourcefulness in charting their own futures.

The author of the Financial Times column points to a global agreement on the minimum corporate tax rate as a model for the proposed AI tax, but implementing an international AI tax regime has its own problems. Tax and regulatory competition between countries is healthy. Contrary to the myth of a regulatory “race to the bottom,” tax havens play a beneficial role by imposing discipline on high-tax nations and encouraging reforms when governments overstep their bounds.
Consider that Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, which reduced the corporate tax rate in the U.S. The Biden administration sensibly kept most of these business tax provisions in place, despite having the opportunity to overturn them. There is much more consensus on these topics than often meets the eye.
In fact, singling out a technology for punitive taxes is unfair and sets a troubling precedent. In a recent paper, my co-authors and I predicted AI could become the next target after cryptocurrencies for discriminatory electricity taxes. With proposals for AI taxes now appearing in the mainstream press, that warning is appearing prescient.
Instead of making scapegoats of innovators, officials should pursue policies that foster an open and competitive global business environment. They should not punish based on hypotheticals, nor should they constrain tax competition through cartel-like international agreements. Innovation, not a destructive AI tax, is the surest path to shared prosperity.

From an innovation growth point of view, it raises an increasingly important question: Where to find the talent needed in some of these fast-growing roles and avoid a scenario in which talent availability becomes a binding constraint for economic development and growth?On the other hand, the exponential growth of the global AI market also highlights the need for establishing standards and frameworks that ensure responsible AI practices and procurement, especially for commercial enterprises.How are businesses navigating these challenges while leveraging its potential? Here, four leaders share insights on how their companies are exploring the field.Have you read?Davos 2024: Who's coming and what to expect'Innovation is burgeoning'Jeff Schumacher, CEO NAX GroupAI is the next frontier in a long line of disruptive technologies, offering enterprises immense potential to create value and solve complex challenges, such as reducing scope3 emissions. Yet, to truly realize the promise of AI, businesses must not only adopt it but also operationalize it. This process involves connecting AI models with observable actions, leveraging data subsequently fed back into the system to complete the feedback loop. The critical element lies in automating these steps, enabling rapid, self-learning iterations that propel continuous improvement and innovation.In pursuing this goal, however, established leaders often grapple with limitations rooted in experience, hampered by technology functions inundated with backlogs and technical debt from critical systems reliant on outdated technologies. These challenges highlight the impracticality of attempting transformation from within – it’s too time-consuming, costly, and risky.“To truly realize the promise of AI, businesses must not only adopt it but also operationalize it.”— Jeff Schumacher, CEO NAX GroupIn recognizing these hurdles and the escalating need to confront large-scale systemic issues, businesses are increasingly forging strategic partnerships with software and services companies. Such collaborations signify the evolving landscape of industry practices and serve as a catalyst for businesses to create innovative solutions to challenges that previously seemed insurmountable.'People are key to confidence in AI'Carmine Di Sibio, EY Global Chairman and CEOThe biggest threat to business adoption of AI is not a lack of desire but confidence. In a recent EY survey, nearly 70% of CEOs revealed that uncertainty around generative AI made it challenging to develop and execute a strategy quickly.Leaders’ concerns are not without merit. Consider AI chatbots: they produce erroneous outputs or “hallucinate” 3% of the time, with incidents peaking at 27%. Companies also have reservations about data privacy, misinformation and intellectual property. In sectors where generative AI has immense potential to improve lives – such as health care, financial services and logistics – such risks are untenable. Indeed, they are for most businesses.Every new technology has a hype phase before its total value is realized. However, navigating the in-between can be messy. So, how can organizations harness AI confidently? An important first step is implementing people-led governance mechanisms. For example, the EY AI principles cover crucial considerations such as accountability, security, transparency and sustainability. It also means using human input to “fine-tune” models and interpret outputs. In other words, to unlock AI’s value, we must put people at the centre.After all, technologies we’ve come to rely on – from the internet to cellphones – were once AI-powered transformation strategies to optimize performance and foster confidence in this game-changing technology.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookies'Pitching AI enthusiasm just right'Lisa Heneghan, Chief Digital Officer, KPMG InternationalAI is unquestionably the “internet” moment of our time. The speed at which it will be debated, embraced and improved will surprise even the most enthusiastic supporters. In KPMG’s CEO Outlook survey, 70% of senior executives told us that generative AI is their top investment priority and that it’ll pay off in the next three to five years. It’s clear that despite economic uncertainty, CEOs are focused and determined to make AI work for them. For corporate leaders, the danger right now is the “fear of missing out” driving decisions which could damage long-term profits or create new ethical or cyber security challenges. It’s a delicate balancing act between late adopters who may miss golden growth opportunities and early adopters who risk making impulsive moves that could backfire. Companies should start investing today. Understanding the business case will not be about savings but based on driving experience and skills, which will help identify the opportunities. Focus on getting the foundations in place and building the right tech platforms that are agile enough to adapt to the rapidly evolving AI landscape. It is better to test and learn now than watch and miss the opportunity to lead change – time to market is more important than perfection.“It’s a delicate balancing act between late adopters who may miss golden growth opportunities and early adopters who risk making impulsive moves that could backfire.”— Lisa Heneghan, Chief Digital Officer, KPMG International'Making AI work with safety at the fore'Dr. John Markus Lervik, Chief Strategy & Development Officer and Co-Founder, CogniteIndustrial companies face an AI revolution dilemma. How do they innovate for competitiveness with AI when hallucinations are not an option for critical asset operations in energy and manufacturing?The ageing industrial workforce, low data literacy, difficulty attracting talent, hazardous working environments, increasingly complex optimization needs and sustainability all call for AI-based solutions, including AI robotics. With disruptive generative AI innovation occurring in every part of society, industrial enterprise boardrooms increasingly push for AI strategy and investment as the highest priority. But how do we make generative AI work for industries where safety is the top priority?The answer is surprisingly simple. By combining generative AI large language models with industrial knowledge graphs. If the “knowledge graph” is as new to you as large language models, that is because, in the context of digital transformation, they are better known as the data models that power digital twins. From that perspective, large language models need digital twins to make generative AI work for industry.Digital twins provide a deterministic, real-time, governed and access-controlled digital representation of real-world assets with all its processes, whereas large language models offer a natural language conversational interface for anyone to access the digital twin for insight and analytics. It’s a win-win.'Companies must act on AI-driven OT automation'Anant Maheshwari, President and CEO Global High Growth Regions, HoneywellAI is rapidly creating new opportunities across industries, yet most companies are still trying to define how to use AI to impact profit and loss positively. Accelerating AI across Operational Technology (OT) automation is one opportunity. OT has leveraged control automation for decades, and it is here that AI can become the logical leap forward. Reaching this goal requires organizations to adopt a new integrated software and hardware playbook for OT as a critical automation enabler. Additionally, the right technology partners are needed to combine a patchwork of IT and OT systems under a common strategy and coherent execution building on embedded control systems. Get this right, and the returns will be significant.“The pace of AI’s evolution is evident and companies must act on AI-driven OT automation now to avoid getting left behind.”— Anant Maheshwari, President and CEO Global High Growth Regions, HoneywellOne example of such automation can be seen in a real estate company to reduce energy intensity across an international buildings portfolio. It has achieved higher revenues from tenants who want a data-driven pathway to reduce scope 3 emissions. Another example can be seen from a global energy company that has dramatically reduced downtime and associated costs and increased throughput revenues by deploying AI-enabled controls across its OT assets.These “early movers” are leveraging AI to impact profit and loss positively and drive higher shareholder returns. However, the pace of AI’s evolution is evident and companies must act on AI-driven OT automation now to avoid getting left behind.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesRelated topics:Emerging TechnologiesForum InstitutionalShare:Contents'Innovation is burgeoning''People are key to confidence in AI''Pitching AI enthusiasm just right''Making AI work with safety at the fore''Companies must act on AI-driven OT automation'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a Sunday blog post, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva called for governments to establish social safety nets and offer retraining programs to counter the impact of AI. “In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,” she wrote ahead of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, where the topic is set to be high on the agenda. The ski resort town of Davos was already bedecked with AI advertisements and branding as the summit got underway Monday. Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, and his biggest backer — Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella — will speak at the event later this week as part of a program that includes a debate Tuesday on “Generative AI: Steam Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution?” As AI continues to be adapted by more workers and businesses, it’s expected to both help and hurt the human workforce, Georgieva noted in her blog. Echoing previous warnings from other experts, Georgieva said the effects were expected to be felt more deeply in advanced economies than emerging markets, partly because white-collar workers are seen to be more at risk than manual laborers. In more developed economies, for example, as much as 60% of jobs could be impacted by AI. Approximately half of those may benefit from how AI promotes higher productivity, she said. “For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring,” wrote Georgieva, citing the IMF’s analysis. “In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.” In emerging markets and lower income nations, 40% and 26% of jobs are expected to be affected by AI, respectively. Emerging markets refer to places such as India and Brazil with sustained economic growth, while low-income countries refer to developing economies with per capita income falling within a certain level such as Burundi and Sierra Leone. “Many of these countries don’t have the infrastructure or skilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over time the technology could worsen inequality,” noted Georgieva. She warned that the use of AI could increase chances of social unrest, particularly if younger, less experienced workers seized on the technology as a way to help boost their output while more senior workers struggle to keep up. AI became a hot topic at the WEF in Davos last year as ChatGPT took the world by storm. The chatbot sensation, which is powered by generative AI, sparked conversations on how it could change the way people work around the world due to its ability to write essays, speeches, poems and more. Since then, upgrades to the technology have expanded the use of AI chatbots and systems, making them more mainstream and spurring massive investment. Some tech firms have already directly pointed to AI as a reason they are rethinking staffing levels. While workplaces may shift, widespread adoption of AI could ultimately increase labor productivity and boost global GDP by 7% annually over a 10-year period, according to a March 2023 estimate by Goldman Sachs economists. Georgieva, in her blog post, also cited opportunities to boost output and incomes around the world with the use of AI. “AI will transform the global economy,” she wrote. “Let’s make sure it benefits humanity.” Rob North in Davos contributed reporting.",606,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'CNN', 'logo': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61', 'foundingDate': '1980-06-01', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/cnn/', 'https://twitter.com/CNN', 'https://www.instagram.com/cnn/', 'https://www.youtube.com/cnn']}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Business', 'item': 'https://www.cnn.com/business/index.html'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Tech', 'item': 'https://www.cnn.com/business/tech/index.html'}]",,,,N/A,N/A,"

            Almost 40% of jobs around the world could be affected by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), a trend that is likely to deepen inequality, according to the International Monetary Fund.
    

            In a Sunday blog post, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva called for governments to establish social safety nets and offer retraining programs to counter the impact of AI.
    

            “In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,” she wrote ahead of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, where the topic is set to be high on the agenda.

300 million jobs could be affected by latest wave of AI, says Goldman Sachs




            In more developed economies, for example, as much as 60% of jobs could be impacted by AI. Approximately half of those may benefit from how AI promotes higher productivity, she said.
    

            “For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring,” wrote Georgieva, citing the IMF’s analysis.
    

            “In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.”
    

            In emerging markets and lower income nations, 40% and 26% of jobs are expected to be affected by AI, respectively. Emerging markets refer to places such as India and Brazil with sustained economic growth, while low-income countries refer to developing economies with per capita income falling within a certain level such as Burundi and Sierra Leone.
    

            “Many of these countries don’t have the infrastructure or skilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over time the technology could worsen inequality,” noted Georgieva.

            She warned that the use of AI could increase chances of social unrest, particularly if younger, less experienced workers seized on the technology as a way to help boost their output while more senior workers struggle to keep up.

The tech sector is pouring billions of dollars into AI. But it keeps laying off humans




            AI became a hot topic at the WEF in Davos last year as ChatGPT took the world by storm. The chatbot sensation, which is powered by generative AI, sparked conversations on how it could change the way people work around the world due to its ability to write essays, speeches, poems and more.
    

            Since then, upgrades to the technology have expanded the use of AI chatbots and systems, making them more mainstream and spurring massive investment.
    

            Some tech firms have already directly pointed to AI as a reason they are rethinking staffing levels.
    

            While workplaces may shift, widespread adoption of AI could ultimately increase labor productivity and boost global GDP by 7% annually over a 10-year period, according to a March 2023 estimate by Goldman Sachs economists.
    

            Georgieva, in her blog post, also cited opportunities to boost output and incomes around the world with the use of AI.
    

            “AI will transform the global economy,” she wrote. “Let’s make sure it benefits humanity.”

By any measure, 2023 was an amazing year for AI. Large language Models (LLMs) and their chatbot applications stole the show, but there were advances across a broad swath of uses. These include image, video and voice generation.
The combination of these digital technologies have led to new use cases and business models, even to the point where digital humans are becoming commonplace, replacing actual humans as influencers and newscasters.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Importantly, 2023 was the year when large numbers of people started to use and adopt AI intentionally as part of their daily work. Rapid AI innovation has fueled future predictions, as well, including everything from friendly home robots to artificial general intelligence (AGI) within a decade. That said, progress is never a straight line and challenges could sidetrack some of these predicted advances.
As AI increasingly weaves into the fabric of our daily lives and work, it begs the question: What can we expect next?”
Physical robots could arrive soon
While digital advancements continue to astonish, the physical realm of AI — particularly robotics — is not far behind in capturing our imagination. LLMs could provide the missing piece, essentially a brain, particularly when combined with image recognition capabilities through camera vision. With these technologies, robots could more readily understand and respond to requests and perceive the world around them.
In the Robot Report, Nvidia’s VP of robots and edge computing Deepu Talla said that LLMs will enable robots to better understand human instructions, learn from one another and comprehend their environments.
One way to improve robot performance is to use multiple models. MIT’s Improbable AI Lab, a group within the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), for instance, has developed a framework that makes use of three different foundation models each tuned for specific tasks such as language, vision and action. 
“Each foundation model captures a different part of the [robot] decision-making process and then works together when it’s time to make decisions,” lab researchers report. 
Incorporating these models may not be enough for robots to be widely usable and practical in the real world. To address these limitations, a new AI system called Mobile ALOHA has been developed at Stanford University. 
This system allows robots “to autonomously complete complex mobile manipulation tasks such as sautéing and serving a piece of shrimp, opening a two-door wall cabinet to store heavy cooking pots, calling and entering an elevator and lightly rinsing a used pan using a kitchen faucet.”
An ImageNet moment for robotics
This led Jack Clark to opine in his ImportAI newsletter: “Robots may be nearing their ‘ImageNet moment’ when both the cost of learning robot behaviors falls, as does the data for learning their behaviors.”  
ImageNet is a large dataset of labeled images started by Fei Fei Lee in 2006 and is widely used in advancing computer vision and deep learning research. Starting in 2010, ImageNet served as the dataset for an annual competition aimed at assessing the performance of computer vision algorithms in image classification, object detection and localization tasks.advertisement
The moment Clark references is from 2012, when several AI researchers including Alex Krizhevsky along with Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, a form of deep learning, that achieved a dramatic reduction in image classification error rates.
This moment demonstrated the potential of deep learning, and is what effectively jumpstarted the modern AI era. Clark’s view is that the industry could now be at a similar moment for physical robots. If true, biped robots could be collaborating with us within a decade, in hospitals and factories, in stores or helping at home. Imagine a future where your household chores are effortlessly managed by AI-powered robots.
The pace of AI advancement is breathtaking
Many such inflection points could be near. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said recently that AGI, the point at which AI can perform at human levels across a wide variety of tasks, might be achieved within five years. Jim Fan, senior research scientist and lead of AI agents at Nvidia, added that “the past year in AI is like leaping from Stone Age to Space Age.”advertisement

Consulting giant McKinsey has estimated that gen AI will add more than $4 trillion a year to the global economy. Securities from UBS recently updated their perspective on AI, calling it the tech theme of the decade and predicted the AI market will grow from $2.2 billion in 2022 to $225 billion by 2027. That represents a 152% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), a truly astonishing number.
Enthusiasm for the potential of AI to improve our quality of life runs high. Bill Gates said in his “Gates Notes” letter at the end of 2023 that “AI is about to supercharge the innovation pipeline.” A New York Times article quotes David Luan, CEO of AI start-up company Adept: “The rapid progress of A.I. will continue. It is inevitable.” 
Given all of this, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that gen AI is at the peak of inflated expectations according to the Gartner Emerging Technology Hype Cycle, a gauge of enthusiasm for new technologies.

Is AI progress inevitable?
As we revel in the achievements of AI in 2023, we must also ponder what challenges lie ahead in the aftermath of this rapid growth period. The momentum behind AI is unlike anything we have ever seen, at least since the Internet boom that fueled the dot com era — and we saw how that turned out.
Might something like that occur with the AI boom in 2024? A Fortune article suggests as much: “This year is likely to be one of retrenchment, as investors discover many of the companies they threw money at don’t have a workable business model, and many big companies find that the cost of compute outweighs the benefit.” 
That view aligns with Amara’s Law that states: “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.” Which is another way of stating that systems attempt to rebalance after disruption, or that hype often outpaces reality.
This view does not necessarily portend the AI industry falling from grace, although it has happened twice before. Since it was originally coined as a term at a 1956 Dartmouth College conference, AI has had at least two periods of elevated expectations that ended due to problems encountered in building and deploying applications when the speculative promises did not materialize. The periods, known as “AI winters,” occurred from 1974 to 1980 and again from 1987 to 1993.

Not all rainbows and unicorns
Now amid a brilliant “AI summer,” is there a risk of another winter? In addition to the cost of computing, there are also issues with energy use in AI model training and inference that is running into a headwind of climate change and sustainability concerns.
Then too, there are what are sometimes referred to as the “Four Horsemen of the AI-pocalypse:” data bias, data security, copyright infringement and hallucination. The copyright issue is the most immediate, with the recent lawsuit brought by the New York Times against OpenAI and Microsoft. If the Times wins, some commentators have speculated, it could end the entire business model on which many gen AI companies have been built.
The biggest concern of all is the potential existential threat from AI. While some would welcome the advent of AGI, seeing this as a pathway to unlimited abundance, many others led by proponents of Effective Altruism are fearful that this could lead to the destruction of humanity.
A new survey of more than 2,700 AI researchers reveals the current extent of these existential fears. “Median respondents put 5% or more on advanced AI leading to human extinction or similar, and a third to a half of participants gave 10% or more.”
A balanced perspective
If nothing else, the known and potential problems function as a brake on AI enthusiasm. For now, however, the momentum marches forward as predictions abound for continued AI advances in 2024. 
For example, the New York Times states: “The AI industry this year is set to be defined by one main characteristic: A remarkably rapid improvement of the technology as advancements build upon one another, enabling AI to generate new kinds of media, mimic human reasoning in new ways and seep into the physical world through a new breed of robot.”
Ethan Mollick, writing in his One Useful Thing blog, takes a similar view: “Most likely, AI development is actually going to accelerate for a while yet before it eventually slows down due to technical or economic or legal limits.” 
The year ahead in AI will undoubtedly bring dramatic changes. Hopefully, these will include advances that improve our quality of life, such as the discovery of life saving new drugs. Likely, the most optimistic promises will not be realized in 2024, leading to some amount of pullback in market expectations. This is the nature of hype cycles. Hopefully, any such disappointments will not bring about another AI winter.

In a world grappling with racial inequalities, artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising tools for fostering equity and inclusion. By identifying and addressing biases in various areas, people are using AI to dismantle systemic barriers and promote racial equality. The process has already started, so let’s explore how AI is currently being utilized to enhance racial equality and overcome some of the historical barriers that exist.

AI in Law Enforcement and Judicial Systems
Perhaps surprisingly to some people, AI is increasingly being employed in law enforcement and judicial systems to reduce racial biases. Consider, these systems are already employing tools like COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) for risk assessment in courts to predict the likelihood of re-offending. While initially criticized for potential biases, ongoing improvements and oversight are being implemented to ensure its fairness and promote more equitable justice. In policing, AI-powered facial recognition technology is focused on reducing racial bias, contrary to people’s initial fears on how visual identification could be used. For example, IBM has developed more equitable facial recognition systems by training algorithms on diverse datasets. This approach helps in accurately identifying individuals across different racial groups, reducing instances of misidentification.

AI in Employment and Recruiting
AI is already revolutionizing the hiring process by promoting diversity and reducing unconscious biases. AI-powered tools like Entelo and HireVue analyze a candidate's experience and skills without considering factors like race or gender, enabling fairer recruitment processes. For instance, Unilever utilizes AI-driven assessments in its hiring process, which has led to a more diverse workforce. Moreover, AI is used for job advertisement targeting to reach diverse candidates. LinkedIn uses AI algorithms to ensure job ads are not biased towards a particular demographic, encouraging a diverse range of applicants.

AI in Education and Academic Research
Today, educational institutions use AI tools to provide equitable learning experiences. Knewton, an adaptive learning platform, tailors educational content to individual students’ needs, helping bridge the achievement gap in racially diverse classrooms. Moreover, academic researchers leverage AI to analyze and address racial disparities. Project Implicit, a Harvard University initiative, uses AI to study implicit racial biases among individuals, providing insights that inform policies and practices in education and beyond.Shot of human hands stuck on each other between business colleagues partnershipgetty
Potential Future Applications of AI in Promoting Racial Equality
Looking ahead, AI has the potential to further promote racial equality in several innovative ways. First is bias detection in media and literature: AI could be used to analyze media content and literature for racial biases, providing insights that could inform more inclusive content creation. Second is community engagement platforms. AI-powered platforms could facilitate community discussions on racial issues, analyzing sentiments and suggestions to inform policy making. Third is enhanced language translation services. AI-driven translation services could be improved to cater to a wide range of dialects and languages, ensuring better communication and understanding across different racial groups. Fourth is AI in policy formulation: AI systems could assist policymakers in analyzing data related to racial disparities, helping in the creation of more equitable policies and programs.

AI's role in promoting racial equality is a powerful testament to the technology's potential for social good. By addressing biases in various sectors, people will benefit from AI’s help to create a more equitable world. However, the success of these efforts depends on continuous improvements in AI algorithms and ongoing human oversight to ensure fairness. As AI systems continue to evolve, our application of these capabilities in enhancing racial equality will likely expand, offering new and innovative ways to address long-standing disparities and forge a path towards a more inclusive society.

However, surprisingly, the impact will not be felt equally across countries. Advanced economies like the US and Europe face greater disruption than emerging markets and low-income nations. ""In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,"" said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in a recent blog post about the study. She warned that if AI complements high-income workers more, it could widen wealth gaps as returns to capital increase. To combat this, Georgieva recommended countries implement ""comprehensive social safety nets"" and retraining programs to support workers vulnerable to displacement. While some occupations could become fully automated by AI, it is more likely to augment human capabilities in most roles initially. Georgieva's views come as political and business leaders meet at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos this week, where AI's impact is a hot topic. The regulatory environment for AI remains in flux globally. For instance, the European Union reached a tentative deal last month on legislation governing use of the technology, including risk assessments and transparency rules. Meanwhile, the US is still evaluating its stance on AI regulation at the federal level. In related news, 2024 is already seeing a wave of layoffs from tech companies including big names like Google and Amazon. In such a scenario where layoffs are already so common, would AI only exacerbate the problem?

intelligence has the power to reshape how we live, play, and especially work, according to a new analysis from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF also found that not all countries will be affected the same way. The agency is calling for a, quote, ""careful balance of policies,"" to ensure AI is applied effectively and efficiently. 
Our senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent joins us now from Los Angeles to talk through this report and what it may mean. So what did the IMF-- well, let's start with why they conducted this analysis. 
Hey, John, good evening. They conducted this analysis because AI is here to stay, and it's creating all kinds of sea changes in different industries across the globe. And so the IMF's reasoning is that they want to help countries create the right kind of policies to absorb the change and innovate on top of it. 
We're already seeing this kind of activity happening at the Senate AI Forum, for example, here in the United States. But if you take a look at what they're trying to do at the IMF, it's essentially assess 125 countries for AI readiness, and then help make recommendations, or at least share the research, so these countries can then take that and act accordingly. 
Right. So the IMF doesn't find itself in a pinch when these changes cause some of those countries to wobble economically. So what-- in this study, what kinds of jobs will be most affected by AI? 
Yeah, it's not so much of a surprise. You've seen some of this data come out before from Goldman Sachs and other places. But looking at it from the United States' perspective, 60% of jobs will be affected by AI, according to this IMF study. And the groups that will be most impacted in places like the US and the UK-- we're talking about clerical support workers, office workers, technicians, people who are in service and sales. 
And on the flip side, those who will be least likely to be-- least likely to be affected are people who work in agriculture and machine operations. But if you look at the risk and the opportunity, the IMF is saying that even though your job may be at great risk of being impacted negatively by AI, the more complementary your skill set becomes, the more opportunity you'll have to sort of evolve with it. And that's part of the recommendation here, not just for countries, but also individuals. 
Right. So there's some people might be helped by it, and others will be hurt. So does that affect-- that imbalance in AI and how it may help you-- is that going to affect income inequality? 
Absolutely. The IMF is warning that income inequality could get significantly worse if the right measures are not taken. And if you look at the populations that are most at risk, women face the most at risk when it comes to the types of jobs that many women have across the 125 countries that were studied. But unlike previous waves of automation, we should point out that this is not just an AI innovation impact that will hit the middle-class. 
This is likely to hit higher-income earners and lower-income earners with a similar sort of magnitude. And so the IMF is saying if your job is complementary with AI, then you actually have a chance to earn even more, which would create a larger wage gap, according to this assessment. 
So then finally, the IMF says that-- so we've gone from the kind of within-country inequalities, and the IMF is saying wealthier economies tend to be better equipped to handle the AI adoption, rather than, say, low-income countries. Which countries do well, and why, and how do they sort through that analysis? 
Countries that are more technologically advanced, essentially, will do better. And it will come as no surprise to you, we're talking about the United States, Singapore, Denmark. They tend to do very well. 
Now, lower-income countries will fare worse. But if you take a look at what the issues are when it comes to how you deal with-- the findings basically showed that countries tend to be better at AI adoption, compared to the lower-income countries, because they have the resources to do so. And that's why you see an overall-- not just income gap between individuals perhaps on the horizon, but also between these countries. 
So the idea here is the IMF is trying to warn and sound the alarm now, so that countries can legislate or provide regulations to sort of absorb what could be this negative impact. But I will say that covering the Senate AI Forum here in the United States, that's a really tall order. They're still trying to figure out what AI is, and building that regulation is much easier said than done, John. ",,,,,,

 U.S. government investment in artificial intelligence (AI), which amounted to $4.38 billion in 2022, is designed to benefit not only national security and government operations but also American society. This two-pronged approach has led to discoveries about the advantages of AI in areas beyond governance, including healthcare, transportation, the environment, and others.1


 Starting with an endorsement of “man-machine cooperation” by then-President John F. Kennedy’s Science Advisory Committee in 1962, numerous presidential administrations have encouraged AI research and knowledge, including in the workforce, education, and government. These efforts included an Obama administration 2016 report titled “Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence;” the Trump administration’s “American AI Initiative,” launched in 2019; and the Biden administration’s executive order on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,” issued in October 2023.234


 As AI technology advances, the government is exploring ways to harness and leverage it in its operations while setting and maintaining appropriate guardrails.


Key Takeaways
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly important in various sectors, including government services.The U.S. government is actively harnessing AI technologies to improve its services and operations.AI offers numerous benefits in areas such as healthcare, transportation, the environment, and benefits delivery.The federal government has initiated various projects and initiatives to leverage AI technologies.Responsible use of AI in government requires establishing strong guardrails and addressing ethical and privacy concerns.
  AI Initiatives in the U.S. Government  
 President Joe Biden’s October 2023 executive order (EO) on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence” provides extensive guidance for government involvement in AI.5




  Primary Directives  
 The Biden EO directs U.S. government agencies to establish safety and security standards, protect privacy, advance equity and civil rights, promote innovation and competition, and advance American AI leadership worldwide. An overview of the document’s eight primary directives follows.654


 New Standards for AI Safety and Security


 The EO directs government agencies to ensure robust, reliable, repeatable, and standardized testing and evaluations of AI systems. The administration will also help develop adequate labeling and mechanisms to ensure the origin of AI content.


 Promoting Innovation and Competition


 AI-related education, training, development, research, and capacity investments must be leveraged to address specific intellectual property (IP) questions. Agencies must promote competition by providing small developers access to technical assistance and encouraging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to exercise its authority to enforce competition and protect consumers.


 Supporting Workers


 Government departments must develop principles and best practices to mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers. This will require addressing job displacement, labor standards, workplace equity, health and safety, and data collection.


 Advancing Equity and Civil Rights


 Government use of AI will comply with all federal laws and promote substantive oversight and engagement with all communities to protect against unlawful discrimination and abuse. Coordination between the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and federal civil rights offices will play a significant role in these efforts.


 Standing Up for Consumers, Patients, and Students


 To protect consumers and promote the responsible use of AI in domains such as healthcare and education, the administration will enforce existing consumer protection laws and enact safeguards against fraud, unintended bias, privacy violations, and other harmful effects. This will include advancing the responsible use of AI in developing affordable and lifesaving drugs and advancements in other health-related areas.


 Protecting Americans’ Privacy


 The lawful, secure collection, use, and retention of data must promote privacy by directing federal agencies to use privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) where beneficial. Congress is also urged to pass bipartisan data privacy legislation.


 Ensuring Responsible and Effective Government Use of AI


 Agencies will ensure the responsible government deployment of AI and work to modernize federal AI infrastructure in various domains, such as regulation, governance, benefits, procurement, and security. The government will further accelerate hiring AI professionals as part of a government-wide AI talent surge led by the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Digital Service, the U.S. Digital Corps, and the Presidential Innovation Fellowship.


 Advancing American Leadership Abroad


 Government agencies are directed to engage with international partners to develop a framework to manage AI risks while advancing American leadership in safety, security, trust, and AI development. This will include the expansion of bilateral, multilateral, and multistakeholder collaborations on AI; accelerated development and implementation of vital AI standards with international partners; and promoting safe, responsible, rights-affirming development and deployment of AI worldwide.

  Ensuring Responsible Use of AI in Government  
 Government agencies regularly call for the responsible use of AI. This includes mandates for compliance with laws that protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. The benefits of AI come with potential pitfalls that create a need to establish strong guardrails to ensure AI keeps people safe and doesn’t violate individual rights.


  AI Safety and Security  
 Section 4 of the Biden EO addresses AI system vulnerabilities through the Defense Production Act of 1950. AI companies must report safety test results and other information for systems that may pose national security or infrastructure risks. Federal agencies must establish guidance and standards for safe AI development and use and promote research and collaboration to address potential risks. Workforce development plans for integrating AI technology are also required.4


  Ethical Considerations and Privacy Concerns  
 AI has raised ethical concerns about privacy, bias, accountability, and transparency. Despite ideological differences between administrations, government AI policies have attempted to address these concerns since 2016. AI systems require large amounts of data, which can raise privacy concerns. Bias can result from training AI systems on non-representative data, leading to discriminatory outcomes. AI decisions can have significant impacts on individuals, making accountability critical. The transparency of AI decision-making processes is also important for individuals to understand how and why decisions are made.4



The AI for autonomous situational awareness system is one use-case example for the Department of Homeland Security that was proposed for customs and border protection. It is intended to use Internet of Things sensors, high-resolution cameras, and motion sensors to covertly detect and analyze illicit border crossings in remote locations while creating a low-cost, low-power footprint.7
  Benefits of Artificial Intelligence in Government Services  
 AI can offer several benefits to the government, such as improved efficiency, accuracy, and decision making. AI can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up employees to focus on higher-value tasks. AI can eliminate errors and inconsistencies for improved accuracy and consistency of government services. AI can facilitate data-driven and evidence-based decisions, as well as personalized and responsive services. Additionally, AI can save costs by reducing the need for manual labor and streamlining processes.68


 AI has shown benefits in specific areas, such as healthcare, transportation, the environment, and delivery of government benefits. HHS leverages AI to solve problems and improve patient outcomes. The DOT uses AI in three areas: drone operations, traffic management, and railroad safety. AI is used in the environment to monitor natural resources and predict natural disasters. AI can also reduce the workload for workers and assist caseworkers. The Social Security Administration (SSA) uses data analytics and computer systems to process claims more efficiently.91011121314


  Challenges and the Future of AI in Government Services  
 AI constantly evolves, and potential advancements include improving accuracy and efficiency, creating more human-like systems, personalizing medicine, and addressing global challenges.


 However, implementing AI in government services has several challenges, such as a lack of skilled personnel, data privacy and security concerns, integration with existing systems, and transparency and accountability. Addressing these challenges requires a collaborative approach involving government agencies, AI developers, domain experts, and citizens. Governments need to invest in training, establish clear policies and guidelines, and engage citizens to build trust and ensure accountability.


 How Is Artificial Intelligence Being Used in Healthcare by the U.S. Government?
One of AI’s most significant applications is in medical imaging to improve accuracy and speed up diagnosis. The U.S. government also uses AI to analyze health data in order to identify trends and patterns that can inform public health policy decisions.15


 What Are the Potential Benefits of AI in Improving Transportation Services?
AI-powered technologies can be used to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve overall road safety. Additionally, AI can predict demand for transportation services, enabling providers to allocate resources more efficiently and reduce wait times. AI enables transportation providers to improve routes and schedules and provide more personalized services to passengers.


 What Initiatives Has the U.S. Government Undertaken to Leverage AI Technologies?
Initiatives include an Obama administration 2016 report titled “Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence;” the Trump administration’s “American AI Initiative,” launched in 2019; and the Biden administration’s executive order on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,” issued in October 2023.234Furthermore, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been tasked with developing AI standards, while the National Science Foundation (NSF) is funding research in AI and machine learning. Additionally, several federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, are investing in AI technologies to enhance their operations and capabilities.


 What Are the Ethical Considerations and Privacy Concerns Associated with AI in Government?
Law enforcement agencies’ use of facial recognition technology has raised concerns about surveillance and potential privacy violations. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential for AI to perpetuate bias and discrimination, particularly in the criminal justice system. The use of AI in decision-making processes, such as those related to hiring or lending, could also have unintended consequences and reinforce existing biases.


 How Much Money Has the U.S. Government Spent on AI?
According to the most recent figures, the U.S. government spent approximately $4.8 billion on AI research and development in 2022. This includes funding for various agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy. This funding is expected to increase in the coming years, as AI plays an increasingly important role in government operations.1


  The Bottom Line  
 The potential of AI to transform government services and improve public welfare is immense. AI can help streamline bureaucratic processes, enhance decision-making capabilities, and enable more efficient delivery of public services.


 For example, AI-powered chatbots can provide 24/7 customer support, reducing wait times and improving the overall experience for citizens. AI can also be used to analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, which can inform policy decisions and resource allocation.


 By harnessing the power of AI, the government can enhance its capacity to serve its citizens and improve the overall well-being of its communities. Additionally, the use of AI in government services may be imperative to achieve efficiency, accuracy, and cost containment, especially as both the number of government services and the population continue to expand.


 While advantages of AI—especially in healthcare, transportation, the environment, and benefits delivery—are numerous, responsible use of AI in government requires establishing strong guardrails and addressing ethical and privacy concerns.

While AI tools putting workers out of jobs has been a major point of anxiety in Silicon Valley and beyond over the past year, not all the recent layoffs in the tech industry are directly linked to AI tools simply replacing workers. But many of the recent job cut announcements have come on the heels of those same companies disclosing major investments into AI technology as they look to reallocate resources, and a growing number of tech firms have explicitly cited AI as a reason for rethinking head counts. The continued labor upheaval unfolding in the very industry creating AI could point to more unrest to come as the technology is forecast to reshape the broader business landscape in the years ahead. More than 5,500 tech layoffs less than two weeks into 2024 The latest rounds of tech job cuts are occurring across a range of roles and in both Big Tech companies and smaller startups. Tech giants Google and Amazon both announced sweeping layoffs this week impacting hundreds of workers across various business divisions. News of the job cuts at Google and Amazon come months after both companies separately announced multi-billion-dollar investments into AI startup Anthropic. Also this week, social platform Discord said it was trimming 17% of its staff. Unity Software, the maker of technology used in popular mobile games such as Pokemon Go, said it was cutting 25% of its workforce. And the language-learning app Duolingo said it laid off around 10% of its contract workers. All told, there have been more than 5,500 tech employees who have lost their jobs less than two weeks into 2024, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi. And the latest cuts in tech come after a very painful two years for the industry, marked by hundreds of thousands of workers losing their jobs amid a reset in pandemic-induced demand. There were some 262,682 tech industry layoffs recorded in 2023, per Layoffs.fyi data, after 164,969 cuts the previous year. Pandemic demand recoils as AI anxiety takes hold Roger Lee, a startup founder who has long been tracking tech industry layoffs via his website Layoffs.fyi, told CNN that many tech companies are still trying to “correct for their overhiring during the pandemic surge.” The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic led to skyrocketing demand for digital services as people around the world were forced to work, socialize and shop from home. Against that backdrop, the tech industry went on a remarkable hiring spree. But as pandemic restrictions eased in the years that followed and broader macroeconomic uncertainty set in, the tech industry saw its greatest retraction since the dotcom bust of 2000, cutting tens of thousands of jobs in rapid succession. While Lee says the high interest rate environment and tech downturn have lasted longer than initially expected, he adds that “an increasing number of tech companies have cited AI as reason for layoffs.” Last year, companies including Chegg, IBM and Dropbox cited the onset of AI as a reason to rethink staffing. More recently, Duolingo and even Google have suggested the same as they seek to mobilize resources to capitalize on the AI boom. As the full extent of AI’s impact to the labor market is still revealing itself, researchers have said that hundreds of millions of jobs globally could be impacted, though the tech could simultaneously have the potential to create new and different jobs in the future. Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note last March that as many as 300 million full-time jobs around the world could be lost or diminished by the rise of generative AI technology and that white-collar workers appeared to be most at risk. Separate research also indicates that women’s jobs could be disproportionately impacted by businesses’ adoption of AI in the years ahead. Disparate impacts of tech job cuts come under scrutiny As the tech industry layoffs continue, labor advocates and even lawmakers are taking notice. The Google workers who lost their jobs this week were shocked to find out via email that they were being laid off, according to Parul Koul, a Google software engineer and president of the grassroots Alphabet Workers Union, a CWA-affiliated group that is organizing workers throughout Google’s parent company Alphabet. Koul slammed the layoffs as “unnecessary and counterproductive” in a statement to CNN on Friday that blasted “corporate greed.” “The layoffs introduce chaos and instability into the workplace and force workers to make do with less,” Koul added, saying even those that remain on the job “work in constant anxiety that they will be next.” Google, for its part, has said that the cuts were to help the teams “become more efficient and work better,” and that it is supporting impacted employees “as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond.” Some lawmakers, meanwhile, have recently taken aim at reports of the tech layoffs’ disparate effects on certain workers. A coalition of more than two dozen Black lawmakers led by Democratic Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Barbara Lee of California expressed concerns over the “impacts of widespread layoffs within the tech industry and its disproportionate impacts on the African American community and women” in a letter late last month to acting Labor Secretary Julie Su that was obtained by CNN. “Recent findings have consistently shown that minorities and women are vastly overrepresented in industry layoffs,” the letter said. The lawmakers pressed the Department of Labor to pay closer attention to these ongoing mass layoffs and to do more to protect the workers most at risk of losing their livelihoods.",930,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'CNN', 'logo': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cnnlogo.png?q=w_60,h_61', 'foundingDate': '1980-06-01', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com', 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/cnn/', 'https://twitter.com/CNN', 'https://www.instagram.com/cnn/', 'https://www.youtube.com/cnn']}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Business', 'item': 'https://www.cnn.com/business/index.html'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Tech', 'item': 'https://www.cnn.com/business/tech/index.html'}]",,,,N/A,N/A,"

Unity Software, the maker of technology used in popular mobile games such as Pokemon Go, said it was cutting 25% of its workforce. And the language-learning app Duolingo said it laid off around 10% of its contract workers.

Silicon Valley’s greatest minds misread pandemic demand. Now their employees are paying for it.




            All told, there have been more than 5,500 tech employees who have lost their jobs less than two weeks into 2024, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi.
    

            And the latest cuts in tech come after a very painful two years for the industry, marked by hundreds of thousands of workers losing their jobs amid a reset in pandemic-induced demand.


            There were some 262,682 tech industry layoffs recorded in 2023, per Layoffs.fyi data, after 164,969 cuts the previous year.
    

        Pandemic demand recoils as AI anxiety takes hold


            Roger Lee, a startup founder who has long been tracking tech industry layoffs via his website Layoffs.fyi, told CNN that many tech companies are still trying to “correct for their overhiring during the pandemic surge.”
    

            The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic led to skyrocketing demand for digital services as people around the world were forced to work, socialize and shop from home. Against that backdrop, the tech industry went on a remarkable hiring spree. But as pandemic restrictions eased in the years that followed and broader macroeconomic uncertainty set in, the tech industry saw its greatest retraction since the dotcom bust of 2000, cutting tens of thousands of jobs in rapid succession.

            While Lee says the high interest rate environment and tech downturn have lasted longer than initially expected, he adds that “an increasing number of tech companies have cited AI as reason for layoffs.”
    

            Last year, companies including Chegg, IBM and Dropbox cited the onset of AI as a reason to rethink staffing. More recently, Duolingo and even Google have suggested the same as they seek to mobilize resources to capitalize on the AI boom.
    

            As the full extent of AI’s impact to the labor market is still revealing itself, researchers have said that hundreds of millions of jobs globally could be impacted, though the tech could simultaneously have the potential to create new and different jobs in the future.
    

            Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note last March that as many as 300 million full-time jobs around the world could be lost or diminished by the rise of generative AI technology and that white-collar workers appeared to be most at risk. Separate research also indicates that women’s jobs could be disproportionately impacted by businesses’ adoption of AI in the years ahead.
    

        Disparate impacts of tech job cuts come under scrutiny


            As the tech industry layoffs continue, labor advocates and even lawmakers are taking notice.
    

            The Google workers who lost their jobs this week were shocked to find out via email that they were being laid off, according to Parul Koul, a Google software engineer and president of the grassroots Alphabet Workers Union, a CWA-affiliated group that is organizing workers throughout Google’s parent company Alphabet.
    

            Koul slammed the layoffs as “unnecessary and counterproductive” in a statement to CNN on Friday that blasted “corporate greed.”
    

            “The layoffs introduce chaos and instability into the workplace and force workers to make do with less,” Koul added, saying even those that remain on the job “work in constant anxiety that they will be next.”
    

            Google, for its part, has said that the cuts were to help the teams “become more efficient and work better,” and that it is supporting impacted employees “as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond.”
    

            Some lawmakers, meanwhile, have recently taken aim at reports of the tech layoffs’ disparate effects on certain workers.
    









OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addresses a speech during a meeting, at the Station F in Paris on May 26, 2023. Altman, the boss of OpenAI, the firm behind the massively popular ChatGPT bot, said on May 26, 2023, in Paris that his firm's technology would not destroy the job market as he sought to calm fears about the march of artificial intelligence (AI).

            A coalition of more than two dozen Black lawmakers led by Democratic Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Barbara Lee of California expressed concerns over the “impacts of widespread layoffs within the tech industry and its disproportionate impacts on the African American community and women” in a letter late last month to acting Labor Secretary Julie Su that was obtained by CNN.
    

            “Recent findings have consistently shown that minorities and women are vastly overrepresented in industry layoffs,” the letter said.
    

            The lawmakers pressed the Department of Labor to pay closer attention to these ongoing mass layoffs and to do more to protect the workers most at risk of losing their livelihoods.

Maggioncalda highlighted the need to look at this through the lens of specific sectors. Speaking on AI's impact on Coursera hiring, he said that it has only opened doors for more hiring, mostly for a developers' profile.Maggioncalda also highlighted that AI is helping eliminate the parity of capabilities between an above-average performer and a weak performer.The use of AI also increased the above-average performance bar, the CEO further added. Additionally, AI will also boost remote opportunities in India for the next few years as people become more equipped with the help of AI.Raghav Gupta, Managing Director, India, and APAC, Coursera, added that emerging technologies like Generative AI are transforming the way people learn, teach, and work.“Not using AI is like not using Google or Spreadsheet,” said, Maggioncalda, emphasising the importance of implementing AI.Sharing the use case of radiologists, Maggioncalda said that radiologists also use computer vision (CV)–a specialised field of artificial intelligence to predict diseases accurately. “We still need radiologists, despite the introduction of AI to detect the diseases.”AI will increase opportunities overall. ""Earlier, we had 4 content developers, and now we only have 1 content developer. However, we hired over double the tech developers,” Ajay Setia, CEO of InvincibleMeta.AI, noted.As of now, for the next 10-15 years, Setia expects that AI will create more opportunities until the world gets introduced to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) because AI needs to be fed data to generate output. Meanwhile, AGI is expected to create its own data.In the future, with technological advancement, Setia expects to see artificial superintelligence (ASI), which can eliminate the need for humans to feed data, but that is still around 50 years away.“Current Gen AI is the weakest version of AI. We're in the first stage,” Setia added.India has the potential to add USD 359 billion to USD 438 billion to its GDP on account of Gen AI adoption in 2029-2030, which is above estimates, according to a report ‘The AIdea of India’ by EY. This means adding 5.9 per cent-7.2 per cent to the country's GDP for the same period.Meanwhile, AI adoption will contribute around USD 1.2 trillion to 1.5 trillion to India's cumulated GDP over seven years.Approximately 69 per cent of the overall impact of Gen AI is expected to come from business services, including IT, legal, consulting, outsourcing, rental, financial services, transportation, logistics, education, retail trade and healthcare, the report further added.“Intellectual property debates rage, with questions about AI’s creative ownership and rights of human creators. While such fears are normal, given the capabilities demonstrated by Gen AI tools, it is far more likely, as our survey suggests, that rather than Gen AI supplanting humans, it will be ‘humans + Gen AI’ that will boost productivity, bring greater visual and audio magic, and help improve monetization of products and services,” the EY report explained.AI's impact on media &amp; entertainment sectorIndia’s Media &amp; Entertainment sector stands at the cusp of a Gen AI revolution. The journey ahead, while challenging, is replete with opportunities. With the right blend of policy, innovation, and ethical considerations, the report added that a new era of Indian storytelling beckons.AI's impact on healthcare sectorIn an environment marked by significant demand-supply disparities and a severe shortage of both clinical and non-clinical talent (e.g., only 64 doctors per 100,000 patients compared to the global average of 150 per 100,000), Gen AI holds the potential to augment the healthcare system’s capabilities and accelerates the transformation of diagnostics, treatments, and patient care. Over 48 per cent of healthcare organisations that participated in the EY survey said that they are likely to implement AI in a year.AI's impact on retail sectorMore than 50 per cent of respondents in this sector believe that Gen AI will have a huge impact on the entire value chain, making it more efficient and responsive to market dynamics. In India, the survey reveals that while a small 6 per cent have already implemented Gen AI, a staggering 71 per cent in the retail sector plan to adopt it within the next 12 months. By 2025, Gen AI could potentially elevate the retail sector’s profitability by 20 per cent.AI's impact on technology servicesOver two-thirds of the tech CXOs in the study said Gen AI would have a significant impact (medium to high) on their business, with about 86 per cent having already implemented Gen AI or looking to implement it within a year. Access to the tool increased productivity (issues resolved per hour) by 14 per cent on average. For novice and low-skilled workers, the improvement was 35 per cent but with minimal impact on experienced and highly skilled workers.AI's impact on government and public servicesAccording to the EY survey, about 70 per cent of respondents from the GPS sector see a medium-high impact of Gen AI on their functioning, while about 50 per cent expect to implement Gen AI in the next 12 months.&nbsp;AI's impact on financial servicesGlobally, most financial institutions anticipate that fully harnessing the automation potential of Gen AI may require a considerable amount of time, ranging from 5 to 10 years, the survey added.“Financial institutions have recognised the transformative potential of Gen AI, as evidenced by the fact that about 78 per cent of the respondents in the survey have either put the technology into practice in at least one use-case or have plans to pilot it over the next 12 months,” as per the EY report.",,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'mint', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/newschemalogo.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.livemint.com/', 'name': 'Business News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.livemint.com/technology', 'name': 'Technology'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news', 'name': 'News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': '4', 'item': {'name': 'Human vs Machine: Is Artificial intelligence job creator or terminator?

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva wrote in a blog post that, in most scenarios, AI is likely to exacerbate overall inequality and called for proactive measures by policymakers to prevent the technology from further intensifying social tensions.
The impact of AI on income inequality will hinge on how well the technology complements high earners. Increased productivity from high-income workers and companies could widen the wealth gap, Georgieva explained.

According to the IMF chief, countries should implement ""comprehensive social safety nets"" and retraining programs for vulnerable workers to mitigate these effects.
The IMF report, published on Sunday (14 January) evening, highlighted that, while there is potential for AI to fully replace some jobs, the more probable scenario is that it will complement human work. Advanced economies may witness about 60% of jobs affected, surpassing the impact on emerging and low-income countries.




However, the report noted that only half of the jobs affected by AI will face negative consequences; the rest may benefit from enhanced productivity gains due to AI integration.
""Your job may disappear altogether - not good - or artificial intelligence may enhance your job, so you actually will be more productive and your income level may go up,"" Georgieva wrote.


Georgieva's comments align with discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where global business and political leaders are deliberating on AI. Some companies have raised concerns among employees by investing heavily in AI, with examples such as Buzzfeed Inc. using AI for content creation and restructuring its news department.


While the European Union has reached a tentative deal on AI legislation, the US is still considering its federal regulatory stance on the matter.
The IMF report predicts that emerging markets and developing economies will experience a smaller initial impact from AI on labour markets but are also less likely to benefit from the productivity gains that AI integration may bring.


The IMF chief stressed the importance of helping low-income countries seize the opportunities presented by artificial intelligence.
While addressing the potential challenges of AI, she acknowledged its tremendous opportunity for everyone.
She also acknowledged the need for an AI-related productivity boost to sustain global economic growth, emphasising the importance of unlocking productivity for a positive global narrative.
The IMF is set to publish updated economic forecasts later this month, indicating that the global economy is broadly on track to meet previous projections.
Georgieva cautioned that 2024 is likely to be a ""very tough year"" for fiscal policy worldwide due to countries addressing debt burdens from the Covid-19 pandemic and managing depleted buffers.
With billions of people heading to the polls this year, Georgieva expressed concern that governments might face pressure to increase spending or cut taxes to gain popular support, potentially undermining progress made in the fight against high inflation.

A Seattle-area nonprofit helping disadvantaged job seekers around the world is adding generative artificial intelligence to the toolkit for its participants. 
The Global Mentorship Initiative is teaching college students and recent graduates how to use digital tools that are  powered by technology including ChatGPT and GPT-4 to more easily and successfully land jobs, starting with the job search and application all the way through the interview process to sending thank you emails. 
“This is a new opportunity for students in these high unemployment areas,” said Jon Browning, founder and CEO of the Global Mentorship Initiative, which is based in Bellevue, Wash.
The program is conducted virtually through video conferences. It has partnerships with more than 50 colleges and universities that refer students for mentoring. Close to 6,000 students from 100 countries are in the program, with about one-quarter in the U.S., half in African countries, and the rest in other countries and areas with high unemployment rates. Global Mentorship Initiative also works with refugee students. 
The initiative has 5,000 volunteer mentors in 127 countries, with about 1,000 of those coming from Microsoft. 
Browning himself was a Microsoft employee for 24 years, leaving as a director in 2014. He took a role at the Rockefeller Foundation, working to bring tech jobs to underserved youth in Africa. Through the effort, he was struck by the need to provide mentorship to bridge the gap between educated young people and employment opportunities. So Browning created the initiative, which launched in 2019. 
The program pairs mentors with college students prepping for jobs, guiding them through the process with a scripted playbook that spans 12 sessions. 



The Global Mentorship Initiative last year adopted generative AI curriculum following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in late 2022, followed by the more powerful GPT-4.  
In March of last year, Microsoft disclosed it was using OpenAI’s technology in its Bing search engine. It created Microsoft Copilot, allowing Bing users to pose detailed queries and receive highly specific, footnoted answers. Users could provide prompts that produced written responses and images. 
Browning recognized the potential impact of the AI tools and the team began developing these resources for Global Mentorship Initiative. By June, the program had primers on the new technology, describing how it could be useful, while also explaining how the models are trained and cautioning students to watch for biases, errors and exaggerations. The initiative created a library of queries for basic job-searching tasks using Bing’s Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT. 
Sample questions include:

What are the keywords I should use in my resume/CV for a project manager job at an IT company in <country>?
Write a cover letter for this job. Below is the job description and my resume/CV.
What are the most common interview questions for project managers applying to <company>? How should I answer these questions based on my resume/CV below?
Is there an organization in <country> that lends clothes for job interviews?
What should I do if I get a bad work performance review?

The Global Mentorship Initiative this fall also partnered with 300 Microsoft employees over two months to generate 800 suggested queries for pursuing specific tech jobs. 
The organization is supported by corporate sponsorships and grants, and its backers include Microsoft, LinkedIn, Expedia, healthcare provider Providence and others. 
The initiative’s work was particularly timely given the expansion of remote employment opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic. But college graduates in the U.S. and abroad weren’t necessarily prepped with the professional skills for landing the roles.  
Numerous African countries, for example, are providing greater access to education and producing “hundreds of thousands of graduates every year,” Browning said. “[But] they are not prepared to compete on a global stage for a job or remote work.”

Brianna Chambers, an international relations major at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, completed the program, which she calls “a masterclass in entering the workforce.” It helped with building her personal brand on LinkedIn and offered important advice on professional workplace conduct to establish credibility.
Chambers, who graduates in the fall, wants to work with aid organizations in navigating international trade regulations and tariffs, or as a foreign service officer to promote her country.
“I feel more than prepared for my job search,” she said by email, “which I will be starting promptly.”
The Global Mentorship Initiative is continuing to grow its efforts to fill in students’ knowledge gaps, expanding to reach 10,000 young people by the end of this year. Browning wants to create resources for teachers and professors to use in classrooms, scaling the program beyond one-on-one mentorships. He’d like to include students in trade programs as well. 
“Everybody needs to know how to get a job,” Browning said. “And it doesn’t matter if you’re a programmer or you’re an electrician, you need to know how to land a job.”

Around 26% percent of jobs in India are “highly exposed” to disruption by artificial intelligence, or AI, in the foreseeable future, according to a recent analysis published by the International Monetary Fund. Globally, the number stands at 40% for all jobs, while in developed economies, 60% of jobs are similarly susceptible.The analysis cites data from India’s Periodic Labour Force Survey to state that most of the country’s jobs fall in the low-exposure category. This is because the majority of workers are “craftspeople, skilled agricultural workers, and low-skilled, or ‘elementary’ workers.”  Essentially, jobs in India are therefore less likely to be impacted by artificial intelligence.However, the analysis cautions that professionals, managers, clerical support workers, technicians and those working in service and sales jobs face the highest risk from artificial intelligence in the country. India was also found to be an exception to a global trend of jobs held by women being more likely to be impacted by artificial intelligence. “[This] may be attributed to high shares of women in agricultural jobs, especially in countries where the farming sector is large [for example, India],” the analysis states.On the other hand, advanced economies are highly exposed to artificial intelligence because of the predominance of “cognitive-intense” jobs. These markets will “experience the benefits and pitfalls of artificial intelligence sooner than emerging markets”, said the analysis.To measure the risk that AI poses to job markets, the analysis considered the factor of “AI complementarity”. It said that AI would not necessarily render some jobs obsolete but could enhance their productivity.“AI complementarity suggests that...about half [of jobs] may be negatively affected by AI while the rest could benefit,” the anaysis found, waarning that this could have lopsided benefits. “The correlation between earnings and potential complementarity...suggests that AI’s gains will likely disproportionately accrue to higher-income earners, especially in countries such as India,” said the analysis.In a blog post about the findings of the analysis, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva emphasised the need to draft a “set of policies to safely leverage the vast potential of AI” in both advanced and emerging markets.“In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,” Georgiva wrote.Also read: A technology lawyer suggests how artificial intelligence can benefit every Indian tangiblyIndia’s scaling up of AI could reproduce casteist bias, discrimination against women and minorities

Apple has decided to shut down a 121-member artificial intelligence team based in San Diego.
The team is to be relocated to a site in Austin, and members have been given time until the end of February to choose to move.

Apple Inc. is shuttering operations on a team related to artificial intelligence operations in San Diego, which is expected to result in many employees being terminated from their posts. Apple has decided to move the entire team’s operations to Austin, Texas. Consequently, any employees who are unwilling to make the move are likely to be let go.
The team known as the Data Operations Annotations has been key to the operations and success of Siri, the company’s digital assistant, used by several million device users worldwide. It has members worldwide, including Spain, China, India, and Ireland. The San Diego team focuses on using Siri in French, Hebrew, English, Arabic, Spanish, and Portuguese.

The move is likely to result in many of the team members exiting the company owing to the long-distance move and the short notice for relocation. However, members willing to make the move would retain their roles and are offered stipends worth $7000. Members of the AI team could also potentially apply for other roles within the company.
The potential layoffs will also continue the trend of job cuts that have come from other tech giants, including Google, Amazon, X, Citigroup, and more. The growing role of AI in organizations is only expected to exacerbate the issue in the coming months and years. Apple is also expected to unveil its plans for its own large language models by June 2024.

""Going further, there's even less desire to use AI to learn about Christianity or the Bible. Just 8% of Christians and 4% of non-Christians are interested in using AI to study the Bible. We see similar numbers when it comes to the use of AI to learn about Christianity (6% and 3%, respectively)."" The study finds that most people believe AI should be used ""cautiously, especially for more nuanced matters."" Along those lines, only 27% of Americans agree that if they asked ""a question about Christian teachings and beliefs to an AI tool, [they] would trust its response.'"" Christians are slightly more likely to trust the AI tool response about beliefs than non-Christians (29% versus 23%), according to the Barna research. ""These findings suggest two takeaways: First, there may be a need for greater digital literacy directed at Christians who seek to use AI to answer nuanced questions about faith.

UNEVEN EFFECTSThe IMF report predicted that, while labor markets in emerging markets and developing economies will see a smaller initial impact from AI, they are also less likely to benefit from the enhanced productivity that will arise through its integration in the workplace.   &quot;We must focus on helping low income countries in particular to move faster to be able to catch the opportunities that artificial intelligence will present,&quot; Georgieva told AFP. &quot;So artificial intelligence, yes, a little scary. But it is also a tremendous opportunity for everyone,&quot; she said. The IMF is due to publish updated economic forecasts later this month which will show the global economy is broadly on track to meet its previous forecasts, she said.  It is &quot;poised for a soft landing,&quot; she said, adding that &quot;monetary policy is doing a good job, inflation is going down, but the job is not quite done.&quot;&quot;So we are in this trickiest place of not easing too fast or too slow,&quot; she said.The global economy could use an AI-related productivity boost, as the IMF predicts it will continue growing at historically muted levels over the medium term. &quot;God, how much we need it,&quot; Georgieva said. &quot;Unless we figure out a way to unlock productivity, we as the world are not for a great story.&quot; &#039;TOUGH YEAR&#039; AHEADGeorgieva said 2024 is likely to be &quot;a very tough year&quot; for fiscal policy worldwide, as countries look to tackle debt burdens accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic, and rebuild depleted buffers.Billions of people are also due to go to the polls this year, putting additional pressure on governments to either raise spending or cut taxes to win popular support.  &quot;About 80 countries are going to have elections, and we know what happens with pressure on spending during election cycles,&quot; she added. The concern at the IMF, Georgieva said, is that governments around the world spend big this year and undermine the hard-won progress they have made in the fight against high inflation.&quot;If monetary policy tightens and fiscal policy expands, going against the objective of bringing inflation down, we might be for a longer ride,&quot; she added. CONCENTRATING ON THE JOBGeorgieva, whose five-year term at the IMF&#039;s helm is set to end this year, refused to be drawn on whether she intends to run for a second stint leading the international financial institution. &quot;I have a job to do right now and my concentration is on doing that job,&quot; she said. &quot;It has been a tremendous privilege to be the head of the IMF during a very turbulent time, and I can tell you I&#039;m quite proud of how the institution coped,&quot; she continued. &quot;But let me do what is in front of me right now.&quot;Published By: Shweta KumariPublished On: Jan 15, 2024Tune InALSO READ |  AI&#039;s impact in education: Balance between innovation and digital safetyMust Watch",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'India Today', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/mediamanager/itlogo.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'name': 'News', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/', '@type': 'Thing'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'name': 'Business', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/business', '@type': 'Thing'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'name': ""AI likely to impact 40% of jobs globally, IMF chief says 'tough year ahead'"", 'position': 3}]","Artificial intelligence to impact 40 per cent of jobs globally, says International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva - India Today",,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/artificial-intelligence-to-impact-40-per-cent-of-jobs-globally-says-international-monetary-fund-chief-kristalina-georgieva-2488681-2024-01-15,N/A,N/A,N/A,Business,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/artificial-intelligence-to-impact-40-per-cent-of-jobs-globally-says-international-monetary-fund-chief-kristalina-georgieva-2488681-2024-01-15,,,,,,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202401/imf-chief-152000645-16x9_0.png?VersionId=pKuukthE5T0ygkHywIOV7UDuRkX92Ujp?size=647:363,2024-01-15T08:39:54+05:30,,https://embed.indiatoday.in/share/video/business/MjQ4ODY4MQ==,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/mediamanager/itlogo.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'FC-8, Ecity Bioscope Rd, Film City', 'addressLocality': 'Sector 16A, Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301', 'telephone': '0120 480 7100'}",,"['https://www.facebook.com/IndiaToday', 'https://twitter.com/indiatoday', 'https://www.youtube.com/Indiatoday', 'https://www.instagram.com/indiatoday/']",,,"[{'@type': 'Article', 'headline': 'Artificial intelligence to impact 40 per cent of jobs globally, says International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva - India Today', 'url': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/artificial-intelligence-to-impact-40-per-cent-of-jobs-globally-says-international-monetary-fund-chief-kristalina-georgieva-2488681-2024-01-15', 'datePublished': '2024-01-15 08:53:00+5:30', 'author': {'@id': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/author/agence-france-presse'}}]",,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1', '.story-kicker']}",,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': {'@type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/artificial-intelligence-to-impact-40-per-cent-of-jobs-globally-says-international-monetary-fund-chief-kristalina-georgieva-2488681-2024-01-15?t={seek_to_second_number}'}, 'startOffset-input': {'@type': 'PropertyValueSpecification', 'valueRequired': 'http://schema.org/True', 'valueName': 'seek_to_second_number'}}",,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'representativeOfPage': 'http://schema.org/True', 'url': 'https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202401/imf-chief-152000645-16x9_0.png?VersionId=pKuukthE5T0ygkHywIOV7UDuRkX92Ujp?size=1200:675', 'width': '1200', 'height': '675', 'description': '&quot;Your job may disappear altogether\xa0-– not good –- or AI may enhance your job, so you actually will be more productive and your income level may go up,&quot; IMF chief said.\xa0(Photo: AFP)'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1200,675,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'India Today', 'url': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/'}","{'@id': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/author/agence-france-presse', '@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Agence France-Presse'}"

BenchSci Layoffs: 17% of staff axed, investing in generative AI



January 12, 2024








BenchSci, a Toronto-based artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical startup, has confirmed to BetaKit that it has eliminated 17 per cent of its workforce, or 70 jobs.
What’s happening at BenchSci?
In a recent LinkedIn post, BenchSci said the decision to trim its headcount is a result of “shifts in the economic environment, operational efficiencies, and adaptation to technological advancements, specifically Generative AI.”
“We believe that Generative AI will continue to reshape preclinical R&D and have a substantial positive impact on our customers,” the post reads.
“As we look towards our future, these changes will allow us to further our investment in Generative AI and work toward making drug discovery more efficient and help bring new medicine to patients faster.”
Several staff members commented on BenchSci’s post — claiming that they had been let go.
According to the company’s LinkedIn page, it employs more than 340 people in Canada.
Termination agreements for BenchSci employees
In Canada, non-unionized employees at BenchSci are owed full severance pay when they lose their jobs due to downsizing, corporate restructuring, or the closure of the business.
This includes individuals working full-time, part-time, or hourly in Ontario, Alberta, and B.C.
People working “on contract” or as a contractor may also be owed severance pay — given that many employees in Canada are often misclassified as independent contractors.
Severance can be as much as 24 months’ pay, depending on a number of factors.

WATCH: Employment lawyer Lior Samfiru explains what rights employees have if they are being fired or let go on an episode of the Employment Law Show.


Before you accept any severance offer, have an experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP review it and your employment contract.
If you don’t receive the correct amount, which happens often, you have been wrongfully dismissed and should take legal action.
Non-unionized employees in Canada have up to two years from the date of their dismissal to pursue proper severance pay.

By Swayam Malhotra -   January 16, 2024 Modified date: January 16, 2024   










Generative  AI’s role in reshaping the job landscape in 2024 goes beyond just influencing existing roles. It’s catalyzing new job categories and altering the skills landscape.
Key Highlights:

Generative  AI is influencing jobs across various sectors.
Creative sector faces opportunities and IP challenges.
AI enhances productivity in corporate environments.
Green jobs are emerging alongside AI advancements.
HR and learning development increasingly rely on AI.


Impact on Creative Sector and Intellectual Property
In the creative industry, generative AI aids in content creation across marketing, software, design, and entertainment. However, it raises issues concerning intellectual property and originality, potentially leading to legal disputes and plagiarism concerns.
Generative  AI’s role in reshaping the job landscape in 2024 goes beyond just influencing existing roles. It’s catalyzing new job categories and altering the skills landscape.
AI and the Healthcare Industry
In healthcare,  AI is not just a tool but a partner. It aids in diagnosis, research, and patient care, leading to more efficient healthcare delivery. However, it also demands healthcare professionals to adapt to AI-assisted workflows, ensuring they remain integral to the decision-making process.
AI in Manufacturing and Automation
In manufacturing, AI’s role is pivotal in automating repetitive tasks, improving production efficiency, and reducing human error. This shift creates a demand for skilled technicians and engineers to develop and maintain  AI systems, transforming traditional manufacturing jobs.





 Educational Sector and AI
The  education sector is witnessing a revolution with AI. It offers personalized learning experiences and automates administrative tasks. Teachers and  educators are now required to integrate  AI tools into their teaching methodologies, blending traditional and modern teaching practices.
Retail and Customer Service
In retail, AI enhances customer experience and inventory management. It provides insights into consumer behavior, leading to more effective marketing strategies. However, it also changes the skill requirements for sales and marketing professionals, necessitating a deeper understanding of AI tools.
Transportation and AI
AI’s impact on the transportation sector is significant, particularly in logistics and delivery services. It improves route planning and fleet management, but also introduces challenges in terms of job displacement in traditional driving roles.
 AI in Financial Services
In the financial sector, AI assists in risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer service. This requires finance professionals to adapt to AI-based tools for data analysis and decision-making.
The Role of Governments and Policy Makers
Governments and policymakers play a crucial role in managing the transition to an AI-driven economy. They need to formulate policies that encourage  AI innovation while protecting workers from displacement and ensuring equitable access to retraining and upskilling programs.
CONCLUSION
While generative AI in 2024 is transforming job roles and creating opportunities, it also poses challenges that need to be addressed through strategic planning, policy making, and continuous learning. The future of work with  AI will be a blend of human creativity and machine efficiency, demanding adaptability and a lifelong learning mindset.
