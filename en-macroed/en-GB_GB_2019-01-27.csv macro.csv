After all, aren’t computers less likely to have inherent views on, for example, race, gender, and sexuality?
Well, that was true back in the days when, as a general rule, computers could only do what we told them. The rollout of machine learning, thanks to the explosion of Big Data, and the emergence of affordable computers with enough processing power to handle it have changed all that.









3 Steps To Tackle The Problem Of Bias In Artificial Intelligence

In the old days, the term “garbage in, garbage out” concisely summed up the importance of high-quality data. When you give computers the wrong information to work with, the results they come up with are unlikely to be helpful.
PROMOTED
Back then, this was mostly a problem for computer programmers and analysts. Today, when computers are routinely making decisions about whether we are invited to job interviews, eligible for a mortgage, or a candidate for surveillance by law enforcement and security services, it’s a problem for everybody.

In possibly the highest profile example of getting this wrong so far, a study found that an AI algorithm used by parole authorities in the US to predict the likelihood of criminals reoffending was biased against black people.
Exactly how this came about is unknown – the workings of the proprietary algorithms have not been made available for independent auditing. But the ProPublica study found that the system overestimated the likelihood of black offenders going to commit further crimes after completing their sentence while underestimating the likelihood of white offenders doing the same.

Biased AI systems are likely to become an increasingly widespread problem as artificial intelligence moves out of the data science labs and into the real world. The “democratization of AI” undoubtedly has the potential to do a lot of good, by putting intelligent, self-learning software in the hands of us all.
But there’s also a very real danger that without proper training on data evaluation and spotting the potential for bias in data, vulnerable groups in society could be hurt or have their rights impinged by biased AI.
It’s possible AI may be the solution to, as well as the cause of this problem. Researchers at IBM are working on automated bias-detection algorithms, which are trained to mimic human anti-bias processes we use when making decisions, to mitigate against our own inbuilt biases.
This includes evaluating the consistency with which we (or machines) make decisions. If there is a difference in the solution chosen to two different problems, despite the fundamentals of each situation being similar, then there may be bias for or against some of the non-fundamental variables. In human terms, this could emerge as racism, xenophobia, sexism or ageism.
While this is interesting and vital work, the potential for bias to derail drives for equality and fairness runs deeper, to levels which may not be so easy to fix with algorithms.
I spoke to Dr. Rumman Chowdhury, Accenture’s lead for responsible AI, who outlined that there may be situations where data and algorithms are clean, but societal biases may still throw a spanner in the works.
She said, ""With societal bias, you can have perfect data and a perfect model, but we have an imperfect world.""
""Think about the use of AI in hiring … you use all of your historical data to train a model on who should be hired and why. Then you parse their resume or look at people’s faces while they’re interviewing.
“But you’re assuming that the only reason people are hired and promoted is pure meritocracy, and we actually know that not to be true.
“So, in this case, there's nothing wrong with the data, and there's nothing wrong with the model, what's wrong is that ingrained biases in society have led to unequal outcomes in the workplace, and that isn't something you can fix with an algorithm.""
In very simplified terms, an algorithm might pick a white, middle-aged man to fill a vacancy based on the fact that other white, middle-aged men were previously hired to the same position, and subsequently promoted. This would be overlooking the fact that the reason he was hired, and promoted, was more down to the fact he is a white, middle-aged man, rather than that he was good at the job.
Chowdhury lists three specific steps which organizations can take to minimize the risk of perpetuating societal biases.
The first is to look at the algorithms themselves and ensure that nothing about the way they are coded perpetuates bias. This is particularly necessary when AI is constantly making predictions which are out-of-step with reality (as seems to be the case with the US probation example mentioned above).
Second is to consider ways in which AI itself can help to mitigate against the risk of biased data – IBM’s bias detection algorithms could play a part here.
Thirdly, we must “make sure our house is in order – we can’t expect an AI algorithm that has been trained on data that comes from society to be better than society – unless we’ve explicitly designed it to be.”
This leads onto the discussion of the regulation of AI – who will be responsible for setting the parameters AI operates within – teaching machines what is valid data to learn from, and where inbuilt societal biases could limit its ability to make decisions which are both valuable and ethical.
Tech leaders including Google, Facebook and Apple jointly formed the Partnership on AI in 2016 to encourage research on the ethics of AI, including issues of bias. Part of the partnerships work involves informing legislators, but this ""top-down"" approach may not produce solutions to every problem, and may even stifle innovation.
Chowdhury says “What we don’t want … is every AI project at a company having to be judged by some governance group, that’s not going to make projects go forward. I call that model ‘police patrol,' where we have the police going around trying to stop and arrest criminals. That doesn't create a good culture for ethical behavior.""
Neither should the burden of regulation and enforcement be put solely on the front-line – the data scientists themselves, argues Chowdhury.
""Yes, the data scientist plays a role, the AI researcher plays a role, but at a corporation, there are many moving parts.
“We put a lot of responsibility on the data scientist … but they shouldn’t shoulder all of it.”
Basically, if society is at a stage where we are ready to democratize AI, by making it available to all, then we need to be ready to democratize the oversight and regulation of AI ethics.
Chowdhury refers to this concept as the Fire Warden model.
""Think about how if there's a fire in your building right now, everyone knows what to do – you all meet outside at a pre-arranged location, someone will raise the alarm – you won't put out the fire, but you've been educated on how to respond.
“That’s what I want to see in the governance of AI systems, everybody has a role to play, everyone’s roles are a bit different, but everyone understands how to raise ethical issues.”
Crucially, this will only work if there is faith that someone will put out the fire – no one would bother calling the fire brigade if they knew they didn’t have the ability and motivation to do their job. Some top-down regulation will undoubtedly be a necessary part of tackling the issue of AI bias.
But building a culture of reporting and accountability throughout an organization means there will be a far greater chance to spot and halt, bias in data, algorithms or systems before it is perpetuated and becomes harmful.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until then, no one is helped by exaggerating the intelligence or capabilities of AI systems. What is AI anyway? (Clockwise from top: a model from the film Metropolis, Oral-B’s AI toothbrush, an autonomous delivery robot.)It’s better, then, to talk about “machine learning” rather than AI. This is a subfield of artificial intelligence, and one that encompasses pretty much all the methods having the biggest impact on the world right now (including what’s called deep learning). As a phrase, it doesn’t have the mystique of “AI,” but it’s more helpful in explaining what the technology does.How does machine learning work? Over the past few years, I’ve read and watched dozens of explanations, and the distinction I’ve found most useful is right there in the name: machine learning is all about enabling computers to learn on their own. But what that means is a much bigger question.Let’s start with a problem. Say you want to create a program that can recognize cats. (It’s always cats for some reason). You could try and do this the old-fashioned way by programming in explicit rules like “cats have pointy ears” and “cats are furry.” But what would the program do when you show it a picture of a tiger? Programming in every rule needed would be time-consuming, and you’d have to define all sorts of difficult concepts along the way, like “furriness” and “pointiness.” Better to let the machine teach itself. So you give it a huge collection of cat photos, and it looks through those to find its own patterns in what it sees. It connects the dots, pretty much randomly at first, but you test it over and over, keeping the best versions. And in time, it gets pretty good at saying what is and isn’t a cat. So far, so predictable. In fact, you’ve probably read an explanation like this before, and I’m sorry for it. But what’s important is not reading the gloss but really thinking about what that gloss implies. What are the side effects of having a decision-making system learn like this? Well, the biggest advantage of this method is the most obvious: you never have to actually program it. Sure, you do a hell of a lot of tinkering, improving how the system processes the data and coming up with smarter ways of ingesting that information, but you’re not telling it what to look for. That means it can spot patterns that humans might miss or never think of in the first place. And because all the program needs is data — 1s and 0s — there are so many jobs you can train it on because the modern world is just stuffed full of data. With a machine learning hammer in your hand, the digital world is full of nails ready to be bashed into place. Machines that teach themselves can produce powerful results, as with DeepMind’s series of Go-playing AI systems.  Photo by Google via Getty ImagesBut then think about the disadvantages, too. If you’re not explicitly teaching the computer, how do you know how it’s making its decisions? Machine learning systems can’t explain their thinking, and that means your algorithm could be performing well for the wrong reasons. Similarly, because all the computer knows is the data you feed it, it might pick up a biased view of the world, or it might only be good at narrow tasks that look similar to the data it’s seen before. It doesn’t have the common sense you’d expect from a human. You could build the best cat-recognizer program in the world and it would never tell you that kittens shouldn’t drive motorbikes or that a cat is more likely to be called “Tiddles” than “Megalorth the Undying.” Teaching computers to learn for themselves is a brilliant shortcut — and like all shortcuts, it involves cutting cornersTeaching computers to learn for themselves is a brilliant shortcut. And like all shortcuts, it involves cutting corners. There’s intelligence in AI systems, if you want to call it that. But it’s not organic intelligence, and it doesn’t play by the same rules humans do. You may as well ask: how clever is a book? What expertise is encoded in a frying pan? So where do we stand now with artificial intelligence? After years of headlines announcing the next big breakthrough (which, well, they haven’t quite stopped yet), some experts think we’ve reached something of a plateau. But that’s not really an impediment to progress. On the research side, there are huge numbers of avenues to explore within our existing knowledge, and on the product side, we’ve only seen the tip of the algorithmic iceberg. Kai-Fu Lee, a venture capitalist and former AI researcher, describes the current moment as the “age of implementation” — one where the technology starts “spilling out of the lab and into the world.” Benedict Evans, another VC strategist, compares machine learning to relational databases, a type of enterprise software that made fortunes in the ‘90s and revolutionized whole industries, but that’s so mundane your eyes probably glazed over just reading those two words. The point both these people are making is that we’re now at the point where AI is going to get normal fast. “Eventually, pretty much everything will have [machine learning] somewhere inside and no-one will care,” says Evans. He’s right, but we’re not there yet. In the here and now, artificial intelligence — machine learning — is still something new that often goes unexplained or under-examined. So in this week’s special issue of The Verge, AI Week, we’re going to show you how it’s all happening right now, how this technology is being used to change things. Because in the future, it’ll be so normal you won’t even notice. Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeThe ups and downs of being a political TikToker

You could try and do this the old-fashioned way by programming in explicit rules like “cats have pointy ears” and “cats are furry.” But what would the program do when you show it a picture of a tiger? Programming in every rule needed would be time-consuming, and you’d have to define all sorts of difficult concepts along the way, like “furriness” and “pointiness.” Better to let the machine teach itself. So you give it a huge collection of cat photos, and it looks through those to find its own patterns in what it sees. It connects the dots, pretty much randomly at first, but you test it over and over, keeping the best versions. And in time, it gets pretty good at saying what is and isn’t a cat. 

So far, so predictable. In fact, you’ve probably read an explanation like this before, and I’m sorry for it. But what’s important is not reading the gloss but really thinking about what that gloss implies. What are the side effects of having a decision-making system learn like this? 

Well, the biggest advantage of this method is the most obvious: you never have to actually program it. Sure, you do a hell of a lot of tinkering, improving how the system processes the data and coming up with smarter ways of ingesting that information, but you’re not telling it what to look for. That means it can spot patterns that humans might miss or never think of in the first place. And because all the program needs is data — 1s and 0s — there are so many jobs you can train it on because the modern world is just stuffed full of data. With a machine learning hammer in your hand, the digital world is full of nails ready to be bashed into place.

But then think about the disadvantages, too. If you’re not explicitly teaching the computer, how do you know how it’s making its decisions? Machine learning systems can’t explain their thinking, and that means your algorithm could be performing well for the wrong reasons. Similarly, because all the computer knows is the data you feed it, it might pick up a biased view of the world, or it might only be good at narrow tasks that look similar to the data it’s seen before. It doesn’t have the common sense you’d expect from a human. You could build the best cat-recognizer program in the world and it would never tell you that kittens shouldn’t drive motorbikes or that a cat is more likely to be called “Tiddles” than “Megalorth the Undying.” 

""Teaching computers to learn for themselves is a brilliant shortcut — and like all shortcuts, it involves cutting corners""

Teaching computers to learn for themselves is a brilliant shortcut. And like all shortcuts, it involves cutting corners. There’s intelligence in AI systems, if you want to call it that. But it’s not organic intelligence, and it doesn’t play by the same rules humans do. You may as well ask: how clever is a book? What expertise is encoded in a frying pan? 

So where do we stand now with artificial intelligence? After years of headlines announcing the next big breakthrough (which, well, they haven’t quite stopped yet), some experts think we’ve reached something of a plateau. But that’s not really an impediment to progress. On the research side, there are huge numbers of avenues to explore within our existing knowledge, and on the product side, we’ve only seen the tip of the algorithmic iceberg. 

Kai-Fu Lee, a venture capitalist and former AI researcher, describes the current moment as the “age of implementation” — one where the technology starts “spilling out of the lab and into the world.” Benedict Evans, another VC strategist, compares machine learning to relational databases, a type of enterprise software that made fortunes in the ‘90s and revolutionized whole industries, but that’s so mundane your eyes probably glazed over just reading those two words. The point both these people are making is that we’re now at the point where AI is going to get normal fast. “Eventually, pretty much everything will have [machine learning] somewhere inside and no-one will care,” says Evans. 

He’s right, but we’re not there yet. 

In the here and now, artificial intelligence — machine learning — is still something new that often goes unexplained or under-examined. So in this week’s special issue of The Verge, AI Week, we’re going to show you how it’s all happening right now, how this technology is being used to change things. Because in the future, it’ll be so normal you won’t even notice.

Workers are clearly anxious about the effects on the job market of artificial intelligence and automation.Estimates about how much of the workforce could be automated vary from about 9% to 47%. The consultancy McKinsey estimates up to 800 million workers globally could be displaced by robotic automation by 2030. Some jobs will change dramatically, while others will disappear altogether.So if automation makes the job market a little like a game of musical chairs, is there a way to make sure you’re still employed when the music stops? Can education help you robot-proof your career?Future-proofing your career is less about picking a safe job and more about constantly updating your skills throughout your career, according to Northeastern University president Joseph Aoun, who wrote Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence.Getty ImagesNortheastern University president Joseph Aoun says we'll have to combine technical, data and human skills to keep up in an uncertain future (Credit: Getty Images)He says education needs to change dramatically if workers are to adapt to this new environment. His solution, which he calls humanics, has three basic pillars:Technical ability: understanding how machines function and how to interact with them. As both artificial intelligence and robotics become ever more capable, machines will step into roles once monopolised by humans. Some employees won't last, but others will find themselves working with machines, and probably being vastly more productive as a result. Workers with a grounding in coding and engineering principles will be better placed to thrive in this new kind of workplace.Data discipline: navigating the sea of information that's generated by these machines. Workers will need data literacy to read, analyse and use the almost bottomless troves of information that are increasingly guiding everything from major business decisions to stock picks to purchasing decisions.And the human discipline: ""which is what we humans can do that machines for the foreseeable future, cannot emulate.” Aoun says this includes creativity, cultural agility, empathy and the ability to take information from one context and apply it to another. In educational terms, this means less emphasis on the classroom and a greater emphasis on experiential learning.Getty ImagesAutomation and AI aren't just going to affect lower-skill workers – professions such as law and accounting will be disrupted too   (Credit: Getty Images)The World Economic Forum suggests many white-collar jobs, like accounting, will be at risk from future automation, while the OECD says low-skilled jobs will be most vulnerable and there’ll still be a strong correlation between education and income. Either way, skills are becoming outdated faster than ever before.A generation ago, the half-life of a skill was about 26 years. Today, it&rsquo;s four and half years and dropping &ndash; Indranil Roy“A generation ago, the half-life of a skill was about 26 years, and that was the model for a career. Today, it’s four and half years and dropping,” says Indranil Roy, the head of the Future of Work Centre of Excellence, set up by global consultancy Deloitte.Aoun says the rapid pace of change isn’t necessarily a negative, but it does mean you’ll probably never outgrow homework. It also means universities will need to shift their focus towards lifelong education and training mid-career workers.“We’re constantly becoming obsolete. And in some ways that’s an enormous opportunity for us all to re-educate ourselves and update ourselves. Those that are able to do it will be able to flourish,” he says.Aoun worries that the tertiary education system currently isn’t equipped for this new reality. He says many universities are far too focused on four-year undergraduate courses and academic research.Equally important to helping students graduate, he says, is helping students master “the human discipline”. The solution is a much greater emphasis on real-world experience. That might mean taking a job or a long-term internship while studying. In addition to career experience, this gives students the life-skills to negotiate and interact with colleagues.“It also allows you to see opportunities and see gaps, and this is where you can say ‘I’m going to start a company or a not-for-profit’,” he says.Roy agrees that less-tangible life skills are becoming more important to many employers. He says some of Deloitte’s “more progressive” clients use artificial intelligence for skills like analytics, freelancers for deep technical skills and only fully employ people with “life skills” and values that align closely with the organisation. But he points out those are skills that mostly come from outside a university environment.Getty ImagesIndranil Roy recommends universities offer more interdisciplinary studies to teach students the right skills for the future (Credit: Getty Images)McKinsey suggests that by 2030, the workforce will spend 55% more time using technical skills than in 2016. The World Economic Forum, meanwhile, foresees a net gain in employment from automation, with some jobs killed off but more created.Roy says that probably means a workplace in which robots work alongside humans – for example, he says some of Deloitte’s clients have AI systems that attend and participate in meetings.Aoun agrees that it’s important to understand our changing our relationship with machines in the workplace, and to adapt education accordingly.“In the same way that once we have self-driving cars, clearly teaching driving will be transformed. So technology is going to make certain fields obsolete, but it’s not going to make humans obsolete,” he says.Perhaps above all, Aoun says humans need to focus on skills that are harder for artificial intelligence to replicate. Specifically, that means taking knowledge from one context or discipline and applying it to another. Humanics itself is about combining three separate disciplines.“We humans are creative, innovative, entrepreneurial. We are able to interact with other people, work with them, be empathetic. We are able to be culturally agile, work with people with different backgrounds. We are able to be global,” he said.Roy says universities, particularly in the US, Canada and Australia, are increasingly focusing on interdisciplinary studies. However, tertiary institutions in other countries are still a little more traditional in their approach.Technology is constantly upending our expectations, with change the only certainty. Roy says he is “surprised every day” at the barriers machines are breaking.So perhaps it’s not enough to help workers survive a musical chairs-style job market. Maybe they also need to survive in one where all the chairs are constantly moving.To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook  page or message us on Twitter.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""If You Only Read 6 Things This Week"".

You Are Smarter Than a Computer

FacebookTwitterLinkedIn The question of artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and the future of human work is a Rorschach test: the answer you get depends on what you see. For some, the advent of “smart” everything portends a future of rising living standards and human flourishing. Others see a dark side. Without going “full Terminator,” many of the best informed people in the AI field see a revolution that threatens social cohesion by devaluing human labor.
@eddieespinal via Twenty20
The actual future will likely contain elements of both these forecasts along with others that we haven’t yet imagined. In the short- and medium-term, significant challenges are probable as artificial intelligence works its way through the economy. The best estimates predict that somewhere between 10 percent and 30 percent of all jobs — between 15 million and 45 million positions — are susceptible to partial or complete automation in the United States alone.
Moreover, while lower-skilled jobs are at the greatest risk in the short-term, AI is also beginning to affect accounting, medicine, law and, ironically, the high-tech sector itself. The good news is that automation will be gradual and uneven because of its capital costs and implementation challenges.
In the longer term, economic history suggests that substituting technology for human labor is the best path to economic growth and improved living standards. The steam engine that launched the Industrial Revolution eliminated tens of thousands of jobs for artisans producing fine linens — but created millions of factory jobs in textile mills and drove down the price of clothing, and eventually, other wares. Lower prices left more income to purchase new products, devices and services.
This is the triple benefit of innovation: new jobs, lower prices and increased diversity of products. Just as manufacturing replaced agriculture as the principal occupation of Americans, today services and information tasks are replacing manufacturing. Innovation means jobs are destroyed, but new types of work are created at an even faster rate.
Given the pace of change and the degree of uncertainty, what should policymakers — and individuals — do to prepare for the future?
For mid-career workers, retraining will be an important part of the solution. Some companies, like AT&T, are investing heavily in skill development programs that help shift their existing workforce into new jobs within the company. AT&T workers who are closer to retirement specialize in maintaining legacy systems using the “old” skills built up earlier in their careers.
Wage insurance is another potentially useful tool for buffering workers against loss of income when higher paid jobs are replaced with more plentiful but lower-paying positions. By partly replacing the income lost during the transition to a new job, wage insurance would help keep more people in the labor force, preventing loss of skills and the physical, psychological and emotional toll of disemployment.
Younger workers face a more complex picture. Since the Sputnik crises of the mid-1950s, presidents, policymakers and educators have emphasized the acquisition of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills. Recent research indicates this may no longer be a good bet for the next generation.
According to one recent study, almost 60 percent of STEM workers leave their careers after 10 years driven out by stagnating wages and obsolete skills. Those with strong inter-personal or noncognitive skills find their way into STEM leadership and management positions. Others have to start over.
This reality is reflected in what employers tell us about what’s missing in our current workforce, namely soft-skills (listening, problem-solving, teamwork, integrity, dependability and adaptability). One study found that when offered the choice between a job candidate with job-specific skills or one who had good general skills, employers favored the general skills by almost two-to-one. Out of a list of eight qualities valued by Google hiring managers, the top seven were soft-skills. You can read more about the soft-skill shortage and strategies for addressing it here.
Finally, remember this: there is no computer that is smarter than the average human being. Algorithms typically do one thing very well. But a human being can do many things well simultaneously. Computers break information down; the human mind integrates information — text, image, sound, body language — creating the thing we call “consciousness,” a feat no computer can replicate. In our high-tech future, people will succeed not by trying to compete with AI but by being more fully human. Ironic, isn’t it?

He has reported on politics and policy issues for news organizations including National Memo, Massroots, NBC, and is a published science fiction author. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Artificial Intelligence is currently being deployed in customer service to both augment and replace human agents – with the primary goals of improving the customer experience and reducing human customer service costs. While the technology is not yet able to perform all the tasks a human customer service representative could, many consumer requests are very simple ask that sometimes be handled by current AI technologies without human input. In this article we’ll shed light on the current trends and use-cases that business leaders should be considering today. We’ve broken this article on AI for customer service into the following four sections: How AI is helping to augment the work of human customer service representatives, including: Augmenting messenging AI for sorting and routing support inquiries AI for enhanced phone support Where AI may be replacing human customer service representatives An assessment of the results / ROI of current AI customer service initiatives Perspectives and predictions about the future of AI and customer service According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics there were just over 2.7 million Americans employed as customer service representatives with a mean wage of $35,170. Any technology that could improve the efficiency of customer service representatives or make some of these positions redundant would potentially produce significant business savings. This is likely one reason why Oracle found that 80% of sales and marketing leaders say they are currently using or plan to deploy chatbots in the near future.  AI Augmenting Human Customer Service AI doesn’t need to completely replace humans customer services representatives to be useful. There are many transitional step between a human only customer service system and possible goal of one completely run by a perfectly human like AI. There are many AI can work in tangent with human agents. Machine learning can also help streamline processes to make human more efficient by letting them spend all their time doing what they do best. This is how AI is currently being used by business to produce noticeable improvements. Salesforce’s Chief Digital Evangelist, Vala Afshar predicts that, “The line-of-business that is most likely to embrace AI first will be the customer service – typically the most process oriented and technology savvy organization within most companies.” Other executives share his sentiment, our own consensus of 35 AI executives determined that conversational interfaces (mostly intended for customer support) would be the most important consumer-facing AI innovation in the next 5 years. AI for customer service seems somewhat inevitable. Mr. Afshar points out that 38% of enterprises use AI, and that is expected to grow to 62% by next year. Salesforce believes deploying AI for Customer Relationship Management will increase global business revenues by $1.1 trillion by 2021, which is why they have bet so heavily on their Einstein platform with both internal development and several big acquisitions to try to capture a large share of this market. While one of the biggest players, Salesforce is by no means the only company developing AI for customer relationship applications. 1 – AI Augmented Messaging One company that provides AI-augmented messaging is LivePerson, which last year had revenue of roughly $200 million and is currently working with IBM Watson. The company is deploying a “bot assistant to the agent” model for some clients. The goal is to avoid the frustration some people feel when dealing with a pure bot while still using the technology to increase efficiency. At the moment the company feels generalized bots don’t work, but specialized bots meant to handle the most routine and simple tasks do. A screen shot intended to demonstrate LivePerson’s conversational interface passing messages to and from human agents – Image from LivePerson Liveperson claims that around half of all customer service interactions are currently highly suitable for bots. So they have created a system were the humans and bots work in tango. Very simple questions can be handled directly by a bot, but as soon as the conversation becomes too complicated the bot can hand the conversation off to a human. The human can handle the more difficult task and even hand the interaction back to the bot finished any simple details. This maximize the time human agents spend doing what only human agents currently can and minimize the time they spend on task that bots can handle. This system allows one agent to handle multiple interactions. According to the case studies LivePerson promotes, their system has allowed agents at UPC, one of Ireland’s largest internet providers, to take up to three chats at once. While they say the system even let agents at Sun handle up to 6 concurrent chats. 2 – AI Organized Email Inquiries Having a person read every email a company gets to try to figure out what the customer needs and how to deal with it can be a very time-consuming task. That is why companies are using AI to speed up the process. Once company offering this sort of tool is DigitalGenius with their core customer service product. Some companies are using this AI-powered technology to scan and tag emails to direct them to the right office. The system also provides agents with macros and clips from the best past responses to quickly create a response. This screen shot from DigitalGenius’ product page highlights the main benefits that the company claims to deliver. While this image can’t be taken as our claim to what DigitalGenius can or cannot do (we are not a customer of theirs), it should be seen as a representative set of important business problems that AI conversational interface companies (like DigitalGenius and it’s competitors) are set out to solve One example of their technology which DigitalGenius highlights is its use by student prep company Magoosh. According to Magoosh, the system made their customer service team significantly more efficient. The technology let them cut the number of customer requests waiting for a reply by half and mad it easy for Magoosh to meet their internal goal of responding to all customers with 24 hours. DigitalGenius claims more than 83% of all incoming requests could be handled by their system that would tag and sort them. 3 – AI Enhanced Customer Phone Calls A screen shot from Software Advice’s “Demographics on Live Chat Customer Service” survey, showing the frequency of live chat customer service engagement among age groups AI is harder to deploy for voice-based communications. On a purely technical level it is more challenging for a computer system to deal with voice than chat. Background noise, unusual speech patterns, accents, and poor pronunciation all make it hard for an AI to translate voices into text.  In addition some people only call companies as a last resort when they have really difficult issues to address. A customer survey by Software Advice found that when it comes to simple questions customers were almost equally divided whether they preferred to use chat or a phone call to get the answer, but to get an answer for a complex financial questions customer prefer calling by a rate of three to one.   Yet even with these hurdles, there are companies who are managing to use AI to enhance the work of customer service representatives who answer phone calls. For example, the startup Cogito has developed a real-time conversation-analysis tool based on behavioral science and deep learning. Their AI listens to conversations for both content and tone. They claim it can detect mimicking, change in volume, change in pitch, etc. to gain real-time insight into how customers are feeling and how all company calls are going. It provides real-time suggestions to customer service representatives to improve the call and evaluate performance. One of the first big tests of their system was at insurance giant Humana. During a six month trial involving 200 agents, calls that used their system resulted in a 28 percent improvement in Net Promoter Scores, a 6 percent improvement in issue resolution, and fewer callers asking to speak to a manager. Cogito claims their system reduces call backs by 10 percent and increases customer satisfaction by 28 percent.  Similarly, Salesforce announced earlier this year that call monitoring is one of the ways they are deploying their AI technology. Einstein Supervisor claims to be able to predict customer satisfaction and make recommendations. It can track call center patterns and also look for broad patterns within the data, such as increased call volume from customers who bought a specific batch of a product. AI Replacing Human Customer Service Voice ordering demo – as seen on the short video on the Starbucks website The potential cost savings and the ability to provide 24-hour customer service are why some organizations are using AI to replace humans in certain customer service applications all together. AI can’t yet fully replicate everything a person can do when it comes to resolving complex issues, but there any many applications where it doesn’t need to.  Pre-internet, many customer calls were to get very basic information or make very basic orders. These are the type of interactions that are being fully automated across several platforms. For example, something simple like ordering a pizza to be delivered is a routine interaction, and the problems that would arise from AI making a small mistake are minimal. Food companies like Subway, Dominos, Starbucks and Wingstop have all recently started using AI to let people place orders in different ways without human involvement. Individuals can place pizza orders with chatbots in Facebook Messenger or verbally tell Amazon’s Alexa to order them a frappuccino. Several banks are making major pushes for AI, since people often interact with their banks to get basic information such as checking balances or to perform basic tasks like paying bills. Capital One recently unveiled their natural language assistant, Eno.  Similarly, Bank of America plans to roll out Erica, their AI banking assistant, in the coming months. Multiple major international companies now feel confident turning over simple, routine consumer interactions to bots.  A Look into the Future of AI and Customer Support Predictions of just how much AI will impact customer service performance and employment varies considerably. This is partly due to the fact that many of the most interesting uses of AI in customer service have only been deployed relatively recently and the fact that customer service can be a bit nebulous.  While call center employment is an easily quantifiable measurement, some of the biggest impacts of the technology will be freeing up cashiers, hostesses, and salespeople at local stores. According to a 2016 report from McKinsey, 29 percent of what customer-service representatives do has the potential for automation.  A Tata consultancy services survey of executives around the world found that 31.7 percent of major companies are currently using AI in customer service. It is the second most common use of AI by companies after IT. It also found on average executives expect cognitive technology to reduce customer service jobs on net by 4 percent. There is also the issue of how this technology might induce demand. Companies are currently using AI to replace humans when to comes to low-level consumer interactions to make responses quicker and cheaper, but they are also using AI to make consumer service interactions with human agents better. Sometimes, though, when you make something better and cheaper, people expect significantly more of it.  According to Microsoft’s 2016 State of Global Customer Service Report, millennials have a 68% higher expectations for customer service today than they had just one year ago. Thanks to technology 78% of young consumer expect service agent to already know their contact and product information when they contact them. The mid-term impact of the use of AI in customer service might not be a net reduction in customer service jobs. Instead, companies may use the efficiency gained to provide a much higher level of service with similar levels of employment. Concluding Thoughts Fashion is a retail sector that seems to be investing heavily in customer support and sales support chat applications, read more about use-cases from Dior, Nike, and other fashion leaders in our recent “AI in Fashion” article Customer service is one area where AI is currently being widely used and having an impact. In different forms it is being used to improve the quality or reduce the cost of customer service across industries such as fast food, banks, insurance and retail. Major companies are now confident AI chatbots and voice-activated systems can reliably handle low-level requests, resulting in significant investment and roll outs of these systems at the moment. Compared to some other aspects of business, the impact of AI on customer service is already being directly felt by companies and regular customers in a very clear and direct way. It is a space where new and improved applications AI are being deployed by wide range of different companies at a significant rate. Unlikely other applications of AI, ways to improve customer service is something almost all companies have to deal with. Despite the rapid change, AI is not expected to fully replace human customer service agents any time in the near future.  Current applications of AI in the customer service space are being used to fully handle some of the most monotonous work and are making it easier for human agents to deal with the more difficult issues. As these systems learn, they should be able to handle more and more requests without human involvement.  This means companies will likely be able to provide the current level of service they do now for less money, but that doesn’t inherently mean it will free up all company to spend less on this part of their business. We are seeing customers come to expect better service as a result of technology making that possible. The major impact of AI in customer service could be a reduction in total spending customer service for same industries or it could be quality improvement arms race for others while spending the same amount.   Header image credit: Infinit Contact Related Posts AI for Customer Service in Banking - Current ApplicationsIDC estimated the size of overall AI-related spending in the banking industry in their Worldwide… Chatbots for Customer Service - 4 Current ApplicationsIn this article, we look at current applications of user-built and vendor-built chatbots in the… AI for Fraud Detection in Retail - 2 Powerful Use CasesLeading retailers - like Walmart, Stop & Shop, and Home Depot - are enhancing their payment… 5 Ways Banking Chatbots Could Improve the Customer ExperienceIn banking and finance, chatbots have the potential to improve the customer experience by allowing… AI for Customer Segmentation and Marketing CampaignsDeloitte reported that 42% of questioned executives think AI will be “of critical importance” within… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently said that algorithms can perpetuate racial inequities.

Last week, newly elected U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made headlines when she said, as part of the fourth annual MLK Now event, that facial-recognition technologies and algorithms ""always have these racial inequities that get translated, because algorithms are still made by human beings, and those algorithms are still pegged to basic human assumptions. They're just automated. And automated assumptions — if you don't fix the bias, then you're just automating the bias.""Does that mean that algorithms, which are theoretically based on the objective truths of math, can be ""racist?"" And if so, what can be done to remove that bias? [The 11 Most Beautiful Mathematical Equations]It turns out that the output from algorithms can indeed produce biased results. Data scientists say that computer programs, neural networks, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) work because they learn how to behave from data they are given. Software is written by humans, who have bias, and training data is also generated by humans who have bias.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksLeaf Filter USADon't Pay For New Gutters. Get This 3-In-1 System InsteadLeaf Filter USALearn MoreUndoThe two stages of machine learning show how this bias can creep into a seemingly automated process. In the first stage, the training stage, an algorithm learns based on a set of data or on certain rules or restrictions. The second stage is the inference stage, in which an algorithm applies what it has learned in practice. This second stage reveals an algorithm's biases. For example, if an algorithm is trained with pictures of only women who have long hair, then it will think anyone with short hair is a man.LATEST VIDEOS FROM livescienceLive ScienceGoogle infamously came under fire in 2015 when Google Photos labeled black people as gorillas, likely because those were the only dark-skinned beings in the training set.And bias can creep in through many avenues. ""A common mistake is training an algorithm to make predictions based on past decisions from biased humans,"" Sophie Searcy, a senior data scientist at the data-science-training bootcamp Metis, told Live Science. ""If I make an algorithm to automate decisions previously made by a group of loan officers, I might take the easy road and train the algorithm on past decisions from those loan officers. But then, of course, if those loan officers were biased, then the algorithm I build will continue those biases.""Searcy cited the example of COMPAS, a predictive tool used across the U.S. criminal justice system for sentencing, which tries to predict where crime will occur. ProPublica performed an analysis on COMPAS and found that, after controlling for other statistical explanations, the tool overestimated the risk of recidivism for black defendants and consistently underestimated the risk for white defendants.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.To help combat algorithmic biases, Searcy told Live Science, engineers and data scientists should be building more-diverse data sets for new problems, as well as trying to understand and mitigate the bias built in to existing data sets.First and foremost, said Ira Cohen, a data scientist at predictive analytics company Anodot, engineers should have a training set with relatively uniform representation of all population types if they're training an algorithm to identify ethnic or gender attributes. ""It is important to represent enough examples from each population group, even if they are a minority in the overall population being examined,"" Cohen told Live Science. Finally, Cohen recommends checking for biases on a test set that includes people from all these groups. ""If, for a certain race, the accuracy is statistically significantly lower than the other categories, the algorithm may have a bias, and I would evaluate the training data that was used for it,"" Cohen told LiveScience. For example, if the algorithm can correctly identify 900 out of 1,000 white faces, but correctly detects only 600 out of 1,000 asian faces, then the algorithm may have a bias ""against"" Asians, Cohen added.Removing bias can be incredibly challenging for AI.Even Google, considered a forerunner in commercial AI, apparently couldn't come up with a comprehensive solution to its gorilla problem from 2015. Wired found that instead of finding a way for its algorithms to distinguish between people of color and gorillas, Google simply blocked its image-recognition algorithms from identifying gorillas at all.Google's example is a good reminder that training AI software can be a difficult exercise, particularly when software isn't being tested or trained by a representative and diverse group of people.Artificial Intelligence: Friendly or Frightening?Super-Intelligent Machines: 7 Robotic Futures10 Crazy New Skills That Robots Picked Up in 2018Originally published on Live Science.

How Will Automation, AI Impact Healthcare Employment?
Healthcare employment will have low exposure to automation in the next decade despite the increased use of artificial intelligence to replace some tasks, experts predict.

January 30, 2019 - Increased use of automation and artificial intelligence is slated to replace millions of jobs and tasks in the near future. However, healthcare employment is relatively safe from automation, according to a new report from the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program.
The report, titled Automation and Artificial Intelligence: How machines are affecting people and places, looks back at how automation impacted the workforce from the 1980s to 2016 and offers projections on how new automation and artificial intelligence (AI) tools will affect the economy by 2030.
“The next phase of automation, increasingly involving AI, seems like it should be manageable in the aggregate labor market, though there are many sources of uncertainty,” Mark Muro, Senior Fellow and lead author of the report, stated in a press release. “With that said, the potential effects will vary significantly across occupations, regions, and demographic groups, which means that policymakers, industry, and society as a whole needs to focus much more than they are on ensuring the coming transitions will work for all of those affected.”
Muro and his co-authors Robert Maxim and Jacob Whiton found that only approximately one-quarter of US jobs (36 million positions in 2016) are at an elevated risk of automation in the coming decade.
Meanwhile, about 36 percent of US employment, or 52 million jobs in 2016, face medium exposure by 2030, and the remaining 39 percent (57 million jobs in 2016) will experience low exposure.

The healthcare workforce sits in the medium to low exposure buckets, the report shows.
“Regardless of whether technological reality will keep up with technological possibility, the pattern of automatability is clear,” Muro et al. write. “Occupations in complex, creative, and social fields like management, business and finance, science and technology (computer, math, physical and life sciences, architecture, and engineering), law, education, arts, media, entertainment, healthcare, and social and community services (those to the left of the bar chart) have among the lowest automation potential across the workforce.”

								For example, home health aides only have an eight percent automation potential by 2030, while registered nurses have a 29 percent automation potential and medical assistants have a 54 percent automation potential.
Additionally, healthcare practitioners and technical occupations have a 33 percent current-task automation potential and healthcare support occupations have a 49 percent potential.
In contrast, jobs that are in “more cut-and-dried activity areas” such as office administration, agriculture, construction and extraction, maintenance and repair, production, transportation, and food services will experience the highest automation potential.
In the middle are protective services, building and ground maintenance, and personal services, the report states.
Despite different levels of automation potential, researchers emphasize that no occupation will be unaffected by the adoption of automation and artificial intelligence. Routine tasks will be the most vulnerable to automation in the next decade.
“Near-future automation potential will be highest for roles that now pay the lowest wages,” the report states. “Likewise, the average automation potential of occupations requiring a bachelor’s degree runs to just 24 percent, less than half the 55 percent task exposure faced by roles requiring less than a bachelor’s degree.”
“Given this, better-educated, higher-paid earners for the most part will continue to face lower automation threats based on current task content—though that could change as AI begins to put pressure on some higher-wage ‘non-routine’ jobs.”
Automation risk will be the most disruptive in the American Heartland, so Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, the report also stated.
“Overall, the 19 states that the Walton Family Foundation labels as the American Heartland have an average employment-weighted automation potential of 47 percent of current tasks, compared with 45 percent in the rest of the country,” researchers write. “Much of this exposure reflects Heartland states’ longstanding and continued specialization in manufacturing and agricultural industries.”
Similarly, smaller, more rural communities will also see significantly more automation exposure and task replacement compared to urban areas.
In addition, the report states that men, young workers, and under-represented communities have greater automation exposure.
Automation and artificial intelligence will impact the US workforce in the next decade. But the potential loss or task replacement for some occupation isn’t as dire as some say.
“Technologists at first issued scary dystopian alarms about the power of automation, including artificial intelligence, to destroy work,” researchers write. “Now, the discourse appears to be arriving at a more balanced story that suggests that while the robots are coming they will bring neither an apocalypse nor utopia, but instead both benefits and stress alike.”
Federal, state, and local policymakers, business, educators, and civil society have the power to ensure automation and artificial intelligence maximize productivity while mitigating negative labor market effects, they add.
“In this vein, the nation needs to commit to deep-set educational changes, new efforts to help workers and communities adjust to change, and a more serious commitment to reducing hardships for those who are struggling,” the report concludes. “If the nation can commit to its people in this way, a future full of machines will seem much more tolerable.”
