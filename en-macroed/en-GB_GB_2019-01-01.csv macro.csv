HELSINKI —  Jaana Partanen is not your typical AI programming geek.
Until a year ago, the 59-year-old dentist from the Finnish town of Mikkeli had no idea what to make of terms like ""machine learning"" or ""neural networks.""
Now, Partanen spends her evenings learning the basics of coding and she is thinking about how to apply artificial intelligence to her job, either to help write up medical summaries or perform orthodontics.

""I can see it [artificial intelligence] is already here, and it serves us — very much actually,"" she said, adding that following the latest developments in the field has become a hobby.
She's one of tens of thousands of non-technology experts who are taking part in a grand experiment aimed at repurposing the country's economy toward high-end applications of artificial intelligence. The idea has a simple, Nordic ring to it: Start by teaching 1 percent of the country's population, or about 55,000 people, the basic concepts at the root of artificial technology, and gradually build on the number over the next few years.
“We’ll never have so much money that we will be the leader of artificial intelligence. But how we use it — that’s something different"" — Mika Lintilä, economy minister
Originally started as a free-access university course, Finland's ""1 percent"" AI scheme is now being rolled out nationally with the support of private companies and the government.
For Helsinki, there is also a clear economic incentive to training large numbers of Finns in the basics of AI: Doing so may allow Finland to stay competitive amid ever growing competition between China and the United States, and in the aftermath of the rapid decline of Nokia, the national mobile champion that has fallen on hard times.
As the two superpowers vie for technological supremacy, Finland knows it's outclassed on raw resources. There is no point trying to compete with Beijing or Washington in terms of developing the basic technology of AI. So Finland aspires to occupy a niche, as world leader in practical applications of AI, according to Economy Minister Mika Lintilä.

“We’ll never have so much money that we will be the leader of artificial intelligence,” Lintilä said. “But how we use it — that’s something different.""
Setting up the goalposts
Like many ideas in the liberal Nordic country, this one did not originate with government.
It started a short walk away from the economy ministry, in a modern building shared by the University of Helsinki's department of computer science and consulting agency Reaktor. Originally, it was meant as a promotional sideline to a free online course dubbed ""Elements of AI.""
The university and the company decided to launch the course last May with the intention to ""support democracy,"" according to computer scientist Teemu Roos, the mind behind it.
Without requiring any coding skills, the class introduces the basics of artificial intelligence, but does not intend to train a new generation of cutting-edge developers. Instead, it wants to raise awareness about the opportunities and risks of AI among people who are strangers to computer science, so they can decide for themselves what's beneficial and where they want their government to invest.
""That’s how society works — if enough people say they don’t like it, then we regulate it,” he said.

Roos said he came up with the idea in the summer of 2017, after hearing that the Finnish government was fishing around for help from institutions to develop ""lifelong learning"" — or professional training — material on AI.
Roos knew he would need help to make his material approachable for a general audience, so he teamed up with Reaktor. Together they purged his Introduction to AI course, which he had given to his computer science students for six years, of any elements that required programming and designed a slick website.

But the marketers at Reaktor were still worried that the course would stay unnoticed outside of expert circles, and so they came up with the idea to promote it by linking it to an ambitious goal: They convinced some of the country’s largest employers to join them, and announced that by the end of 2018, the course — coupled with other efforts of the industry — would lead to at least 1 percent of Finland’s population being trained in AI.
Quickly, the initiative gathered pace. By mid-December, over 250 companies announced they would participate in the initiative dubbed ""AI challenge."" Paper giant Stora Enso, for instance, pledged to train 1,000 of their employees in AI. Tech companies Elisa and Nokia said they would train their entire workforce.
""The companies participating in the challenge have pledged to train their staff in the basics of AI — with our course or with any material they see fit,"" said Reaktor's chief marketing officer, Ville Valtonen.

In addition to the companies' separate efforts, more than 10,500 people — over 6,300 of them from Finland — had graduated from the course by mid-December, according to Reaktor.

As the initiative began to flourish, government officials took notice, and publicly embraced it. Finland's ministry of foreign affairs and the country's tax authority both announced they would also train their staff — and when the first batches of students graduated from Elements of AI in September 2018, Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö showed up at the ceremony. Among the graduates was dentist Partanen, who traveled over three hours on a bus to take part.
A Finnish language version of the course was launched in November. This, government officials hope, will boost the number of graduates from Finland even further.
Europe's No. 1 laboratory for AI
The grassroots training scheme is just one element of a national plan to turn Helsinki into a leading voice on AI in the world.
In October 2017, Finland was the first EU country to put a national AI strategy into writing. In a second report released in June 2018, the government estimated that around 1 million of its population would eventually need to update their AI skills.
Helsinki's next and final strategy report, due to be published in April, will spell out how to bring small and mid-size enterprises across the country on board ""who have no idea at this point that their future has to do with AI,"" said Ilona Lundström, a director general at Finland’s economy ministry and the key architect behind Helsinki’s national plan for AI.
At the same time, Finland plans to partner up with bordering Estonia and Sweden to become Europe’s No. 1 “laboratory” for AI test trials, she said. And the country wants to use its voice in the European Union, where it is set to take over the council presidency this summer, to lobby for loosening some regulation.

“We are using AI as the flagship project for a bigger kind of setup of themes of digitalization"" — Ilona Lundström, a director general at Finland’s economy ministry
""The old churches used to have a person who’s waking up everybody who is falling asleep while listening to the preacher,"" Lundström said. “Our role is to have the stick and kind of poke people and tell them 'Stay alert, stay awake, be focused and get forward.'”
Helsinki's plan includes pushing for “sandbox environments” to test AI technology across borders. The country is looking at experiments with neighbors to the west and the south, such as cross-border trials in autonomous shipping on the Baltic sea between Finnish or Swedish ports or an experiment to merge some of Finland’s and Estonia’s digital infrastructure.
At the same time, the grassroots AI campaign at home is supposed to have effects that go far beyond artificial intelligence, officials said.
“We are using AI as the flagship project for a bigger kind of setup of themes of digitalization,” Lundström said.

“If you talk about digitalization at large in the same manner, nothing happens. But if you take a special approach like artificial intelligence, things start to move.""

That's been true for dentist Jaana Partanen in Mikkeli.
She has signed up for a course to learn the basics of coding in her hometown, ""the first time they're doing a public programming course here,"" she said.
Computer scientist Roos' team is working on an advanced sequel to the course, which will likely be launched early next summer and require some programming.
Jaana Partanen wants to sign up for it.

Automating government
Getty





Even as artificial intelligence (AI) is forecast to exceed human capabilities across a range of industries it is also predicted to augment human labor. In finance, AI is already helping financial advisors augment financial planning while enhancing investment strategy. And in medicine, AI diagnostics systems have proven to be far more accurate than doctors in diagnosing heart disease and cancerous growths. In fact, McKinsey lists some 400 use cases representing $6 trillion in value across 19 industries in which AI will augment human work.

But what about government? What will the impact of AI be on the nature of government?
Waking Government to AI
 
Not surprisingly much of the public sector has already begun experimenting with AI-driven technologies. At the federal level, many agencies are beginning to deploy AI-powered interfaces for customer service, alongside an expanding use of software to update legacy-systems and automate simple tasks. Growing investments in infrastructure planning, legal adjudication, fraud detection and citizen response systems represent the first phase in the ongoing digitization of government.
PROMOTED
Notwithstanding these investments, however, government remains far behind the private sector in deploying and integrating AI. As Silicon Valley’s Tim O’Reilly has suggested, augmenting government through AI is critical to modernizing the public sector. AI-based applications could potentially reduce backlogs and free workers from mundane tasks while cutting costs. According to Deloitte, documenting and recording information alone consumes a half-billion staff hours each year, at a cost of more than $16 billion in wages. Add to this an additional $15 billion in the procuring and processing of information and the value of AI in transforming government bureaucracy becomes clear.

Some now argue that the affordances of technology are critical to remaking government for the 21st century. Advancing democracies into the era of Big Data could go a long way towards reducing systemic dysfunction within the public sector. Using sensor technologies and machine learning systems to reinforce government oversight could begin to reduce regulation while actually increasing the amount of oversight. Coining the term “algorithmic regulation” for example, O’Reilly suggests that government regulations should be regarded as algorithms (i.e. a set of rules) that can be adjusted based on fresh data.
The most recent advancement in AI— deep learning— represents a revolution in the use of machines for supporting decision-management, forecasting, data classification and the synthesis of information. Building on deep learning tools, AI could mean significantly improving service delivery for citizens and elevating the work of public service professionals while also inspiring a new generation of technocrats to enter government. Alternatively, AI could also mean remaking government altogether.

Digital Leviathan
 

In the United States, demographic polarization and toxic federal politics have stymied needed action on a host of pressing issues including immigration reform, welfare reform, gun control and the country’s overall faith in government and its institutions. More problematically this political polarization lends itself to growing concerns about the very efficacy of democracy itself.
Outside the US, China is clearly pioneering an entirely different model of government. Where Soviet-style central planning led to scarcity and oppression, China's new economic thinking is that Big Data can assist planned economies in shaping markets and potentially leapfrogging democracy. Combining Big Data, sensor technologies and AI, China is introducing a techno-utilitarianism that may well outpace participatory decision-making.
Could China’s model work in other countries and if so what would that mean for democracy? In the West, the growing fear is that China will become a kind of digital autocracy on a scale never previously imagined. Given China’s expanding use of AI and its outsized influence on the developing world, this begs the question: what systems of government are necessary for managing AI driven societies? And what is the potential for exploitation in such a vast system of algorithmic management and control?
Technocracy or Democracy?
 
The worrying question today for many is whether democracy can survive AI. The reality is that disruptive technologies like AI cannot be put back in the box. AI is becoming a mainstream technology that will need to be effectively integrated into 21st century decision-making across all institutions— especially government. In the wake of this digital revolution some functions of government will necessarily be eliminated. But AI will also enable new tools for smart citizenship and open government that can augment democracy. Rather than technocracy or democracy, the answer will likely be a combination of both.
What we do know is that we are leaving the era of centralized systems and top-down decision-making. As Beth Noveck, former head of President Obama's Open Government Initiative explains, representative democracy itself now faces a crisis of legitimacy. The rationale for closed systems of decision-making in which citizen participation is confined to voting or interest group activism belongs to a different era. In an era of networks, we now need tools that bridge algorithms with new forms of collaborative decision-making. Simply put, we need digital democracies that build on the capabilities of AI and Big Data.

Author:Anne SradersJan 3, 2019 11:42 AM ESTiStockArtificial intelligence, or AI, is the use of computer science programming to imitate human thought and action by analyzing data and surroundings, solving or anticipating problems and learning or self-teaching to adapt to a variety of tasks.Chances are, you're exposed to artificial intelligence every day. Whether you're browsing your Facebook 
  (FB)  feed or talking to Apple's 
  (AAPL)  Siri, you're interacting with artificial intelligence. And artificial intelligence has been the cause of many of the technological breakthroughs in the past several years - from robots to Tesla 
  (TSLA)  . But while there are certainly naysayers to the technological development, AI seems set to become the future of predictive tech. But, what actually is artificial intelligence, and how does it work? Better still, how is AI being used in 2019? The Future of Vacation PlanningWhat Is Artificial Intelligence? Coined in 1955 by John McCarthy as ""the science and engineering of making intelligent machines,"" artificial intelligence (or AI) is software that is able to use and analyze data, algorithms and programming to perform actions, anticipate problems and learn to adapt to a variety of circumstances with and without supervision. AI is generally broken down into specialized or general and strong or weak AI, depending on its applications. Generally, there are three main divisions of AI - neural networks, machine learning and deep learning. Neural networks (often called artificial neural networks, or ANN) essentially mimic biological neural networks by ""modeling and processing nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs in parallel."" Machine learning generally uses statistics and data to help improve machine functions, while deep learning computes multi-layer neural networks for more advanced learning. The original seven aspects of AI, named by McCarthy and others at the Dartmouth Conference in 1955, include automatic computers, programming AI to use language, hypothetical neuron nets to be used to form concepts, measuring problem complexity, self-improvement, abstractions, and randomness and creativity.How Does Artificial Intelligence Work? So, how does AI actually work? Well, for starters, there are different kinds of AI that operate differently. And while AI is generally a blanket term for these different kinds of functions, there are several different kinds of AI that are programmed for different purposes - including weak and strong AI, specialized and general AI, and other software.Strong vs. Weak AIOn a basic level, the difference between strong and weak AI is supervision. Weak AI is designed to be supervised programming that is a simulation of human thought and interaction - but is ultimately a set of programmed responses or supervised interactions that are merely human-like. Siri and Alexa are a good example of weak AI, because, while they seemingly interact and think like humans when asked questions or to perform tasks, their responses are programmed and they are ultimately assessing which response is appropriate from their bank of responses. For this reason, weak AI like Siri or Alexa don't necessarily understand the true meaning of their commands, merely that they comprehend key words or commands and their algorithms match them up with an action.On the other hand, strong AI is largely unsupervised and uses more clustered or association data processing. Instead of having programmed solutions or responses to problems, strong AI is unsupervised in its problem-solving process. Strong AI is typically known for being able to ""teach"" itself things - for example, strong AI is used to teach itself games and learn to anticipate moves. Even as far back as 2013, AI taught itself Atari 
  (PONGF)  games and ended up beating records and even surpassed humans in several different games. But apart from games, strong AI is commonly associated with the ""scary"" robots and machines that most often plague the public's nightmares of how dangerous AI could be. However, on a basic level, unsupervised learning goes into problems without any pre-programmed answers, and is able to use a mixture of logic and trial and error to learn the answers or categorize things. This is often demonstrated in exercises where strong AI is shown images with colors and shapes and is supposed to categorize and organize them. Specialized vs. General AIBut apart from supervision, there are different functions of AI.Specialized AI is AI that is programmed to perform a specific task. Its programming is meant to be able to learn to perform a certain task - not multiple. For example, from self-driving cars to predictive news feeds, specialized AI has been the dominant form of AI since its inception (although this is rapidly changing). On the other hand, general AI isn't limited to one specific task - it is able to learn and complete numerous different tasks and functions. In general, much of the cutting-edge, boundary-pushing AI developments of recent years have been general AI - which are focused on learning and using unsupervised programming to solve problems for a variety of tasks and circumstances. UsesAs far as its uses go, AI is potentially boundless.However, AI has been leveraged for a variety of industries and purposes.In business, AI has had considerable success in customer service and other business operations. AI has been used in business for various purposes including process automation (by transferring email and call data into record systems, helping resolve billing issues and updating records), cognitive insight (for predicting a buyer's preferences on sites, personalizing advertising and protecting against fraud) and cognitive engagement (used primarily in a customer service capacity to provide 24/7 service and even answers to employee questions regarding internal operations). In fact, 2017 studies show that 45% of people ""prefer chatbots as the primary mode of communication for customer service activities."" For the 2016 year, the global chatbot market was reportedly worth $190.8 million - and could potentially comprise about 25% of customer service interactions by 2020, according to Gartner 
  (IT)  . In addition to its involvement in customer service and business, AI has also been used in recent years for writing news stories. Especially for formulaic articles like earnings reports or sports statistics, AI has increasingly been used to automatically write stories and fill in different data. This technology has been employed by the likes of The Wall Street Journal.""You get these news releases about things that are happening in sports, for example, or in business. But people are not creating these pieces anymore. It's actually A.I. that's releasing this information,"" Stephen Ibaraki, founder and chairman of the UN ITU AI For Good Global Summit with XPRIZE Foundation told Neil Sahota for Forbes this year. ""Lots of us are spending hours on our mobile phones reading updates about events and news flashes never realizing it's A.I. that's generating this stuff now.""And it seems as though AI is even integrating into education.Yi Wang, chairman and CEO of LAIX 
 undefined , a Chinese-based company teaching various languages using AI, told TheStreet back in September that ""we want everyone to become global citizens."" Artificial Intelligence ExamplesIt may come as a surprise that artificial intelligence is all around us - and has even permeated our routine on a daily basis. Whether on our phones or at the cutting edge of technological development, artificial intelligence is all around.Siri/AlexaWhether or not you've thought about that voice in your phone as a product of AI or not, Apple's Siri and Amazon's 
  (AMZN)   Alexa both use AI to help you complete tasks or answer questions on your mobile devices.As examples of weak AI, Siri and Alexa are programmed with responses and actions based on commands or questions posed to them by the phone owner. Facebook FeedBelieve it or not, your Facebook feed is actually using AI to predict what content you want to see and push it higher. Algorithms built into the feeds filter content that is most likely to be of interest to the particular Facebook user and predict what they will want to see. TeslaDespite its founder (the ever-eccentric Elon Musk) being vocally suspicious of advanced AI technology, Tesla's electronic cars use a variety of AI - including self-driving capacities. Tesla also uses crowd-sourced data from its vehicles to improve their systems.  NetflixYes, while you are chilling on your couch with some Netflix (NFLX)  , you are reaping the benefits of AI technology.The media streaming site uses advanced predictive technology to suggest shows based on your viewing preferences or rating. And while the data currently seems to favor bigger, more popular films over smaller ones, it is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Still, how did AI get from a futuristic technology to part of our daily lives?  History of Artificial IntelligenceAlthough it is widely known for being cutting edge, the processes and concepts behind AI have been around for a while. In fact, according to Bernard Marr, a best-selling author and Forbes contributor,""the theory and the fundamental computer science which makes it possible has been around for decades.""So, how did AI get started, and how has it progressed?As far back as the mid 1600s, French scientist and philosopher Rene Descartes hypothesized about two divisions - machines that could one day think and learn a specific task, and those that could adapt to perform a variety of different tasks as humans do. These two veins were later called specialized and general AI.The so-called Turing Test, proposed in 1950 by English mathematician Alan M. Turing, attempted to determine when a computer could actually think. The test predicted that, by 2000, AI computers would be able to be nearly indistinguishable from humans after interrogation, although this test has never been ""passed."" By 1955, the Dartmouth Conference (or the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence) developed some of the first concepts of AI. Spurred on by Dartmouth College professor John McCarthy, AI was given a comprehensive definition, and other concepts like machine learning, language processing and neural networks were hypothesized and introduced. In 1966, ELIZA, the first chatbot, was developed at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum and is the predecessor of the likes of Siri and Alexa. Although ELIZA didn't actually speak (and communicated via text instead), the technology was the first that was developed to relay messages in language (or natural language processing) as opposed to using computer code and programming. AI moved from a largely cutting-edge technological development to useful applications in business by 1980, when Digital Equipment Corporation's XCON was able to save the company around $40 million in 1986 through its learning system. And after the development of the internet in the early 1990s, the sharing of data across the web only increased AI's capabilities. By 1997, Deep Blue - IBM's 
  (IBM)  supercomputer - beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov through a variety of calculations, and indicated that AI was developing to possibly best humans.  But apart from games, AI was developing to operate automobiles as well. The 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge put the prowess of automated vehicles on display as they raced a course in the Mojave desert. And just six years later, IBM's cognitive computing engine Watson beat Jeopardy's champion, winning the $1 million prize money - further indicating AI's capabilities in successfully navigating language-based problems. Still, it wasn't until 2012 that the full capabilities of AI were beginning to be understood. The research paper Building High-Level Features Using Large Scale Unsupervised Learning was published in 2012 by researchers at Google 
  (GOOGL)  and Stanford, and explained advances in unsupervised learning through deep neural networks that allowed AI to learn to recognize different pictures of cats without labeling the pictures. This breakthrough was progressed further in 2015, when researchers officially declared that computers were better at recognizing images than humans following the ImageNet challenge. The challenge had computers identify 1,000 objects.In 2016, Google subsidiary Deep Mind's AlphaGo software was able to beat Go world champion Lee Sedol over the course of five matches. The defeat was more impressive than AI's previous superiority in chess because Go has over 100,000 potential opening moves, and it forced AlphaGo to use neural networks to learn the game and defeat its opponent. The defeat marked an astonishing breakthrough that demonstrated AI's ability to learn on its own. However, one of AI's most recent and promising applications has been with self-driving cars, released in 2018. Google spin-off Waymo released self-driving taxi service in Phoenix called Waymo One - which is reportedly used by around 400 citizens. Artificial Intelligence News in 2019 So, what's happening with AI in 2019? AI and Elon MuskSurprisingly, Musk has been one of the most vocal criticizers of advanced AI technology - despite owning a company, OpenAI, dedicated to AI research. Musk's co-founded company researches ways to responsibly and safely progress AI technology - which Musk sees as imperative. The Tesla CEO recently claimed in a documentary ""Do You Trust This Computer?"" that super computers could become ""an immortal dictator from which we would never escape.""However, Zia Chishti, chairman and CEO of AI firm Afiniti, told TheStreet earlier this year that the hype over the dangers of AI may be overblown.""AI is just a way to identify patterns in complex fields, it's not going to nuke the world -- there is no chance of that. I think the visions of the impending apocalypse as a result of robot intelligence is fanciful -- so I wouldn't be overly concerned about Elon Musk's perspective on it,"" Chishti said. Korean Killer RobotsStill, Musk's warnings may be somewhat warranted.Recent reports claim that South Korean university Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has partnered with a defense company to create ""killer robots."" Some 50 academics reportedly signed a letter calling for a boycott of KAIST and Hanwha Systems amid concerns of an arms race. ""There are plenty of great things you can do with AI that save lives, including in a military context, but to openly declare the goal is to develop autonomous weapons and have a partner like this sparks huge concern,"" Toby Walsh, professor at University of New South Wales and organizer of the boycott, told The Guardian earlier this year. Concerns over the development of ""killer robots"" and AI weapons remains a concern going into 2019. The Sex Robot DisruptionHowever, on the opposite side of the spectrum, disruption is seemingly occurring in a rather unusual market - sex dolls.Matt McMullen, CEO of Realbotix and RealDoll and creator of the sex robot, Harmony, set out to incorporate AI technology with sex dolls to create an altogether eerily human-like robot. ""I like building this robot and seeing it move and talk and interact with people, what it does to them. It just opens up Pandora's box of psychology and science, "" McMullen told Forbes earlier this year. ""It's been evident that when you are using a very lifelike robot as a conduit for the AI and for the conversation, people tend to talk to that in a different way than they would, say, something on a computer screen. Putting that device in someone's home where they're relaxed and they're in their own environment creates another level of comfort.""Still, concerns over the implications of these AI, life-like dolls - especially in relation to intimacy issues and mental health - are rampant. Among many others, one such opponent of AI-partnered sex robots is Kathleen Richardson, professor of Ethics and Culture of Robots and AI at De Montfort University in Leicester, England.""Basically, to say a relationship doesn't need to involve another human being, ... We're living in a culture where we have a surplus of human beings, we don't have any problems with the amount of human beings that we have in the world, but we're creating this culture and this climate where we're trying to encourage people to form relationships with commercial goods, basically,"" Richardson told Forbes in September.And while many of the recent AI developments have been blanketed in controversy, innovators continue to push the boundaries.""The individual in question who finds this happiness with an AI-driven robot, and finds intimacy that they never had with another person-whose job does it become to intervene and say, 'no, you can't do that. That's not right,'"" McMullen questioned.AI and Counseling? Still, in a slightly less controversial vein, AI has made recent strides in the field of mental health and counseling. Woebot, an intelligent software application, is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and even charities are considering using the technology to help meet demands for counseling, according to The Guardian. For those like Aidan Jones, the chief executive of Relate, a relationship counseling charity, ""we have to start to look at what can be done with a non-human interaction,"" Jones told The Times.Woebot uses what's called cognitive behavioral therapy (or CBT) to help counsel users. The company released an iOS app in January, offering a texting-based service.""The Woebot experience doesn't map onto what we know to be a human-to-computer relationship, and it doesn't map onto what we know to be a human-to-human relationship either,"" Alison Darcy, a clinical psychologist at Stanford University and creator of Woebot told Business Insider in January. ""It seems to be something in the middle.""AI ExportsMost recently, Silicon Valley is reportedly concerned over the possibility of regulators curbing exports of AI technology from the U.S., according to The New York Times.The Commerce Department allegedly named artificial intelligence as an item that would be re-evaluated under new export rules designed to increase national security. The principle concern seems to revolve around how exports of AI may boost the industries in other countries like China, potentially to the detriment of the U.S.""The number of cases where exports can be sufficiently controlled are very, very, very small, and the chance of making an error is quite large,"" Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, told The New York Times. ""If this goes wrong, it could do real damage to the A.I. community.""Still, it appears that, with every innovation in AI, new concerns over ethics, economics and safety seem to progress with them. By Anne SradersLatest from TheStreet Pro:TheStreet ProWith Trump Victory a Foregone Conclusion, Expect a Rate Cut in SeptemberBy Bob Byrne42 minutes agoTheStreet ProAMZNWMTTGTPrime Time for Amazon, J.D.

AI Will Create Millions More Jobs Than It Will Destroy. Here’s How



By Byron Reese
January 1, 2019 







In the past few years, artificial intelligence has advanced so quickly that it now seems hardly a month goes by without a newsworthy AI breakthrough. In areas as wide-ranging as speech translation, medical diagnosis, and gameplay, we have seen computers outperform humans in startling ways.
This has sparked a discussion about how AI will impact employment. Some fear that as AI improves, it will supplant workers, creating an ever-growing pool of unemployable humans who cannot compete economically with machines.
This concern, while understandable, is unfounded. In fact, AI will be the greatest job engine the world has ever seen.
New Technology Isn’t a New Phenomenon
On the one hand, those who predict massive job loss from AI can be excused. It is easier to see existing jobs disrupted by new technology than to envision what new jobs the technology will enable.
But on the other hand, radical technological advances aren’t a new phenomenon. Technology has progressed nonstop for 250 years, and in the US unemployment has stayed between 5 to 10 percent for almost all that time, even when radical new technologies like steam power and electricity came on the scene.
But you don’t have to look back to steam, or even electricity. Just look at the internet. Go back 25 years, well within the memory of today’s pessimistic prognosticators, to 1993. The web browser Mosaic had just been released, and the phrase “surfing the web,” that most mixed of metaphors, was just a few months old.
If someone had asked you what would be the result of connecting a couple billion computers into a giant network with common protocols, you might have predicted that email would cause us to mail fewer letters, and the web might cause us to read fewer newspapers and perhaps even do our shopping online. If you were particularly farsighted, you might have speculated that travel agents and stockbrokers would be adversely affected by this technology. And based on those surmises, you might have thought the internet would destroy jobs.
But now we know what really happened. The obvious changes did occur. But a slew of unexpected changes happened as well. We got thousands of new companies worth trillions of dollars. We bettered the lot of virtually everyone on the planet touched by the technology. Dozens of new careers emerged, from web designer to data scientist to online marketer. The cost of starting a business with worldwide reach plummeted, and the cost of communicating with customers and leads went to nearly zero. Vast storehouses of information were made freely available and used by entrepreneurs around the globe to build new kinds of businesses.
But yes, we mail fewer letters and buy fewer newspapers.
The Rise of Artificial Intelligence
Then along came a new, even bigger technology: artificial intelligence. You hear the same refrain: “It will destroy jobs.”
Consider the ATM. If you had to point to a technology that looked as though it would replace people, the ATM might look like a good bet; it is, after all, an automated teller machine. And yet, there are more tellers now than when ATMs were widely released. How can this be? Simple: ATMs lowered the cost of opening bank branches, and banks responded by opening more, which required hiring more tellers.
In this manner, AI will create millions of jobs that are far beyond our ability to imagine. For instance, AI is becoming adept at language translation—and according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for human translators is skyrocketing. Why? If the cost of basic translation drops to nearly zero, the cost of doing business with those who speak other languages falls. Thus, it emboldens companies to do more business overseas, creating more work for human translators. AI may do the simple translations, but humans are needed for the nuanced kind.
In fact, the BLS forecasts faster-than-average job growth in many occupations that AI is expected to impact: accountants, forensic scientists, geological technicians, technical writers, MRI operators, dietitians, financial specialists, web developers, loan officers, medical secretaries, and customer service representatives, to name a very few. These fields will not experience job growth in spite of AI, but through it.
But just as with the internet, the real gains in jobs will come from places where our imaginations cannot yet take us.
Parsing Pessimism
You may recall waking up one morning to the news that “47 percent of jobs will be lost to technology.”
That report by Carl Frey and Michael Osborne is a fine piece of work, but readers and the media distorted their 47 percent number. What the authors actually said is that some functions within 47 percent of jobs will be automated, not that 47 percent of jobs will disappear.
Frey and Osborne go on to rank occupations by “probability of computerization” and give the following jobs a 65 percent or higher probability: social science research assistants, atmospheric and space scientists, and pharmacy aides. So what does this mean? Social science professors will no longer have research assistants? Of course they will. They will just do different things because much of what they do today will be automated.
The intergovernmental Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development released a report of their own in 2016. This report, titled “The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries,” applies a different “whole occupations” methodology and puts the share of jobs potentially lost to computerization at nine percent. That is normal churn for the economy.
But what of the skills gap? Will AI eliminate low-skilled workers and create high-skilled job opportunities? The relevant question is whether most people can do a job that’s just a little more complicated than the one they currently have. This is exactly what happened with the industrial revolution; farmers became factory workers, factory workers became factory managers, and so on.
Embracing AI in the Workplace
A January 2018 Accenture report titled “Reworking the Revolution” estimates that new applications of AI combined with human collaboration could boost employment worldwide as much as 10 percent by 2020.
Electricity changed the world, as did mechanical power, as did the assembly line. No one can reasonably claim that we would be better off without those technologies. Each of them bettered our lives, created jobs, and raised wages. AI will be bigger than electricity, bigger than mechanization, bigger than anything that has come before it.
This is how free economies work, and why we have never run out of jobs due to automation. There are not a fixed number of jobs that automation steals one by one, resulting in progressively more unemployment. There are as many jobs in the world as there are buyers and sellers of labor.

The streets were full of horses and carts. Life expectancy for someone born that year was just 41. Wind forward to 1962 and working conditions had greatly improved. The streets were full of cars and trucks and the jet age had begun. Life expectancy had nearly doubled, to 71.The year 2062 – when it’s estimated that computers will become as intelligent as us – may well be a similarly optimistic time.
The price of basic goods should have fallen dramatically, as they’ll be produced by more efficient ­machines. Poverty could be a distant memory, if we share the wealth created by robots that never sleep.If you’ve been enjoying a long Christmas holiday and are wishing you didn’t have to go back to work tomorrow, consider this: by 2062, technological advances may have resulted in weekends lasting four or five days.But with some leading economists worrying that many jobs are simply going to disappear by 2062, with little or none of the income sharing needed to make up for this, will the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in fact leave lots of people behind?Akin Robotics is one of the first humanoid robotics factories to start mass production. Its creations are programmed to work in shopping centres, airports, hospitals and homes (Photo: Chris McGrath/Getty Images)Should we be worried?Economists have been making predictions about industrial advances causing job losses for decades. Back in 1930, for example, John Maynard Keynes warned about “technological unemployment”. Yet joblessness today is at historically low levels in most countries, despite the world’s population being bigger than ever.Work hasn’t ended – indeed, many of us seem to be spending more and more time doing it.Modern fears about future job displacement can be traced to a 2013 study on the impact of automation, by Carl Frey and Michael Osborne at Oxford University. This made a much-quoted prediction that 47 per cent of jobs in the US  were under threat of automation over the next two decades, a figure that would surely be very similar in the UK.Since that report – which ironically used machine learning to predict which of over 700 different jobs could be automated – Andy Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England, predicted in November 2015 that around half of all jobs in the UK were at risk of automation.And in October 2016 Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, predicted that 69 per cent of jobs in India and 77 per cent of jobs in China are  at risk.Robots made to produce the Mini Cooper at BMW’s plant at Cowley in Oxford (Photo: ANDREW COWIE/AFP/Getty Images)Which jobs are really at risk?Frey and Osborne found a 94 per cent probability that a bicycle repair job will be automated in the next two decades. But bikes are fiddly objects to repair and have lots of non-standard parts. It would require a very expensive robot for a job that isn’t well paid, so it will not be economically viable.Added to this, being a bicycle repair person is a social job. It’s about talking to the customer, selling them the latest kit, offering tips on good places to ride. It’s not just about repairing bikes. Frey and Osborne didn’t take factors  like these into account.Bicycle repair is one job that may be beyond a machine (Photo: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images)Their study also found a 55 per cent probability that a commercial pilot will be automated in the next two decades. From a technical perspective, we can already automate much of this job today. Yet that 55 per cent figure seems unlikely; Boeing predicts that over 600,000 new pilots will be needed during that time.Another prediction is that there’s a 98 per cent probability that fashion models will disappear in the next two decades. Are we really going to replace human pouts, hip-swaying and swagger with robotic catwalk performers? We don’t want to know what  clothes look like on a robot, but on a person. And robots aren’t going to be walking in high heels anytime soon.It’s also surely too blunt to say many whole job types will cease to exist. Frey and Osborne classified “accountant and auditor” as being at risk. They are certainly parts of these that will be automated, but I doubt the job will cease to exist.
Fast facts: automation and jobs
A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2017 analysed the impact of automation in the US between 1993 and 2007. It found that on average, every new robot replaced around 5.6 workers – and offsetting gains were not observed in other occupations.
It estimated that every additional robot per 1,000 workers reduced the total population in employment in the US by 0.34 per cent.
Automation also put pressure on the jobs that remained. Every additional robot per 1,000 workers reduced wages by 0.5 per cent.
The number of industrial robots in the US quadrupled, eliminating an estimated half a million jobs.Toby Walsh is Scientia Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of New South Wales in Australia (Photo: La Trobe University Press)Some roles are starting to be automated without being replaced by jobs elsewhere, such as in the oil industry. The price of oil collapsed from $115 per barrel in August  2014 to below $30 at the start of 2016. This drove the industry to decrease headcount and introduce more automation.Nearly half a million jobs disappeared from the oil industry worldwide. But now, as the price of oil is rebounding, and the industry is growing, fewer than half of those jobs have returned. ­Automation has reduced 20 people typically working at a well to just five.The developing world  may suffer, however. Globalisation outsourced many jobs from rich economies to poorer ones, such as call centres relocating to India and factories in the Far East serving the West. These trends may now start to reverse. The improved efficiencies that AI and robotics will bring may shift many of these jobs back to the developed world.Industrial robots weld parts of chassis of the Volkswagen Golf 7 model in Wolfsburg, Germany (Photo: RONNY HARTMANN/AFP/Getty Images)How can businesses survive?The music business suggests how some industries might adapt. ­Digital music hasn’t resulted in fewer human musicians. Indeed, the demand for musicians is predicted to increase modestly in the next decade. Also, many musicians now make more money from performance than from recording. We value experiences, hearing our musical idols in person.Even supposing the prediction that 47 per cent of jobs are at risk of automation proves to be accurate, that would not translate  into 47 per cent unemployment. There will be many new jobs created by technology.Just look at the industrial revolution. Before then, most people worked in agriculture or as craftspeople. Many of these jobs became mechanised – but new ones were created in offices and factories.Some people suggest that “robot repair person” will be one of the new jobs. I am entirely unconvinced by this example, ­however. The thousands of people who used  to paint and weld in car factories got replaced by only a couple of robot repair people. There’s also no reason why robots won’t be able to repair other robots. We already have factories where robots make robots. There are even “dark factories” – which have no people and so no need for lights – in which robots work night and day building other robots.The Japanese company FANUC, one of the largest manufacturers of industrial robots, has operated one of these near Mount Fuji since 2001, helping the firm achieve annual sales of around $6bn (£4.7bn).Akin robots are able to speak, recognise faces, use the internet and process what they see, hear and smell (Photo: Chris McGrath/Getty Images)Can I have a four-day weekend?To avoid 47 per cent unemployment, we might just work a shorter week. That was  the case during the industrial revolution.
Before then, many of us would wake up with the sun, go out into the fields and work till the sun went down, and then go to bed. Many worked around 60 hours per week. After the industrial revolution, work was reduced to around 40 hours per week for most people. Some of us even got a few weeks of holiday each year.The same could happen with the AI revolution. We could shorten the working day. Or we could have a three-day or four-day weekend.However, this would require some of the wealth generated by increasing productivity to be shared around, and there is little evidence this is  starting to happen. Indeed, the opposite seems to be the case. Wage growth for most workers in developed economies has stopped, or is failing to keep up with the limited inflation we now experience.There is an argument that we could afford to work less, as more efficient machines will make many of life’s essentials cheaper. So we might not need wage growth in order to work less. We could therefore – in theory, at least – live on less.Audi’s electric engine assembly line in Gyor, Hungary (Photo: Laszlo Balogh/Getty Images)Who will be the first to suffer?In the developed world, the canaries in the coal mine are likely to be drivers of taxis, trucks and delivery vehicles.There will be benefits to this. Around 95 per cent of road deaths are caused by driver error. The sooner we replace human drivers with reliable computers, the better. Around three-quarters of the cost of transporting goods by truck are the labour. But an autonomous truck will not need to take breaks so can drive for twice as long, at nearly one-quarter the cost. That’s roughly an eightfold increase in productivity.For lorry drivers, the transition might be relatively painless. In Australia, for example, the average age of a lorry driver is 47. In a decade or so, many  will retire, their jobs being taken by automated trucks. Young people will simply not enter the profession.But for taxi drivers, change might be quicker and more painful. One of the newest jobs on the planet – being an Uber driver – might also be one of the shortest-lived.Robots at the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US Warren Stamping Plant (Photo: Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)How should we prepare?One way to keep ahead of the machines will be to learn new skills as new technologies are invented. Learning will need to be lifelong.We will also need to consider large changes to our educational system. Greater emphasis on Stem subjects (science, ­technology, engineering and mathematics) is definitely not the  answer. There will be only a limited demand for computer programmers; indeed, when AI succeeds, much of the programming will be done by the computers themselves.Humans will instead need strong analytical skills. They will need emotional and social intelligence. And they will need all the other traits that makes us human, such as creativity, resilience, determination and curiosity.By 2062 machines will probably be superhuman, so it’s hard to imagine any job in which we will remain superior. This means the only jobs left will be those in which we prefer people to be doing the work.Stilton cheese is made by humans – and long may it continue that way (Photo: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images)The AI  revolution will be about rediscovering the things that make us human. This is a reason why it might be called the Second Renaissance. We will be rediscovering our humanity.By 2062, machines will be able to write plays to rival Shakespeare’s Macbeth. To paint works as provocative as Picasso’s Guernica. And to compose music as beautiful as that of Beethoven. But we’ll still prefer works produced by human artists. These works will speak to the human experience, which a robot can never feel.There will be plenty of artisan jobs we value, too. Brewing craft beer. Making cheese. Growing organic  wine. Throwing pottery by hand. We will buy the hand-carved wooden bowl over the cheaper, more perfect machine-made one.We still appreciate handmade goods (Photo: FETHI BELAID/AFP/Getty Images)As social animals, we will also increasingly appreciate and value social interactions with other humans. Barristas will be pushing buttons on computer-controlled coffee machines that make ­perfect coffee every time, but we’ll still line up to have a human make us coffee for the chitchat. For the smile and the human experience.We will still prefer a human sales assistant to help us choose a dress. A human doctor to deliver bad news about our blood test. A human barman to  pour us a glass of whisky and offer a consoling word. A human coach to help get us fit. And a human judge to pass sentence in our courts.The most important human traits in 2062 will be our social and emotional intelligence, as well as our artistic and artisan skills.The irony is that our technological future will not be about technology, but about our humanity. And the jobs of the future are the most human ones.This is an edited excerpt from ‘2062: The World That AI Made’ by Toby Walsh (£14.95, La Trobe University Press), out now",,,,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071'}, 'author': {'name': 'Toby Walsh', '@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#/schema/person/05be1204e85ee70e56668f58ea84ffc4', 'url': 'https://inews.co.uk/author/toby-walsh'}, 'headline': 'Will automation and AI give us four-day weekends &#8211; or simply leave us without jobs?', 'datePublished': '2019-01-01T06:00:54+00:00', 'dateModified': '2020-10-07T20:00:56+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071'}, 'wordCount': 2321, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#organization'}, 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#/schema/ImageObject/23f6d45d8ea8d8d92b814126384530a82a9c307e', 'url': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064297506-e1546272992472.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064297506-e1546272992472.jpg', 'width': 960, 'height': 640}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064297506-e1546272992472.jpg', 'keywords': ['Artificial Intelligence', 'Features', 'Jobs', 'Robots', 'Work'], 'articleSection': ['Long Reads', 'Technology'], 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071', 'url': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071', 'name': 'Will robots and AI give us four-day weekends - or leave us without jobs?', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#website', 'type': 'WebSite'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/artificial-intelligence-robots-machines-jobs-work-ai-automation-241071#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064297506-e1546272992472.jpg', 'datePublished': '2019-01-01T06:00:54+00:00', 'dateModified': '2020-10-07T20:00:56+00:00', 'description': 'Smart machines could give us all lives of leisure in future – or they may simply leave us without any wages.

Introduction
The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) — from artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), through artificial general intelligence (AGI), to artificial superintelligence (ASI) — is on its way to changing everything. It's expected that soon, artificial intelligence will combine the intricacy and pattern recognition strength of human intelligence with the speed, memory and knowledge sharing of machine intelligence.

As the rise of AI continues, AI is challenging and changing not only the way humans live, learn and work, but also how entities across nations: its government, industries, organizations, and academia (NGIOA) construct their commercial and economic industries and markets. With this technology-driven growth of artificial intelligence, the need to do most manual, mathematical and mundane work is already in decline and will likely be greatly diminished in the coming years. Moreover, with all these new digital assistants and decision-making algorithms assisting and directing humans, more complex day-to-day work for humans is being greatly lessened.
While attempts to create artificial intelligence have fueled many applications and technological advances, it's fundamentally the increased processing capabilities that have made it possible to design intelligent machines that can rapidly compute and make intelligent implications from diverse data inputs. Despite these rapid advances in processing capabilities, human-like artificial intelligence, however, remains hard to determine—as it still requires further understanding of how to replicate human brain performance and processing in computers. While many computer scientists believe that mimicking the processing method of the human brain will be the key to achieving human-like artificial intelligence, that alone is perhaps not enough, and many other variables will need to be evaluated, like memory and conscience.
PROMOTED
Moreover, since current computer processing systems are not effectively able to process the massive amounts of diverse data and information required to achieve human brain-like processing power, there is perhaps a need for developing a fundamentally new computing system and new computing hardware and software infrastructures that are mathematically correct, adaptable, energy independent and secure.

Towards Artificial Super Intelligence
The potential development of artificial superintelligence points to a frankly scary scenario in the coming years. Eventually, the processing power of the human brain may not be able to match that of ASI, and the risk manager in each one of us must begin thinking about the risks that arise from a situation in which humans are competing -- rather than collaborating -- with AI.
These risks to natural human intelligence are compounded when one remembers that AI will reach a point where it will be able to improve its own software design and capabilities far beyond what its designers envisioned. Already, AI researchers are working to develop this ability for self-improvement in more benign situations, such as photo recognition and games. Admittedly, hardware would likely also need to be evolving simultaneously, but this potentially exponential growth in AI warrants greater caution.

These fears are heightened by the reports emerging about how the structure of the adult human brain changes when a new cognitive or motor skill, including vocabulary, is learned. As a result, there is a growing concern that when AI takes over most human tasks and intelligence work, this may change the level of human intelligence and the nature of natural human intelligence as well. If the human brain is not allowed the opportunities to learn new skills, how will its development suffer? That brings us to the question:
Enhance Human Intelligence or Artificial Intelligence?
Natural human intelligence has always seemed to be one of humanity's greatest weapons against its enemies. Therefore, as artificial intelligence matches and surpasses human intelligence, the question is whether natural intelligence will be able to compete with artificial intelligence in the coming years.
The answer to this question will define the future of humanity, as at some point, when and if artificial intelligence becomes an enemy to humankind, natural human intelligence may or may not be enough to defeat artificial intelligence. So, although artificial intelligence is becoming more and more a part of our everyday lives, the question everyone across nations needs to evaluate today is whether our efforts should be towards enhancing human intelligence or artificial intelligence.
So, what can humans do as a species to proactively plan against that scenario? In the below video, I interviewed Prof. Risto Ilmoniemi, Head of the Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, Aalto University School of Science, Finland.  They need to focus on the science of intelligence. Risk Group initiated this much-needed discussion on the Science of Intelligence on Risk Roundup.

About Human Intelligence
From the beginning of human time, the power of imagination has helped humans explore the unknown, evolve and change the world. As seen over the years, humans have fundamentally transformed geospace with ideas, imagination, and innovation, and that same power of imagination will likely help humans explore the unknown of cyberspace, space and the spaces we haven’t even defined yet, and thereby change the realities of the human ecosystem in the coming years. Imagination has always been an indicator of human intelligence. In fact, imagination is a creative power that is necessary for inventions in cyberspace, geospace, and space (CGS)—and the same power of imagination is driving scientists today to better understand human intelligence.
From what is known about humans, natural intelligence evolution has proceeded by natural selection -- from random mutations -- and by a greater societal emphasis on education and learning. Some studies indicate that heritability (genes) may account for up to 50 percent of intelligence levels; and the role of the environment (education, environment, experience, resources, etc.) contribute to the rest. While much about the human brain genome is already decoded, we still don’t have a clear understanding of how exactly to enhance human intelligence. The reason behind this limited understanding is that the human brain is incredibly complex, with a network of perhaps 100 billion neurons that function individually and collectively, and as a result, understanding of the human brain remains difficult.
However, recent research by Joe Tsien and his team from Augusta University in Georgia have speculated that there must be a basic design principle from which human intelligence originates and the brain evolves—and that one simple algorithm can explain human intelligence. So, if the origins of human intelligence are based on a fundamental algorithm, it is necessary to understand and evaluate whether brain computations rely on relatively simple mathematical logic or a more complex process. Moreover, if human intelligence is indeed based on a fundamental mathematical logic, then the current advances in neuroscience and computer science give hope to evolving human intelligence at the speed of AI’s evolution due to exploding processing speed.
Having said that, knowing what determines intelligence is perhaps still the biggest question facing humanity today. Given there are many theories of intelligence, a question that remains is whether intelligence is a single general ability with a single point of origin or a set of many abilities with multiple, complex points of origin.
While there is a growing concern that human intelligence evolution is stagnant, science is now perhaps getting closer to entering a new phase in which it will be possible to change and improve human DNA. While neuroscience still has a long way to go, and this is most likely decades away, these advances in science and technology will almost certainly discover how to modify and enhance natural human intelligence eventually.
Now, irrespective of human intelligence or AI, intelligence is believed by some, such as Joe Tsien and his team from Augusta University in Georgia, to be having a very simple mathematical pattern underlying it. So, in theory, if the information and processes of the human mind can be disassociated from the biological form, it is no longer tied to biological limits such as lifespan or memory lapse and aging processes. Furthermore, information and knowledge stored within a human brain or information within a computer’s memory could then be copied or transferred to one or many other recipients, whether they be digital, robotic or biological.
Although there are many efforts going on across nations to understand the origin of intelligence within the human genome, it remains to be seen how effective gene editing or any other technology can be at influencing intelligence. The time is now to use all available resources for ensuring that this is not the end of the growth of natural human intelligence but rather just the beginning. So, even though, artificial intelligence is becoming more and more a part of our everyday lives, understanding how the human brain produces intelligent and self-aware behavior is still perhaps one of the greatest challenges facing science and technology today
Developing Control
To reach the desired end in intelligence evolution requires an evolution of both natural and artificial intelligence: collective machine intelligence that can help solve complex challenges facing humanity and human intelligence evolution that can be ready to take on artificial intelligence if it goes against humanity. After all, a conscious AI may not have the same priorities and values as does humanity -- who knows if advanced AI will value human life?
Humans have no choice but to learn to think in a new way to survive as a species as artificial intelligence continues to evolve exponentially (and as of now, natural human intelligence remains limited and fixed). It is more important than ever that natural human intelligence evolution also happens simultaneously, and it is within human control and power to make ourselves more intelligent.

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  wikiMany of the pivotal technologies utilized by the public today have their roots in military projects. The internet’s first successful message transfer was due to a U.S. Department of Defense-awarded contract in 1969 for the development of the “ARPANET project.” Global Positioning System (GPS) technology utilized in smartphones today was put in place and created in the 1970s for accurate military positioning, coordination, and tracking.  It follows that keeping abreast with the current applications of artificial intelligence at the top five military defense contractors can be fruitful for business leaders looking for successful examples of the implementation of AI today. These examples could also illuminate the near-term business capabilities of AI in the business world. This article serves to present a broad look at the implementation of AI by the five leading defense contractors in the U.S. as ranked by total revenue. Many of these companies have a number of projects that involve AI, and so we can’t cover all of them. Additionally, with the burgeoning and new field of AI could come a large strategic advantage to those militaries capable of utilizing it over the militaries and governments that struggle to develop it. It would then stand to reason that some of the projects or contracts currently worked on by these top contractors may be highly classified and thus bear limited or no information on them to the public. The US Department of Defense does create and administer such projects, known as Special Access Program (SAP) or black projects. Examples include a project that developed the F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft by Lockheed Martin and the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber by Northrop Grumman. Both of these projects were highly classified and denied as even existing until their public announcement in 1983 and 1997 respectively.  Many of the initiatives outlined in this report reference DARPA. DARPA stands for Defense Advancement Research Projects Agency, and it acts to make investments in innovative technologies to aid the United States military. DARPA has 220 government employees and acts as both a developer and management structure of US military and private sector partnerships for the development of innovative technologies. If defense contractors are hired to work on new US military technology projects, it is likely DARPA is the authority the contractor will answer to for continued renewal of research contracts (or grants) for the US military and the agency granting approval for cutting the check.  In attempts to expedite and streamline the research and development of AI initiatives at the US Department of Defense (DoD), the DoD announced the creation of JAIC (Joint Artificial Intelligence Center) on June 27th, 2018. The project is lead by Dana Deasy, former CIO at JP Morgan Chase and current CIO at the Pentagon. JAIC is essentially a new branch of DARPA, and under DARPA’s administration and budget.  JAIC seems to symbolize DARPA’s newfound prioritization of AI projects for military use. Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan wrote in his memo signifying the creation of JAIC: This effort is a Department priority. Speed and security are of the essence…I expect all offices and personnel to provide all reasonable support necessary to make rapid enterprise-wide AI adoption a reality. We’ll explore the applications of each contractor one-by-one. The top 5 US contractors below have been rank-ordered by their size, starting with Lockheed Martin, the largest. 1. Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) In 2017, Lockheed Martin reported $51 billion in revenue, $35.2 Billion reported from contracts with the US Government. This makes Lockheed Martin the largest contractor for the US military and the largest military contractor in the world. Established in 1995,  Lockheed Martin is a publicly-traded company that employs over 100,000 people. Much of Lockheed Martin’s AI technology research and development is executed by a fully-owned subsidiary company, Advanced Technologies Laboratories (ATL).  Lockheed Martin reported $1.2 billion in research and development spending in 2017, but the company only highlights or alludes to artificial intelligence or machine learning once within their annual report. It reports they “demonstrated an array of remotely piloted and autonomous vehicles for military, civilian, and commercial applications.” Determining Lockheed Martin’s monetary commitments to their programs that involve AI is difficult without inside knowledge; however, we believe a portion of their $1.2 billion dollars in R&D spending is allocated to an autonomous drone initiative and Convoy Active Safety Technology (CAST). The autonomous drone initiative was reported on in our piece entirely on Lockheed Martin’s AI applications for the military. Convoy Active Safety Technology is a system installed on military vehicles designed to make them semi-autonomous. Should soldiers driving in the middle of a convoy suddenly come under enemy fire, the CAST-equipped vehicle can lock-on to the vehicle ahead of it and drive itself using machine vision. This could give the operator in the driver’s seat the opportunity to better defend themselves in the heat of battle. Below is a 1-minute video showing how the CAST system works:  2. The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) In 2017, Boeing Defense, the predominantly non-commercial division of Boeing that focuses on government contracts, reported $29.5 billion in revenue. This makes it the second largest defense contractor for the US military and the world. Boeing, established in 1916,  is a publicly-traded company that employs over 120,000 people. Boeing reported $3.2 billion dollars in research and development spending in 2017. $834 million of that figure was specifically in the Defense, Space & Security category. As detailed in our report on AI at Boeing, Boeing is attempting to pioneer the military use of autonomous craft for sea, space, and air, showcasing ten separate autonomous military sea, space, and air vehicles on their website.  The autonomous vehicle with the most real-world use case is the RQ-21A Blackjack. The Blackjack is intended to have autonomous flight time endurance of 16+ hours per day depending on the configurations of the plane’s tools and payloads. This UAV is Currently flown by Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron 1 and 2 (VMU-1 and VMU-2), supporting expeditionary operations worldwide. Below is a short 3-minute video demonstrating how Blackjack takes off, flies, and lands:  Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on machine vision. Machine vision is a form of artificial intelligence that applies machine learning to labeled images and video data captured by a camera. A more in-depth explanation of how autonomous vehicles work using machine vision can be found in our report on machine vision in the military. On August 1st of 2018, Boeing announced the Boeing Aerospace & Autonomy Center, which will house employees from Boeing and subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences who “will focus on designing, building and flying autonomous aircraft and developing enabling technologies.” 3. General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD) General Dynamics Corp.’s reported total revenue for 2017 was $30.97 billion, making it the third largest US military defense contractor. General Dynamics, founded in 1899, is a publicly-traded company that employs 98,600 people.  Our research yielded very little AI-based initiatives at General Dynamics, although as is the trend in big business today, innovative projects utilizing AI seem to be just taking root at General Dynamics. The company published a press release specifically noting that their 2018 hackathon had an AI innovation theme. Hackathons are multi-day, department-wide events meant to bring together company employees and generate valuable brainstorming, as well as intra-department team building.  Dozens of data scientists, analysts, and programmers formed 11 teams that competed in a series of technical challenges, each designed to stretch skills and expose team members to various machine learning data analytics tools, like Amazon Machine Learning. As teams worked at their tasks, they also had to prevent attacks from an expert “Red Team” that emulated the persistent real-world cyber threats by continuously probing and disrupting their efforts. This seems to be an effective strategy to familiarize data teams with AI tools quickly. That said, the hackathon event was a two-day event and could indicate the general novelty of AI at General Dynamics today.  General Dynamics’s 2017 Annual report mentions their research and development spending as a means “to enhance innovation and bring new products to market, 2017 company-sponsored research and development rose to $521 million from $418 million, the fourth consecutive annual increase.” That said, there is no direct mention of machine learning technologies or innovations within their entire 2017 report.  General Dynamic does appear to partner with other companies utilizing AI. The company seems to have a direct partnership with a company that has a DARPA-sponsored natural language processing software company called Netowl. Netowl has three core machine learning and natural language software. One is a text and image analytics software meant to produce accurate document processing and multi-lingual name matching to aid in border security and counterterrorism. 4. Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) Northrop Grumman Corp. reported total revenue for 2017 was $25.80 billion, making it the fourth largest US military defense contractor in the United States. Northrop Grumman merged in 1994 and is a publicly traded company that employs 70,000 people. Northrop Grumman seems to have the largest focus on artificial intelligence within its annual report, directly mentioning AI and its autonomous aircraft numerous times. Illuminating Northrop Grumman’s focus on AI, “Autonomous systems” is represented as one of Northrop Grumman’s three sections of their aerospace revenue.  $639 million was spent on research and development by Northrop Grumman in 2017, specifically stating a large majority of this $639 million figure was assigned to government programs.  In 2013, Northrop Grumman’s X-47B autonomous aircraft, operating under a DARPA contract, successfully conducted autonomous takeoff and recoveries on an aircraft carrier. Aircraft carrier take-off and landing is considered one of the most challenging feats of piloting for human pilots today. In 2015, the X-47B would later conduct the first autonomous mid-air refueling, as shown in the 2-minute video below. Both of these feats of aviation might show the capability of autonomous aircraft to complete the administrative tasks necessary for an autonomous aircraft wartime deployment.  Northrop Grumman also offers Blue Wasp, a software utilizing artificial intelligence for monitoring and early detection of possible hostile forces.  This is a direct competitor to Raytheon’s PREVENT program. Similar to PREVENT, Blue Wasp catalogues traffic patterns of a monitored seascape and then identifies deviations from those traffic patterns to foreshadow possible coming conflict.  5. Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) Raytheon reported their total revenue for 2017 was $25.35 billion, making it the fifth largest US military defense contractor in the United States. Raytheon, founded in 1989, is a publicly-traded company that employs 64,000 people. In 2017, Raytheon reported $734 million in research and development costs, noting specifically those costs are primarily from US government contracts. Raytheon noted in its annual report that it was working on contracts with DARPA, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and many other military research initiatives. Raytheon seems to be the US defense contractor with the second most attention to artificial intelligence, next to Northrop Grumman. Topics of innovation in AI and computing for AI are referenced at least one time each in their annual report, compared to the other companies in this report which rarely mention AI at all. Raytheon states part of their research initiatives are as follows: To improve the speed and power of computers used in intelligence analytics, we’re testing quantum processing technologies that may hold the keys to advanced encryption technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, and more accurate radars. To meet growing demand for deterrence, we’re pioneering semi-autonomous warfare technologies that bring together warfighters, computers, and robots to speed decision-makingand targeting. Under the Cybersecurity and Special Missions category of the 2017 annual report, Raytheon states “[Cybersecurity and Special Missions] designs and implements…quick-reaction solutions, as well as high-consequence special mission support, for the U.S. Intelligence Community, the DoD, civilian federal agencies.” This could refer to the PREVENT system Raytheon showcased in its 2018 issue of “Technology Today”, a digital magazine detailing Raytheon’s research efforts to the public.   The Raytheon Prevent System   PREVENT detects emergent group threat behaviors by computing and evaluating the normal traffic patterns of a surveyed region. Prevent is able to provide early warning to operators based on this detection to conduct further analysis on the identified participants involved in the irregular activity.

Most developed nations of the world, including China and USA, are investing in research and development projects focused at Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the ways it can influence education system, healthcare, business and financial infrastructure and other systems. AI is the replication of human intelligence processes by machines. Just like a human mind, a true AI system can learn on its own.
Globally, AI is increasingly being considered as important in banking as well as financial services sector leading to the addition of new technologies to the sector. JPMorgan Chase, the top commercial bank in the USA, is investing more than US$9.5 billion annually in technology and innovation. Besides JPMorgan, other American banks like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, CitiBank, US Bank, PNC Bank, Bank of NY Mellon as well as India's top four banks like State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are working to integrate AI with their existing systems so as to improve customer services, reduce costs and improve efficiency.
Chatbots (artificial conversational entity) and conversational interfaces are now the trend as they can inspire enthusiasm and excitement in the banking world.
AI's role in the banking or financial sector more or less revolves around conversations between a human (customer) and a machine-learning agent or artificial assistant. Simply put, the user can chat with an artificial agent through facebook messenger or preferred chatting platforms.
JPMorgan Chase has recently introduced a platform named Contract Intelligence (COiN). This platform can manually review legal documents and contracts by using image recognition software. So, the manual process of analysing 12,000 commercial credit agreements that once took 360,000 hours, can now be completed in seconds thus saving time and efforts.


Similarly, Wells Fargo has developed a new AI platform that they are calling an  AI-driven chatbot through the Facebook Messenger . Bank of America also introduced an intelligent virtual assistant named Eric.
Due to such investments in AI, according to PwC (Pricewater house Coopers) FinTech Trends Report India) 2017, global investment in AI applications reached $5.1 billion from $4.0 billion in 2015.
In India, the State Bank of India (SBI) and HDFC Bank have developed AI-based chatbots for customers named SIA (SBI Intelligent Assistant) and EVA (Electronic Virtual Assistant) respectively.
AI is helping banking sector by providing digital support to customers, who can access these services through their smart phones and other devices. Such banking chatbots have been extremely effective at satisfying customers with required support and information and also bring in new clients for the banks through positive word-of-mouth. Banking chatbots like Kasisto AI (KAI), Personetics Assist, Finn AI, Clinc AI etc. are capable of conversing like a human being via text or voice messages. They can also extract and understand meaning of words or sentences being said or written to them.
AI can also play an important role in fraud detection and prevention. If programmed properly, AI can identify suspicious activities in transaction history and behaviour of individual customers and accountholders. If red flags are detected, then the system can immediately deny such suspicious transactions until they are verified by a human being.
AI also plays a vital role in risk management, marketing and support. AI or machine-learning algorithms can learn from their past actions and hence improve the quality of services. This is why the implementation and integration of AI in the banking sector is the demand of modern banking. Over the next five years, accountholders and customers of banks are going to see an improvement in the quality of conversation with chatbots as they will be able to answer more complex questions. Also, it will be possible for chatbots to converse in more languages other than English.
Recently, a commercial bank in Bangladesh has launched country's first AI-based banking chatbot. Anyone can interact with this chatbot through facebook messenger. It is a digitally interactive system that will respond to set questions from users regarding opening of accounts, credit cards and prepaid cards along with general service information through facebook messenger.
According to a report by the Chinese government think-tank, China Development Research Foundation, several companies in China's export-manufacturing provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Guangdong have cut 30-40 per cent of their workforce as a result of automation over the past three years. Such information can fuel the fear that application of AI in any sector will lead to lay-off of human employees from some areas. This may not be the case with AI in banking. Here, application of AI can make work convenient for the existing workforce.
In Bangladesh, AI can play an effective role in traffic monitoring and management system, national security system, healthcare system, manufacturing and service sectors.
The government of Bangladesh can learn from the steps being taken by governments and corporations in other countries to research and implement AI in different areas of life. AI's operational and analytical benefits can be integrated into the existing systems in a bid to manufacture goods and provide services which will be at par with international standards.
