 Breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence have the potential to bring about sweeping changes to the global economy, according to Goldman Sachs Research. As tools using advances in natural language processing work their way into businesses and society, they could drive a 7% (or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.
 “Despite significant uncertainty around the potential for generative AI, its ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects,” Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani write in a report.

               
        

 A new wave of AI systems may also have a major impact on employment markets around the world. Shifts in workflows triggered by these advances could expose the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs to automation, Briggs and Kodnani write.
 Analyzing databases detailing the task content of over 900 occupations, our economists estimate that roughly two-thirds of U.S. occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI. They further estimate that, of those occupations that are exposed, roughly a quarter to as much as half of their workload could be replaced. But not all that automated work will translate into layoffs, the report says. “Although the impact of AI on the labor market is likely to be significant, most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI,” the authors write.

               
        

 In addition, jobs displaced by automation have historically been offset by the creation of new jobs, and the emergence of new occupations following technological innovations accounts for the vast majority of long-run employment growth, according to the report. For example, information-technology innovations introduced new occupations such as webpage designers, software developers and digital marketing professionals. There were also follow-on effects of that job creation, as the boost to aggregate income indirectly drove demand for service sector workers in industries like healthcare, education and food services.   
 A recent study by economist David Autor cited in the report found that 60% of today’s workers are employed in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940. This implies that more than 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions, our economists write.

               
        

 At the same time, advances in AI are expected to have far-reaching implications for the global enterprise software, healthcare and financial services industries, according to a separate report from Goldman Sachs Research. With well-known tech giants poised to roll out their own generative AI tools, the enterprise software industry appears to be embarking on the next wave of innovation, after the development of the internet, mobile and cloud computing transformed the ways we operate as a society.
 
 “Generative AI can streamline business workflows, automate routine tasks and give rise to a new generation of business applications,” Kash Rangan, senior U.S. software analyst in Goldman Sachs Research, writes in the team’s report. The technology is making inroads in business applications, improving the day-to-day efficiency of knowledge workers, helping scientists develop drugs faster and accelerating the development of software code, among other things.
 Software companies are already arming their product portfolios with new generative AI offerings. Software-as-a-service firms, for example, are using it to open opportunities for upselling and cross-selling product and increasing their customer retention and expansion, the authors note. They see multiple ways that such businesses can leverage generative AI for growth: 1) through new production and application releases, 2) by charging premiums for AI-integrated offerings, and 3) by increasing prices over time as existing products are supplemented with AI-enabled features and prove their value to customers. Added up, GS Research estimates the total addressable market for generative AI software to be $150 billion, compared with $685 billion for the global software industry.
 As more generative AI tools are developed and layered into existing software packages and technology platforms, the team sees businesses across the economy benefiting, from enhancing office productivity and sales efforts, to the design of buildings and manufactured parts, to improving patient diagnosis in healthcare settings, to detecting cyber fraud.
 While much is unknown about how generative AI will influence the world economy and society, and it will take time to play out, there are clear signs that the effects could be profound.

NewsletterHow Does ChatGPT Really Work?Learning how a “large language model” operates.Share full article524VideoCreditCredit...Illustrations by Mathieu LabrecqueBy Kevin RoosePublished March 28, 2023Updated April 4, 2023In the second of our five-part series, I’m going to explain how the technology actually works.The artificial intelligences that powers ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Bing chatbot and Google’s Bard can carry out humanlike conversations and write natural, fluid prose on an endless variety of topics. They can also perform complex tasks, from writing code to planning a kid’s birthday party.But how does it all work? To answer that, we need to peek under the hood of something called a large language model — the type of A.I. that drives these systems.Large language models, or L.L.M.s, are relatively new on the A.I. scene. The first ones appeared only about five years ago, and they weren’t very good. But today they can draft emails, presentations and memos and tutor you in a foreign language. Even more capabilities are sure to surface in the coming months and years, as the technology improves and Silicon Valley scrambles to cash in.I’m going to walk you through setting up a large language model from scratch, simplifying things and leaving out a lot of hard math. Let’s pretend that we’re trying to build an L.L.M. to help you with replying to your emails. We’ll call it MailBot.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStep 1: Set a goalEvery A.I. system needs a goal. Researchers call this an objective function. It can be simple — for example, “win as many chess games as possible” — or complicated, like “predict the three-dimensional shapes of proteins, using only their amino acid sequences.”Most large language models have the same basic objective function: Given a sequence of text, guess what comes next. We’ll give MailBot more specific goals later on, but let’s stick to that one for now. Step 2: Collect lots of dataNext, we need to assemble the training data that will teach MailBot how to write. Ideally, we’ll put together a colossally large repository of text, which usually means billions of pages scraped from the internet — like blog posts, tweets, Wikipedia articles and news stories.To start, we’ll use some free, publicly available data libraries, such as the Common Crawl repository of web data. But we’ll also want to add our own secret sauce, in the form of proprietary or specialized data. Maybe we’ll license some foreign-language text, so that MailBot learns to compose emails in French or Spanish as well as English. In general, the more data we have, and the more diverse the sources, the better our model will be.Before we can feed the data into our model, we need to break it down into units called tokens, which can be words, phrases or even individual characters. Transforming text into bite-size chunks helps a model analyze it more easily.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStep 3: Build your neural networkOnce our data is tokenized, we need to assemble the A.I.’s “brain” — a type of system known as a neural network. This is a complex web of interconnected nodes (or “neurons”) that process and store information.For MailBot, we’re going to want to use a relatively new type of neural network known as a transformer model. They can analyze multiple pieces of text at the same time, making them faster and more efficient. (Transformer models are the key to systems like ChatGPT — whose full acronym stands for “Generative Pretrained Transformer.”)Step 4: Train your neural networkNext, the model will analyze the data, token by token, identifying patterns and relationships. It might notice “Dear” is often followed by a name, or that “Best regards” typically comes before your name. By identifying these patterns, the A.I. learns how to construct messages that make sense.The system also develops a sense of context. For example, it might learn that “bank” can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river, depending on the surrounding words.

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.As it learns these patterns, the transformer model sketches a map: an enormously complex mathematical representation of human language. It keeps track of these relationships using numerical values known as parameters. Many of today’s best L.L.M.s have hundreds of billions of parameters or more.Training could take days or even weeks, and will require immense amounts of computing power. But once it’s done, it will almost be ready to start writing your emails.Weirdly, it may develop other skills, too. As L.L.M.s learn to predict the next word in a sequence, over and over and over again, they can pick up other, unexpected abilities, such as knowing how to code. A.I. researchers call these emergent behaviors, and they’re still sometimes mystified by them.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStep 5: Fine-tune your modelOnce a large language model is trained, it needs to be calibrated for a specific job. A chatbot used by a hospital might need to understand medical terms, for example.To fine-tune MailBot, we could ask it to generate a bunch of emails, hire people to rate them on accuracy and then feed the ratings back into the model until it improves.This is a rough approximation of the approach that was used with ChatGPT, which is known as reinforcement learning with human feedback.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStep 6: Launch, carefullyCongratulations! Once MailBot has been trained and fine-tuned, it’s ready to use. After you build some kind of user interface for it — like a Chrome extension that plugs into your email app — it can start cranking out emails.But no matter how good it seems, you’re still going to want to keep tabs on your new assistant. As companies like Microsoft and Meta have learned the hard way, A.I. systems can be erratic and unpredictable, or even turn creepy and dangerous.Tomorrow, we’ll hear more about how things can go wrong in unexpected and sometimes disturbing ways.ImageYour homeworkLet’s explore one of the more creative abilities of L.L.M.s: the ability to combine disparate concepts and formats into something bizarre and new. For example, our colleagues at Well asked ChatGPT to “write a song in Taylor Swift’s voice that uses themes from a Dr. Seuss book.”For today’s homework, try to mix and match a format, a style and a topic — like, “Write a limerick in the style of Snoop Dogg about global warming.”Don’t forget to share your creation as a comment.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTQuizQuestion 1 of 3What is the primary objective function of large language models like ChatGPT?Win as many chess games as possiblePredict the 3-D shapes of proteinsGuess what comes next in a sequence of textStart the quiz by choosing your answer.GlossaryTransformer model: A neural network architecture useful for understanding language, which does not have to analyze words one at a time but can look at an entire sentence at once.

Midjourney, ChatGPT, Bing AI Chat, and other AI tools that make generative AI accessible have unleashed a flood of ideas, experimentation and creativity. If you want to harness that in your organization, questions remain about where to start putting AI to work and how to do it without running into ethical dilemmas, copyright infringement, or factual errors. A good place to start is use it to help people who are already expert in their area to save time and be more productive.
There are many other different places to quickly start using generative AI, and it’s being incorporated into several tools and platforms your organization may already use. So you’ll want to think about setting out guidelines for how to experiment with and adopt these tools. Here are five key areas where it’s worth considering generative AI, plus guidance on finding other appropriate scenarios.
1. Increase developer productivity knowhow
Coding is often considered to be somewhere between an art and a science, but there’s a lot of work in programming that’s routine and repetitive. The rise of cloud platforms and module repositories means that writing modern applications is as much about gluing together components and APIs, refactoring existing code, optimizing environments, and orchestrating pipelines as it is about coming up with algorithms. A lot of that work is ripe for automation and AI assistance, but, again, you need to know how and where you’re using these tools to monitor impact and effectiveness. You could start with single-use tools that speed up specific, common tasks before moving on to full-scale coding assistants.
 
 
 













 
 

Documentation is both critical and frequently neglected: not only can you have generative AI document a codebase, but you can then build a chat interface into your documentation where developers can ask how it works and use it, or just replace the usual search box. That turns generic documentation into conversational programming where the AI can take your data and show you how to write a query, for example.

Testing is another area that tends to get neglected, so automated unit test generation will help you get much broader test coverage. Commit bots can also help developers write messages that include enough information to be useful to users and other developers, and generative AI could do the same for IT staff documenting upgrades and system reboots.
It’s also key to generate backend logic and other boilerplate by telling the AI what you want so developers can focus on the more interesting and creative parts of the application. You should also use generative AI to write your own codemods, (scripts that automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks in large code bases), or ask it to help fix contribution voice and tone to better suit house style. Coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and IDEs that build in large language models (LLMs) can do all of that and more but shouldn’t replace a developer; they need to understand and assess code they haven’t written (and the context it runs in) in case it contains security vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks, omissions, bad decisions or just plain mistakes since it’s generating code based on learning from repos that might have any or all of those issues. Think about how to track AI-generated code in your organization so you can audit it and assess how useful it is. Developers report being more productive and less frustrated when using GitHub Copilot, and Microsoft says 40% of the code Copilot users check in is AI-generated and unmodified. Currently that provenance is lost once a developer leaves their IDE session, so think about internal guidance on recording how AI tools are used.
 
 
 













 
 

2. Uplevel low code and no code business users
Although business users don’t have the expertise to evaluate the code produced by an AI assistant, low code and no code environments are highly constrained, and the places where they integrate generative AI tools are far less likely to be problematic.
Low code apps frequently need to retrieve and filter data. And low code platforms already add generative AI features that can generate lookup queries or sanitize the data that come back—like programmatically adding missing zip codes—which allows business users without database expertise to get further without needing to stick to prebuilt components or wait for a professional developer to build the query string for them. Open-source tools like Census GPT make it easier to query large public data sets.
Code assistants aren’t just for pro developers, either. Wix Artificial Design Intelligence (ADI) can build a whole website for you, mixing code generation and generative design; Uizard does the same for website and app prototypes; and Fronty turns images into HTML and CSS while Express design in Microsoft Power Apps turns a hand drawn sketch or Figma file into a working app, complete with backend.
 
 
 













 
 

Most of the generative AI use cases organizations will be interested in are modules that can be called in a low code automation workflow so employees can adapt them to their specific needs. And platforms are already making ChatGPT and other OpenAI APIs available like any other component. However, be sure any warnings or guidance accompanying the text or images generated show up correctly in the low code environment, ideally with a way to give feedback, and that staff know your policy on whether any of this can be presented directly to customers without an employee reviewing it first.

3. Understand documents and data
Combining a custom version of ChatGPT with Bing has brought millions of new users to Microsoft’s search engine. But the way LLMs work means errors and ‘hallucinations’ will happen as they essentially autocomplete sentences and paragraphs to generate text that matches query prompts. And if the information you want doesn’t exist, the model will still attempt to create something plausible. Even when the information given is correct and matches what most experts in an area would say, responses may be incomplete, inaccurate, and if you’re not already an expert, you may not know what’s missing. These issues can be as much of a problem for enterprise search as they are for the public web; the forthcoming Microsoft 365 Copilot tool will try to deal with that by grounding queries in data from the Microsoft Graph of documents and entities, and providing references, but it might still miss important points you’ll need to add in yourself.
Start taking advantage of the opportunities to use LLMs to summarize and analyze documents, or generate text to explain concepts in more constrained scenarios where that information gets reviewed internally by people with expertise, rather than getting shown directly to your customers or other end users.
 
 
 













 
 

Generate a knowledge graph to visualize the connections and relationships between different entities as a way to help you understand a project, community or ecosystem. The Copilot tool coming to Excel promises an interactive way to get insights and ask questions about data in a sandbox that doesn’t change the underlying data, so any mistakes might take you down the wrong path but shouldn’t contaminate the original information for future analysis.
Storytelling with data is another effective way to communicate key trends and AI-powered analytics like Power BI’s Smart Narratives, which can find anomalies and contributing factors, and then explain them with charts and autogenerated descriptions. This avoids the problems LLMs have with math because the insights are derived by AI models like linear regression and then described by the language model. These kinds of ensemble approaches are likely to become more common. Similarly, security tools are starting to use language generation to explain threats, anomalies, and possible evidence of breaches detected by AI in clear, customized language that tells you what it means and what to do about it. In future, expect to be able to ask these kinds of tools questions and have them explain recommendations.
You can also make existing chatbots smarter and more flexible by moving beyond keywords and canned responses to something that sounds more natural and can automatically include new information as your knowledge base updates. Again, it’s tempting to use generative AI chatbots directly with customers to increase customer satisfaction and reduce costs, but this is a riskier scenario than using them inside your organization to surface useful information about benefits and other HR questions, for example. While a sassy chatbot will suit some brands, you don’t want to make the headlines because a customer received dangerous advice or got insulted by your chatbot. Using generative AI for agent assistance can get you the productivity boost with less of the risk.  
 
 
 













 
 

4. Speed up business user workflow
Meetings are supposed to be where business decisions are made and knowledge is shared, but far too much meeting value never leaves the room. AI tools like Microsoft Teams Premium, Dynamics 365 Copilot and the ChatGPT app for Slack create summaries and record the action items assigned to attendees and people who weren’t in the room and may not know what they’re on the hook for. This can also help avoid power plays around who’s asked to take notes and do other ‘office housework,’ for instance.
Being able to catch up with a busy Slack channel once a day could also improve productivity and work-life balance, but those who make the plans and decisions should take responsibility for making sure AI summaries, action items, and timescales are accurate. AI tools that summarize calls with customers and clients can help managers supervise and train staff. That might be as useful for financial advisors as for call center workers, but tools that monitor employee productivity need to be used with empathy to avoid concerns about workplace surveillance. User feedback and product reviews are helpful, but the sheer volume can be overwhelming and nuggets of useful information might be buried pages deep.
Generative AI can classify, summarize, and categorize responses to give aggregate feedback that’s easier to absorb. In the long term, it’s easy to imagine a personal shopping assistant that suggests items you’d want to buy and answers questions about them rather than leaving you to scroll through pages of reviews and comments. But again, businesses will need to be cautious about introducing tools that might surface offensive or defamatory opinions, or be too enthusiastic about filtering out negative reactions. Generative AI tools can read and summarize long documents, and use the information to draft new ones. There are already tools like Docugami that promise to extract due dates and deliverables from contracts, and international law firm Allen & Overy is trialling a platform to help with contract analysis and regulatory compliance. Generating semi-structured documents like MoUs, contracts, or statements of work may speed up business processes and help you standardize some business terms programmatically, but expect to need a lot of flexibility and oversight.
 
 
 













 
 

5. Get over writer’s block, spruce up designs
You don’t have to turn your whole writing process over to an AI just to get help with brainstorming, copywriting and creating images or designs. Office 365 and Google Docs will soon allow you to ask generative AI to create documents, emails and slideshows, so you’ll want to have policy on how these are reviewed for accuracy before they’re shared with anyone. Again, start with more constrained tasks and internal uses that you can monitor.
Generative AI can suggest what to write in customer outreach emails, thank you messages, or warnings about logistical issues, right inside your email or in a CRM like Salesforce, Zoho, or Dynamics 365, either as part of the platform or through a third-party tool. There’s also a lot of interest in using AI for marketing, but there are brand risks too. Treat these options only as a way to get started and not the final version before clicking send.
AI-generated text might not be perfect but if you have a lot of blanks to fill, it’s likely better than nothing. Shopify Magic, for instance, can take basic product details and write consistent, SEO-tuned product descriptions for an online storefront, and once you have something, you can improve on it. Also, Reddit and LinkedIn use Azure Vision Services to create captions and alternative text for images to improve accessibility when members don’t add those themselves. If you have a large video library for training, auto-generated summaries might help employees make the most of their time. Image generation from text can be extremely powerful, and tools like the new Microsoft Designer app put image diffusion models in the hands of business users who might balk at using a Discord server to access Midjourney, and don’t have the expertise to use a Stable Diffusion plugin in Photoshop. But AI-generated images are also controversial, with issues ranging from deepfakes and uncanny valley effects, to the source of training data and the ethics of using works of known artists without compensation. Organizations will want to have a very clear policy on using generated images to avoid the more obvious pitfalls.
 
 
 













 
 

Finding your own uses
As you can see, there are opportunities to benefit from generative AI in everything from customer support and retail, to logistics and legal services—anywhere you want a curated interaction with a reliable information source.

To use it responsibly, start with natural language processing use cases such as classification, summarization and text generation for non-customer-facing scenarios where the output is reviewed by humans who have the expertise to spot and correct errors and false information, and look for an interface that makes it easy and natural to do that rather than it just accepting suggestions. It’ll be tempting to save time and money by skipping human involvement, but the damage to your business could be significant if what’s generated is inaccurate, irresponsible, or offensive.
Many organisations are worried about leaking data into the models that might help competitors. Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have already published data usage policies that say the data and prompts used by one company will only be used to train their model, not the core model supplied to every customer. But you’ll still want to have guidance on what information staff can copy into public generative AI tools.
 
 
 













 
 

Vendors also say that users own the input and output of the models, which is a good idea in theory, but may not reflect the complexity of copyright and plagiarism concerns with generative AI, and models like ChatGPT don’t include citations, so you don’t know if the text they return is correct or copied from someone else. Paraphrasing isn’t exactly plagiarism, but misappropriating an original idea or insight from someone else isn’t a good look for any business.
It’s also important for organizations to develop AI literacy and have staff become familiar with using and evaluating the output of generative AI. Start small with areas that aren’t critical and learn from what works.

",N/A,"The potential impact on job losses and dangerous cybersecurity incidents alone warrant a short pause. 
",N/A,https://schema.org,Article,2023-04-04T01:00:00.000America/New_York,Why we must hit ‘pause’ on generative AI experiments,,https://www.scmagazine.com,,,N/A,N/A,"The non-profit Future of Life Institute recently published an open letter calling for a six-month pause to study the effects of generative AI and how we can innovate more responsibly. This comes as AI technologies such as ChatGPT and Dall-e have provoked global fascination and fear regarding the capabilities of AI on its current trajectory of development. Thousands of tech experts and leaders signed the open letter. I have joined them.Generative AI will disrupt the world in profound ways. Unlike traditional AI systems that are designed to recognize patterns and make predictions, generative AI creates new content in the form of images, text, and audio. It poses a great potential societal and economic impact as it may cause hundreds of millions of people to lose their jobs. This fear was shared by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on a recent Lex Fridman podcast, where Altman talked about job losses among programmers and customer service people. We can compare the generative AI revolution to what happened to blue-collar jobs during the Industrial Revolution. Except this time, white-collar professions are more at risk.Many professions are potentially impacted: art, teaching, journalism, legal, real estate, and software development. In its recent GPT-4 technical report, OpenAI reported that GPT-4 demonstrates human-level performance on a large panel of academic and professional benchmarks: Uniform Bar Exam, SAT Math, AP Art History, and AP Biology. It’s even more impressive when considering that GPT-4 has not been fine-tuned on these specific tasks.In journalism, the effects of generative AI are underway as we see job cuts at major newspapers and digital outlets. It’s not all bad though, since the technology could foster more investigative journalism and the production of original content—as mentioned recently by Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of the Axel Springer media group. In the software industry—like the cybersecurity industry—AI will help build software and products much more quickly—think GitHub Copilot. This may put some tech workers at risk as less people are required to do the job. The potential societal impact goes far beyond jobs. Generative AI presents big risks in terms of cybersecurity. In a recent, and very interesting, technical report, Microsoft Research ran a series of experiments documenting the capabilities of GPT-4. In one experiment, researchers instructed an early version of GPT-4 to plan and execute a cyberattack that consisted of hacking a computer in a local network. It presents both a fascinating and scary use case for the technology.As shown in the report, the main cybersecurity risk will happen when we connect generative AI to tools, so that the AI can interact with the world, learn from the feedback, and adapt. Linux systems are just one example of a tool, which itself includes many tools to interact with the world, such as network commands. There’s also a compiler toolchain, which lets the AI write its own programs. As generative AI typically excels in Linux and programming, from there the possibilities are theoretically infinite.In terms of cybersecurity, the current AI safety protocols are not sufficient, and the protocols in themselves don’t provide perfect protection. OpenAI has reported that for the development of GPT-4 they have worked with 50 experts from domains such as cybersecurity, biorisk, and international security. These experts test the AI in an adversarial manner and ensure that it does not generate harmful content. However, it’s not 100% bullet proof; it’s indeed quite easy to generate harmful content with ChatGPT. Besides the risk to cybersecurity, and in the light of the recent pandemic, we have to consider biorisk as a major concern.That’s why we need to take time to understand the technology. AI research and development should focus on AI safety, alignment, and interpretability. It’s also important that the AI community builds robust watermarking systems. AI will impact many industries, and it’s difficult to predict if it will have a negative or positive long-term effect, especially from a social and economic point of view. That’s a key purpose of the open letter. To give us more runway so that we can make the right decisions. Choices that will hopefully protect our societal and economic well-being.Sébastien Goutal, chief science officer, Vade","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.scmagazine.com/perspective/why-we-must-hit-pause-on-generative-ai-experiments'}",['https://files.scmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SebastienGoutalCol-e1680558334793.jpg'],2023-04-04T08:36:00.000America/New_York,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Sébastien Goutal', 'url': 'https://www.scmagazine.com/contributor/sebastien-goutal'}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'SC Media', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.scmagazine.com/images/sc-logo.png'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,SC Media,,https://www.scmagazine.com#Organization,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 0, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.scmagazine.com/', 'name': 'SC Media'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.scmagazine.com/topic/security-program-controlstechnologies', 'name': 'Security Program Controls/Technologies'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.scmagazine.com/perspective/why-we-must-hit-pause-on-generative-ai-experiments', 'name': 'Why we must hit ‘pause’ on generative AI experiments'}}]",{'@id': 'https://cyberriskalliance.com#postalAddress'},US,NY,10017,400 Madison Ave,CyberRisk Alliance LLC,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Sales and sponsorships', 'email': 'sales@cyberriskalliance.com'}]","['SC Magazine', 'SC Events']",NewsMediaOrganization,"The latest in-depth, unbiased news, analysis and perspective to keep cybersecurity professionals informed, educated and enlightened about the market.",{'@id': 'https://cyberriskalliance.com#organization'},{'@id': 'https://cyberriskalliance.com#organization'},"[{'@type': 'Brand', 'name': 'SC Awards', 'alternateName': ['Excellence Awards', 'Leadership Awards', 'Trust Awards'], 'url': 'https://www.scmagazine.com/sc-awards', 'description': 'Honoring the best in cybersecurity, the SC Awards recognize the people, products and companies that are forging the industry’s future and advancing the cause of safe and secure commerce and communications.'}, {'@type': 'Brand', 'name': 'Women in IT Security', 'url': 'https://www.scmagazine.com/women-in-it-security', 'description': 'Celebrating significant and consequential contributions to the field and community, the SC Media Women in IT Security program honors leaders who have faced down the security challenges, shaped the industry, and made a positive impact on the advancement of cybersecurity in government or the private sector.'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tech recruiters have to keep in mind talent shortages, layoffs, budget cuts and economic uncertainty, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion mandates. Suffice it to say, it’s not an easy time to be a recruiter.
But LinkedIn’s The Future of Recruiting 2023 report finds that generative AI tools such as ChatGPT may take some of the pressure off. About two-thirds (68%) of hirers surveyed in February 2023 said they were “very hopeful” or “cautiously optimistic” about generative AI’s impact on recruiting.
“Generative AI — i.e., tools like ChatGPT that intelligently generate content — is a fascinating new technology that holds promise for talent professionals, many of whom believe it can help in time-consuming tasks, like drafting job descriptions and personalized messages to candidates, among others,’’ the report said.
The top recruiting outcomes hiring pro respondents said they would like to see from GAI tools are:

Automate repetitive tasks to prioritize more strategic work (74%)
Make it faster/easier to source candidates (67%)
Make it faster/easier to engage candidates (59%)

How GAI can help recruiters
While the technologies and skills used in the world of work continue to change, today, both are driven by AI, said Jennifer Shappley, vice president of global talent and acquisition at LinkedIn.

            Hostile Workplace Prevention Policy        



“We know that the number one goal of hirers is to find the right candidate fast. Our recent research found that 75% of hirers hope that generative AI can help them uncover new candidates,’’ she said. Another pain point for recruiters is writing a job description, which can be a time-consuming and difficult task, particularly if they are struggling to attract the right candidates.
“With generative AI, we can integrate this technology into our products to help streamline parts of the hiring process, so recruiters can focus their energy on the more strategic aspects of their job,’’ Shappley said.
One way LinkedIn is doing this is by testing new AI-powered job descriptions that will make it faster and easier to write job descriptions and attract quality candidates for a role.
LinkedIn hiring predictions
The report laid out a number of recruitment predictions.
Continue building diverse workforces
Besides the use of GAI in the hiring process, LinkedIn is predicting that employers “will remain committed to building a diverse workforce” despite the uncertain economy.
Though most recruiting pros said hiring overall has been negatively impacted, three out of four said that DEI hiring is not being deprioritized — in fact, nearly 20% said it’s a higher priority now, according to the report.
Hire more contract workers
As a result of the tumultuous times, LinkedIn is also predicting employers will hire more contract workers “as a hedge against uncertainty.”
The job site based this prediction on the fact that in the U.S., for example, LinkedIn job posts for contract positions are growing much faster than job posts for full-time employees, which is relatively stable. The report defines contract positions as labor “contracted” out to a company for a finite amount of time listed by a contract, whether full-time or part-time work.
Keep recruiting/staffing in-house vs external is pretty evenly split
The data indicates a more stable split: 22% of companies expect to spend more on in-house recruiters this year vs. in 2022, while 23% expect to invest more in external staffing firms.
Stay informed about candidates’ top priorities
Another prediction is that companies will keep a closer eye on what candidates most want in order to stay competitive in a tight labor market.
Every month, LinkedIn surveys over 20,000 members about the most important factors they weigh when considering a new job. The top priority for candidates today is excellent compensation and benefits, by a fairly wide margin. This is followed by work-life balance and flexibility and comp, which the report said are also the two fastest-growing priorities year over year.
“There’s much more to your employer brand than good pay and flexibility, and offering them may not make you stand out — but be warned: If you don’t provide them, talent will take notice,’’ the report said.
Upskilling will be key to internal recruiting and diverse hiring
Two other predictions focus on upskilling. One is that business leaders will recognize the value of filling open roles with homegrown talent, given the shaky economy. Some 75% of recruiting pros said that “internal recruiting will be an important factor shaping the future of recruiting over the next five years.”
A related prediction is that upskilling will be a key tool for hiring a diverse workforce. Eighty-one percent of recruiting pros said upskilling and reskilling employees will be an important factor in shaping the future of recruiting over the next five years.
Tips for hiring leaders to attract tech talent
A key way to hire talent today is to focus on skills as opposed to pedigree, Shappley said. “Gone are the days where degrees were prioritized. Today it’s about skills.”
She recommended that talent professionals focus on three things:

Write job descriptions to include skills and not unnecessary qualifiers like a four-year degree.
Ask about a candidate’s skills during the interview process.
Help make sure the entire hiring team has a skills-first focus when hiring.

LinkedIn has been working on creating a skills-first labor market “that makes it easier for employers to hire and develop talent based on skills, and for members to stand out and get hired based on their skills,’’ Shappley said.

AI and the Future of Work: Preparing the Workforce for an AI-Driven Economy
By Brent Orrell

FacebookTwitterLinkedIn
AI is best positioned to augment the workforce, not replace it. The U.S. Chamber’s Commission on Artificial Intelligence Competition, Inclusion, and Innovation report outlines recommendations for preparing the workforce for the continued integration of AI tools across our economy.
To paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the “end of work” have been greatly exaggerated – more than once. Throughout history, the arrival of new technology has been regarded as a threat to human work and, in every instance, new technology has been integral to unlocking new work, new value, and rising incomes.
This hopeful view is not the same thing, however, as saying that new technology, like artificial intelligence, will be all upside for every worker, all the time, everywhere. The recent report from the U.S. Chamber’s Commission on Artificial Intelligence Competition, Inclusion, and Innovation acknowledges that the effects of AI on employment will be both uneven and hard to predict. The report emphasizes that, at its core, AI tools are informing and expanding, not replacing, human labor and, “if developed and deployed ethically, [AI] has the ability to augment human capabilities and empower people to do much more.”
How Workers and Businesses Can Prepare for the AI Economy of the Future
By its nature, technological innovation requires businesses and workers to learn and adapt—and learning and adaptation can be hard. Sometimes, it means upskilling within an existing job and at other times finding a whole new job in a different sector.
This learning and adaptation process is likely to be particularly demanding when it comes to AI. A recent University of Pennsylvania study found that 80 percent of American jobs are likely to see at least 10 percent of their tasks altered by AI while almost 20 percent of jobs will see at least 50 percent of their tasks altered. Another study by Goldman Sachs largely echoed these findings estimating that 18 percent of jobs globally could be computerized with “knowledge” and “information” tasks especially exposed.
During one of the AI Commission’s field hearings, Cheryl Oldham, vice president of education policy at the U.S. Chamber, emphasized that if we’re going to minimize any labor market disruptions and build new and effective pathways that lead to AI-related jobs, “we need to proactively lean into workforce development.”
To do so, the report recommends:
Training and Reskilling: The creation of new programs that can help ease worker transitions find and improve incentives for businesses to invest in retraining as necessary.Educating the Future Workforce: Urging students and workers to prepare early and to continuously upgrade their knowledge, skills, and abilities.Economic Policies: Encouraging Congress to adopt tax policies that support “human labor augmentation” within firms rather than ones that incentivize the substitution of technology for human labor and skill.
AI is neither the end of work nor a future delivered on a golden platter. Rather, it is a new tool that, just like new tools of the past, will take time, effort, and practice to master.

SeekOut Launches Generative AI Technology Based on ChatGPT

By Mark Feffer -   April 4, 2023   





Talent intelligence platform SeekOut launched new generative AI technology based on OpenAI’s GPT. Called SeekOut Assist, the tool allows recruiting teams to quickly move from a job description to initial contact with candidates, the company said.
According to SeekOut, the product works with recruiters to quickly surface qualified candidates. When recruiters paste a job description into the system, SeekOut generates a list of the most qualified candidates for the role.
The system uses GPT technology to break down job descriptions into search criteria such as job title, required skills and preferred skills. It then analyzes over 800 million profiles in SeekOut’s talent database to find the best matches. SeekOut said the search criteria it uses are transparent, explainable and can be further fine-tuned by a recruiter.
Personalized Outreach at Scale
The best recruiters research candidates and craft highly personalized messages to increase their email response rates. SeekOut Assist generates a personalized message to the candidate based on their unique qualifications for the role.
In addition, SeekOut Assist analyzes the information in each candidate’s SeekOut profile, including skills and experiences. The technology uses the candidate profile and job description to write a personalized outreach message to the candidate, improving the chances of a response.  
SeekOut believes its new approach to generative AI could have a serious impact on how recruiters get their jobs done. To use Josh Bersin’s words, “Generative AI will be a total game changer in HR.”
“SeekOut Assist is a big step forward in solving real business problems with the power of Generative AI and will make our customers radically more productive and effective,” said SeekOut Co-Founder and CTO Aravind Bala. “We’re excited about the future of AI in the HR technology space, and look forward to working with our customers and partners to build new tools that make recruiters’ contributions to their organizations even more strategic.”

Sam Johnson



					Editor-In-Chief, Otter PR				




April 3, 2023




 








Sam Johnson, editor-in-chief of Otter PR, says that as advanced as AI technology has become throughout the past several decades, it still lacks critical qualities, features, and skills that can be easily replicated by human writers when working with clients but not by a machine.
The world is abuzz with talk of AI and all it can do to make our lives easier. It is the stuff of science fiction now come to life, and many who have predicted the emergence of AI over the years are heralding its arrivalOpens a new window . 
However, for those who work as writers — whether it be copywriting, journalism or creative writing — the emergence of AI in these industries has caused a dust-up of concern. Since AI is here to stay, what does this mean for those who write for a living or those who lead them?

AI programs like ChatGPT and OpenAI have revolutionized content creation and copywriting. There is no denying this, yet as intuitive as these programs may be, they are far from replacing a team of client-focused human beings. With creativity and nuance still necessary to convey human emotion, the world still needs human writers.
The Capabilities of AI for Writing
AI is not coming to take our jobs, writers. Not yet, but the fear of it doing so is understandable. Text-based AI programs can quickly spit out a comprehensive article outline in seconds and generate an entire article based on that outline in minutes. The result is a good piece that would pass muster with most editors and outlets. 
Indeed, these programs are handy tools for writers. They can outline drafts, generate fresh ideas, or revitalize outdated pitches. Need a little nuance? Tweak your requests within the program, and you’ll suddenly receive a completely new, computer-generated writing portion. 
These programs access a remarkable amount of data and are lightning-fast. They tap into other stories, research, and content created (by humans) to generate functional pieces that accomplish what functional writing is intended to do: compile data and inform readers. 

Moreover, the capabilities of AI programs like ChatGPT are beneficial to career writers. The outlining capabilities alone could save journalists and bloggers several hours of work each week. As long as you trust the information the program is pulling and compiling, your days of searching the internet for just the right bits of research may be numbered. 
Frankly, I don’t know any writer who would scoff at freeing up some of their time that would otherwise be dedicated to research and outlining. The ability of AI programs to do the frontline work of compiling data, outlining, and prompting ideas can prove endlessly helpful for writers looking to maximize their productivity and output. 
With all that current AI is capable of and all of the advancements that will come soon, writers need to think of AI not as a replacement but as an additional tool in their toolbelt. AI will hopefully improve the writer’s job, but it is not on its way to replacing human writers soon.

The Benefit of Human Writers
AI is based on statistics and quantitative modeling. It is unfamiliar with emotion and often struggles with context, hyperbole, and prose. These programs cannot think independently of human intervention because they are utilitarian — they are merely meant to serve a purpose and get a job done as efficiently as possible. 
We live in a world where emotional language still serves a purpose; hyperbole, humor, and stunning prose thrill people, win awards, and make a difference in people’s lives. AI-generated content gets the job done, but it is not yet sentient to the point where it can replace the genius of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists or authors. 
This is where the benefit of a team of human writers comes in. Human creativity is endless; we can sense the needs of other humans, bend our interactions to fit those needs and create pieces that speak to issues so beautifully that they can alter the perception and opinions of others. 
Service, promotion, and marketing are still very human ideals. If given the opportunity, human beings will excel far beyond anything a computer program could produce.
Client support and collaboration are other areas where human beings will always surpass the potential of AI. In virtually every global industry and market, it’s imperative that writers can communicate well with clients to tell stories properly or bring visions to life. A person could input all of the commands in the world into an AI program, and it still would not make up for the benefit of having a human being field their requests. 
To hear the inflection in one’s voice, to read body language and facial expression, and to take constructive criticism and expand on ideas are all human abilities that cannot be replicated by a machine — one that was created by humans, for humans. When clients request changes that need to be made or nuance that needs to be added, it is based on human knowledge of their market and intent, the latter of which no machine today can truly understand. And yet, every day, human writers quickly form relationships with clients, come to understand their particularities, and produce work that ultimately benefits the client, the writer, and the writer’s employer.

The Need for Human Expression 
The fear built around the expansion of AI capable of churning out articles, blogs, emails, and even books is not entirely unwarranted. There is no doubt that AI will change the way writers work, perhaps even irreversibly so. The more companies across all industries become aware of the capabilities of AI to streamline processes and, ultimately, save them time and money, the more they will champion the rise of AI. 
As AI continues gaining traction in the modern workplace, writers must adapt or risk being left behind. Lower-level copywriters, editors, or those who fail to expand on their writing skills will likely be the first to feel the potential adverse effects of AI. However, there still needs to be more specialized services for talented writing teams. 
Jobs being replaced with the rise of technological advancements is a worry that has existed for a while. Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the same fear has been expressed by workers who were eventually replaced by innovations in automation. Throughout the 20th century, many have witnessed customer service roles lose out to more efficient technological interventions. But as long as there are new ideas, talented wordsmiths must articulate those ideas artfully. 
The need for pure human expression will endure as long as we hold it sacred. Career writers will significantly benefit from learning what they can about AI and how they can employ it to enhance their work and help tighten their creative process.

ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. The chatbot saw a meteoric rise, gaining 1 million users within the first five days of its November 30, 2022 launch. By January, it became the fastest-growing platform with 100 million users, reaching 1 billion visits in February alone. To put ChatGPT’s ascendency into perspective, it took social media app Twitter five years to reach 100 million users, while Instagram took 2 ½ years after its launch and TikTok nine months.


ChatGPT’s resonance with its global users and overnight success can be attributed mainly to the chatbot’s many uses and its human capability. OpenAI’s technology platform managed to score in the 90th percentile on both the college-entry SATs and the attorney bar exam.

Cutting-Edge Job Seekers See An Advantage To Using ChatGPT
Forward-thinking job seekers are also leveraging artificial intelligence in their job searches. According to a February survey from ResumeBuilder.com of 1,000 current and recent job hunters, nearly half (46%) of job seekers are using the chatbot to craft their résumés or cover letters.

PROMOTED
Seventy percent of respondents saw a higher response rate from companies when using ChatGPT. Seventy-eight percent of candidates who used the chatbot scored interviews, while nearly six in 10 job hunters were hired after using the AI tool during their application process.

However, it is worth mentioning that 11% of job seekers were rejected once it was learned from the hiring company that the candidate used ChatGPT.
With the AI platform disrupting the job search, I spoke with career coaches about the manner in which they were advising job seekers on how to gain a competitive advantage by using ChatGPT to streamline and guide the application and interview process.

“ChatGPT is empowering job seekers. It can provide answers to their specific questions beyond what a basic Google search will find (articles and videos). For example, ChatGPT can help develop a list of questions a job seeker can ask during an informational meeting. It can help job seekers identify alternative job titles in a new industry. It can even help them make a career shift to something totally different. Plus, it helps get rid of writer's block. It can craft a rough draft of a cover letter, thank you note or even a follow-up email.”

Samantha Foster, Executive Recruiter
“ChatGPT is a great ‘complementary’ tool. I just started using it and it cuts the time I spend rewriting boring job descriptions and preparing better interview questions. For candidates, it is definitely helping them stay organized when applying to and interviewing for several positions simultaneously.”
Sweta Regmi, Career And Résumé Strategist/ Interview And Branding Coach
“Job seekers have the power to use AI just the way employers have been using it for years for recruiting.
I tested ChatGPT as a job seeker by providing the prompt. I asked ChatGPT to identify core competencies based on the targeted role and added four job postings. Now, I have the resources with soft skills and hard skills to create a résumé. It helped me understand my strength, weakness, opportunities and threat (SWOT) to self-reflect.
As an employer, I created job descriptions to test out. It saved me time on productivity. I still have to have knowledge of HR and employment laws in my country and city. AI can only help if you have the skills or knowledge.”
Marti Konstant, Workforce And Career Agility Trainer And Writer
“Use AI as your personal genius bar and you will not lose jobs to robots. You will only lose out to those who embrace AI.
AI use cases for job search: conduct job research; compare your transferable skills to open up ideas for new role possibilities; create project planning examples to demonstrate your understanding of the work requirements; extract language and requirements from job description to use in your job search process and ATS; develop branding phrases and talking points that integrate your competencies and strengths; feed in your accomplishments, milestones and your ""about"" section via LinkedIn (requires specific prompt crafting) and identify case studies in your area of expertise (digital marketing, product development and learning and development) and include these in your written and verbal talking points during the outreach or interview process.”
Ruth Sternberg, Job Search And Résumé Writer
“AI can help you when you're preparing your materials for a job search by providing a compilation or list of expectations from job postings, all in one place; providing rough organization of your career history—an outline to give you somewhere to start and helping you identify new job possibilities.
When you feed it your résumé, you can ask to see jobs that seem to align with it. ChatGPT can give you a list of what’s important for a particular role, based on descriptions and other developed material, so you can compare your own job history to see if you match up. You also can ask the software to suggest ways you could improve what you’ve written based on a particular job. It can help you determine what types of jobs match a particular college major.
It also could translate résumés into other languages; add keywords from a particular industry and help you spot incongruities or flag unusual claims in your narrative to prompt a fact check.”
Virginia Franco, LinkedIn And Résumé Writer
“I see AI tools serving as powerful tools for job seekers, who will be able to use it to support interview prep and even outreach. AI could disrupt ATS systems as we know them! I’ve tested it out by plugging in the résumé I wrote and a job posting and asking it to write a cover letter. It provided a great start, but a so-so final product. Once I edited it, it was good!”
Adrienne Tom, Executive Résumé And LinkedIn Profile Writer
“Job seekers must understand the limitations of AI. Content is not always accurate, customized, or personalized. So, AI support may only be a starting point or a booster, not the complete solution. The output of AI is typically only as good as the input or questions it is asked. So knowing what to ask is critical.”
Shennee Rutt, Executive Résumé Writer And Career Strategist
“I think as AI evolves, and more shortcuts from writing a résumé, applying for a job, interviewing could potentially eliminate highly qualified candidates due to bias in scripted computer-generated content. It also removes the “human” in human resources and talent acquisition. Since humans write the codes, it could be biased and adversely impact job hunters. If the human-being who writes the code has biased discrimination and it is interpreted in the code written, this could impact candidates and job seekers with disabilities or pre-existing conditions.”

The implications of AI — both positive and negative — have fascinated experts and amateurs alike for many years, but there are some great benefits of artificial intelligence that are perhaps not frequently considered.
Digital technology has been developing at breakneck speed over the last few decades. Most of us have significantly more technological power in our pockets than in our homes in the 90s. Coating wine bottle with wax and honey extraction, the best of IE this week

There have also been significant breakthroughs in machine learning and deep learning. These concepts have allowed machines to process and analyze information and, in some cases, to learn for themselves very sophisticatedly.
Thanks to these developments in AI technology, machines can now learn to perform complex functions such as facial recognition.

That being said, there has been significant debate regarding the risks artificial intelligence poses to humanity, including concerns that AI can be misused or may take over humanity. For example, movies like The Terminator, Westworld, and Saturn depict grim pictures of killer robots.
Fears of the potentially darker side of AI are one thing, but they are balanced by some potential benefits that AI and ML could deliver. Here are some of the most notable examples. 
1. AI has and will continue to enhance automation

Today, AI-augmented robots can easily perform various automated tasks, both inside and outside the factory, without the need for constant human intervention. AI is poised to be a transformative technology for some applications and tasks across a vast suite of industries.
Machine learning, deep learning, and other AI technologies are already being used to reduce human workloads in assembly, packaging, customer service, and HR, among other areas, and the move has reduced operational and employee costs substantially. 
An example of AI’s inexhaustible capacity to enhance the level of automation can be seen in the Japanese machine tool builder, Okuma. In 2018, Okuma highlighted many innovations to showcase the future of smart manufacturing.
This includes robots for plants of all sizes, new and improved machine tools, and smart machine tools. Such examples clearly demonstrate the potential of AI for future work in the industry. 
We may also see AI and robots working alongside human operatives. Robotic coworkers or Cobots will assist, rather than fully replace human workers, and improve the overall efficiency and general happiness of humans in the workplace. 
Companies like Amazon already benefit from this kind of working relationship between us and the machines. 
2. AI can help eliminate the necessity for humans to perform tedious tasks

One of the main benefits of artificial intelligence is its ability to reduce the drudgery involved in many work tasks. Repetitive, tedious tasks in any job are the bane of many human workers. While monotony may result in human perfection, computer automation remains the best and cheapest option for monotonous tasks.  
Machines excel when executing standardized processing work like data entry, freeing up human operatives to concentrate on the more creative and interpersonal aspects of their jobs or lives. For example, financial institutions today take full advantage of AI to make banking quicker and easier for consumers. With AI at the helm of simple and repetitive tasks, financial workers can focus on the tedious aspects of their job. 
The 2019 MIT SMR-BCG Artificial Intelligence Global Executive Study and Research Report reveals that the early AI adopters and winners focus on organization-wide alignment with AI, integration, and investment. 45% of the study’s respondents recognize that one of the dangers of AI is the fact that the competition can easily utilize the tool to drive efficiency. 47% of the respondents strongly agreed that employees will have the space and time to think creatively and drive the business goals while AI does the heavy and repetitive lifting.    
 3. Improving weather forecasting is another way AI can benefit humans

Weather forecasting is highly complex and needs computing and deep-learning networks to sift through and analyze large data sets infinitely faster than humans ever could. 
In the past few years, we have seen artificial intelligence and its associated technologies used in weather and climate forecasting. Climate Informatics, for example, enables greater collaboration between data scientists and climate scientists. 
There are countless applications of AI aimed at accurate weather forecasting. IBM, for instance, used its computers to improve its forecasts as early as the mid-1990s.
4. Next-generation disaster response is another reason why AI is good

2017 California wildfires led to the burning of more than 1 million acres of land. 46 people lost their lives to the devastation, and hundreds of homes were reportedly burnt to the ground. The large-scale wildfires in Australia between 2019 and 2020 also caused severe damage and loss of life. 
Due to the increasing threats of extreme weather events like these, more and more government authorities and organizations are embracing artificial intelligence to help fight these disasters with algorithms and satellite data. 
AI has demonstrated its utility in building smart disaster responses and providing real-time data on disasters and weather events. With AI, governments save valuable time and enable disaster response in a more targeted and efficient manner. Once sophisticated enough, it may be able to offer early and crucial warnings that will save lives. 

5. AI could fight alongside humans in battles

It is a common trope that AI will one day be the end of humanity because robots and machines will deskill, destroy, or enslave us all. However, robots may just be the ultimate human companions in war. AI shows immense promise as a potential application in war, as stipulated in Paul Scharre’s book “Army of None.”
According to Scharre, militaries and machine intelligence are expected to work in tandem to conduct wars. This would likely mean AI and robots taking on the more dangerous roles in combat instead of putting human beings in the literal firing line. Needless to say, there are some very serious ethical issues to work out first before we give AI the ability to potentially take life. 
But AI could help save human lives in other areas like disaster rescue situations. We may, one day, see AI-powered firefighters or assist first responders in locatingsaving and save lives during environmental or industrial catastrophes. 
6. AI is on-call all the time

AI never sleeps. Rather than an ominous statement, this is actually potentially very beneficial to us all. 
Humans need to eat, sleep and rest; machines and AI do not. So long as it has a supply of electricity, In theory, AI can work all the time, for eternity. 
This will reduce errors, maintain critical services, and enable businesses and other organizations to provide services their users rely on (like helplines, etc.). For educational and research institutions, this could lead to some breakthroughs in future discoveries that could have wide-ranging benefits for us all. 
7. AI could create new jobs!

While there are some very real concerns about the potential to eliminate or make some types of jobs redundant, AI could also open entirely new areas of work. Applying AI in businesses will also force the job market to evolve, which, with the right preparation, could be a very good thing. RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

From various maintenance and supporting roles, to entirely new careers not yet dreamed of, the widespread adoption of AI could be a brighter future for all of us. And we’ve been here before.
Similar fears to those around AI have surfaced around most new forms of technology. Sometimes, the fears are well-founded, and sometimes not, but the genie of new technology cannot be put back in the bottle. All we can do is learn how to use it wisely and to our advantage. 
And that is your lot for today. 
While there are some genuine concerns around its development, AI could be the best thing since sliced bread is adopted properly.

Its abilities were astonishing — and squarely in the bailiwick of people who generate content, such as advertising copy and blog posts, for a living.“They’re horrified,” said Rebecca Matter, the institute’s president. Over the holidays, she scrambled to organize a webinar on the pitfalls and potential of the new artificial-intelligence technology. More than 3,000 people signed up, she said, and the overall message was cautionary but reassuring: Writers could use ChatGPT to complete assignments more quickly, and move into higher-level roles in content planning and search-engine optimization.“I do think it’s going to minimize short-form copy projects,” Ms. Matter said. “But on the flip side of that, I think there will be more opportunities for things like strategy.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOpenAI’s ChatGPT is the latest advance in a steady march of innovations that have offered the potential to transform many occupations and wipe out others, sometimes in tandem. It is too early to tally the enabled and the endangered, or to gauge the overall impact on labor demand and productivity. But it seems clear that artificial intelligence will impinge on work in different ways than previous waves of technology.The positive view of tools like ChatGPT is that they could be complements to human labor, rather than replacements. Not all workers are sanguine, however, about the prospective impact.Katie Brown is a grant writer in the Chicago suburbs for a small nonprofit group focused on addressing domestic violence. She was shocked to learn in early February that a professional association for grant writers was promoting the use of artificial-intelligence software that would automatically complete parts of an application, requiring the human simply to polish it before submitting.The platform, called Grantable, is based on the same technology as ChatGPT, and it markets itself to freelancers who charge by the application. That, she thought, clearly threatens opportunities in the industry.“For me, it’s common sense: Which do you think a small nonprofit will pick?” Ms. Brown said. “A full-time-salary-plus-benefits person, or someone equipped with A.I. that you don’t have to pay benefits for?”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTArtificial intelligence and machine learning have been operating in the background of many businesses for years, helping to evaluate large numbers of possible decisions and better align supply with demand, for example. And plenty of technological advancements over centuries have decreased the need for certain workers — although each time, the jobs created have more than offset the number lost.ImageGuillermo Rubio has found that his job as a copywriter has changed markedly since he started using ChatGPT to generate ideas for blog posts.Credit...In-camera double exposure by Mark Abramson for The New York TimesChatGPT, however, is the first to confront such a broad range of white-collar workers so directly, and to be so accessible that people could use it in their own jobs. And it is improving rapidly, with a new edition released this month. According to a survey conducted by the job search website ZipRecruiter after ChatGPT’s release, 62 percent of job seekers said they were concerned that artificial intelligence could derail their careers.“ChatGPT is the one that made it more visible,” said Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute who studies automation’s effects. “So I think it did start to raise questions about where timelines might start to be accelerated.”That’s also the conclusion of a White House report on the implications of A.I. technology, including ChatGPT. “The primary risk of A.I. to the work force is in the general disruption it is likely to cause to workers, whether they find that their jobs are newly automated or that their job design has fundamentally changed,” the authors wrote.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFor now, Guillermo Rubio has found that his job as a copywriter has changed markedly since he started using ChatGPT to generate ideas for blog posts, write first drafts of newsletters, create hundreds of slight variations on stock advertising copy and summon research on a subject about which he might write a white paper.

More voices, better journalism. The article you are reading is in part the result of The Times inviting readers to share their experiences. With questionnaires, we get a wide range of views that often lead to a more deeply reported article. This helps us ensure that our journalism reflects the world we cover.Here’s more on how it works and why it’s good for us and you.Since he still charges his clients the same rates, the tool has simply allowed him to work less. If the going rate for copy goes down, though — which it might, as the technology improves — he’s confident he’ll be able to move into consulting on content strategy, along with production.“I think people are more reluctant and fearful, with good reason,” Mr. Rubio, who is in Orange County, Calif., said. “You could look at it in a negative light, or you can embrace it. I think the biggest takeaway is you have to be adaptable. You have to be open to embracing it.”After decades of study, researchers understand a lot about automation’s impact on the work force. Economists including Daron Acemoglu at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have found that since 1980, technology has played a primary role in amplifying income inequality. As labor unions atrophied, hollowing out systems for training and retraining, workers without college educations saw their bargaining power reduced in the face of machines capable of rudimentary tasks.The advent of ChatGPT three months ago, however, has prompted a flurry of studies predicated on the idea that this isn’t your average robot.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOne team of researchers ran an analysis showing the industries and occupations that are most exposed to artificial intelligence, based on a model adjusted for generative language tools. Topping the list were college humanities professors, legal services providers, insurance agents and telemarketers. Mere exposure, however, doesn’t determine whether the technology is likely to replace workers or merely augment their skills.Shakked Noy and Whitney Zhang, doctoral students at M.I.T., conducted a randomized, controlled trial on experienced professionals in such fields as human relations and marketing. The participants were given tasks that typically take 20 to 30 minutes, like writing news releases and brief reports. Those who used ChatGPT completed the assignments 37 percent faster on average than those who didn’t — a substantial productivity increase. They also reported a 20 percent increase in job satisfaction.A third study — using a program developed by GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft — evaluated the impact of generative A.I. specifically on software developers. In a trial run by GitHub’s researchers, developers given an entry-level task and encouraged to use the program, called Copilot, completed their task 55 percent faster than those who did the assignment manually.Those productivity gains are unlike almost any observed since the widespread adoption of the personal computer.“It does seem to be doing something fundamentally different,” said David Autor, another M.I.T. economist, who advises Ms. Zhang and Mr. Noy. “Before, computers were powerful, but they simply and robotically did what people programmed them to do.” Generative artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is “adaptive, it learns and is capable of flexible problem solving.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThat’s very apparent to Peter Dolkens, a software developer for a company that primarily makes online tools for the sports industry. He has been integrating ChatGPT into his work for tasks like summarizing chunks of code to aid colleagues who may pick up the project after him, and proposing solutions to problems that have him stumped. If the answer isn’t perfect, he’ll ask ChatGPT to refine it, or try something different.“It’s the equivalent of a very well-read intern,” Mr. Dolkens, who is in London, said. “They might not have the experience to know how to apply it, but they know all the words, they’ve read all the books and they’re able to get part of the way there.”There’s another takeaway from the initial research: ChatGPT and Copilot elevated the least experienced workers the most. If true, more generally, that could mitigate the inequality-widening effects of artificial intelligence.On the other hand, as each worker becomes more productive, fewer workers are required to complete a set of tasks. Whether that results in fewer jobs in particular industries depends on the demand for the service provided, and the jobs that might be created in helping to manage and direct the A.I. “Prompt engineering,” for example, is already a skill that those who play around with ChatGPT long enough can add to their résumés.Since demand for software code seems insatiable, and developers’ salaries are extremely high, increasing productivity seems unlikely to foreclose opportunities for people to enter the field.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThat won’t be the same for every profession, however, and Dominic Russo is pretty sure it won’t be true for his: writing appeals to pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies when they reject prescriptions for expensive drugs. He has been doing the job for about seven years, and has built expertise with only on-the-job training, after studying journalism in college.After ChatGPT came out, he asked it to write an appeal on behalf of someone with psoriasis who wanted the expensive drug Otezla. The result was good enough to require only a few edits before submitting it.“If you knew what to prompt the A.I. with, anyone could do the work,” Mr. Russo said. “That’s what’s really scares me. Why would a pharmacy pay me $70,000 a year, when they can license the technology and pay people $12 an hour to run prompts into it?”To try to protect himself from that possible future, Mr. Russo has been building up his side business: selling pizzas out of his house in southern New Jersey, an enterprise that he figures won’t be disrupted by artificial intelligence.Yet.Audio produced by Kate Winslett.Lydia DePillis is a reporter on the Business desk who covers the changing American economy and what it means for people’s lives.

		States and municipalities are eyeing restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence-based bots to find, screen, interview, and hire job candidates because of privacy and bias issues. Some states have already put laws on the books.	




 









Organizations are rapidly adopting the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for the discovery, screening, interviewing, and hiring of candidates. It can reduce time and work needed to find job candidates and it can more accurately match applicant skills to a job opening.
But legislators and other lawmakers are concerned that using AI-based tools to discover and vet talent could intrude on job seekers’ privacy and may introduce racial- and gender-based biases already baked into the software.
“We have seen a substantial groundswell over the past two to three years with regard to legislation and regulatory rule-making as it relates to the use of AI in various facets of the workplace,” said Samantha Grant, a partner with the law firm of Reed Smith. 











 
 
 
States, including California, Maryland, and Washington, have enacted or are considering legislation to put rules around using AI for talent acquisition. The European Union’s EU AI Act is also aimed at addressing issues surrounding automated hiring software.

On April 1, Italy became the first Western nation to ban further development of ChatGPT over privacy concerns after the natural language processing app experienced a data breach involving user conversations and payment information. ChatGPT is the popular chatbot created by OpenAI and backed by billions of dollars from Microsoft.
The Italian data protection authority is also investigating whether OpenAI’s chatbot already violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation rules created to protect personal data inside and outside the EU. OpenAI has complied with the new law, according to a report by the BBC.











 
 
 
Congress is considering the federal Algorithmic Accountability Act, which, if passed, would require employers to perform an impact assessment of any automated decision-making system that has a significant effect on an individual’s access to, terms, or availability of employment. 
In addition, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recently announced that it intends to increase oversight and scrutiny of AI tools used to screen and hire workers. As part of that effort, the EEOC held a public hearing Jan. 31 to explore the potential benefits and harms of AI in hiring situations, according to Grant.
“The current swell of laws and regulations related to AI in HR is like a wave under the water — building, gaining momentum, and getting ready to come ashore,” said Cliff Jurkiewicz, vice president of Global Strategy at Phenom, an AI-enabled hiring platform provider. “The new laws are necessary and welcomed as technology has outpaced existing regulations for protecting underrepresented groups.”











 
 
 
New York City makes a move
One of the attempts to wrangle AI-based automated employment-decision tools is New York City’s Local Law 144, slated to go into effect in April. The law, originally passed in 2021, was postponed due to the “high volume of public comments” during the rule-making process. It prohibits employers from using automated employment selection tools unless an organization institutes specific bias auditing and makes the resulting data publicly available.
A company must also disclose its use of AI to job candidates who live in New York City.
The New York City law could be a catalyst for other states to adopt similar legislation — since so many companies do business in the city and it is an epicenter of finance and commerce, Jurkiewicz said. “Implementing such a law will undoubtedly influence similar laws throughout the US and potentially other regions,” he said.











 
 
 
While the city ordinance implies employers must conduct an audit, vendors are preemptively doing them to help companies they work with, “both as security for existing clients, as well as a way to differentiate/appeal to potential prospective clients,” said Ben Eubanks, chief research officer with Lighthouse Research & Advisory.
“I think everybody’s holding their breath and watching to see what’s going to happen in New York, partially because the rules around these tools [require them] to be audited [and] evaluated and the vendor has to prove they’ve passed some approved checklist,” Eubanks said. “At this point, it’s hard to know what it’s going to look like rolling out. I have lots of companies within the vendor community that have been watching this closely.”
Companies offering AI-based recruitment software include Paradox, HireVue, iCIMS, Textio, Phenom, Jobvite, XOR.ai, Upwork, Bullhorn and Eightfold AI.











 
 
 
For example, HireVue’s service includes a chatbot that can hold text-based conversations with job seekers to guide them to jobs that best fit their skills. Phenom’s deep-learning algorithm chatbot sends tailored job recommendations and content based on skills, position fit, location, and experience to candidates so employers can “find and choose you faster.” Not only does it screen applicants, but it can schedule job interviews.
AI talent acquisition software uses numerical scores based on a candidate’s background, skills, and video interview to deliver an overall competency-based score and rankings that can be used in employer decision-making.
This week, Beamery, a multinational AI-based talent management software provider, announced the launch of TalentGPT, a chatbot based on GPT-4 and other large language models (LLMs). The chatbot is aimed at assisting hiring managers, recruiters, candidates and employees in talent acquisition and job searches. The company claims its AI automates rules compliance and mitigates bias risks associated with LLMs, which are the algorithms behind chatbots.











 
 
 
Talent acquisition software and services have touted their AI-based platforms as offering greater diversity, inclusion and equality (DEI) because the computer software can be programmed to be gender and ethnicity neutral; the goal is to eliminate as much human bias as possible.
The problem: humans program the software.
The challenges inherent in AI
As with any “disruptive technology,” Jurkiewicz said AI brings challenges that should be considered and planned for by hiring organizations. They include:











 
 
 

Algorithmic bias.
Lack of transparency.
Legal and ethical concerns.
Over-reliance on AI.
Privacy and data security.
Dehumanization in the hiring process.
Misalignment with organizational culture and values.

A US and EU joint report released this year on the potential economic impact of AI on the future of workforces found that while it can bolster workforce efficiency and innovation, it can exacerbate inequality.
“There is substantial evidence…AI has introduced and perpetuated racial or other forms of bias, both through issues with the underlying datasets used to make decisions, and by unintentional or seemingly benign decisions made by algorithm designers,” the report said. “The challenge for policymakers is to foster progress and innovation in AI while shielding workers and consumers from potential types of harm that could arise.”
The challenges are only expected to grow. From 35% to 45% of companies are expected to use AI-based talent acquisition software and services to help select and interview job prospects in the coming year, according to two recent studies.











 
 
 
Although there are few AI-related employment laws on the books at the moment, employers should expect that to change as the use of AI expands beyond just hiring and into performance evaluations, career projections, and promotion/termination decisions, according to Paul Starkman, an attorney with the Chicago-based law firm Clark Hill.
“And [that] may ultimately morph into consumer information protection laws, such as the European Union’s GDPR and California’s CCPA/CPRA,” Starkman said.
Hiring algorithms aren’t new
While the use of computer algorithms for screening prospective job candidates is not new — simple text searches have been used to parse resumes for decades — the sophistication of the applications and the breadth of their use has rapidly grown.











 
 
 
Nearly three in four organizations boosted their purchase of talent acquisition technology in 2022 and 70% plan to continue investing this year — even if a recession arrives — according to a survey by online enterprise hiring platform Modern Hire. Modern Hire’s fifth annual Hiring Report found that 45% of companies worldwide are using AI to improve recruiting and human resource functions. 
Experts caution that AI recruiting systems are only as good as the programmers who “feed the machine.” If an AI tool ingests data from  resumes of people previously hired by a company — and the recruiting departments that made those decisions harbored subconscious biases and preferences — those biases could be inherited by the AI tool.
For example, Amazon spent a decade training its applicant screening algorithm using its own hiring data. But once it went live, it reportedly showed bias against women. Just the word “woman” would cause the algorithm to rank female applicants lower than men.











 
 
 
Conversely, there are also top tips from online job search sites instructing applicants on how to write resumes that will pass automated screening software, making sure job candidates get seen.
While resume matching to job descriptions is the most common use of AI, tools are also being used to analyze patterns of potential candidates, including segmentation of candidates based on experience, education, skills, and their potential for retention once hired, according to Bret Greenstein, a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) partner and Data Analytics and AI researcher.
To perform more detailed searches for potential candidates, AI platforms must collect massive amounts of data on prospective candidates without their expressed permission, according to Eubanks, author of the book Talent Scarcity: How to Hire and Retain a Shrinking Workforce. That information can include facial recognition software and video interviews companies may keep, share, and filter with AI to determine favorable candidates.











 
 
 
In 2019, the Illinois Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act (“AIVI Act”) was signed into law, making the state the first to regulate  automated “interview bots” and other forms of AI to analyze applicants’ facial expressions, body language, word choices, and vocal tones during video interviews. And in 2020, Maryland enacted a similar law prohibiting employers from using facial recognition algorithms in hiring unless the applicant agreed to it.
In a 2019 blog, Starkman wrote that AI has been used on video interviews to determine whether an applicant shows characteristics of “successful” candidates. “Multi-state employers should take note of the AIVI Act, as it explicitly applies ‘when considering applicants for positions based in Illinois,'” he wrote.
The built-in bias problem
In an email response to Computerworld, Starkman said that without proper development and use, “AI systems can be biased, either because of bias in the data itself or in how the algorithm processes the data, and that may result in the unintended elimination of certain disabled candidates, foreign-born candidates, and others in discriminatory ways, if no safeguards are in place.”











 
 
 
For example, he said, AI-driven chatbots that communicate with job candidates should be monitored to limit the inadvertent receipt of information about disabilities and other personal characteristics that could lead to discrimination claims. “Another algorithm-assisted hiring and performance evaluation system ultimately had to be scrapped because it was based on past hiring practices and could not be trained to unlearn its programmer’s bias,” he said.
In another illustration, Starkman said software designed to disregard candidates with gaps in their resumes may have unduly impacted women candidates because they were statistically more likely to leave the workforce than men.
“I understand where their hearts are at — they want to make things safer and more equitable for the candidate population out there,” Eubanks said. “But the challenge is the rules they’re making [aren’t] always aligned with how companies hire.”
For example, Eubanks said, the Illinois law requires companies to delete any video interviews after 30 days. Many employees quit a short time after being hired. So, by the time the company goes back to look at a second-choice candidate, their video interview is deleted.











 
 
 
“Some of those nuances they put into laws…, [they’re] put in place by people who don’t always understand how hiring works,” Eubanks said. “They’re not doing the day to day [work]. And because of that, it creates some complexities, challenges, and headaches.”
To address the challenges, organizations should adopt a balanced approach that combines the strengths of AI with human judgment or a human in the hiring process loop that has expertise, Jurkiewicz said. “It is vital to ensure that AI-driven employment tools are explainable, unbiased, tested and compliant with applicable laws and ethical guidelines,” he said.
When developed, tested, monitored and implemented responsibility, AI-powered tools can significantly increase diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace.
Studies have shown that many underrepresented communities either lack the skills or do not understand the impact of not promoting their favorable attributes (skills, behaviors, competencies and experiences) as other, systemically well-trained communities can and have [done] historically, according to Jurkiewicz.
“AI can surface individuals’ positive attributes and encourage underrepresented groups to compete for work they may not have thought possible,” he said.

Every business will begin using Artificial intelligence in 2023 to ease employee work and increase efficiency for effective-efficient work time management..AI systems are typically used to predict future outcomes by analyzing large amounts of labeled training data to identify patterns and correlations. Today, machine learning is the primary method for developing AI systems. Artificial intelligence is generally regarded as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, human intelligence and ingenuity. The AI trend in 2023 has been the acceleration of AI applications in business to improve and automate processes and workspaces. In recent years, there are several different advancements in business technology. Nonetheless, none of the previous innovations have been as progressive or disruptive as artificial intelligence..Using Virtual Assistants.Artificial intelligence is providing a more personalized experience for your customers. It can also change how your company operates on the inside. AI bots can be used as personal assistants to help manage your emails, and calendar, and even provide recommendations for process streamlining. Artificial Intelligence assistants are programmed to answer questions from customers who call or chat online. Chatbots and virtual assistants are now essential components of marketing strategies for companies looking to acquire and retain customers..Streamlining Sales and Marketing.Marketers and sales teams can use artificial intelligence-powered tools to make more informed decisions. AI-powered customer support tools assist businesses in developing strong customer relationships. Similarly, AI tools can assist businesses in generating qualified leads and lowering customer churn. Sales teams are utilizing AI to better understand their customers while providing tailored solutions. E-commerce companies use AI to ask a few questions to their buyers and then customize the products and show only the ones that are the best fit for the customer's preferences. This increases the chances of conversion..Enhancing Data Security.AI is capable of churning through massive amounts of data to uncover key insights that can help brands and marketers target relevant customers, forecast market trends, and optimize pricing and promotions. AI is frequently used to safeguard private and sensitive information and to provide a foundation for security. AI can adjust the system when it detects threats and other security concerns, resolving them quickly and ensuring data confidentiality..Process Automation.With the astounding rise of AI, industry leaders predict the emergence of a new era of automation. Automation has been on the rise in technology over the last few decades. Various automation tools are being innovated and developed to help business processes become more agile. Home appliances were the first automation tools, followed by industrial robots. Advanced robots now work alongside humans in a variety of settings..Personalized Customer Experience.Artificial intelligence in business improves the customer experience. Customers are always looking for new and innovative services and tools. Customers have high expectations for the products and services they purchase as access to many digital services has increased. Eg: Smart Chatbot is designed to quickly guide and respond to your customers. It communicates with customers, listens to their needs, and offers a personalized experience. AI can quickly identify patterns in a day, and millions of transactions can be analyzed to provide personalized services to each customer..Saves Time and Reduce Cost.AI systems can optimize and complete repetitive tasks. This technology is used by businesses to notify customers or employees of delays or projected completion times. Poor scalability always has an immediate impact on business performance. AI-based systems aid in the automation of all aspects of your business process. AI-powered machines process data more quickly and efficiently. Thus, artificial intelligence in business saves time while increasing productivity and operational efficiency..Make Smarter Decision.AI is altering the way businesses make decisions about their operations and services. AI enables businesses to gain business insights and make better decisions. Businesses can analyze customer data and gain useful insights for making the best business decisions by integrating their information systems with AI. AI systems can predict what customers want and which products are in high demand in the market. This strategy would apply to retail and e-commerce businesses..Quality Control.Quality assurance and control are critical for businesses of all sizes. It is critical in e-commerce for the seller to quality control products out for delivery as well as products in warehouses before they become part of the outbound inventory. Businesses that can masterfully implement AI-based automation, particularly in the aforementioned areas, will see increased efficiency, cost savings, and better decision-making..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
