Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered HR technology threatens the life chances of hundreds of millions of people with disabilities worldwide, as well as those of us who will become disabled in time.


Eight of the 10 largest private U.S. employers use AI to track the productivity metrics of individual workers, many in real time, according to The New York Times. Yet even the NYT, when analyzing the risks to employees from disadvantaged backgrounds, in low paid jobs, failed to reference the threat to the millions of people in work whose interaction with the screen and camera is impacted by their disability and is therefore ‘not-standard’. While employers say “derelict workers” can be rooted out and industrious ones rewarded, no reference is made to how these productivity metrics should be adjusted to ensure disabled employees are assessed fairly. Susan Scott-Parker, a veteran disability inclusion campaigner and founder of the campaign Disability Ethical AI asks:

“What if the reason I don’t hit my key strike targets is my employer’s failure to give me a one-handed keyboard?”

Legal Challenge
PROMOTED
Surely, we already have the legal statutes required to challenge these inequities? The UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and most regulators, state that the obligation to make accommodations is triggered when the person makes the request. Yet time and time again automated requirement processes (including those that deploy AI) either do not permit the candidate to request adjustments; make it extremely difficult to do so; or make lodging the request stigmatising and embarrassing. Developers of AI HR technology are not incentivised to prove their products are safe for disabled job seekers or employees or indeed for anyone. Many providers state unequivocally that it is employers (not the AI software developer) who are legally (and they imply ethically) liable should a disabled job seeker complain they have been discriminated against.

The burden remains on individual disabled job seekers to prove they have been treated badly by an algorithm; an algorithm they didn’t even know was there. We all know job seekers rarely have the time or motivation to litigate when turned down for a job: we are a long way from the threat of legal risk genuinely influencing HR. So if not litigation, what could possibly persuade them that the risk this technology poses to the life chances of hundreds of millions (never mind the risk of losing out in the war for talent) outweighs the cost benefits to their recruiters?

Biased and Flawed
HR’s problem is much more than just the bias in the data – the science that developers claim underpins these tools all too often does not stand up to scrutiny. Recent research from New York University revealed that 2 tools used to predict your personality by analyzing the words you use in your resume and your LinkedIn profiles were, quite simply, not valid. As it turns out, your personality changes noticeably depending on if these tools rely on your resume or your LinkedIn profile.

Neither buyers nor AI developers understand the difference between the inevitable disability bias in the data and the discrimination triggered when the AI tool, which does not itself make adjustments, is dropped into a standardised, rigid, e-process, which by definition disadvantages candidates who require reasonable adjustments so as to compete on an equal basis. In other words “AI is the new flight of stairs” for the disabled candidate.

All big, predictive data sets rely on the notion of the statistical norm, what is known as the bell curve, from which we draw predictive correlations from averages. These are limited to serving the needs of around 67% of people who will score near average on whichever measurement taken and therefore the further away from any ‘norm’ you are, the less likely the AI will meet your need. Who decides what norms are taken, the extent to which your ‘category’ is present on the internet which feeds data into the AI learning, will determine your inclusion in an AI dominated world. This is dangerous for all minoritized groups.
Playing Catch Up
It is clear that we need to update our disability legislation to include digital discrimination, which includes HR based AI but also daily interactions which rely on memory, restrictive controls for making mistakes and more. Our technological capabilities have overtaken our human ethics and reasoning capacity. Scott-Parker tells the story of the person with Tourette’s who tried more than 100 times via emails, LinkedIn, telecalls, etc. to tell an employer that while he couldn’t hold the game controls for the recruitment assessment, he could do the job. She reports:
“We need legislation which creates an obligation to make it easy for candidates to request adjustments, effectively and in non-stigmatizing fashion, very early in the recruitment process. And what about our candidate with a facial disfigurement– he doesn’t need the employer to make any adjustments, he just needs the facial/ emotion recognition tech to not discard him when he looks into the camera. Some regulators are beginning to address the potential impact, positive and negative, of Artificial Intelligence on persons with disabilities. But their response is far from sufficient in a world where HR directors have not been taught that standardized automated recruitment processes discriminate against candidates with disabilities. And where existing disability discrimination legislation should and must apply but is proving so ineffectual. And where those leading the worldwide ‘Ethical and Responsible AI’ debate remain, for whatever reason, ‘disability oblivious’ or should that be ‘disability averse?’ What will it take to capture their attention?”
Four Key Takeaways
So if you are a developer or an HR AI buyer, here’s four key takeaways on hiring AI inclusion
(1) Take a pause before implementing any rigid system with no flexibility, for monitoring or hiring.
(2) Get in touch with a wide range of disabled people to consider the potential flaws from multiple perspectives.
(3) Assume there WILL be flaws and lend a hand ironing them out with pilot testing.
(4) Give everyone easy contact details if their disability prevents them from using the system, so that you can upgrade and improve, on the basis of feedback from the human beings trying (unsuccessfully) to navigate your systems.
The genie is out of the bottle as far as AI Tech is concerned, but we must not give up on our moral and legal principles of disability equality and inclusion.

Beyond Words: Large Language Models Expand AI’s Horizon


				The powerful models making waves in natural language processing are rippling across fields from healthcare to robotics and beyond.

  Back in 2018, BERT got people talking about how machine learning models were learning to read and speak. Today, large language models, or LLMs, are growing up fast, showing dexterity in all sorts of applications.
They’re, for one, speeding drug discovery, thanks to research from the Rostlab at Technical University of Munich, as well as work by a team from Harvard, Yale and New York University and others. In separate efforts, they applied LLMs to interpret the strings of amino acids that make up proteins, advancing our understanding of these building blocks of biology.
It’s one of many inroads LLMs are making in healthcare, robotics and other fields.
A Brief History of LLMs
Transformer models — neural networks, defined in 2017, that can learn context in sequential data — got LLMs started.
Researchers behind BERT and other transformer models made 2018 “a watershed moment” for natural language processing, a report on AI said at the end of that year. “Quite a few experts have claimed that the release of BERT marks a new era in NLP,” it added.
Developed by Google, BERT (aka Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) delivered state-of-the-art scores on benchmarks for NLP. In 2019, it announced BERT powers the company’s search engine.
Google released BERT as open-source software, spawning a family of follow-ons and setting off a race to build ever larger, more powerful LLMs.
For instance, Meta created an enhanced version called RoBERTa, released as open-source code in July 2017. For training, it used “an order of magnitude more data than BERT,” the paper said, and leapt ahead on NLP leaderboards. A scrum followed.
Scaling Parameters and Markets
For convenience, score is often kept by the number of an LLM’s parameters or weights, measures of the strength of a connection between two nodes in a neural network. BERT had 110 million, RoBERTa had 123 million, then BERT-Large weighed in at 354 million, setting a new record, but not for long.
As LLMs expanded into new applications, their size and computing requirements grew.
In 2020, researchers at OpenAI and Johns Hopkins University announced GPT-3, with a whopping 175 billion parameters, trained on a dataset with nearly a trillion words. It scored well on a slew of language tasks and even ciphered three-digit arithmetic.
“Language models have a wide range of beneficial applications for society,” the researchers wrote.
Experts Feel ‘Blown Away’
Within weeks, people were using GPT-3 to create poems, programs, songs, websites and more. Recently, GPT-3 even wrote an academic paper about itself.
“I just remember being kind of blown away by the things that it could do, for being just a language model,” said Percy Liang, a Stanford associate professor of computer science, speaking in a podcast.
GPT-3 helped motivate Stanford to create a center Liang now leads, exploring the implications of what it calls foundational models that can handle a wide variety of tasks well.
Toward Trillions of Parameters
Last year, NVIDIA announced the Megatron 530B LLM that can be trained for new domains and languages. It debuted with tools and services for training language models with trillions of parameters.
“Large language models have proven to be flexible and capable … able to answer deep domain questions without specialized training or supervision,” Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at NVIDIA, said at that time.
Making it even easier for users to adopt the powerful models, the NVIDIA Nemo LLM service debuted in September at GTC. It’s an NVIDIA-managed cloud service to adapt pretrained LLMs to perform specific tasks.
Transformers Transform Drug Discovery
The advances LLMs are making with proteins and chemical structures are also being applied to DNA.
Researchers aim to scale their work with NVIDIA BioNeMo, a software framework and cloud service to generate, predict and understand biomolecular data. Part of the NVIDIA Clara Discovery collection of frameworks, applications and AI models for drug discovery, it supports work in widely used protein, DNA and chemistry data formats.
NVIDIA BioNeMo features multiple pretrained AI models, including the MegaMolBART model, developed by NVIDIA and AstraZeneca.
In their paper on foundational models, Stanford researchers projected many uses for LLMs in healthcare.
LLMs Enhance Computer Vision
Transformers are also reshaping computer vision as powerful LLMs replace traditional convolutional AI models. For example, researchers at Meta AI and Dartmouth designed TimeSformer, an AI model that uses transformers to analyze video with state-of-the-art results.
Experts predict such models could spawn all sorts of new applications in computational photography, education and interactive experiences for mobile users.
In related work earlier this year, two companies released powerful AI models to generate images from text.
OpenAI announced DALL-E 2, a transformer model with 3.5 billion parameters designed to create realistic images from text descriptions. And recently, Stability AI, based in London, launched Stability Diffusion,
Writing Code, Controlling Robots
LLMs also help developers write software. Tabnine — a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that nurtures cutting-edge startups — claims it’s automating up to 30% of the code generated by a million developers.
Taking the next step, researchers are using transformer-based models to teach robots used in manufacturing, construction, autonomous driving and personal assistants.
For example, DeepMind developed Gato, an LLM that taught a robotic arm how to stack blocks. The 1.2-billion parameter model was trained on more than 600 distinct tasks so it could be useful in a variety of modes and environments, whether playing games or animating chatbots.
The Gato LLM can analyze robot actions and images as well as text.
“By scaling up and iterating on this same basic approach, we can build a useful general-purpose agent,” researchers said in a paper posted in May.
It’s another example of what the Stanford center in a July paper called a paradigm shift in AI. “Foundation models have only just begun to transform the way AI systems are built and deployed in the world,” it said.
Learn how companies around the world are implementing LLMs with NVIDIA Triton for many use cases.

What Is the Metaverse?
The Metaverse is a spatial computing platform that provides digital experiences as an alternative to or a replica of the real world, along with its key civilizational aspects like social interactions, currency, trade, economy, and property ownership – founded on a bedrock of blockchain technology.
Comparing the Metaverse to the internet in the 1970s and 1980s feels appropriate. Speculation about what it would look like and how people would use it arose as the foundation for the new communication form was laid. Although it was widely discussed, few people understood what it meant or how it would operate.
In retrospect, everything did not go precisely as some had hoped. It’s time to define this nebulous and complicated term, though, as the Metaverse is predicted to grow to be an $800 billion market by 2024. Tech titans like Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Google are investing heavily in making it a reality.
Metaverse is a mix of 3-dimensional worlds accessed through a browser, a mobile app, or a headset. It would allow people to have real-time interactions and experiences across large distances. A vast ecosystem of online applications will be the outcome.
The Metaverse is currently all the rage in the digital world because of its seemingly endless potential and objectives. Many investors are drawn to the Metaverse since it is at the cutting edge of technological and digital discoveries. It is an environment where the physical and digital worlds can coexist and significantly impact fundamental areas of daily life.
In essence, it is a universe of limitless, interconnected virtual communities where people can socialize, collaborate, and have fun using virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, smartphone apps, and other technologies. It will also include additional aspects of online life, such as social media and shopping.
As application scenarios mature, the Metaverse will develop into an exceptionally large-scale, extremely open, and dynamically optimized system. To create a system that can support various virtual reality application scenarios, creators from different fields will work together.
Understanding the seven layers of the Metaverse
Entrepreneur and author, Jon Radoff, has suggested that the Metaverse comprises seven distinct layers, with each layer influencing one aspect of the user experience:

Experience: Physicality’s limitations will be removed as physical space is dematerialized in the digital world. The Metaverse will provide people with a wide range of experiences we cannot currently enjoy.
Discovery: Through app shops, search engines, and rating websites, customers can learn about new platforms thanks to this layer. Finding new technology and communities requires this crucial step.
Creator economy: To produce digital assets or experiences, developers use various design tools and apps. Numerous platforms are developing more straightforward creative methods over time, for example, drag-and-drop tools.
Spatial computing: It blends mixed reality (MR), virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). Over time, it has developed into a significant technology category that enables users to interact with 3D environments for enhanced experiences.
Decentralization: There won’t be a single authority that rules the Metaverse. Scalable ecosystems will support business owners in providing a more comprehensive range of specialized digital items as the Metaverse expands, enabled by blockchain technology. 
Human interfacing: The hardware layer of the Metaverse must include human interfacing. Any virtual world can accept a person’s body as a 3D, realistic avatar.
Infrastructure: The technology that powers people’s gadgets, connects them to the network, and distributes content is part of the infrastructure layer. Over time, 5G networks will dramatically enhance the capacity of the Metaverse.

Examples of Metaverse platforms
To understand the meaning of the Metaverse, let us look at the leading platforms bringing this vision to life:

Decentraland: Decentraland is a blockchain-based virtual social environment. It’s used to build, trade, earn money, and explore virtual worlds. It’s essentially a digital ledger that permanently records bitcoin transactions across a network of computers and serves as the foundation for the universe of Decentraland. It provides exceptional opportunities for both studying and enjoying virtual experiences. Decentraland can be used to conduct meetings and trade in marketplaces for virtual goods, among other things. As in real life, interacting with other members is simple.
The Sandbox: It is a 3D virtual world hosted on the Ethereum blockchain where people may interact, build things, and make money. Numerous devices, including Windows phones and smartphones, are supported by Sandbox. With new virtual experiences, it provides people with chances for money-making. It is not inexpensive to use, though. To make this possible, SandBox has developed its SAND coin based on Ethereum. One can pay gas expenses on the Ethereum network can be paid with SAND tokens.
Bloktopia: Bloktopia uses virtual reality to provide users with an immersive experience. It is a 21-story virtual structure representing the 21 million Bitcoins currently in use. With new virtual experiences, it provides a variety of revenue-generating potential. People can design their avatars, participate in numerous activities, learn about cryptocurrencies, and purchase virtual “real estate” in the tower. Using the platform’s builder tool, you can also utilize this real estate to make artwork, games, sequences, and other things.
Meta Horizon Worlds: Users can socialize, have business meetings, explore the virtual environment, participate in virtual activities, and play games on Horizon Worlds. One of Meta’s VR social apps is Horizon Worlds. In the Horizon universe, blockchain technology is not utilized. It features functional VR building blocks, such as code blocks, music, and animation effects, that aid content developers in addition to navigable VR settings. As a test platform for virtual explorers with an invite-only policy, Facebook (now Meta Platforms Inc.) first debuted Horizons in August 2020.
Metahero: The Metahero project offers practical technology that lets users scan actual objects and move them into the Metaverse rather than a virtual realm. It focuses on bringing physical artifacts into the digital world utilizing ultra-HD photogrammetric scanning technologies. With their 3D avatars, users can use Metahero as a portal to explore the NFT, social media, fashion, and other aspects of the Metaverse. Metahero creates ultrahigh-definition avatars from real-world things, including people.

Features of the Metaverse
The working of the Metaverse is based on the following key features:
1. Incorporation of avatars
Creating digital avatars of oneself as a way to express one’s emotions and feelings uniquely is one of the core concepts of the Metaverse. Each person has their own digital identity, which can be static or animated and is distinctive to them. Digital avatars are a unique way to express oneself since, in addition to being precise reproductions of your actual form, they may also be recreations of your favorite celebrities or something completely original.
The concept of gamification is introduced when users have the chance to modify their avatars, creating a more engaging and dynamic experience.
Avatars can frequently be altered and can resemble their users’ real-life counterparts in some way. Avatars can occasionally also be computer applications. With the help of keyboards, joysticks, mice and specialized human-computer interfacing (HCI) devices, users may operate their avatars. More lifelike avatars might give viewers or anyone interacting with them a more immersive experience.
2. Blockchain-based operations
Blockchain allows consumers to safeguard their virtual assets and gives them digital proof of ownership, making it a crucial component of the Metaverse. The Metaverse is experiencing a growth in data volume, value, and significance of security and dependability. Blockchain skills and technology are necessary to ensure data validity in the Metaverse, and artificial intelligence is employed to protect its diversity and wealth of material.
Due to the numerous drawbacks of centralized data storage in systems like database management systems (DBMS), the Metaverse concept is incomplete without blockchain. Without the influence of a centralized organization, the blockchain-based Metaverse enables access to any digital place.
3. The use of virtual land (parcels)
The demand for virtual land on the Metaverse is soaring. On the Metaverse, land can be purchased by anybody for cryptocurrencies. The land is a non-fungible token (NFT), a blockchain asset class that one cannot trade for other things. Size refers to the fundamental number of pixels in a plot of Metaverse real estate.
Digital storefronts, virtual gaming, or even entertainment can be interacted with on virtual land. Its size and location will determine the use cases for the land. For instance, plots near a VR street may be worthwhile because of the potential for display advertisements.
4. Immersive Experiences (AR and VR)
Participants in the Metaverse will be able to have more immersive experiences that converge reality and the virtual world by utilizing mixed reality and AR/VR technologies. It is simple to understand why the Metaverse is becoming increasingly popular with each passing day: this will bring games to life, concerts and plays, and professional or educational encounters to seem more authentic.
The main building blocks of Metaverse projects are AR and VR. Three key components are required for augmented reality systems to function: the connectivity of actual and virtual environments, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D object rendering.
5. Intersection with artificial intelligence (AI)
As the driving force behind corporate research in fields including content analysis, self-supervised speech processing, robotic interactions, computer vision, and whole-body posture estimation, AI is crucial to the Metaverse. 
The business applications of the Metaverse can be delivered using AI in several different ways. AIOps, a subfield of AI, employs machine learning to assist companies in managing their IT infrastructure – which will soon apply to Metaverse systems. Further, AI-powered chatbots are becoming more and more common among organizations. In the Metaverse, AI bots with lifelike avatars can be employed for various purposes, including sales, marketing, and customer support.
6. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) for governance
A DAO is a governance body – like a council or a committee – that uses blockchain and smart contracts to reach a consensus for various decisions. According to DAO governance guidelines, the Treasury Wallet offers money for farming across several networks. To ensure that everyone in the organization has the opportunity to participate in the governance process, all decisions in DAOs continue to be governed by proposals and voting processes. The procedure is vital for assisting participants in casting ballots on significant decisions on managing Metaverse resources.
7. Reliance on Human-Computer Interface (HCI) technology
The massive online computer platform known as Metaverse comprises many diverse platforms, devices, and individual users on a big scale. The use of HCI in creating the Metaverse — specifically, how to integrate user activities into the virtual world — is crucial to attaining this objective.
In order to take part in specific activities, a human and a computer exchange information through a process called HCI. The most crucial benefit of human-computer interaction is that it aids groups needing formal training and information on how to connect with computing systems. 
8. A focus on social interactions
Humans communicate and interact in the Metaverse through avatars and visual representations of a user. Users can engage and converse both with the Metaverse and with other users. The setting for these exchanges is cyberspace, which serves as a representation of the real world.
But there are differences between the economic and physical limitations of actual locations. One can imagine our physical experiences in the real world merging into one virtual environment. People shall be able to navigate the limitless world with the aid of this holistic experience that will combine all of these disparate encounters.
9. Supporting Web3
The idea behind Web3 is to usher in a new era of the internet. It is the progression of user ownership and control over their online material, digital assets, and online personas. Web3 and the Metaverse technologies work in perfect harmony with one another. Web3 may provide the foundation for connectivity in the Metaverse because the Metaverse is a virtual environment and prefers a decentralized web.

Importance of the Metaverse
The Metaverse is not only an emerging new technology that’s part of today’s hype cycle. It builds on years of research on artificial intelligence and immersive interactivity and will transform businesses in several ways.
1. It is a new technique for interacting with users
You may leverage the Metaverse to your advantage as a company to provide customers with a whole new level of immersive experiences and entertainment options. Competitive advantage and attention will come to your business if it is one of the first to provide clients with a Metaverse experience.
There are several ways to promote your company in the Metaverse, including branded gaming experiences, virtual items, and AR/VR showrooms. Businesses may use the Metaverse to build 3D marketing experiences that are immersive, engaging, and capture the attention of potential customers in new, embracing ways.
2. Businesses can find opportunities for virtual events
It’s not uncommon to plan a conference or live event that can be viewed online and in person. Many people cannot travel to attend a professional conference or lecture, but that is still no excuse for not learning more. In contrast to a straightforward Zoom or Google Meet stream, a conference in the Metaverse can be a fully-fledged VR experience, with appropriate networking and participation opportunities, rather than just another video in a small window with comments underneath it. The spectators will feel more present and immersed in the experience thanks to VR and the Metaverse.
3. Companies can advertise and sell their goods
Several firms are already actively utilizing augmented reality to allow consumers to virtually try clothing or eyewear, see how new furniture might fit in their space, or receive a makeover with new hair or cosmetics. In the Metaverse, there is the potential to have the same experiences but in a better way.
If you have the option to lease or purchase commercial property, you can put up shops and showrooms where users can view your goods in the Metaverse. Users still avidly purchase virtual clothing and accessories today, proving that digital fashion is having a moment.
4. The Metaverse introduces a new media of advertising
Brands can engage with a massive global audience through Metaverse platforms in an e-commerce business. Businesses should anticipate introducing novel techniques for brand storytelling and general advertising in the Metaverse. Storytelling is one of the most effective methods for increasing brand awareness and identification.
People enjoy hearing tales that reveal much more about the business and its beliefs than simple slogans. Storytelling will eventually change into “story living,” when the audience members become active players or even characters with a say in the events rather than just being passive listeners.
5. It is possible to Improve teamwork and the creation of processes
Online meetings and distant teamwork are the new realities we have all come to terms with. These methods were imposed upon us, but they proved equally effective in a face-to-face office setting. One may further improve workflows by using the Metaverse. Meetings will appear as a group of individuals sitting in a room rather than as Zoom calls.
Meta has already started offering VR workrooms. The Metaverse offers workers a digital environment for communication and the ability to read one another’s body language and emotions and maintain an emotional bond.
6. E-wallets and cryptocurrencies make transactions for businesses simpler
Cryptocurrencies and the Metaverse go hand in hand. It will be challenging to enjoy the benefits of the digital world without a crypto wallet, even at this early adoption stage. Digital wallets are also supported by Metaverse, allowing businesses to control transactions across their virtual ecosystem.
Although this concept may overwhelm some business users, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have more benefits than drawbacks. With cryptocurrency, users and businesses may conduct any online transaction more easily. There’s no need to link your bank account to virtual worlds, payments only require a few clicks, and all transactions are transparent.

Takeaway
The Metaverse will be among the key technologies to reshape the digital world in the next few years. A recent survey by technology company Ciena found that 78% of business users worldwide would be interested in leveraging the metaverse. That is why it is so crucial for enterprises to prepare for this technology, strengthen blockchain capabilities, safeguard against Metaverse and blockchain security risks, and embrace a new era of the internet.

To Shneiderman and others in the AI field, the Tesla demo embodied some of the worst qualities of AI hype; its reduction to humanoid characters, its exorbitant promises, its promotion by self-interested entrepreneurs and its suggestion that AI systems or devices can function autonomously, without human guidance, to achieve results that outmatch human capacities.“When news articles uncritically repeat PR statements, overuse images of robots, attribute agency to AI tools, or downplay their limitations, they mislead and misinform readers about the potential and limitations of AI,” Sayash Kapoor and Arvind Narayanan wrote in a checklist of AI reporting pitfalls posted online the very day of the Tesla demo. Advertisement    “When we talk about AI,” Kapoor says, “we tend to say things like ‘AI is doing X — artificial intelligence is grading your homework,’ for instance. We don’t talk about any other technology this way — we don’t say, ‘the truck is driving on the road’ or ‘a telescope is looking at a star.’ It’s illuminating to think about why we consider AI to be different from other tools. In reality, it’s just another tool for doing a task.”That is not how AI is commonly portrayed in the media or, indeed, in announcements by researchers and firms engaged in the field. There, the systems are described as having learned to read, to grade papers or to diagnose diseases at least as well as, or even better than, humans.         Business   Column: Crypto is melting down. Here’s who’s hurt  Crypto was always reliant on the ‘bigger fool’ theory, and it has found its marks.June 16, 2022  Kapoor believes that the reason some researchers may try to hide the human ingenuity behind their AI systems is that it’s easier to attract investors and publicity with claims of AI breakthroughs — in the same way that “dot-com” was a marketing draw around the year 2000 or “crypto” is today. What is typically left out of much AI reporting is that the machines’ successes apply in only limited cases, or that the evidence of their accomplishments is dubious. Some years ago, the education world was rocked by a study purporting to show that machine- and human-generated grades of a selection of student essays were similar. The claim was challenged by researchers who questioned its methodology and results, but not before headlines appeared in national newspapers such as: “Essay-Grading Software Offers Professors a Break.” One of the study’s leading critics, Les Perelman of MIT, subsequently built a system he dubbed the Basic Automatic B.S. Essay Language Generator, or Babel, with which he demonstrated that machine grading couldn’t tell the difference between gibberish and cogent writing. “The emperor has no clothes,” Perelman told the Chronicle of Higher Education at the time. “OK, maybe in 200 years the emperor will get clothes. ... But right now, the emperor doesn’t.”    Science & Medicine   Column: News of the first gene-edited babies shows that science can’t police itself  Just over a year ago, CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna of UC Berkeley talked with me about the prospects that the gene-editing technology she had helped develop might be used in violation of ethical boundaries. Dec. 7, 2018  A more recent claim was that AI systems “may be as effective as medical specialists at diagnosing disease,” as a CNN article asserted in 2019. The diagnostic system in question, according to the article, employed “algorithms, big data, and computing power to emulate human intelligence.” Those are buzzwords that promoted the false impression that the system actually did “emulate human intelligence,” Kapoor observed. Nor did the article make clear that the AI system’s purported success was seen in only a very narrow range of diseases.AI hype is not only a hazard to laypersons’ understanding of the field but poses the danger of undermining the field itself. One key to human-machine interaction is trust, but if people begin to see a field having overpromised and underdelivered, the route to public acceptance will only grow longer. Oversimplification of achievements in artificial intelligence evokes scenarios familiar from science fiction: futurescapes in which machines take over the world, reducing humans to enslaved drones or leaving them with nothing to do but laze around.A persistent fear is that AI-powered automation, supposedly cheaper and more efficient than humans, will put millions of people out of work. This concern was triggered in part by a 2013 Oxford University paper estimating that “future computerization” placed 47% of U.S. employment at risk. Shneiderman rejected this forecast in his book “Human Centered AI,” published in January. “Automation eliminates certain jobs, as it has ... from at least the time when Gutenberg’s printing presses put scribes out of work,” he wrote. “However, automation usually lowers costs and increases quality.... The expanded production, broader distribution channels, and novel products lead to increased employment.”         Technology and the Internet   From the Archives: Why Robert Taylor is one of the most important figures in the history of computer science  Since it’s so fashionable these days to question whether government can do anything right – whether it’s regulating banks, bolstering the economy or overseeing healthcare – it’s worth noting that we’re about to celebrate the 40th anniversary of one of the most important federal initiatives of our time. Sept. 21, 2009  Technological innovations may render older occupations obsolete, according to a 2020 MIT report on the future of work, but also “bring new occupations to life, generate demands for new forms of expertise, and create opportunities for rewarding work.”A common feature of AI hype is the drawing of a straight line from an existing accomplishment to a limitless future in which all the problems in the way of further advancement are magically solved, and therefore success in reaching “human-level AI” is “just around the corner.”Yet “we still don’t have a learning paradigm that allows machines to learn how the world works, like human and many non-human babies do,” Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) and a professor of computer science at NYU, observed recently on Facebook. “The solution is not just around the corner. We have a number of obstacles to clear, and we don’t know how.” So how can readers and consumers avoid getting duped by AI hype?    Business   Who really benefits from putting high-tech gadgets in classrooms?  Who really benefits from putting high-tech gadgets in classrooms?Feb. 4, 2012  Beware of the “sleight of hand that asks readers to believe that something that takes the form of a human artifact is equivalent to that artifact,” counsels Emily Bender, a computational linguistics expert at the University of Washington. That includes claims that AI systems have written nonfiction, composed software or produced sophisticated legal documents. The system may have replicated those forms, but it doesn’t have access to the multitude of facts needed for nonfiction or the specifications that make a software program work or a document legally valid.Among the 18 pitfalls in AI reporting cited by Kapoor and Narayanan are the anthropomorphizing of AI tools through images of humanoid robots (including, sadly, the illustration accompanying this article) and descriptions that utilize human-like intellectual qualities such as “learning” or “seeing” — these tend to be simulations of human behavior, far from the real thing.Readers should beware of phrases such as “the magic of AI” or references to “superhuman” qualities, which “implies that an AI tool is doing something remarkable,” they write. “It hides how mundane the tasks are.”Shneiderman advises reporters and editors to take care to “clarify human initiative and control. ... Instead of suggesting that computers take actions on their own initiative, clarify that humans program the computers to take these actions.” It’s also important to be aware of the source of any exaggerated claims for AI. “When an article only or primarily has quotes from company spokespeople or researchers who built an AI tool,” Kapoor and Narayanan advise, “it is likely to be over-optimistic about the potential benefits of the tool.”The best defense is healthy skepticism. Artificial intelligence has progressed over recent decades, but it is still in its infancy, and claims for its applications in the modern world, much less into the future, are inescapably incomplete. To put it another way, no one knows where AI is heading. It’s theoretically possible that, as Musk claimed, humanoid robots may eventually bring about “a fundamental transformation of civilization as we know it.” But no one really knows when or if that utopia will arrive. Until then, the road will be pockmarked by hype.As Bender advised readers of an especially breathless article about a supposed AI advance: “Resist the urge to be impressed.”    Latest from Michael Hiltzik         Column: Who elected Elon Musk our arbiter of social norms?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. It involves the development of systems endowed with human intellectual characteristics, such as the ability to reason. In our 21st-century world, digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have taken center stage and are blazing the trail by changing the traditional way of doing business. Today with the aid of neural networks and intelligent algorithms, AI technology is replacing human thinking ability with machine control and is doing so with greater accuracy and precision, a development that was thought impossible a few years back. Let’s take a look at the role of AI and autonomous vehicles and how this technology will shape the future.
'It is expected that the combination of blockchain technology and self-driving cars will create a far better autonomous system.' -Jude ChukwudozieClick To Tweet
Autonomous Vehicle Benefits
The American computer scientist Eliezer Yudkowsky argues that by far the greatest danger about artificial intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it. In truth, most people don’t. For the record, AI and cars have a mutual history, and it was the dream of scientists to create intelligent machines that could think and act for themselves which gave birth to autonomous vehicles, or self-driving cars, which have turned out to become one of the best innovations of AI technology. Let’s dive into some of the benefits of these vehicles.
#1: Detection Algorithms
Autonomous vehicles have neural networks and specific algorithms. These are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Language (ML) based object detection algorithms. These serve to collect data, analyze objects, and make accurate decisions while on the road. These features also enable these intelligent machines to provide solutions to problems occurring in advance of real time by predicting events through the swift processing of data. 
For example, autonomous vehicles can predict a potential threat like a car collision ahead or behind and take a decision in real time to avert it. With good data collection sensors, these pieces of information are processed and results are obtained as actions. In addition to the neural network and specific algorithms, self-driving cars have five core components that help them optimize operation in real time, namely: computer vision, sensor fusion, localization, path planning, and control.  They also have an enhanced degree of AI perception technology for detecting pedestrians, vehicles, cyclists, and work and obstacles that are 300 yards away. These embedded algorithms help these automobiles to determine and suggest alternative routes based on real-time traffic conditions. Indeed, an amazing technology.
#2: Autopilots
Quite recently, Tesla manufactured electric cars that are self-driving and equipped with autopilots to enable automatic steering, accelerating braking, lane changing, and parking actions. Added to these features is the fact that these cars have the potential to reduce emissions globally, a milestone achievement from fuel-driven vehicles. Today, autonomous vehicles can be found in some of the biggest cities of the world. Even heavy-duty trucks without drivers that can deliver goods over long distances have been manufactured. This has not only reduced transportation costs significantly but also reduced the loss of human lives through accidents, much of which arise from human errors.
#3: AI-enhanced Features
In recent times, some automotive companies have manufactured autonomous vehicles with enhanced AI features like personal AI assistants, radar detectors, and cameras, all of which serve to prioritize security among other functions. These self-driving cars have implemented AI-enhanced features which are a huge advancement over their predecessors. Self-driving can learn about traits exhibited by the driver like driving speed, preferred car temperature, driving mood, observance of traffic signs, regular songs, or favorite radio stations. By rating driving skills, these autonomous vehicles have helped to change bad driving behaviors and habits.
Autonomous Vehicle Drawbacks
Though one of the most anticipated technologies in this century, AI and autonomous vehicles have been associated with a number of problems:

Autonomous vehicles are limited to more narrow situations and clearer weather. Just like the human eyes, sensors do not do well in fog, rain, or snow.
Autonomous vehicles rely on maps and sensors to function effectively. Unfortunately, these maps have limited test areas at the moment. Creating and maintaining maps for self-driving cars is a difficult and time-intensive process and one that is yet to happen. Its test areas will also need to be increased. In the U.S. for instance, detailed maps would have to be built and maintained across the 4 million miles of public road and this is no small task.
Tesla’s self-driving cars have raised certain safety concerns. In a certain L.A. Times editorial, they are said to be, “crossing double yellow lines and heading toward oncoming traffic, failing to stop for cars crossing the street and steering toward metal posts and roadside boulders.”
Autonomous vehicles controlled by AI robots cannot engage in complex social interactions with other drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. These situations require generalized intelligence and common sense to navigate, qualities that robots do not possess at the moment.
Tesla’s autopilot has a problem detecting flashing lights, road cones put in place for temporary road and traffic maintenance, and most emergency vehicles traveling in the opposite direction. Again, most of the crashes happen in the dark which points to an apparent flaw in the autopilot technology.
The working mechanism of smarter and more connected autonomous vehicles can suffer from cyber attacks which would disrupt their systems and operational processes. When this happens, commuter stress, delayed traffic flow, collisions, accidents, and even loss of human lives become inevitable.
Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), otherwise known as autopilot, accounts for a number of crashes and fatalities in the U.S. In most cases, it has been found to shut off around one second before the crash.

Path to the Future
In the crypto world, blockchain technology makes use of mathematical logic and algorithm to create an autonomous system that is both transparent and immutable. Here in the automotive world, it is expected that the combination of blockchain technology and self-driving cars will create a far better autonomous system that would increase the transparency and accuracy of decisions made by these cars.
Car tech giants are working hard to implement natural conversational AI within vehicles, which will utilize speech recognition, natural language understanding, speech synthesis, and smart avatars to boost comprehension of context, emotion, complex sentences, and user preferences. In the future, AI will be engaged in improving vehicle safety, performance, and efficiency, addressing health hazards and environmental issues. It could also be used to create cars that can communicate with each other and with other road users.

Job recruitment tools that claim to use artificial intelligence to avoid gender and racial biases may not improve diversity in hiring, and could actually perpetuate those prejudices, researchers with the University of Cambridge argued Sunday, casting the programs—which have drawn criticism in the past—as a way of using technology to offer a quick fix for a deeper problem.

Key Facts


In a paper published by Philosophy and Technology, researchers looked at claims from several companies that offer AI-powered recruitment tools, many of which claim to eliminate biases and promote diversity by hiding the names, genders and other identifiers of candidates, and some of which rank candidates based on resume scans, online assessments and analysis of applicants’ speech and facial expressions.



The researchers—two professors at the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Gender Studies—argued that these tools may actually promote uniformity in hiring because they reproduce cultural biases of the “ideal candidate,” which has historically been white or European males.



The tools also might not improve diversity because they are based on past company data and thus may promote candidates who are most similar to current employees.



There is “little accountability for how these products are built or tested,” Eleanor Drage, a study co-author and researcher with the University of Cambridge Center for Gender Studies, said in a statement, adding the technology could serve as a “dangerous” source of “misinformation about how recruitment can be ‘de-biased’ and made fairer.”

“By claiming that racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination can be stripped away from the hiring process using artificial intelligence, these companies reduce race and gender down to insignificant data points, rather than systems of power that shape how we move through the world,” Drage said in a statement.
Tangent
Amazon announced in 2018 it would stop using an AI-recruiting tool to review job applicants’ resumes after it found the system was strongly discriminating against females. This is because the computer models it relied on were developed based on resumes submitted to the company over the past 10 years, which mostly came from male applicants.
PROMOTED
Key Background
Organizations have increasingly turned to AI to help manage job recruitment processes. In one 2020 poll of more than 300 human resources leaders cited by the authors of Sunday’s paper, the consulting firm Gartner found 86% of employers use virtual technology in their hiring practices, a trend that has accelerated since the Covid-19 pandemic forced many to shift work online. While some companies have argued AI can offer a more cost- and time-effective hiring process, some experts have found the systems have a tendency to promote—rather than eliminate—racial and gender biased hiring by replicating existing prejudices from the real world. Several U.S. lawmakers have aimed to tackle biases in artificial intelligence systems, as the technology continues to evolve quickly and few laws exist to regulate it. The White House this week released a “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights,” which argues algorithms used in hiring have been found to “reflect and reproduce existing unwanted inequities” or embed new “bias and discrimination.” The blueprint—which isn’t legally binding or an official government policy—calls on companies to ensure AI does not discriminate or violate data privacy, and to make users aware of when the technology is being used.
What To Watch For
In a list of recommendations, the authors of Sunday’s Philosophy and Technology paper suggested companies that develop AI technologies focus on broader, systematic inequalities instead of “individualized instances of bias.” For instance, they suggest software developers examine the categories used to sort, process and categorize candidates and how these categories may promote discrimination by relying on certain assumptions about gender and race. Researchers also contend HR professionals should try to understand how AI recruitment tools work and what some of their potential limitations are.
Surprising Fact
The European Union has classified AI-powered hiring software and performance evaluation tools as “high risk” in its new draft legal framework on AI, meaning the tools would be subject to more scrutiny and would need to meet certain compliance requirements.

You may also be wondering what exactly that means. Let me explain what we are doing and why and what it means for our students, our faculty, our university and our state. Artificial intelligence is all around us — from Amazon’s predictions of products you might like to the facial recognition technology that unlocks your cell phone. Companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple are spending billions on artificial intelligence, but small companies need artificial intelligence, too, if they want to operate efficiently, effectively and maximize their impact.More:UF/IFAS uses high-tech methods to improve farming practices affecting springsAnother opinion:UF's new AI supercomputer will change how students learnYet, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence says the U.S. is woefully behind in training the next generation of AI personnel, the workforce that will ensure our national security and economic competitiveness. We must build an AI workforce quite quickly — by 2025, according to the commission. So, what are we doing at UF to train this generation of AI experts? Traditionally, people who are trained in artificial intelligence writ large — whether it’s machine learning or natural language processing — acquire their knowledge through computer science or engineering degrees. We’ve turned this model on its head. We’ve taken AI knowledge beyond those specialized environments and spread it across the entire university. AI pervades everything we do, from courses UF offers to research our faculty conduct to the university’s own business practices. A few examples. Students can earn certificates in artificial intelligence by taking three courses that cover fundamentals, ethics — an essential framework to ensure equitable and fair use of this technology — and a final course specific to their major. A student in the School of Architecture, for example, would take a course about the application of AI in the built environment. Beyond the certificate, we offer 230 courses in AI and data science, with more than 6,000 students currently engaged in these courses. This allows us to train many more students in artificial intelligence than we could ever do if we kept this knowledge siloed in a computer science department. It also allows students to learn about AI more easily because they are studying it within their major. We think this is a fantastic way to build the workforce of the future. But there is more. We’ve hired an additional 130 faculty who specialize in artificial intelligence across our institution — from the College of the Arts to the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.  Dr. Dwayne Mitchell from the College of Medicine, for instance, studies pediatric and adult brain cancers. As a world leader in clinical-translational research, his toolbox has gotten more powerful thanks to UF Health’s GatorTron, the world’s first natural language processing model designed to mine data from clinical notes, billions of words, at a speed humans can’t replicate. This allows researchers to reduce time needed to identify patients to enroll in trials from months to minutes. Faster trials means faster results and, ultimately, quicker paths to treatments and ways to improve lives. UF researchers are using AI in many other ways: To produce better tasting fruit, identify potential crop damage and create better tourism experiences. Now, we are not doing this work alone. We have partnerships with such companies as IBM, L3Harris, SAS and Vobile, which is opening an office in Gainesville in part because of UF’s focus on artificial intelligence. And we are working with state partners — the Florida Technology Council and the Florida High Tech Corridor. And we have an incredible partner in NVIDIA, which gifted us the fastest AI supercomputer at a higher education institution in the U.S. — HiPerGator AI. NVIDIA also created an AI technology center at UF, embedding its engineers among our faculty to assist their research work. We’ve shared this resource with the other 11 universities in the State University System, allowing them to use it for teaching and research. We’ve also partnered with FAMU, Miami-Dade College and Palm Beach State College to train their faculty so they can provide more AI courses for their students. We recognize that we cannot wait until students arrive on a college campus to start getting educated about AI. So, our faculty are also working with the Florida Department of Education to develop the nation’s first AI curriculum for public schools. AI is transforming Florida’s economy into one that is tech driven and high wage, and we want to part of that transformation as a leader and a partner. David Reed is the director of the Artificial Intelligence Academic Initiative Center at UF.Join the conversationLetters to the editor present the opinions of readers on news stories and other pieces published by The Sun. Share your opinions by sending a letter to the editor (up to 200 words) to letters@gainesville.com.
