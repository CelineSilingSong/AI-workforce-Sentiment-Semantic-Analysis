Print        Like many artists, I’ve looked in horror at generative image AI, a technology that is poised to eliminate humans from the field of illustration.In minutes or hours, apps such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney can churn out polished, detailed images based on text prompts — and they do it for a few dollars or for free. They are faster and cheaper than any human can be, and while their images still have problems — a certain soullessness, perhaps, an excess of fingers, tumors that sprout from ears — they are already good enough to have been used for the book covers and editorial illustration gigs that are many illustrators’ bread and butter.They are improving at an astounding rate. Though some AI fans give lip service to the idea that this technology is meant to help artists, it is, in fact, a replacement, as explicit as the self-acting spinning mule, a machine commissioned by British factory bosses in 1825 to break the power of striking textile workers. Advertisement    This replacement could only be accomplished through a massive theft. The most popular generative art AI companies, Stability AI, Lensa AI, Midjourney and DALL-E, all trained their AI’s on massive data sets such as LAION-5B, which is run by the German nonprofit LAION.These data sets were not ethically obtained. LAION sucked up 5.8 billion images from around the internet, from art sites such as DeviantArt, and even from private medical records. I found my art and photos of my face on their databases. They took it all without the creator’s knowledge, compensation or consent.Once LAION had scraped up all this work, it handed it over to for-profit companies — such as Stability AI, the creator of the Stable Diffusion model — which then trained their AIs on artists’ pirated work. Type in a text prompt, like “Spongebob Squarepants drawn by  Shepard Fairey,” and the AI mashes together art painstakingly created over lifetimes, then spits out an image, sometimes even mimicking an artist’s signature.   AIs can spit out work in the style of any artist they were trained on — eliminating the need for anyone to hire that artist again. People sometimes say “AI art looks like an artist made it.” This is because it vampirized the work of artists and could not function without it.John Henry might have beaten the steam drill, but no human illustrator can work fast enough or cheap enough to compete with their robot replacements. A tiny elite will remain in business, and its work will serve as a status symbol. Everyone else will be gone. “You’ll have to adapt,” AI boosters say, but AI leaves no room for an artist as either a world creator or a craftsman. The only task left is the dull, low-paid and replaceable work of taking weird protrusions off AI-generated noses.While they destroy illustrators’ careers, AI companies are making fortunes. Stability AI, founded by hedge fund manager Emad Mostaque, is valued at $1 billion, and raised an additional $101 million of venture capital in October. Lensa generated $8 million in December alone. Generative AI is another upward transfer of wealth, from working artists to Silicon Valley billionaires. Advertisement    All this has made illustrators furious. After ArtStation, the popular portfolio site for the entertainment and game design industry, decided to allow AI-generated art, the front page became a sea of anti-AI graphics, uploaded by artists in a coordinated rebellion. ClipStudioPaint pulled a generative AI feature after protests by its users. Artists such as “Hellboy” creator Mike Mignola have spoken out against AI art. Famed animator Hayao Miyazaki called it an “insult to life itself.”AI pushers have told me that AI is a tool which artists can use to automate their work. This just shows how little they understand us. Art is not scrubbing toilets. It’s not an unpleasant task most people would rather have the robots do. It is our heart. We want to do art’s work. We make art because it is who we are, and through immense effort, some of us have managed to earn a living by it. It’s precarious, sure. Our wages have not risen for decades. But we love this work too much to palm it off to some robot, and it is this love that AI pushers will never get.They already seem omnipresent, but generative art AIs are at their beginning. If illustrators want to stay illustrators, the time to fight is now. Data sets such as LAION-5B must be deleted and rebuilt to consist only of voluntarily submitted work. AIs trained on copyrighted art must also be pulled. Above all, the work of real people should be valued, not exploited to enrich a few tech plutocrats.

					Bailey Graham   Leave a comment             Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming a game-changer in the film industry. From scriptwriting and casting to special effects and distribution, AI is transforming the way movies are made and seen. While there are many benefits to using AI in filmmaking, there are also potential downsides that need to be considered. One of the biggest advantages of AI in the film industry is its ability to save time and resources. Machine learning algorithms can analyze large datasets of existing scripts and use that data to generate new, original stories. This not only saves time for screenwriters, but it also opens up new possibilities for storytelling and creativity. AI is also being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of casting decisions. AI-powered platforms can analyze a vast amount of data, including past performance data and social media activity, to predict which actors are most likely to be successful in a given role. This can help casting directors make more informed decisions and save time and resources. In addition, AI is being used to enhance the visual effects (VFX) in films. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize and classify different objects in a scene, making it easier and faster to add VFX elements. This can save time and money for VFX studios, as well as enhance the overall quality of the film. However, there are also potential downsides to the use of AI in the film industry. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for AI to replace human jobs. As AI algorithms become more advanced, there is a risk that they could replace human screenwriters, casting directors, and VFX artists, leading to job losses in the film industry. Another potential downside is the loss of human creativity and personal touch. While AI algorithms can generate new stories and make accurate predictions, they may lack the unique perspective and emotional depth that comes from human creativity. This could lead to a homogenization of storytelling and a decrease in the overall quality of films. There are several ways that humans can retain their jobs in the film industry even when AI is capable of doing the same work. One approach is to focus on the unique capabilities of human creativity and emotion. While AI algorithms may be able to generate stories and make predictions, they may lack the unique perspective and emotional depth that comes from human creativity. This could lead to a homogenization of storytelling and a decrease in the overall quality of films. By highlighting the value of human creativity, filmmakers can differentiate themselves from AI and justify their continued employment. Another approach is to focus on tasks that are difficult or impossible for AI to do. For example, tasks that require human empathy, social skills, or physical dexterity may be more difficult for AI to perform. By focusing on these tasks, humans can retain their jobs even in the face of AI competition. Finally, humans can also stay competitive by continuously learning and adapting to new technologies. As AI algorithms become more advanced, it will be important for humans to stay up-to-date on the latest developments and to learn how to use AI tools effectively. This could involve taking courses, attending workshops, or collaborating with AI experts to learn new skills and stay ahead of the curve. By investing in their own education and development, humans can maintain their value in the film industry. Overall, it’s clear that AI is having a major impact on the film industry. From scriptwriting and casting to VFX and distribution, AI is transforming the way movies are made and seen. While there are many benefits to using AI in filmmaking, there are also potential downsides that need to be considered. As AI continues to evolve, it will be important to strike a balance between the advantages of technology and the value of human creativity.

            Is broccoli or beetroot the best option for your personal health? Which foods are likely to trigger the biggest glucose spikes or cholesterol surges in your blood?
    

            Custom diets are the next frontier in nutrition science – and artificial intelligence (AI) will play a key role in figuring out what each of us should, and shouldn’t, be eating. 
    

            An ambitious program called Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH) kicked off in the US in January 2022 when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded $170 million to fund institutions across the country to conduct a five-year study with 10,000 participants.

            CNN spoke to Holly Nicastro, program director in the NIH office of nutrition research and coordinator of NPH, about the aims and scale of the project and how AI can benefit our health by helping to devise optimal diets for every individual.
    

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.


CNN: There’s already a lot of information about healthy eating. Why is your approach different, and what’s the goal?


Holly Nicastro: There is a lot of conflicting information, and there is no one-size-fits-all diet to stay healthy. The goal of NPH is to use AI to develop algorithms that predict individual responses to food and dietary patterns. 
    

            Our approach is different because we’re looking at a comprehensive set of factors, many of which are not typically examined in nutrition science. The NPH study will examine how genes, the microbiome, biology and physiology, one’s environment, lifestyle, health history, psychology, and social determinants of health impact individual responses to diet. Furthermore, we’ll be studying one of the largest and most diverse cohorts of participants for a precision nutrition study. 
    

CNN: Who are your participants?


Nicastro: Participants for NPH will be recruited from the All of Us Research Program, which is run by NIH. All of Us is inviting one million people across the US to help build one of the most diverse health databases in history. Most participants come from groups that have been previously underrepresented in the biomedical sciences. All of Us participants have provided information through surveys, electronic health records, biological samples, and digital health technologies like Fitbits. The diversity of the All of Us Research Program cohort will allow NPH to examine factors such as age, sex, race and ethnicity.

Nicastro: NPH incorporates three modules. In Module 1, information on all the participants’ normal day-to-day diets will be collected. In Module 2, a subset of Module 1 participants will eat three different diets selected by researchers. For Module 3, a smaller, and separate, subset of participants from Module 1 will participate in a two-week study in research centers where their food will be carefully controlled by researchers. 
    

             Each module will conclude with a meal challenge test. Participants will fast overnight and then consume a standardized breakfast meal or drink so that we can examine their responses, such as blood glucose levels, over several hours.

            We’ll be using mobile photography apps and wearable devices that can passively capture information on what people are eating. Participants will wear continuous glucose monitors and accelerometers which gather information about physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep. Researchers will also analyze various biomarkers – like blood lipids and hormone levels – and the stool microbiome.
    

            The NPH study will link in data from the All of Us program and analyze it using AI. This approach creates an unprecedented opportunity to move nutrition research toward personalized nutrition because unlike human researchers, AI can sift through and process vast amounts of data quickly and translate connections between data points into algorithms. These can predict an individual’s response to foods and dietary patterns, taking into account the role of genes, proteins, the microbiome, metabolism, and environmental and lifestyle factors. 
    

CNN: Who stands to benefit the most from precision nutrition approaches?


Nicastro: Some of the earliest direct benefits could be for people at risk for diabetes or who have trouble regulating their blood glucose levels. Blood glucose monitors that attach to the skin allow us to learn how an individual’s blood sugar will change after eating particular foods, food groups, or meals, and then predict those responses based on the individual’s traits. This will help us develop tailored plans that prevent large blood sugar swings.
    

            We’re also using precision nutrition approaches to see how well we can predict other responses to diet, including changes in blood pressure, blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels, mood and cognition. 
    

CNN: Are we really what we eat and how much could we improve our health through diet?


Nicastro: Poor diet is one of the leading causes of preventable disease and death around the world, and it is a huge driver of health care costs. Our diet affects our growth, development, risk and severity of disease, and overall wellbeing. Worldwide, almost 40% of adults have obesity or are overweight, over 30% have hypertension, and other diet-related chronic diseases are on the rise. Recent studies have indicated that about one in five deaths can be attributed to poor diet. Improving our diets has tremendous potential to change the health of the world. 
    

            If everyone followed population-wide guidance, like the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, we would expect to see improvements. These guidelines generally focus on including foods rich in nutrients and limiting added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. However, this one-size-fits-most approach only gets us so far. We see some degree of individual variability in participants’ responses in virtually all diet and nutrition intervention studies, and patients and consumers are increasingly seeking tailored approaches.
    

CNN: I’m convinced! When will custom dietary advice become widely available to the public?


Nicastro: Precision nutrition is already in practice. Clinical practitioners will provide different recommendations based on someone’s disease profile, health history, or health and wellness goals. For example, recommendations for someone looking to control their diabetes will look very different from recommendations for someone who needs to increase their muscle mass.

            Nutritional advice will become increasingly precise over the coming years. In the short term, more data points will be used to generate more tailored recommendations. Longer term, I hope to see the predictive factors identified by NPH being used during standard intake by health care professionals. This may involve having patients use new technologies like continuous glucose monitors or smart toilets that analyze the stool microbial composition in real time, or it may involve a simple genetic signature test.
    

             For us to realize the full benefits of precision nutrition approaches, it will be essential to study and address barriers to following dietary recommendations. Precision approaches should focus on dietary recommendations that not only optimize someone’s health, but also that are easy for an individual to follow based on their own resources, lifestyle, preferences, and abilities.

After ingesting the images and corresponding text, the AI model begins to connect the words a dachshund to the visual representation of a dachshund.A model is only as good as its training data. Bias found on the internet can show up in results, such as a prompt for a “CEO” that produces only white men.You have selected in outer space and the style of stained glass. The AI creates an internal map of concepts by converting images and texts into numbers and by assigning some associations higher probabilities (ie. playing the guitar often involves hands).While the AI may never have encountered an image of  a dachshund in outer space playing a guitar in the style of stained glass, it has now been trained to interpret the database of words and pictures to create such an image.Researchers then add “noise,” or visual clutter, to the data set of images.Visual noise is a pattern of random dots or pixels, similar to television static. This clutter acts as an overlay, obscuring the original image.Researchers add more and more noise to train the model to recognize that this underlying image still contains  a dachshund. This is known as the “diffusion model” of machine learning, and most popular text-to-image generators use it.Next, the AI learns to subtract noise to return a heavily obscured image to one that is clear.Over time, the AI gets so good at “de-noising” images that it gains the ability to generate a detailed image from pure noise.

Employment Law
Can I be fired and replaced with artificial intelligence?



December 21, 2022








The short answer is yes. Your employer can fire you and fill your position with artificial intelligence (AI) — even if you are effectively performing the duties of the job.
This is called a termination without cause. In Canada, companies can let non-unionized workers go for any reason, as long as:

They are provided full severance pay
The reasons for their dismissal aren’t discriminatory

However, it’s very unlikely that your employer would be able to fire you for cause, which would mean no severance package or access to Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.
To justify dismissing you for cause, the company would have to prove progressive disciplinary measures were applied and that a less severe punishment would be inappropriate.
This type of termination is reserved for the worst kinds of workplace offences, such as theft or assault.
LEARN MORE
• Can employers use AI to decide who to fire?
• Severance for provincially regulated employees
• Rights to severance for federally regulated employees

WATCH: Employment lawyer Lior Samfiru explains what rights employees have if they are being fired or let go on an episode of the Employment Law Show.


How can I determine if reasons for my dismissal were discriminatory?
In Canada, reasons for terminating a non-unionized employee are considered discriminatory when they infringe on a protected ground under federal or provincial human rights legislation.
Examples of protected grounds include:

Age
Race
Gender
Religion
Family status

While recent advancements in AI, such as ChatGPT, are providing companies with new ways to improve productivity, the implementation of technological solutions at work can’t violate the human rights of staff.

Example: Beth has worked at a call centre in Calgary for 25 years. Her employer announces that they are now using an AI platform to help with inbound calls. A few weeks later, Beth and four of her colleagues are told that they are being fired. When Beth follows up on the reasons for her dismissal, she learns that she is being terminated because she is two years away from retirement. After explaining her situation to an employment lawyer, she is informed that she has been discriminated against based on her age. Beth’s lawyer tells her that she is entitled to full severance pay, human rights damages, and potentially reinstatement to her former position with full back pay.

If you are fired or let go, and believe that a reason for your dismissal was discriminatory, contact an experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP immediately.
We can help you secure the compensation you are entitled to through a wrongful dismissal claim as well as a human rights complaint.

Filing a human rights complaint
Non-unionized employees in Canada have the right to work in an environment that is free of harassment and discrimination.
If you do experience discrimination at work, you can file a human rights complaint.
The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, Alberta Human Rights Commission, and B.C. Human Rights Tribunal, are examples of organizations that are responsible for dealing with complaints pertaining to their province’s human rights legislation.
Successful complaints can result in compensation, and even reinstatement, for the individual who experienced discrimination.

My employer is pressuring me to resign so AI can do my job instead, what should I do?
Your employer can’t pressure or force you to quit your job. This is known as a forced resignation.
If you are forced to quit your job for any reason, contact an experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP.
In addition to severance pay, you could be owed compensation for any damages associated with the end of your employment.
SEE ALSO
• Do I get severance if I quit?
• Severance pay in a recession
Can my employer punish me if I refuse to resign from my position?
Employers in Canada can’t punish non-unionized workers for refusing to quit their job.
If you are disciplined or fired by your company because you didn’t resign from your position, seek legal counsel immediately.
The experienced employment law team at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP can help you secure the compensation you are entitled to, and ensure that your rights are properly enforced.

• Employment Law Show: What to know about workplace reprisals
Can my employer make major changes to my job if I refuse to resign?
In Canada, non-unionized workers don’t have to accept significant changes to their employment.
Large modifications such as a demotion, cut in pay, reduction in hours, or negative change to commission are illegal.
When substantial changes are made to your job without your consent, the law allows you to resign and seek full severance pay through a constructive dismissal claim.
If you believe that you have been constructively dismissed, don’t quit your job until you speak with an experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP.

My employer offered me an alternate role working with the AI, what should I do?
Some jobs can’t be completely replaced by artificial intelligence. Instead of firing you, your employer might offer you a new job supervising or assisting the technology.
If you are offered an alternate role at the company, this will likely include:

A new employment contract
Something additional in exchange for taking the new job (i.e. greater work flexibility or a signing bonus)

However, if you have a good reason for rejecting the new job (i.e. reduced pay or unfavourable conditions in the contract), you can still receive full severance pay.

Example: John was hired to write financial advice articles for a local newspaper in Vancouver. The paper tells him that it’s now using AI to create the financial advice pieces. Instead of writing the articles, John’s employer offers him a new job proofreading and fact-checking the content produced by the AI platform. When reviewing the new employment contract, he realizes that the position will require him to accept a 20 per cent pay cut. Since the alternate role would result in a significant change in pay, John has a good reason for turning down the offer and is provided full severance pay by the newspaper.

Even without a good reason for refusing the alternate role, you can still pursue your minimum entitlements at the end of your employment.

Instead of accommodating my disability, my employer replaced me with AI, what should I do?
In Canada, employers are legally obligated to assist non-unionized workers who can’t perform their job duties due to a disability (either physical or psychological), religious reasons, or other constraints under federal or provincial human rights legislation.
As part of their duty to accommodate, companies may have to:

Change your job requirements
Provide someone to help you complete your tasks
Make changes to the shift itself

The goal is to ensure that you can continue to perform your job duties, despite your disability. Your employer can’t get out of their duty to accommodate by having artificial intelligence do your job instead.
If you believe that your company hasn’t properly fulfilled their duty to accommodate, contact an experienced employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP.
We can review your situation and help you secure the compensation that you are entitled to through a constructive dismissal claim.

Credit: GettyFor those who came late: At the start of the month, San Francisco research group OpenAI released a free preview of its artificial intelligence platform, ChatGPT. Users who register at chat.openai.com type in a request about almost anything and receive a written answer seconds later.When asked, it wrote instructions on how to remove peanut butter from a VCR in biblical verse: “And it came to pass that a man was troubled by a peanut butter sandwich, for it had been placed within his VCR, and he knew not how to remove it.” It created a dairy-free recipe for macaroni cheese and an essay comparing and contrasting the nationalism of political scientist Benedict Anderson and philosopher Ernest Gellner. It refused to write about the benefits of eating glass, declaring “there are none”.The quality of the responses shocked many.“The technology proved to be astounding,” said Nick Bilton in Vanity Fair.Technology columnist Kevin Roose wrote: “We are not ready.”The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald’s science writer Liam Mannix referenced sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke’s quote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”.AdvertisementAnd The New York Times wondered: “What would Plato say about ChatGPT?”Related ArticleAII’m a revolutionary AI bot. I wrote this article to explain how I workTime pressed on, so I did what workers across a vast quantity of industries are about to start doing. I outsourced. In the small ChatGPT oblong at the top of my screen, I asked the AI platform: “Write three sentences of a newspaper column about ChatGPT in the style of Stephen Brook.”The screen went blank for several seconds, and I foolishly thought I had thwarted the technology. Then up popped this:“ChatGPT is a revolutionary new language model developed by OpenAI. With its advanced ability to understand and generate human-like text, ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. Whether used for personal conversation or business communication, ChatGPT is sure to be a game-changer in the world of natural language processing.”Hmm. House style is to spell revolutionise with an S and not a Z. And this is a neat summary but dull. Perhaps my writing style has not digitally disseminated quite as widely as I had hoped.But pretty soon, the urge to outsource will become irresistible to all of us. The list of potential ChatGPT content opportunities is endless – thank-you notes, Christmas cards, staff memos, press releases, exams, speeches.In fact, it has already happened. One mate proudly revealed that he had used an AI program to write the thank-you notes to his wedding guests. The written word was once the highest form of human expression, but the digital age has turned us lazy. Why order takeaway when you can get home delivery?Emily Bell, former director of digital content for Guardian News and Media and founder and director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at the Columbia Journalism School, wrote that ChatGPT proved her greatest fears about AI and journalism. “Not that bona fide journalists will be replaced in their work – but that these capabilities will be used by bad actors to autogenerate the most astounding amount of misleading bilge, smothering reality.”Strap in. Already, the Queensland police killings offer a warning, showing us the spread of disinformation online can rapidly lead to the radicalisation of people, and sometimes turn them violent.Related ArticleAnalysisScienceIs AI coming of age - or starting to reach its limits?Liberal MP David Coleman was onto the job implications quicker than most. The former digital executive –he was once the head of digital for Nine Entertainment Co (publisher of this masthead) and chair of ninemsn – says ChatGPT is a remarkable product that will create opportunities but also cause massive change.“AI will upend entire industries and radically change the global economy – soon,” he said. “Because the implications of AI are unsettling, politicians will tend to downplay it. But there’s no doubt that jobs will be lost in some industries and it would be dishonest to pretend otherwise.”Meanwhile, in the real world, the big scandal revealed by the Harry & Meghan documentary was that Prince William screamed at Harry.The fallout appears unresolvable. But might ChatGPT come to the rescue? I asked it: Tell me how Prince William and Prince Harry can resolve their dispute.It replied in seconds. “It is not appropriate for me to speculate on the resolution of a personal dispute between Prince William and Prince Harry.”Related ArticleExplainerRobots‘Die as a human or live forever as a cyborg’: Will robots rule the world?But then it couldn’t help itself, offering up this advice: “It would be best for them to communicate openly and honestly with each other and try to find a resolution that works for both of them.”Wading in with some unwarranted advice?

As a data enthusiast, there are several additional lucrative employment alternatives to think about such as a self-taught AI engineer. This article will walk you through the relatively new position of AI Engineer..A fast LinkedIn search for AI engineering jobs worldwide returned 30,267 results. This figure reflects the industry's growing need for AI engineers. MAANG companies are always seeking qualified AI software engineers and research engineers with competitive pay. There has never been a better moment to sharpen your artificial intelligence abilities if you're a newcomer to the field or a software engineer wishing to change careers. A six-figure job in MAANG companies is for sure if you are an AI engineer..In the data sector, the position of an AI engineer is relatively new. Companies used to recruit people with a variety of specialties, including data scientists, data engineers, and machine learning engineers. Then, these individuals would collaborate in various teams to create and implement some people. Many AI-driven businesses are beginning to understand that these professions are closely related, nevertheless. There are people who are adept at all three who can develop, scale, and apply AI models..People with all of these skill sets are rather uncommon and are very valuable to corporations. One of the main causes of the enormous demand for AI engineers is that, as seen by the rise in the number of job advertisements requesting an AI engineer's expertise..AI engineers frequently combine their expertise with that of software developers, data scientists, and data engineers. This individual is capable of developing and deploying fully functional, scalable artificial intelligence systems for end users. Based on the objectives of their businesses, AI experts use deep neural networks and machine learning algorithms to get useful business insights. Engineers in artificial intelligence move between software development and machine learning algorithm implementation as issue solutions..Engineers in AI might come from a wide range of backgrounds. An AI engineer possesses a very unique set of talents from other professionals. You should have good technical and programming expertise in addition to being proficient at developing machine learning models using statistics and arithmetic. As a result, the majority of AI engineers have backgrounds in computer science, software engineering, data science, statistics, or mathematics..But let's say you don't have a quantitative degree or come from one of these educational backgrounds. If so, you may develop all the necessary abilities on your own by working on engaging AI projects and gaining first-hand knowledge of what an artificial intelligence engineer's job entail..In disciplines like computer science and statistics, having a quantitative degree is advantageous but not required. If a person learns all the aforementioned machine learning tools and technologies and possesses good statistical and coding abilities, they may potentially find employment as a self-taught artificial intelligence engineer. All these Artificial Intelligence talents may be taught to oneself from the beginning. We'll outline the many measures you may take to prepare yourself to become an artificial intelligence engineer in the next section..This career path may be ideal for you if you like programming and have an interest in the subject of machine learning. To become an AI engineer, there is not much competition. The employment market is oversaturated with people trying to get into highly competitive fields like software engineering and data science. The entrance hurdle is significantly higher for AI engineers since they must possess a skill set that covers software engineering and other data-related positions..Without the ability to manage data and implement machine learning models, statisticians and data scientists are unable to become AI engineers. Without a working knowledge of statistics and deep learning, software developers cannot become AI engineers. Because fewer people meet the requirements for employment as AI engineers as a result, there is less competition for those positions..So, what is the average pay for AI engineers? Around US$165K is the average annual compensation for AI engineers in the US. The median wage for a data scientist is about US$130K, thus this remuneration is greater. Additionally, it exceeds the average annual salary of a software developer, which is about US$100,000. Similar to pay for other career roles, AI engineer salaries vary by employer, region, sector, and educational background..Although the position of an AI engineer is still very new in the data sector, it is here to stay. The market is in desperate need of people with the abilities needed to develop scalable AI solutions. For the creation of machine learning products, businesses of all sizes recruit AI developers. Another benefit of working as an AI engineer is that, if you so want, you may quickly switch over to other careers in software engineering, data engineering, data science, and machine learning engineering. Additionally, an AI engineer's salary is far greater than both a data scientist's and that of a software engineer..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
