AI can help us fight climate change. But it has an energy problem, too



          Artificial intelligence (AI) technology can help us fight climate change – but it also comes at a cost to the planet. To truly benefit from the technology’s climate solutions, we also need a better understanding of AI’s growing carbon footprint, say researchers. &nbsp;

AI is changing the way we work, live and solve challenges. It can improve healthcare, protect elephants from poachers, and work out how broadband should be distributed.But it could be most valuable as a range of applications helping humanity fight our biggest threat - climate change. AI can strengthen climate predictions, enable smarter decision-making for decarbonising industries from building to transport, and work out how to allocate renewable energy.AI’s relevance as a climate change fighting tool comes at a time when there are increasing ethical concerns linked largely to a data-hungry form of the technology called machine learning, where computer systems analyse patterns in existing data to make predictions and decisions. Machine learning applications have raised concerns about creeping public surveillance, intentional misuse, privacy, transparency and data bias that can lead to discrimination and inequality.It is part of a wider ethics debate in the EU about how to use AI for the benefit of human beings, the challenges that the technology poses and how best to tackle them.‘We have to realise that AI is, in fact, a piece of software that we people design,’ said Virginia Dignum, a professor in social and ethical artificial intelligence at Umeå University in Sweden. We must be responsible for how we use AI, she says. ‘(It is) not some kind of magic that comes from outer space and happens to us. No. We make AI happen.’Perhaps surprisingly, one issue that is only beginning to be discussed is the environmental footprint of AI.Image credit - HorizonNetflixThe algorithms that tells us, for example, what to watch on Netflix tonight have an environmental impact, according to Prof. Dignum. ‘AI uses a lot of energy,’ said the computer scientist, who is part of a 52-person expert group advising the European Commission on trustworthy and ‘human-centric’ AI.The storage, and particularly the processing, of data to train algorithms – the ‘recipes’ computers use to make calculations – in data centres or in the cloud across different centres with rows of machines doing computations consume energy, she says.For one algorithm to train itself on whether an image shows a cat, for instance, it needs to process millions of cat images. The ecosystem for information and communications technology, of which data centres are a part, are comparable to aviation in terms of fuel emissions.  ‘It’s a use of energy that we don’t really think about,’ said Prof. Dignum. ‘We have data farms, especially in the northern countries of Europe and in Canada, which are huge. Some of those things use as much energy as a small city.’She draws on a University of Massachusetts, US, study which found that training a large AI model to handle human language can lead to emissions of nearly 300,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent, about five times the emissions of the average car in the US, including its manufacture.Swedish researcher Anders Andrae has forecast that data centres could account for 10% of total electricity use by 2025.Although AI has been around for about half a century, the question of environmental impact – and other ethical issues - is only arising now because the techniques developed over decades can now be used in combination with an explosion in data and strong computational power, Prof. Dignum explains. ‘It’s time to start thinking about doing AI in a more environmentally friendly way,’ she said.AI might be part of the problem, but it also has the potential to help us find solutions for climate change.Professor Felix Creutzig, who leads a working group called Land Use, Infrastructures and Transport at Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin, Germany, investigates ways to tackle climate change using data science. He is part of a group of international researchers advocating for more collaborative climate change solutions using machine learning.“It’s time to start thinking about doing AI in a more environmentally friendly way.Prof. Virginia Dignum, Umeå University, SwedenVast opportunitiesProf. Creutzig sees vast AI opportunities to ramp up the applications for targeted climate change solutions at the street scale, or even building level, that can be applied in cities. Urban spaces are of particular concern, as they’ll be home to more than two-thirds of the world’s population by 2050 and are incredibly resource-intensive.‘It’s cool to work with technologies and to invest in low-carbon technologies, but to achieve anything close to the 2 degree or 1.5 degree target (for limiting global warming) we must reduce energy demands drastically and can achieve that by improved spatial configurations,’ he said.Improving spatial use can help address issues such as urban heat islands, a phenomenon where urban environs built of steel and cement store heat and warm cities. ‘That’s a key problem of our future,’ he said.Greening cities or using wind channel architecture to create ventilation are ways to help cities deal with extreme heat that can be guided by AI.Prof. Creutzig is employing a method called stacked architecture, which uses machine learning with traditional mechanical modelling to, for instance, obtain insights into how buildings behave when it comes to temperature or energy demand, to find the best design for low energy use and high quality of life. These can then inform urban planning and policymakers.Precisely because AI has so much potential, he also thinks its use should be combined with regulation, such as on not storing unnecessary data or constraining its use, so that it is targeted, efficient and doesn’t cause a new problem. However, he says that there’s currently not enough research into machine learning’s environmental impact. ‘There’s a lot to explore,’ he said.‘Basically it (AI) is a fuel of application … it can lead to a new energy use,’ said Prof. Creutzig. ‘And this would be the opposite of what we want to have. The main example I'm thinking about is smart mobility and autonomous driving because these are really driven by AI or will be modelled by AI.’For Andrea Renda, head of global governance and digital economy expert at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, Belgium, and also a member of the expert group advising the European Commission, AI needs to be developed and deployed so it can meet society’s needs and protect the environment by saving more energy than it expends.‘All of these (data-intensive techniques) are extremely dangerous for the environment unless you can use those techniques in a way that, while using a lot more energy, save a lot more energy because they provide for more efficient solutions,’ said Prof. Renda.Both Prof. Renda and Prof. Dignum agree that basic research into AI forms that are less data hungry than machine learning, such as automated reasoning, should be an EU priority. This would mean less use of personal data and energy consumption.Prof. Dignum has been working with ‘synthetic data’, which is not based on real examples. It could be used to generate, for example, images of broken bones not based on sensitive patient data in order to train an algorithm on what to spot in an X-ray. This data can then be discarded so that it’s not stored.Some researchers in the US have also proposed that AI research should include reporting on computational costs of training algorithms to enhance transparency.To make sure AI is used to help, and not hinder, our society, Prof. Renda says it’s time to merge the two big debates of today. ‘One is on digital technology and the other one is on sustainable development, and in particular the environment. If we use the former to save the latter, I think we will have made the best possible use of the resources that we have,’ he said. ‘Otherwise we're just wasting time.’On 25 September, Prof. Dignum will be participating in a session called Human-centered Artificial Intelligence at the EU’s Research & Innovation days to help shape the scope of EU research and policy on AI from 2021-2027.European Research & Innovation DaysThe European Research & Innovation Days, which will take place in Brussels, Belgium, from 24 to 26 September, are designed to bring together policymakers, academics, industry, civil society and entrepreneurs to discuss how research and innovation can help tackle the major issues facing the EU over the next decade.The idea is to seek a wide range of opinions from experts and interested parties about priorities for the first four years of the EU’s upcoming €100 billion research funding programme, Horizon Europe. In addition to conference sessions, policymakers from the EU and national administrations will be available throughout the event in a space called Horizon Village to gather further input from participants.The event, which is set to be an annual affair, consists of a policy conference to shape the Horizon Europe work programme, an innovation hub for innovators and investors to network, and a public exhibition called Science is Wonderful!.

  Do industries shed or create jobs when they adopt new labour-saving technologies? This column shows that manufacturing employment grew along with productivity for a century or more, and only later decreased. It argues that the changing nature of demand was behind this pattern, which led to market saturation. This implies that the main impact of automation in the near future may be a major reallocation of jobs, not necessarily massive job losses.

Last month a UN panel of government experts debated autonomous weapons and found Google to be eschewing AI for use in weapons systems and engaging in best practice.View image in fullscreenLaura Nolan resigned from Google last year in protest. Photograph: Johnny Savage/The GuardianNolan, who has joined the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and has briefed UN diplomats in New York and Geneva over the dangers posed by autonomous weapons, said: “The likelihood of a disaster is in proportion to how many of these machines will be in a particular area at once. What you are looking at are possible atrocities and unlawful killings even under laws of warfare, especially if hundreds or thousands of these machines are deployed.“There could be large-scale accidents because these things will start to behave in unexpected ways. Which is why any advanced weapons systems should be subject to meaningful human control, otherwise they have to be banned because they are far too unpredictable and dangerous.”Google recruited Nolan, a computer science graduate from Trinity College Dublin, to work on Project Maven in 2017 after she had been employed by the tech giant for four years, becoming one of its top software engineers in Ireland.She said she became “increasingly ethically concerned” over her role in the Maven programme, which was devised to help the US Department of Defense drastically speed up drone video recognition technology.Instead of using large numbers of military operatives to spool through hours and hours of drone video footage of potential enemy targets, Nolan and others were asked to build a system where AI machines could differentiate people and objects at an infinitely faster rate.Google allowed the Project Maven contract to lapse in March this year after more than 3,000 of its employees signed a petition in protest against the company’s involvement.“As a site reliability engineer my expertise at Google was to ensure that our systems and infrastructures were kept running, and this is what I was supposed to help Maven with. Although I was not directly involved in speeding up the video footage recognition I realised that I was still part of the kill chain; that this would ultimately lead to more people being targeted and killed by the US military in places like Afghanistan.”Although she resigned over Project Maven, Nolan has predicted that autonomous weapons being developed pose a far greater risk to the human race than remote-controlled drones.She outlined how external forces ranging from changing weather systems to machines being unable to work out complex human behaviour might throw killer robots off course, with possibly fatal consequences.“You could have a scenario where autonomous weapons that have been sent out to do a job confront unexpected radar signals in an area they are searching; there could be weather that was not factored into its software or they come across a group of armed men who appear to be insurgent enemies but in fact are out with guns hunting for food. The machine doesn’t have the discernment or common sense that the human touch has.“The other scary thing about these autonomous war systems is that you can only really test them by deploying them in a real combat zone. Maybe that’s happening with the Russians at present in Syria, who knows? What we do know is that at the UN Russia has opposed any treaty let alone ban on these weapons by the way.“If you are testing a machine that is making its own decisions about the world around it then it has to be in real time. Besides, how do you train a system that runs solely on software how to detect subtle human behaviour or discern the difference between hunters and insurgents? How does the killing machine out there on its own flying about distinguish between the 18-year-old combatant and the 18-year-old who is hunting for rabbits?”The ability to convert military drones, for instance into autonomous non-human guided weapons, “is just a software problem these days and one that can be relatively easily solved”, said Nolan.She said she wanted the Irish government to take a more robust line in supporting a ban on such weapons.“I am not saying that missile-guided systems or anti-missile defence systems should be banned. They are after all under full human control and someone is ultimately accountable. These autonomous weapons however are an ethical as well as a technological step change in warfare. Very few people are talking about this but if we are not careful one or more of these weapons, these killer robots, could accidentally start a flash war, destroy a nuclear power station and cause mass atrocities.”Autonomous threat?Some of the autonomous weapons being developed by military powers around the world include:

The US navy’s AN-2 Anaconda gunboat, which is being developed as a “completely autonomous watercraft equipped with artificial intelligence capabilities” and can “loiter in an area for long periods of time without human intervention”.


Russia’s T-14 Armata tank, which is being worked on to make it completely unmanned and autonomous. It is being designed to respond to incoming fire independent of any tank crew inside.


The US Pentagon has hailed the Sea Hunter autonomous warship as a major advance in robotic warfare. An unarmed 40 metre-long prototype has been launched that can cruise the ocean’s surface without any crew for two to three months at a time.

Most recently, Hong Kong-based Insilico Medicine developed GENTRL, an AI system for drug discovery. In order to speed up drug development and accelerate target identification, biopharma is increasingly turning to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Most recently, Hong Kong-based Insilico Medicine developed GENTRL, an AI system for drug discovery. In its tests, GENTRL was able to “ideate and generate” a new molecule from beginning to end in 21 days—six molecules, in fact. In a more surprising move, Insilico has made GENTRL’s source code available as open source. GENTRL stands for general tensorial reinforcement learning. It has a two-step algorithm that maps and explores new compound structures within the scaffolding of chemical parameters. It then uses a machine learning model to “learn” DDR1 and common kinase inhibitors. “The development of these first six molecules as an experimental validation is just the start,” stated Alex Zhavoronkov, chief executive officer of Insilico Medicine. “By enabling the rapid discovery of novel molecules and by making GENTRL’s source code open source, we are ushering in new possibilities for the creation and discovery of new life-saving medicine for incurable diseases—and making such powerful technology more broadly accessible for the first time to the public.” Insilico developed GENTRL with WuXI AppTec, a contract research organization (CRO) and drug discovery company, and Alan Aspuru-Guzik, professor of chemistry and computer science at the University of Toronto and founder and chief scientific officer of quantum computing startup Zapata Computing. Of the six molecules GENTRL developed, four inhibit DDR1 at nanomolar concentration. DDR1 is a protein target associated with a variety of diseases, including fibrosis. Details of the research were published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. In May, AstraZeneca announced a long-term collaboration deal with BenevolentAI, a UK-based company focused on combining computational medicine and advanced artificial intelligence. The two companies will focus on using AI and machine learning to discover and develop new drugs for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). “The vast amount of data available to research scientists is growing exponentially each year,” stated Mene Pangalo, AstraZeneca’s executive vice president and president BioPharmaceuticals R&D. “By combining AstraZeneca’s disease area expertise and large, diverse datasets with BenevolentAI’s leading AI and machine learning capabilities, we can unlock the potential of this wealth of data to improve our understanding of complex disease biology and identify new targets that could treat debilitating diseases.” In early April, only a few weeks after Concerto HealthAI inked a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb, it signed a similar deal with Pfizer. The commonality was Concerto focuses on oncology-specific Real-World Data (RWD) and advanced AI for Real-World Evidence (RWE) generation, an area of increasing interest for biopharma companies. Concerto HealthAI will collaborate with Pfizer on Precision Oncology using Concerto’s eurekaHealth platform, artificial intelligence (AI) models and Real World Clinical Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and healthcare claims. They will use data from clinical medical practices that participate in the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s CancerLinQ initiative and others throughout the U.S. In March 2019, Oxford Biomedica announced it had inked a two-year R&D collaboration with Microsoft Research. The goal is to improve the yield and quality of next-generation gene therapy vectors—typically viruses—using AI and machine learning. Oxford Biomedica will focus on its expertise in vector development and large-scale manufacturing. The team in Microsoft’s Station B initiative will use AI and machine learning to increase the yield and improve the purity of Oxford Biomedica’s lentiviral vectors while cutting costs. Station B will use the Microsoft Azure intelligent cloud platform to analyze large data sets created by Oxford Biomedical and develop in silico models and novel algorithms to advance cell and gene delivery technology. And other companies are focusing on AI and machine learning. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a clinical-stage biotech company that combines AI, experimental biology and automation to discover and develop drugs at scale. On Jan. 7, 2019, Recursion announced progress in its collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company on identifying novel preclinical candidates for rare diseases. In 18 months, the partnership had led to the evaluation of Takeda preclinical and clinical compounds in more than 60 unique indications, with new therapeutic candidates identified in more than half-a-dozen diseases. As a result, Takeda exercised its option for drug candidates in two rare diseases and the two companies have extended the partnership. Also in January, Recursion signed a licensing deal with the Ohio State Innovation Foundation (OSIF), acquiring rights to OSU-HDAC42, a clinical stage compound that will be developed by Recursion for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a rare tumor syndrome. And a year ago, in August 2018, the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Insilico Medicine, and Juvenescence, a human longevity company, founded Napa Therapeutics to develop drugs against a novel aging-related target. Napa Therapeutics is built on research in NAD metabolism conducted by Eric Verdin, president and chief executive officer of the Buck Institute. His laboratory will collaborate with Napa, using Insilico’s drug development platform to accelerate compound discovery. “This is a unique opportunity to use cutting-edge AI to accelerate drug discovery,” Verdin said in a statement at the time. “The Buck is excited to join forces with Insilico and Juvenescence as we work to eliminate the threat of age-related disease for this and future generations.” In the most recent news, Insilico’s GENTRL conceptualized and created 30,000 novel small molecules that had the potential to work against fibrosis. Then, it screened those and synthesized the six most promising molecules and then tested them in vitro for both selectivity and metabolic stability. They then tested it in mouse models, where it showed favorable activity.', 'author': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry/#person', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry/'}, 'name': 'Mark Terry', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry'}], 'copyrightYear': '2024', 'datePublished': '2019-09-11T15:46:13.000Z', 'dateModified': '2021-04-15T18:09:47.000Z', 'headline': 'Insilico Medicine’s GENTRL: Artificial Intelligence Continues to be Priority for Biopharma', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#article', 'image': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 350, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/5642428/2147483647/strip/false/crop/625x350+0+0/resize/625x350!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F5199F126-13F3-4BE5-8289-F17B201FF2F3.jpg', 'height': 625}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/24e0068/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F5199F126-13F3-4BE5-8289-F17B201FF2F3.jpg', 'height': 1200}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#webpage'}, 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#webpage'}}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Website', 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'WebPage', 'potentialAction': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma'}], '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#webpage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#primaryimage'}, 'name': 'Insilico Medicine’s GENTRL: Artificial Intelligence Continues to be Priority for Biopharma', 'datePublished': '2019-09-11T15:46:13.000Z', 'dateModified': '2021-04-15T18:09:47.000Z', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/insilico-medicine-s-gentrl-artificial-intelligence-continues-to-be-priority-for-biopharma/#primaryimage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/24e0068/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F5199F126-13F3-4BE5-8289-F17B201FF2F3.jpg', 'height': 1200}]",,,,,,,,,

HeimkenAdvertisementA German artificial intelligence scientist was awarded the prestigious annual Körber Prize for European Science on Friday.
The prize comes with €1 million and honors Professor Bernhard Schölkopf's work into the development of mathematical algorithms which enhance machine learning and enable artificial intelligence devices.
His research is of growing importance in the age of ubiquitous technology. ""We are in the middle of the third industrial revolution,"" the 51-year-old scientist said regarding his work.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is already increasingly important in day-to-day life and is used in online language translation services and in smartphone cameras' ability to recognize faces in photographs.

Mimicking the brain
Schölkopf is a physicist, mathematician and computer programmer who heads the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in the southern German city of Tübingen. His research specifically deals with better enabling machines' abilities to react in unfamiliar situations, for example in the development of self-driving cars and with the processing of medical images.
Schölkopf and his team's so-called support-vector machines attempt to mimic the human brain in how it makes decisions and responds to circumstances. This also means that the machines can easily classify and categorize objects.
The Körber Foundation's prize, which was presented at a ceremony in Hamburg's town hall, has the highest cash value of any in Germany and also is one of the most renowned in Europe.
The prize has been awarded since 1985 and awards those who shape and affect the future within the sphere of life and physical sciences. The fact that they chose to honor the relatively ""young"" branch of AI shows that its importance is likely to increase in the coming years.

Peggy Valcke (CiTiP) elected vice-chair of the Council of Europe’s new Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI)









On 11 September 2019, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (the continent’s leading human rights organization founded in the aftermath of the Second World War and consisting of 47 Member States) set up an Ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI). The mandate of the CAHAI is to examine the feasibility and potential elements of a horizontal legal framework for the development, design and application of artificial intelligence, based on the Council of Europe’s standards on human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Peggy participated in CAHAI’s first meeting from 18-20 November in Strasbourg as the Belgian representative for Flanders (with Mrs. Laureline Nootens for Wallonia-Brussels). She was elected by the Council of Europe’s Member States to co-chair the committee in the coming year (mandate renewable for 1 year). Chair of CAHAI is Gregor Strojin, State Secretary at the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Slovenia. 
At the first meeting, delegates were provided with a comprehensive overview of existing non-binding texts (ethical documents, guidelines, recommendations, declarations) relating to artificial intelligence, binding international legal frameworks already applicable to artificial intelligence, as well as artificial intelligence strategies, policies and legal frameworks at the national level. First ideas were exchanged about the feasibility of an overarching “Oviedo Convention” for the area of artificial intelligence, in which (by now) well-established ethical principles for AI (such as transparency, explicability, fairness, accountability, ‘human in the loop’ and termination obligation…) would be enshrined in a Framework Convention (which could then be further specified by existing or new instruments that would apply in specific contexts, like criminal investigations, judicial lawmaking, processing of personal data, etc.).

(Anna Quinn/Patch.)FORT GREENE, BROOKLYN — A new high-tech factory opening in one of the Brooklyn Navy Yard's oldest buildings is perhaps the best symbol for how the borough's history as a manufacturing powerhouse is taking on a new life, Navy Yard CEO David Ehrenberg said Thursday. The 25,000-square-foot space, known as Building 20, was once a bustling indoor factory that outfitted U.S. Navy battleships with armored plating when it was built more than 150 years ago. And while that type of manufacturing dwindled decades ago — turning the building into a rarely used storage space — a new face of the industry is moving in, Ehrenberg said. Find out what's happening in Fort Greene-Clinton Hillwith free, real-time updates from Patch.SubscribeNanotronics, which has been working out of the Navy Yard's New Lab, officially broke ground in Building 20 Thursday on what will become the city's first ""smart factory,"" or a factory that uses largely digital production rather than a traditional assembly line. The company manufactures a line of tools armed with cutting-edge artificial intelligence used to make manufacturing more efficient. ""Nanotronics represent to us the new breed of manufacturers that are beginning to grow and expand here at the yard,"" Ehrenberg said.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, who was at the event to represent Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who announced Thursday that the state would invest $2.25 million into the new factory through a grant. Hochul, who called Nanotronics' new space the start of a ""new industrial revolution,"" said the company and others at the Yard are bringing back the sort of high-paying, quality jobs that Brooklynites were once used to at the manufacturing industry's peak.""I see a rebirth in this complex,"" she said. ""Every single business that comes here gives a new opportunity for people to come and work and regain that industrial legacy — that heritage — we are proud to call our own here in Brooklyn."" The smart factory will be up and running as early as next spring, Nanotronics Chief of Staff James J. Williams III said. The company plans to build out the first half of the space by the end of the year and will likely finish by March.  When it's done, the space will more than double Nanotronics Brooklyn staff of 65 people to up to 190, Williams said.  The build-out will include creating mezzanine-level spaces and lower-level ""pods"" to house both the company's manufacturers and the research, development and administrative staff, architects said. (Anna Quinn/Patch)The design is based on Nanotronics' emphasis on bringing together its engineers with those who produce its high-tech machines so they can continue to evolve. The machines, like the nSpec microscope, are used for inspections in Nanotronics customers, which range from medical companies to autonomous vehicles manufacturers.  The ""smart technology"" in the machines means that it uses less energy, produces more and makes it so staff is spending time more efficiently, co-founder Matthew Putman said.  ""The way a regular factory worked was that you would have a lot of people doing a lot of manual tasks or working with what I would call crude robotics ... a smart factory uses a lot of incredibly new technology ... so not only are people speaking with people about how to build something, they're telling a machine how to do it,"" Putman said. ""It frees the humans to come up with new ideas.""Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
