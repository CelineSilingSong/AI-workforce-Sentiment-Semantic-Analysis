Redacción MAPFRE   @mapfre “Technology has changed the world, bringing knowledge within reach and expanding a range of opportunities. Persons with disabilities can benefit enormously from such advances, yet too many lack access to these essential tools.” These words were spoken by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2014, and remain as relevant today as they did then. Ban Ki-moon also pointed out that technology could help people with disabilities to harness their full potential within their communities and workplaces, and make the most of their capabilities. Six years later, advances have been made, and technologies such as Artificial Intelligence have made major steps forward, so much so that it is shaping up to be a key tool for including people with disabilities in a society that tends to segregate them. Inclusion versus exclusionThis is precisely the most important issue when it comes to technology and disability. There is no doubt that advances greatly help people who suffer from physical, sensory or mental disabilities (the many examples of which will be covered later), however, it is also true that this same technology can oftentimes end up excluding these people even more if they are not taken into account.According to the article, ‘Inteligencia Artificial y Personas con Discapacidad desde una visión exigente de derechos humanos’ (Artificial Intelligence and People with Disabilities from a Demanding View of Human Rights) by the Comité Español de Representantes de Personas con Discapacidad (CERMI — Spanish Committee of Representatives of Persons with Disabilities), there are risks involved when using Artificial Intelligence, as they detected “discrimination against social groups whose rights such as gender, race or immigration situation are more exposed to being violated,” to which they also added that “recent studies show that people with disabilities, both women and men, are not alien to this phenomenon, very often through multiple and cross-sectional discrimination.”“Discriminatory” Artificial IntelligenceCERMI points out both the main dangers of exclusive use of AI and the great benefits of inclusive use, i.e. encouraging separation or evolving toward ever-increasing inclusion.The risks include:Using AI systems to justify genetic selection of people without disabilities.Identifying or discriminating against people with disabilities.Creating systems based on standardization models that exclude or do not take into account the needs, opinions and diversity of people with disabilities.Designing AI systems based on data that includes stereotypes, biases and prejudices relating to disability.Using systems that do not allow people with disabilities to make decisions by themselves or through their representative organizations.Joan Pahisa, who has a PhD in Computer Science and is an expert in Accessible Technology and R&D at Fundación ONCE, also spoke about this potential reality, stating that both technology in general and AI in particular tend to succumb to society’s usual prejudices. The fact is, if programmers are barely even aware of the reality of people with disabilities, the resulting Artificial Intelligence will suffer from that capacity to learn, so it will end up excluding people with disabilities.Inclusive Artificial IntelligenceDespite these logical fears, new technologies undoubtedly provide a fantastic opportunity to improve the lives of people with disabilities.CERMI points out numerous benefits, of which the following are most notable:Facilitating access to information and communication itself in all media and formats.Facilitating decision-making.Improving accessibility in the environment.Programming robots that facilitate personal assistance.Automotive AI systems.Improved health care and habilitation and rehabilitation services.In addition to highlighting some risks, the aforementioned Joan Pahisa also mentioned the great potential that AI has through examples such as “algorithms that read texts and recognize images, devices that transcribe conversations for people with hearing difficulties, home automation that allows you to control the lights, remote window blinds and thermostats, assistive robots and countless other solutions that already facilitate independence for many people.”In-depth analysisIn fact, many projects are currently underway around the world, as Artificial Intelligence applications have enormous potential for people with all kinds of disabilities (visual, auditory, cognitive, mobility, learning, etc.).There are many examples in this regard. One such example is in Poland, where a project named INSENSION has been developed that aims to better understand the needs of people with multiple and severe intellectual disabilities. An Artificial Intelligence system analyzes each person through audio and video and deciphers what each movement, gesture or sound means. This helps their caregivers, who can then better care for their patients.AccessibilityAnother example is the initiative launched by Microsoft in 2018, AI for Accessibility, which identifies projects aimed at improving accessibility for people with disabilities.AI for Accessibility focuses on three key areas:Employment, given that “the unemployment rate is more than twice as high for people with disabilities.”Daily life, where they see “great opportunities in building modern solutions for people with disabilities by making software and devices smarter and more contextually relevant.”Communication, which “is fundamental to providing equal access to information and opportunities.” Working environmentAs for progress in the working environment, the Adecco Foundation and Keysight created the Fourth Technology and Disability Report, according to which new technologies have improved the overall quality of life of six out of ten people with disabilities.What’s more, the report also claims that “new generations are facing a professional future in which they can work, breaking the outdated tradition that associates people with disabilities with inactivity and dependence.”Technology has helped people with disabilities to be able to hold job positions that they previously never used to, with everything that this entails in terms of social exclusion and the loss of assets with great capabilities.As Mike Hess, a US-based entrepreneur and founder of The Blind Institute of Technology, put it in an interview where he showed no hesitation in describing losing his sight as an inconvenience, nothing more: “I’m married, I’m a father to three children, I’ve competed in martial arts, I ski, climb mountains and I’ve had a successful 20-year career in the tech industry.”An untapped resourceIn fact, Mike Hess is certain that “people with disabilities are the greatest untapped resource on the planet: we are the perfect candidates for what I call ‘desk jockey’ type jobs. Today’s technology is so accessible, and people with disabilities are extremely productive and loyal employees. In some ways, they are more productive than sighted people.”After all, pointed out in each product made at the Centro Don Orione de Posada de Llanes (in Spain), it is the result of a “job done by a person with a disability and many other abilities.” And now, through new technologies, these many other abilities can be developed more easily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future’s series of research briefs, Professor Thomas Malone, Professor Daniela Rus, and Robert Laubacher collaborated on ""Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work,"" a brief that provides a comprehensive overview of AI today and what lies at the AI frontier. 

The authors delve into the question of how work will change with AI and provide policy prescriptions that speak to different parts of society. Thomas Malone is director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence and the Patrick J. McGovern Professor of Management in the MIT Sloan School of Management. Daniela Rus is director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and a member of the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future. Robert Laubacher is associate director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.

Here, Malone and Rus provide an overview of their research.

Q: You argue in your brief that despite major recent advances, artificial intelligence is nowhere close to matching the breadth and depth of perception, reasoning, communication, and creativity of people. Could you explain some of the limitations of AI?

Rus: Despite recent and significant strides in the AI field, and great promise for the future, today’s AI systems are still quite limited in their ability to reason, make decisions, interact reliably with people and the physical world. Some of today’s greatest successes are due to a machine learning method called deep learning. These systems are trained using vast amounts of data that needs to be manually labeled. Their performance is dependent on the quantity and quality of data used to train them. The larger the training set for the network, the better its performance, and, in turn, the better the product that relies on the machine learning engine. But training large models has high computation cost. Also, bad training data leads to bad performance: when the data has bias, the system response propagates the same bias.

Another limitation of current AI systems is robustness. Current state-of-the-art classifiers achieve impressive performance on benchmarks, but their predictions tend to be brittle. Specifically, inputs that were initially classified correctly can become misclassified once a carefully constructed but indiscernible perturbation is added to them. An important consequence of the lack of robustness is the lack of trust. One of the worrisome factors about the use of AI is the lack of guarantee that an input will be processed and classified correctly. The complex nature of training and using neural networks leads to systems that are difficult for people to understand. The systems are not able to provide explanations for how they reached decisions.

Q: What are the ways AI is complementing, or could complement, human work?

Malone: Today’s AI programs have only specialized intelligence; they’re only capable of doing certain specialized tasks. But humans have a kind of general intelligence that lets them do a much broader range of things.

That means some of the best ways for AI systems to complement human work is to do specialized tasks that computers can do better, faster, or more cheaply than people can. For example, AI systems can be helpful by doing tasks such as interpreting medical X-rays, evaluating the risk of fraud in a credit card charge, or generating unusual new product designs.

And humans can use their social skills, common sense, and other kinds of general intelligence to do things computers can’t do well. For instance, people can provide emotional support to patients diagnosed with cancer. They can decide when to believe customer explanations for unusual credit card transactions, and they can reject new product designs that customers would probably never want.

In other words, many of the most important uses of computers in the future won’t be replacing people; they’ll be working with people in human-computer groups — “superminds” — that can do things better than either people or computers alone could do.

The possibilities here go far beyond what people usually think of when they hear a phrase like “humans in the loop,” Instead of AI technologies just being tools to augment individual humans, we believe that many of their most important uses will occur in the context of groups of humans — often connected by the internet. So we should move from thinking about humans in the loop to computers in the group.

Q: What are some of your recommendations for education, business, and government regarding policies to help smooth the transition of AI technology adoption? 

Rus: In our report, we highlight four types of actions that can reduce the pain associated with job transitions: education and training, matching jobs to job seekers, creating new jobs, and providing counseling and financial support to people as they transition from old to new jobs. Importantly, we will need partnership among a broad range of institutions to get this work done.

Malone: We expect that — as with all previous labor-saving technologies — AI will eventually lead to the creation of more new jobs than it eliminates. But we see many opportunities for different parts of society to help smooth this transition, especially for the individuals whose old jobs are disrupted and who cannot easily find new ones.

For example, we believe that businesses should focus on applying AI in ways that don’t just replace people but that create new jobs by providing novel kinds of products and services. We recommend that all schools include computer literacy and computational thinking in their curricula, and we believe that community colleges should offer more reskilling and online micro-degree programs, often including apprenticeships at local employers.

We think that current worker organizations (such as labor unions and professional associations) or new ones (perhaps called “guilds”) should expand their roles to provide benefits previously tied to formal employment (such as insurance and pensions, career development, social connections, a sense of identity, and income security).

And we believe that governments should increase their investments in education and reskilling programs to make the American workforce once again the best-educated in the world. And they should reshape the legal and regulatory framework that governs work to encourage creating more new jobs.

He plans to combine machine learning with databases of facts, and to feed the algorithm images and video as well as text, in hope of creating a richer understanding of the physical world—that the words cat and fur don’t just often appear in the same sentence, but are associated with one another visually. Other top AI labs, including OpenAI, are doing similar work.Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AIOne thing that drew Wen to BAAI is its impressive computational resources. “The BAAI has received stellar support from the government and has strong data and computing power,” he says.His language model is one of many BAAI projects aimed at fundamental advances in AI, reflecting a new era for Chinese technology.

Wen, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing recruited to work part-time at BAAI, hopes to create an algorithm that is even cleverer than GPT-3. He plans to combine machine learning with databases of facts, and to feed the algorithm images and video as well as text, in hope of creating a richer understanding of the physical world—that the words cat and fur don’t just often appear in the same sentence, but are associated with one another visually. Other top AI labs, including OpenAI, are doing similar work.
One thing that drew Wen to BAAI is its impressive computational resources. “The BAAI has received stellar support from the government and has strong data and computing power,” he says.
His language model is one of many BAAI projects aimed at fundamental advances in AI, reflecting a new era for Chinese technology. Despite considerable hype and hand-wringing over China’s technological ascent, the country has so far primarily excelled at taking innovations from elsewhere and deploying them in new ways. This is particularly evident in AI, an area Chinese leaders consider crucial to their aspirations of becoming a true superpower.

IRVINE, Calif., Jan. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- RCP Construction, Inc. and Everguard.ai today announced a collaboration to bring artificial intelligence (AI) and sensor fusion to commercial construction job sites in an effort to improve safety measures. The agreement will bring Everguard's Sentri360™ platform to RCP Construction's White Rock Center Project located in Rancho Cordova, CA. Sentri360™ creates a paradigm shift from a reactive to a proactive approach to preventing workplace injuries and accidents.  
Initial efforts will focus on using the power of AI and computer vision (CV) to enhance the safety protocols already in place for proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and geofencing deep excavation areas on the construction site. The use of heavy machinery, working at height, and the interaction of workers, drivers and machines on a construction site creates significant safety concerns. For example, Everguard's Sentri360™ platform will ensure PPE is worn properly and provide proactive alerts to workers via wearables when PPE is not in use. The platform will monitor for proper use of hard hats, safety glasses and reflective vests as well as face mask use to help reduce the occurrence and spread of COVID-19. Another critical safety use case involves geofencing capabilities where the platform alerts an employee who ventures into a virtual safety zone.   
In addition, this partnership will allow Everguard and RCP Construction to define additional use cases for ongoing development of Everguard's Sentri360™ platform, including teaching the system via new CV algorithms to proactively address other specific hazards found on commercial construction job sites. 
""Making sure our employees return home safely at the end of every day is our number one priority,"" said Phil Fasolo, general superintendent at RCP Construction. ""We are excited to collaborate with Everguard.ai and deploy their platform on our construction worksites to help us optimize safety and efficiency.""  
Everguard.ai is moving environmental health and safety (EHS) from a reactive approach to one of proactive accident avoidance by utilizing AI powered by sensor fusion. Sensor fusion collects inputs from many different technologies, including computer vision (CV), real-time location systems (RTLS) and wearables. Sensor data is fed into edge computer for AI analysis and processing in much the same way that humans process information gathered by their senses. The platform provides near-real-time alerts and analytics to managers and workers, notifying them of safety threats before accidents occur and identifying opportunities for additional employee training. 
""We are thrilled to collaborate with the RCP Construction team to reach the ultimate goal: an accident-free construction industry,"" said Sanjay Pandya, vice president and general manager of construction at Everguard. ""RCP Construction's dedication to ensuring every team member makes it home safely each day is unmatched, and we are excited to provide the technology to help them make strides towards that goal.""

Key Takeaways
New research shows scientists have developed artificial intelligence to find new uses for existing medications, a process also known as drug repurposing.Drug repurposing can reduce the time frame it typically takes to gain approval for new drugs, as well lower the risk associated with safety testing of new medications.This process has already been used to expedite the development of drugs related to COVID-19.
 New research published early this month by the Ohio State University (OSU) shows scientists have achieved success using a machine learning method to determine whether or not certain drugs can be repurposed for new uses. This researcher-developed process is important progress, given that it can more quickly identify drug candidates that may be repurposed to treat a number of diseases, according to the report published in Nature Machine Intelligence on January 4.1


 “This work shows how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to ‘test’ a drug on a patient, and speed up hypothesis generation and potentially speed up a clinical trial,” senior study author Ping Zhang, PhD, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering and biomedical informatics at OSU, said in a news release.2 “But we will never replace the physician—drug decisions will always be made by clinicians.”




FDA Approves Remdesivir as First Treatment For COVID-19

 Drug repurposing, of course, is not new. One example? Botox injections, which were first approved to treat crossed eyes, went on to be used as a migraine treatment as well as cosmetically to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. The OSU study focused on repurposing drugs that prevent heart failure and stroke in patients with coronary artery disease but proved the framework could be applied to most diseases.


 The study’s use of artificial intelligence speeds up a process that was already designed to reduce the time frame it takes to gain the approval of new drugs, according to the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).3 


 “Many agents approved for other uses have already been tested in humans, so detailed information is available on their pharmacology, formulation and potential toxicity,” notes the NCATS website. “Because repurposing builds upon previous research and development efforts, new candidate therapies could be ready for clinical trials quickly, speeding their review by the Food and Drug Administration and, if approved, their integration into health care.”


 Drug repurposing can also lower the risk associated with the safety testing of new medications, according to the news release.2


What This Means For You
In the future, with the help of AI, drug repurposing may be a speedier and more streamlined process. Approving drugs like remdesivir for COVID-19 might be a quicker process.



  How Are Drugs Identified for Repurposing?  
 Before diving into the benefits of drug repurposing, Zhang and his co-researchers on the OSU study asserted that the “gold standard” in drug testing is still randomized clinical trials to determine a drug’s effectiveness against a disease.


 “[But] machine learning can account for hundreds—or thousands—of human differences within a large population that could influence how medicine works in the body,” notes the news release. “These factors, or confounders, ranging from age, sex and race to disease severity and the presence of other illnesses, function as parameters in the deep learning computer algorithm on which the framework is based.”



 The procedure for identifying drugs for repurposing involves a lab first developing an “assay,” a process that will allow it to monitor the compound’s effectiveness, Pek Lum, PhD, co-founder and CEO of Auransa, an AI-driven pharmaceutical company, tells Verywell.


 “A library of already launched compounds (could be in the tens of thousands) that can be repurposed will be screened (tested) for effectiveness using the assay,” Lum explains. “Once a repurposed drug is identified through a screen, it will be further tested in the lab for efficacy in the proposed use. In some cases, if the compound has already been tested previously in clinical trials with an acceptable safety profile for a similar indication or in the case of emergencies like the pandemic, it could go straight into clinical trials without the need to show pre-clinical animal safety again.”


New AI Tool May Help Patients and Nurses Get Extra Rest at Night

 While the repurposed drugs will still need to through clinical trials to show effectiveness in the new use, Lum says drug repurposing is a very useful way to start a drug program “as it can cut short through many steps that are needed or at the very least, one should be able to learn about the repurposed drug through previously generated data.""


  Repurposing for COVID-19  
 If you’re wondering whether or not drug repurposing can be used to speed the process of preventing and treating COVID-19, the answer is yes—and it already has. 


 “The effort to identify already launched drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19 started early on in the pandemic,” Lum says. “Labs started to test already known antiviral drugs against COVID-19 [using the screening process] mentioned above. For example, remdesivir was tested and shown to be efficacious in COVID-19 relevant assays and trials to test it were very quickly set into motion.”


 Stephen T.C. Wong, PhD, professor of computer science, systems medicine, and bioengineering in oncology at Houston Methodist Research Institute, agrees, adding that Remdesivir is a drug that was originally designed to fight Ebola.


Regeneron Earns First-Ever FDA Approval For Ebola Treatment

 “This example does not involve some sophisticated AI analysis due to the emergency of the COVID-19 situations required fast, immediate actions, but it still follows the four steps in drug repositioning,"" Wong tells Verywell.


  How Does AI Help?  
 Wong points out that AI covers much larger drug candidate searching spaces than individual researchers or clinicians.


 “At the macro-level, AI can help identify the right timing and dosage for administering a repurposed drug efficiently,” he says. “For example, through mining of electronic medical records, AI can identify the ‘signature’ for bad outcomes along the timeline of hospitalization and guide the distributions of resources (e.g. ventilators) and timing of applying different therapeutics.”


AI Can Help Reduce Opioid Prescriptions After Surgery, Research Finds

 At the micro-level, ""AI can help understand the biomolecules involved in disease causation and treatment, generating better match between repositioned drugs and target proteins, and identifying potential adverse side effects,"" Wong says.


 Overall, the gist of AI, Wong says, is that it can sweep a search space of drug candidates beyond human capability, as well as “analyze and quantify” data that can lead to better decision making and drug repositioning to improve human health.

The General Services Administration will use artificial intelligence to monitor the deployment of AI applications as part of an $807 million contract awarded to NCI Information Systems.
GSA awarded the Digital Innovation for GSA Infrastructure Technologies (DIGIT) task order to NCI, in part, because of a proposed Evolve Wall command-center screen displaying the lifecycle of AI deployments.
The wall will provide Chief Information Officer David Shive and his leadership team with valuable, real-time information, also accessible on their desktops, as GSA aggressively integrates emerging technologies to become an end-to-end digital entity.
“It’s a pretty comprehensive and transparent view of the technologies that are being introduced, those that are being implemented and adopted,” Paul Dillahay, president and CEO of NCI, told FedScoop. “And that was certainly something that I think was discriminating for our proposal and something that I believe will become more commonplace over a longer period of time.”

The commercial technology identifies an organization’s new emerging technology use cases, showing their impact and the speed at which they can become proofs of concept and ultimately deployed.
GSA could use the wall to look at an AI module rolled out two months ago and see how much it’s learning and thereby improving its efficiency.
“They’re really looking to disrupt their own infrastructure and environment so that they can offer better business outcomes and a better customer experience by adopting and accelerating the use of things like AI,” said Bridget Medeiros, chief growth officer at NCI.
The DIGIT task order covers other aspects of intelligent automation, such as automating mundane service desk tasks with robotic process automation and machine learning (ML). The goal is to only have humans interacting with customers dealing with software or hardware problems when absolutely necessary. And when they do, sentiment analysis will inform them of the person’s tone and needs.
NCI is further bringing animated personas to test new service desk concepts without interrupting the day-to-day work of users. Large companies already use personas to test new products before they go to market, and NCI has adapted them for GSA.

A persona can be used to test how changing an aspect about how technicians, administrators or contract specialists work will impact them, as well as what the benefits might be, using ML.
NCI partners’ code is all U.S. based, making it easier for the company to get an authority to operate and work with GSA in other areas like improving the agency’s cybersecurity tools in the wake of the massive SolarWinds hack compromising eight agencies. To date, GSA has not acknowledged any compromise, but its Federal Acquisition Service has used the Orion software in question.
The DIGIT task order has a one-year base and a maximum performance period of seven years and was awarded under the Alliant 2 governmentwide acquisition contract. The award was made by the Federal Systems Integration and Management Center on behalf of the Office of Digital Infrastructure Technologies. It’s also the largest award in NCI’s 31-year history.

Dr Miha Mlakar: a scientist connecting artificial intelligence with sport






19. 1. 2021

Miha Mlakar is a former captain of the Slovenian Davis Cup team, and a Doctor of Science specialising in algorithms and artificial intelligence, a researcher linking artificial intelligence, data and sport. 












												Dr Miha Mlakar. | Author Miha Mlakar, osebni arhiv










He is head of the Agents Group in the Department of Intelligent Systems at the Jožef Stefan Institute, and explains his work as follows: »Our main focus is on applied research, or how to apply artificial intelligence methods to practical problems of businesses. We, for example, cooperate with companies Gorenje and Unior in the automated analysis of (semi-finished) products on the production line.« The group’s objective is to develop new methods of working and living. »We are now developing a conversational agent to help people deal with stress, anxiety and depression. However, we would also like to expand our cooperation to as many companies as possible in order to connect their problems with our expertise, thus helping them increase their added value.«Data processing and sportMlakar has always been fascinated by numbers, and with his experience of being a professional tennis player and coach, he is now as a scientist focused on establishing links between data science and sport.  As this is a really novel approach, he is interested in learning how it works in practice.»I apply my knowledge of artificial intelligence and data processing to sport, where many of these approaches are still unique. As a former professional player I have the advantage of knowing both aspects really well, i.e. the technical and the domain side. I can thus solve problems and focus on issues that are later used by players or coaches to improve their performance. In practice, we deal with large quantities of data on individual players. I search for hidden data patterns on whose basis I am able to advise players how to improve their game or, if the data refer to the opponent, which tactic to employ against them,« added Mlakar.He works with a number of professional tennis players but, for the reasons of confidentiality, cannot disclose all their names. »I can, however, tell you that we work with Alexander Zverev, Naomi Osaka, and Simona Halep, and that we are currently in talks with Stefanos Tsitsipas for the next season.«Mlakar previously worked with the world’s top players, Serena Williams and Novak Djoković. His task and that of the data processing team is to assist coaches by providing objective advice on what needs improvement. »This enables coaches to prepare their players in the best possible way. For every match we also analyse the opponent’s data to establish what our player must pay special attention to, what the opponent’s weak spots are and how to turn those weak spots to our advantage.«Analytics and sportAs an excellent tennis player and coach, and former captain of the Slovenian Davis Cup team, Mlakar specialises in connecting tennis with artificial intelligence, but his interests go beyond this. »I am also interested in analysing other sports, and I read a lot about analytical achievements in other sports, so that I closely follow the developments in my research area. In the future I will definitely analyse data for other sports, since the fundamental concepts are similar, you only need to ask the right questions to identify the factors important for your answers. You then translate them into numbers using the right method. I think that analysis is becoming increasingly more recognised and significant in all sports, which means that we will see even more analytical work in the future. There are only minor differences between teams, so even the slightest improvement matters.«Miha Mlakar is thus active in many areas. »Yes, that’s true, I have many interests and sometimes not enough time for proper sleep. But if your work makes you happy, then it isn’t ‘work’. My biggest problem is that the day only has 24 hours,« he stresses, and goes on to say that some things overlap, and, while he develops his knowledge of artificial intelligence at the Jožef Stefan Institute, at the same time he applies this knowledge to other areas. »Of course, credit for my work also goes to my family, who has always supported me and made all this possible.«Author: Polona Prešeren

SINGAPORE — While working as an engineer at electronics manufacturing company Infineon Technologies, Dr Pamela Lin realised that artificial intelligence (AI) could help optimise production processes.For example, when equipment breaks down, technicians would usually troubleshoot to determine the cause of the malfunction before repairing the equipment.However, with AI, data can be used to predict and diagnose the failure, removing the need to troubleshoot so that technicians can focus on repair work.

The potential of AI spurred Dr Lin, now 31, to take up a master’s degree, despite already having spent five years pursuing her higher level PhD in mechanical engineering from the Nanyang Technological University.“People asked me: If I have a PhD, why do you go back to do a master’s?” she said. “It’s not really (about) the qualification, but the knowledge itself.”Advertisement 











She joined Infineon in November 2017, after completing her PhD, and is now a senior engineer leading the backend industrial engineering team’s advanced data analytics team at the German firm.She first got insight into how AI can help the manufacturing industry after taking short courses in areas like big data analytics and statistics shortly after joining Infineon.When her colleagues told her about the National University of Singapore-Institute of System Science’s Master of Technology in Intelligent Systems, she decided to sign up for the programme since the knowledge she gained would help with her job.From January 2019, she spent her Saturdays on the part-time master’s programme, and recently completed the degree this month.

“I feel like going into this two-year master’s programme actually accelerated my capability development in this AI domain,” she said.Advertisement 











Dr Lin is among a rising number of millennials who are riding the local digitalisation push, as Singapore presses ahead with its ambitions to become a more advanced technology hub.The Economic Development Board (EDB) highlighted the stories of such millennials to reskill for the tech sector in its year-in-review report released on Wednesday (Jan 20).RETRENCHED DUE TO COVID-19, BUT RESKILLING TO ENTER TECHAnother of these millennials is Mr Muhammad Khairunnizam Lukman, 34. After working in his corporate sales job for more than a year, he was retrenched in March 2020 due to the impact of Covid-19.He then chanced upon an advertisement for Skills Ignition SG, a programme by Google, the Infocomm Media Development Authority, SkillsFuture SG and EDB that equips trainees with skills in digital marketing or cloud technology.Advertisement

Photo: Ooi Boon Keong/TODAYCurrently, 1,650 participants are enrolled in the six-month vocational training course, with 60 per cent of participants aged 40 and above.Mr Lukman was initially hesitant about signing up, as he had not worked in the information technology (IT) sector despite graduating with a diploma in business IT.However, after his brother told him that cloud technology was a high-demand area, Mr Lukman became motivated to leverage his previous experience with IT and sign up for the programme’s vocational training course in cloud technology.“And when I saw that this is something our Government also supported, it gave me a sense of confidence that this should be the direction I need to move forward in,” he said.He is now in the fourth month of the six-month programme and receives a monthly training allowance of S$1,500.For Mr Lukman, one of the biggest challenges was readjusting to the IT sector after leaving it for so long. For example, he used programming language Java when studying for his diploma, but now has to learn Python, an entirely new language, for the cloud technology course.After he completes the programme, he hopes to work as a cloud architect.“I do believe that with the certification that I have and the right positive attitude, I should be able to get a job,” he said.
