A growing range of professionals are becoming increasingly concerned that their job will one day be performed better by a machine.18 Aug 2022Will Artificial Intelligence Ever Replace ArchitectsNot so long ago, when supermarket cashiers found themselves being supplemented by self-service checkouts, it was widely assumed that only certain menial jobs could be performed by machines. Those which required creativity, complex analyses, and emotional intelligence, it was thought, would remain forever performed by human beings.As you might have noticed from the eruption of AI-generated artworks, empathetic chatbots, and even self-proclaimed sentient machines, the future isn’t quite as easy to predict as we might not-so-long ago have imagined.Architecture is a fairly interesting case. It requires mathematical thinking and physical modelling, which is something that artificial intelligence might seem suited to. It’s also something with huge safety implications, which means the margin for error is wafer-thin. The encroachment of AI into this particular discipline has been multifaceted, with lots of smaller tasks being gradually passed over to machines.How has AI evolved?AI can perform many difference services useful to an architect. Generative design allows for variations on a model to be composed and tested, and design alternatives to be presented for consideration. This element of randomness allows for possibilities to be struck upon that might otherwise never have been examined.AI also allows for more efficient interactions between the various parties collaborating on a construction project. AI-powered designs are far less likely to overlook any key component, whether it’s the architecture itself, or the mechanical, electrical or plumbing plans.Risk factors can be identified and prioritised with the help of AI, and project plans can be devised. Artificial intelligence can be used to assess plans and to determine which different sub-projects will consume the most time, and prioritise the project accordingly.How do architects plan and design their work?The process followed by most architects starts with a schematic, which is presented to clients. The design is then refined and development, through collaboration with structural engineers and landscape plans. Finally, the construction documents will be devised. These can be thought of as instructions that the builders will follow. Materials can then be purchased in bulk. For example, if a plan calls for a certain amount of treated sheet timber, it can be known and ordered accordingly.Can AI ever replace architects?In theory, there’s nothing that could fundamentally prevent an AI from designing a building. However, there are a few practical obstacles to overcome. First, AI would need to become widespread in many of the fields upon which architecture is dependent.The AI would need to be able to not only design the building, but present the design in such a way that human workers would be able to understand and implement. For the time being, we should think of AI as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, human architecture.Comments on this Will Artificial Intelligence Ever Replace Architects article are welcome.Artificial IntelligenceArtificial IntelligenceInnovation Park Artificial Intelligence, Heilbronn, Baden-Württemberg, south west GermanyDesign: MVRDV, Architectsbuilding design render © MVRDVInnovation Park Artificial Intelligence, Heilbronn, GermanyValue of Artificial Intelligence in Real Estateimage source : pixabay.comValue of Artificial Intelligence in Real EstateBuilding ArticlesResidential ArchitectureArchitects Office ListingsArchitectural NewsHouse DesignsComments / photos for the Will Artificial Intelligence Ever Replace Architects page welcomeCategories Articles designs, buildings Tags Virtual Reality VRStructural Engineers advanced software applicationsTop 10 LED mirror designs to transform bathroom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The American College of Radiology (ACR) has established the Assess-AI Registry and AI-Lab in an effort help with validating and tracking AI QA for FDA-cleared algorithms.Today, there are more than 340 AI algorithms cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a large number of these are for medical imaging. ""Radiologists want to know AI will be safe and effective for their patients. In other words, they want to make sure it's trust worthy,"" explained Bibb Allen, MD, FACR, chief medical officer of the ACR Data Science Institute and former ACR president. According to Allen, there are lingering concerns that medical imaging AI algorithms may have been validated on datasets that were too small, limited by single center evaluations using specific scanners and settings or with limited diversity in the datasets. Allen said his hospital in Alabama has a much different patient population with a very high rate of obesity and metabolic issues as compared to patients from a hospital in Utah or the West Coast. ""It's not surprising that an algorithm performs well in a test environment,"" Allen explained.He said AI vendors will tell you their products work better than average quality benchmarks based on their testing.""Well that's great, but come and see what will work at our practice in Alabama where we have rampant hypertension and obesity,"" Allen said. He explained there are not standard industry pathways to validate AI to offer assurances that it will work and be trustworthy in all settings. There are variables in patient populations, between males and females, by region, ethnicity and socio-economic levels. ""We are recommending to the end users that they evaluate the models using their own patient data and by using an enriched dataset,"" Allen explained. ""We want them to put in the hard cases so they can say 'OK, the AI found this one, and this was a case that was hard for me.' Equally important is the real-world monitoring.""He said data drift, changes in imaging equipment used, settings on the scanners and software updates might have an impact on the AI software. So, like the scanners themselves, or even the PACS monitors used to read studies, QA needs to be performed to guarantee the AI is working properly. This is especially important when it is relied on for critical findings, computer-aided detection (CAD), when modifying images for things like bone removal, or performing complex qualification that is used to determine patient treatments or next steps. ""The AI is always going to work best the day you plug it in, and then there is going to be some performance degradation over time. So keeping track of that and understanding why it breaks is important,"" Allen said. For example, if you have a portable X-ray system for chest X-rays with a built-in AI pneumothorax detector, it is possible that over time it might not work as well as it used to. ""If you have the data on the AI model's performance in a registry where you track each portable X-ray system, you might recognize that this is not the same X-ray unit as the one you did a software upgrade, and now the model is not performing as well as it used to,"" Allen said. ""The registry can help you figure out what you changed and what you need to do to fix it.""He said AI developers also could use these insights to build better algorithms and understand what technical factors may impact the performance of their AI.These are the goals of the ACR Assess-AI Registry, Allen explained. Like the medical imaging radiation dose index registry and others created by the ACR, he said these are tools to help set baselines and monitor quality over time. And not just for one site or health system, but for all of radiology, because the pooled data will help identify problems and solutions over time. ACR offers radiology AI test platform to evaluate algorithmsThe ACR Data Institute has created a searchable online catalog with information on all the FDA-cleared AI algorithms for radiology. Allen said it is too difficult to test all the AI models that are out there, so this can help narrow the list. The ACR Data Science Institute also has a website called AI-Lab, which allows people test an algorithm on premises or in a secure cloud using their own dataset. Allen said users also can compare one algorithm to another to test their performance. ""Because the models can be brittle and they may not work as well outside of where they were trained, you will want to be able to do an evaluation,"" Allen said. ""AI-Lab allows people to query, retrieve and create a test set and then actually run a model and test the performance. You also can compare one algorithm to another.""Integration into workflow is key to AI adoption""Once an AI algorithm is adopted, it needs to be integrated into the workflow,"" Allen said. ""If you have to go to another computer to use a fracture detection AI, nobody is going to use that."" Allen said it needs to be clear with any AI algorithm that is adopted that it must be integrated into the usual radiologist or clinical workflow or it will never be used. This is where it is important to bring in the hospital IT team so they can coordinate with the AI vendor to ensure this can happen.Creating a team approach to AI Hospitals first need to decide what is needed to get out of using AI, what is needed to support the software and the specific problems that need to be solved. A team should be created with key stakeholders so they all understand issues related to implementation and how the AI needs to be integrated into the workflow so everyone is on the same page. Allen said the level of involvement of the IT department may differ depending on the size of the institution. ""One thing that we worry about is that while places like Stanford, Emory and other big academic institutions can do a lot of stuff with AI in-house because they have researchers and they have all this infrastructure, for most of us, and particularly in community hospitals, many are suffering from the fact that IT teams are maxed out,"" Allen explained. ""They are busy putting out fires and they don't have the bandwidth for a lot of new projects.""He said this issue was the impetus for ACR to build the AI-Lab to make it easier for IT and radiology departments to do validation testing before they implement an algorithm. Hear more of the interview with Allen in the VIDEO: Validation monitoring for radiology AI to ensure accuracy.Editor's note: Allen is also a radiologist at the Birmingham Radiological Group and the radiology residency program director at Brookwood Baptist Health in Birmingham.

Earlier this week, Stålenhag appeared to experience some dystopian dread of his own when he found that artificial intelligence had been used to mimic his style.The act of AI imitation was performed by Andres Guadamuz, a reader in intellectual property law at the University of Sussex in the UK who has been studying legal issues around AI-generated art. He used a service called Midjourney to create images resembling Stålenhag’s spooky style, and posted them to Twitter.Guadamuz says he created the images to highlight the legal and ethical questions that algorithms that generate art may raise. Midjourney is just one of many AI programs capable of churning out art on demand in response to a text prompt, using machine learning algorithms that have digested millions of labeled images from the web or public data sets. After that training, they can conjure up almost any combination of objects and scenes and can reproduce the styles of individual artists with uncanny accuracy.Featured VideoHow A.I.

But he says it was not his intent to upset the artist or provoke a response. In a blog post after the incident, Guadamuz argues that lawsuits claiming infringement are unlikely to succeed, because while a piece of art may be protected by copyright, an artistic style cannot. Stålenhag was not amused. In a series of tweets this week, he said that while borrowing from other artists is a “cornerstone of a living, artistic culture,” he dislikes AI art because “it reveals that that kind of derivative, generated goo is what our new tech lords are hoping to feed us in their vision of the future.”Guadamuz publicly apologized to Stålenhag and says he deleted tweets that included the derivative images. Guadamuz also says he received angry messages, including a death threat, from some Twitter users who disapproved of his stunt. He says that what started out as a thought-provoking experiment was misinterpreted as an attack. “I'm bored and mild-mannered academic by day, but by night I become a supervillain destroying artists’ livelihoods … or something,” Guadamuz jokes.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyScienceEverything You See Is a Computational Process, If You Know How to LookBy Lance FortnowSecurityHackers Claim to Have Leaked 1.1 TB of Disney Slack MessagesBy Lily Hay NewmanGearThe Paris Olympics Will Show Us the Future of Sports on TVBy Boone AshworthIn an email, Stålenhag says that he objects to the way Guadamuz framed his stunt, but accepts his apology.

In 2020, the World Economic Forum released “The Future of Jobs Report” which made all sorts of astonishing predictions about how artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and automation would alter the workforce over the next five years. The most startling prediction – one that’s been echoed by other industry analysts and futurists – is that 85 million jobs will be eliminated by A, and 97 million new ones will be created. This leaves us with a few burning questions. To begin with, which jobs are going to be eliminated, if any? AI tools are already being used to assist with management tasks such as customer service, HR, and accounting. Let’s explore some of the recent research being conducted in this field and take a look at the skills that may be required of workforce managers in the age of AI.

Will AI Take Over Management?
As AI has grown more advanced in the areas of machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, there has been a lot of talk about it potentially taking over roles traditionally held by humans. This is particularly true in the case of management positions, where some people fear that AI will soon be able to do the job better than humans. Thankfully, research indicates that AI is more likely to work alongside us rather than instead of us:
In the 2020 Deloitte Human Capital Trends Report, 64 percent of respondents viewed AI as a means of assisting current roles and making them more efficient.66 percent of respondents of the Deloitte report expected more jobs to be generated and pre-existing jobs to be altered.2021 IDC FutureScape found that only a fifth of companies will gain value from AI management if humans aren’t involved or are replaced.
Markus Schmitt of Germany-based Data Revenue gave CMS Wire the following statement: “Even if 70 percent of the jobs would be taken by AI, it doesn’t necessarily mean that even one manager will lose his job. In this way, AI is no different from any other tool in the workplace, such as email, Excel, or a marketing automation tool. You could argue for each of these tools that they replaced 70 percent of the work for some managers, but it didn’t replace them, it just supported them in getting more done. It became second nature, and no one is questioning it.”
AI may change our jobs and take over certain tasks, but it won’t necessarily be able to eliminate roles altogether. Human interaction is still required for the tasks we fear will be taken over, so there is no need to fear for the livelihoods of our managers just yet.
The Role of AI in Management
Artificial intelligence is becoming more advanced by the second, but not so advanced that it can make human-like correlations between different tasks and departments in the workplace. Instead, AI is mostly used to speed up, automate, and polish processes to save time and money and eliminate errors. You might have used AI already if your company employs accounting software, CMS, scheduling software, or other efficiency-based organizational tools like staff scheduling software.
Gartner has identified four main areas where AI is currently of use in workplace management:
HR administrative functions (admin HR): Core organizational and employee dataHR service management (HRSM): Policies, case management, organizational procedures, and processesTalent Management: recruitment, onboarding, retention and turnover monitoring, performance dataWorkforce management (WFM): Absence management, time capture, time and attendance, tasks/activities, budgeting, forecasting, and scheduling
According to John Brownridge of Deloitte, the work areas “ripe for disruption” are the large-scale data-based tasks that involve plenty of repetition and that run based on a set of rules. Tasks that directly relate to how an organization generates value, however, like using AI-collected data to make decisions about hiring and firing, are best left to the human brain.
Skills Necessary for Managers in the Age of AI
As AI tools begin to disrupt the workplace across the areas mentioned, managers won’t necessarily be losing their jobs in droves, but they will need to acquire new skills in order to fully understand and make use of machine learning in their day-to-day tasks. There are a few specific skills that will help managers to stand out as ideal candidates in the age of AI:
#1: Emotional Intelligence
According to a Capgemini survey, 74 percent of executives believe that emotional intelligence will become an essential skill. The demand for EI is expected to increase by up to six times as AI grows more prevalent. In the age of artificial intelligence, we need to retain those people who can connect with others and who can display empathy, understanding, and humanity in the workplace. Emotional AI is rapidly advancing in terms of being able to decipher human feelings, but it’s a long way from being able to operate as an emotional being in the workplace.
#2: Human-AI Cooperation
Richard Baldwin, the leading globalization expert, wrote a book, The Globotics Upheaval: Globalization, Robotics, and the Future of Work, in which he outlined three action steps for success in the age of AI:
Avoid competing with AI: Understand that it is simply better at processing information at scale.Build skills in human-only areas (emotional intelligence, questioning, strategy, creativity, dexterity, empathy-based social skills).View your humanity as a competitive edge instead of a handicap or disadvantage.
From these points, we can conclude that the best way to stay relevant is to work alongside artificial intelligence, fill the gaps it creates, and see how its capabilities can complement – not compete against – our own.
#3: STEM Skills
The third skill set that managers should be pursuing is one relating to STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics). A recent study found a strong link between increased investment in AI and increased demand for STEM skills. Interestingly, firms that transition to AI usually move to a more educated workforce of people who understand the science behind new technologies. These people are considered more adept at being able to work with new technologies.
What Does the Future Hold?
The latest industry research points to a need for managers to reframe the way they view AI disruption. Instead of being threatened, understand that you can gain the skills required to work alongside this technology. You can fill the gaps artificial intelligence cannot fill and use it to your advantage in the workplace.

A lack of cybersecurity experts in government is compounding the problem.,N/A,http://schema.org,,Opinions,N/A,"As millions of people transitioned to remote work during the pandemic, criminals took advantage of the increased volume of online activity.Scams proliferated, according to the FBI. Human traffickers and drug cartels, long seeking ways to circumvent regulators and law enforcement, refined their money laundering through online marketplaces and cryptocurrencies that afforded anonymity while connecting buyers and sellers, the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported.To adapt to these threats, regulators and law enforcement authorities began to turn to artificial intelligence and machine learning to battle bad actors. These tools help officials spot trends and set rules to help banks and other institutions identify and report suspicious transactions.Regulators, law enforcement and banks have similar priorities, though they often consider them through different lenses. Banks want to find bad actors and report them. Policymakers need to create legal guidelines to help banks spot them. Law enforcement investigators recognize that innovative technology provides the best tools for identifying and shutting down human traffickers, drug rings, and other crime syndicates.The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 laid out a framework to stop the exploitation of the data and technology that facilitates cybercrimes. The law has yet to come into full effect as regulators work out details. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules to crack down on financial cybercrimes, and Congress has warned that ransomware victims don’t always report attacks.Regulators need to expedite their rulemaking associated with AMLA, and the SEC should do the same. Likewise, Congress should act to address the lack of consolidated data regarding ransomware and crime involving cryptocurrency and use discussions about the proposed ENABLER Act, which would amend AMLA to fill loopholes.These efforts, while essential, will fall short unless regulators, law enforcement, and the private sector accept that the main vulnerability regarding cybercrime is people.Around 95 percent of cybersecurity issues can be traced to human error, as the World Economic Forum found. A lack of cybersecurity experts is compounding the problem. The private sector needs around 400,000 more of these professionals to tackle new threats.Even if government agencies and financial institutions could hire everyone they needed tomorrow, they would still need AI and machine learning to manage the deluge of cybercrime that is now routine. The massive scale of online activity and the scope of the cyberthreat today is too large for teams of people of any size to handle, even in the public sector. AI and machine learning can take on that work, with three unique benefits for regulators and law enforcement officials seeking to crack down on cybercrime in the post-pandemic era.Finding the ‘unknown unknowns’AI helps officials in the discovery process, finding so-called “unknown unknowns,” or problems that remain hidden from regulators, as well as patterns in data across multiple firms and systems that point to emerging threats and new behavior patterns.Consider how so-called romance scams in Southeast Asia have reportedly escalated in recent years from individuals seducing victims online and stealing their money into sprawling criminal organizations that oversee human trafficking, forced labor, and violence throughout the region.Law enforcement can assemble and pour over the data to discover who was perpetrating these crimes only one case at a time. Multiple jurisdictions and currencies make their job even harder. AI and machine learning, in contrast, augment their domain expertise, helping them connect the subtle clues in numerous data streams to reveal clandestine wrongdoing.Reducing false positivesNinety-five percent of suspicious activity reports are false positives. Banks are inundating the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network with irrelevant SARs, wasting resources that regulators and financial institutions could put to better use in finding real crime. Using broader data sets to capture all known risks and reduce alerts, AI can cut down on false positives by more than 75 percent, discovering crime more effectively so resources can be refocused on other, more genuine threats.A virtuous cycle results, as they discover new crimes, regulators gain more knowledge and opportunities to update their approaches to catch new criminals.Building tools to go after worst offendersAI and machine learning can help law enforcement single out the worst bad actors and gather sufficient evidence against them.Identifying unknown relationships and linkages between entities and people, spotting unusual changes in behaviors across entities, digital tracking of activities, and other investigative technologies help law enforcement pinpoint the most mysterious and elusive bad actors perpetrating the most damaging crimes. Within mountains of data, AI can recognize the genuinely suspicious patterns and inconsistencies that are the telltale signs of drug and human trafficking organizations’ money laundering, for instance.In addition to automatically building new cases with data, over time, machine learning allows AI to gain knowledge from, and improve on, these investigative processes. Officials therefore have a better chance of catching the biggest fish as their AI gains ‘experience in the field.’Mark Tice is the head of the public sector business at SymphonyAI.Share:In Other NewsFederal watchdog investigates Secret Service handling at Trump rallyPresident Joe Biden already had directed an independent review of the security at the rally.Ask Kevin: What’s the legal basis for the Part B late enrollment fee?A reader asks if the enrollment penalty is statutory.Ask Reg: Can I negotiate my federal salary offer?Departments and agencies vary in the latitude they give their supervisors and managers to vary the step they offer to a prospective employee.Ask Kevin: Why am I paying IRMAA on top of my Medicare Part B premium?A reader asks why they are subject to a Medicare Income-Related Monthly Adjustment AmountAsk Reg: How long does it take to be vested for federal pension?A reader asks if their military service counts toward their retirement eligibility.Load More",NewsArticle,https://www.federaltimes.com/opinions/2022/08/18/federal-government-using-artificial-intelligence-to-fight-cybercrime/,"{'url': 'https://www.federaltimes.com/resizer/whLbWOhsqrJyoqBh1xV1Kg-oavM=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/4QKV5VPGBJFSVBHXSXAGN2Y3RM.jpg', '@type': 'ImageObject'}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mark Tice'}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Federal Times', 'url': 'https://www.federaltimes.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': '/resources/img/federal-logo-white.png?d=124'}}",Federal government using artificial intelligence to fight cybercrime,2022-08-18T18:00:20.260Z,2022-08-18T19:30:33.243Z,Opinions,Federal Times,,,"{'type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.federaltimes.com/opinions/2022/08/18/federal-government-using-artificial-intelligence-to-fight-cybercrime/'}",,,,,,,,,,https://www.federaltimes.com/opinions/2022/08/18/federal-government-using-artificial-intelligence-to-fight-cybercrime/,,,/resources/img/federal-logo-white.png,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/FederalTimes', 'https://twitter.com/federaltimes']",https://www.federaltimes.com/#publisher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
