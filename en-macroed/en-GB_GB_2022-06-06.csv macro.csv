The last 10 years have brought tremendous growth in artificial intelligence. Consumer internet companies have gathered vast amounts of data, which has been used to train powerful machine learning programs. Machine learning algorithms are widely available for many commercial applications, and some are open source.
Now it’s time to focus on the data that fuels these systems, according to AI pioneer Andrew Ng, SM ’98, the founder of the Google Brain research lab, co-founder of Coursera, and former chief scientist at Baidu.
Ng advocates for “data-centric AI,” which he describes as “the discipline of systematically engineering the data needed to build a successful AI system.”

AI systems need both code and data, and “all that progress in algorithms means it's actually time to spend more time on the data,” Ng said at the recent EmTech Digital conference hosted by MIT Technology Review.
Focusing on high-quality data that is consistently labeled would unlock the value of AI for sectors such as health care, government technology, and manufacturing, Ng said.
“If I go see a health care system or manufacturing organization, frankly, I don't see widespread AI adoption anywhere.” This is due in part to the ad hoc way data has been engineered, which often relies on the luck or skills of individual data scientists, said Ng, who is also the founder and CEO of Landing AI.
Data-centric AI is a new idea that is still being discussed, Ng said, including at a data-centric AI workshop he convened last December. But he pointed to some common problems he sees with data:
Differences in labeling. In fields like manufacturing and pharmaceutics, AI systems are trained to recognize product defects. But reasonable, well-trained people can disagree about whether a pill is “chipped” or “scratched,” for example — and that ambiguity can create confusion for the AI system. Similarly, each hospital codes electronic records in different ways. This is a problem when AI systems are best trained on consistent data.
The emphasis on big data. A common belief holds that more data is always better. But for some uses, especially manufacturing and health care, there isn’t that much data to collect, and smaller amounts of high-quality data might be sufficient, Ng said. For example, there might not be many X-rays of a given medical condition if not that many patients have it, or a factory might have only made 50 defective cell phones.  
For industries that don’t have access to tons of data, “being able to get things to work with small data, with good data, rather than just a giant dataset, that would be key to making these algorithms work,” Ng said.
Ad hoc data curation. Data is often messy and has errors. For decades, individuals have been looking for problems and fixing them on their own. “It’s often been the cleverness of an individual's skill, or luck with an individual engineer, that determines whether it gets done well,” Ng said. “Making this more systematic through principles and [the use of tools] will help a lot of teams build more AI systems.”
Unlocking the power of AI 
Some of these problems are inherent to differences between companies. Organizations have different ways of coding, and factories make different products, so one AI system won’t be able to work for everyone, Ng said.

The recipe for AI adoption in consumer software internet companies doesn’t work for many other industries, Ng said, because of the smaller data sets and the amount of customization needed.
“I think what every hospital needs, what every health care system may need, is a custom AI system trained on their data,” Ng said. “Same for manufacturing. In deep visual defect inspection, every factory makes something different. And so, every factory may need a custom AI model that's trained on pictures.”
But to date there’s been a focus on more multipurpose AI systems that unlock billions of dollars of value.
“I see lots of, let's call them $1 million to $5 million projects, there are tens of thousands of them sitting around that no one is really able to execute successfully,” Ng said. “Someone like me, I can't hire 10,000 machine learning engineers to go build 10,000 custom machine learning systems.”

Data-centric AI is a key part of the solution, Ng said, as it could provide people with the tools they need to engineer data and build a custom AI system that they need. “That seems to me, the only recipe I'm aware of, that could unlock a lot of this value of AI in other industries,” he said.
How data-centric AI can help 
While these problems are still being explored, and data-centric AI is in the “ideas and principles” phase, Ng said, the keys will likely be tools and education, including:
Tools to find inconsistencies. Tools could focus on a subset — or “slice” — of data where there is a problem so programmers can make the data more consistent. Reasonable people might label differently, but this problem can be mitigated if areas of dispute are caught early and a common way of labeling is agreed on, Ng said.
Empowering domain experts. In specialized fields, experts should be brought on board. For example, technologists training artificial intelligence to recognize different aspects of cells should ask cell biologists to label images with what they see — they know cells far better than the data engineers. “This actually enables a lot more domain experts to express their knowledge through the form of data,” Ng said.
Moving toward standardization is something to look at, Ng said, but physical infrastructure can be a limiting factor. A seven-year-old X-ray machine will generate different entries than a brand new one, and there aren’t any practical paths to making sure every hospital uses machines from the same generation. It’s also hard to standardize between a factory that makes car parts and one that makes candy.
“Heterogeneity in the physical environment, which is very difficult to change, leads to a very fundamental heterogeneity in the data,” he said. “These different sorts of data need different custom AI systems.”

The Council of Europe’s Steering Committee for Human Rights in the fields of Biomedicine and Health (CDBIO) today issued a new report on the impact of artificial intelligence on the doctor-patient relationship.
The report examines AI systems regarding the doctor-patient relationship in relation to the human rights principles referred to in the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (“Oviedo Convention”). More specifically, the report investigates the potential human rights impact of AI according to six themes:

Inequality in access to high quality healthcare
Transparency to health professionals and patients
Risk of social bias in AI systems
Dilution of the patient’s account of well-being
Risk of automation bias, de-skilling, and displaced liability
Impact on the right to privacy

The report was prepared in the framework of the Strategic Action Plan on Human Rights and Technologies in Biomedicine (2020-2025), regarding the governance of technologies and the objective of “Embedding human rights in the development of technologies which have an application in the field of biomedicine”.
The report, prepared by Brent Mittelstadt, Senior Research Fellow and Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford), contributes to the future work of the Council of Europe on AI in healthcare.

Whale images used for artificial intelligence research

										 by 										 British Antarctic Survey

A new dataset featuring hundreds of satellite images of whales has been published to support the development of artificial intelligence systems which will aid crucial conservation work.





British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists Hannah Cubaynes and Peter Fretwell have published an expansive and freely available collection of satellite images of whales taken as part of BAS' Wildlife from Space project. Antarctic wildlife is difficult to study as many species are remote and inaccessible. As a result, satellites that can photograph and track hard to monitor species are a valuable tool in conservation research.
Satellite imagery can be difficult to interpret with the naked eye though and analyzing satellite images is a laborious and time-consuming task for researchers. Emerging technology which uses artificial intelligence and automated counting techniques addresses this issue but is currently limited as accurate automated systems to detect different species are currently lacking. Such detection systems require access to open-source libraries containing examples of whales annotated in satellite images to train and test automatic detection systems.
Now, for the first time BAS researchers have published exactly such a dataset. A total of 633 annotated whale images have been published, which were created by surveying 6,300 km2 of satellite imagery captured by various very high-resolution satellites in regions across the globe. The dataset covers four different species: southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), and gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus).






Many whale species were brought to the verge of extinction in the age of commercial whaling, but since then some populations have started to recover. Today though, many threats to whales across the world persist and some species are classified as critically endangered. It is hoped that this will support the development of next generation artificial intelligence systems that will aid research and conservation of whale species that are threatened by ship strikes, pollution, entanglement, and disease.
Dr. Hannah Cubaynes, BAS Wildlife from Space Research Associate says that ""satellite imagery can be a powerful and complementary tool to study whales; however, we need AI systems to efficiently detect whales in the imagery. For these AI systems to produce accurate results, they need thousands of examples of whales in satellite imagery to learn what whales look like from space. Our publicly available datasets will contribute to training such AI models and encourage others to share their datasets.""
The research was published in Scientific Data.

Using AI to find disease-causing genes


			Researchers are using a new artificial intelligence-based program to help identify genes that underly diseases.

A new artificial intelligence program is helping scientists speedily sift through thousands of data sets and millions of papers to home in on genes that underly disease, drastically condensing a search process that once took months.
Using computer software, scientists can scan entire genomes, or an organism's full set of DNA, of mice that model human diseases. The goal: to identify genetic mutations that cause those diseases and open new doors for scientists to better harness genetics to develop disease treatments, said Gary Peltz, MD, PhD, professor of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine at Stanford Medicine.
But to do that, scientists must search through massive sets of genomic data, which yields more false positives than researchers care to admit. It's also time intensive. Peltz wanted to make the genetic discovery process easier, faster and more accurate.
To this end, Peltz and postdoctoral fellow Zhuoqing Fang, PhD, created an automated program that sorts through DNA sequence data and can analyze more than 10,000 data sets - in this case, of mouse disease traits -- at a whack. The program sorts through 29 million published papers and assesses possible links between genes and disease traits. Then, it narrows that information down to identify the genes that may be contributing to a certain disease.
In a recently published paper in the journal Bioinformatics, the team used their automated pipeline to identify genes that are linked to diabetes and obesity, as well as cataract formation in mice.   
I spoke with Peltz about what motivated his team to combine AI and gene discovery, how this new computer pipeline works and what this may mean for the future of medicine.
What did your lab do to improve the gene discovery process?
We began analyzing large data sets detailing disease phenotypes, or physical traits, from many different types of mice. We then performed genome-wide association studies, which identify correlations between genes and phenotypes that are specific for certain diseases.
But this requires analyzing huge amounts of incoming data, which creates a lot of work. You end up with a lot of genes that may just be randomly linked with disease susceptibility or resistance. However, that correlation doesn't mean that a gene is actually involved in causing or protecting against that disease. So, you have to sort through those correlations. I'd spend three months reading the literature on the different genes, trying to figure out which ones were most likely to be involved in a given disease.
How does your new automated pipeline make this process even more manageable?  
Being a little bit lazy, I asked: ""Couldn't we get the computer to help sort through these genetic correlations?"" That's the basis for this pipeline.
Zhuoqing Fang, the co-author of the study, had a lot of experience with AI and computer programs. What he did was really nothing short of phenomenal. His work uses AI to assess the likelihood that a candidate gene is involved in disease development.
The AI program identifies genes correlated with disease traits, such as in diabetes and cataracts, in mice. Fang downloaded 29 million papers and the AI program read all of them and determined if a candidate gene was mentioned in a paper about a particular disease. The program is looking for the co-occurrence of gene X and disease Y in a paper.
And, since many human diseases result from interactions between proteins, we used the AI program to analyze a database of protein-protein interactions. That way we get a better sense of if a protein produced by a candidate gene is related to a disease.
The algorithm then compiles this data, which is used to assess the strength of the relationship between a candidate gene and a disease phenotype.
Has the pipeline helped you identify genes that are associated with a given disease?
In one instance, we saw some, but not all, mice that had a mouse version of cataracts had a very high incidence of the condition. So we asked a simple question: ""What's the difference between the mice that develop cataracts and those that do not?"" The AI program identified a gene called Nid1, which is active in cells that sit right in a membrane located inside your eye. The program discovered this by finding a paper, which identified a type of mutation that was just like the one we saw in the mice, but it caused cataracts in cattle.
It really lets the cream rise to the top and filters out a lot of junk.
What do you hope to do with this computational pipeline?
I hope it will enable us to make additional genetic discoveries, which can be the basis for new diagnostic tests and therapies that will improve patient care. Right now, we're using our AI program to analyze mouse genomes. However, this tool can also be used to analyze other types of data sets, such as human genetic data or lists of proteins, that could further reveal how genetic changes cause diseases.
Understanding the genetic architecture underlying disease susceptibility could enable doctors to diagnose diseases in their patients more precisely, and a person's genetic information can be used to identify the best treatment or to develop a disease prevention plan. It could also help guide new drug development. If AI can drive your car, why can't we use AI to make genetic discoveries?

As artificial intelligence (AI) makes inroads into the enterprise, the adopters who’ve seen the most success are taking a holistic approach to AI, according to PwC’s 2022 AI Business Survey. Comprising 36% of survey respondents, these “AI leaders,” as PwC calls them, are using AI to target business transformation, enhanced decision-making, and systems modernization simultaneously rather than addressing one area at a time.
These and other organizations are also beginning to use AI to solve more complex business decisions around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In fact, 46% of AI leaders are using AI to make workforce decisions that include DEI, compared with 24% of other companies, according to PwC.
“Companies are using AI for recruiting and hiring as well as around retention and engagement,” said Bret Greenstein, PwC partner for data analytics and AI and co-author of the report.











 
 
 
AI’s harmful past in hiring
Although many companies are experimenting with AI as a tool to assess DEI in these areas, Greenstein noted, they aren’t fully delegating those processes to AI, but rather are augmenting them with AI. Part of the reason for their caution is that in the past, AI often did more harm than good in terms of DEI in the workplace, as biased algorithms discriminated against women and non-white job candidates.

“There has been a lot of news about the impact of bias in the algorithms looking to identify talent,” Greenstein said. For example, in 2018, Amazon was forced to scrap its secret AI recruiting tool after the tech giant realized it was biased against women. And a 2019 study conducted by Harvard Business Review concluded that AI-enabled recruiting algorithms introduced anti-Black bias into the process.
AI bias is caused, often unconsciously, by the people who design AI models and interpret the results. If an AI is trained on biased data, it will, in turn, make biased decisions. For instance, if a company has hired mostly white, male software engineers with degrees from certain universities in the past, a recruiting algorithm might favor job candidates with similar profiles for open engineering positions.











 
 
 
As AI developers become more aware of the potential for bias being built into recruiting and hiring software, they can work to safeguard against it. Indeed, 45% of organizations that PwC identifies as AI leaders said they have plans to address issues of fairness in their AI systems in 2022.
“I think using AI [for DEI] will move from experiment to production for recruiting and hiring as people get better at understanding and identifying bias and understanding how to assess future performance better,” Greenstein said.
Using AI to highlight bias
According to Gartner, 62% of human resources leaders report using DEI data as an input to talent processes such as recruiting and performance management. However, few are using it to effectively influence leaders’ decisions around workers. To create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce, HR leaders have to better integrate DEI data strategies into day-to-day employee experience practices, said Emily Strother, senior principal, research at Gartner.











 
 
 
Organizations are increasingly embedding AI technology into their talent acquisition and management processes to highlight potential biases, Strother said. “In particular, we see this in how [they] handle recruiting and how [they] work with performance management. This is one of the places organizations are worried about bias the most, but AI can help.”
For example, some companies are using AI-powered tools to identify the biased language recruiting managers might use during candidate interviews. Corrective measures could include building bias reminders throughout the interview process or alerting managers when their language is biased or potentially has an unfair judgment, Strother said.
Managers’ biases can also creep in when it comes to setting goals for employees. AI can help by comparing employees’ goals against others with the same tenure and then alerting managers if they’re consistently assigning fewer or less important goals to certain workers.











 
 
 
“This helps managers realize some of their unintended biases in goal setting and helps them correct their behaviors,” Strother said.
AI can also help organizations ensure that their job postings are as free of bias as possible. “We see organizations using AI to review some of the job sites, such as LinkedIn or Indeed, to ensure the language they’re using when they post [open jobs] is accurate or in line with the skills [needed for the job] versus anything that might [indicate bias],” Strother said.
Kay Formanek, founder and CEO of diversity education company KAY Diversity and Performance and author of Beyond D&I: Leading Diversity with Purpose and Inclusiveness, offers an example. “If a company says, ‘We’re looking for driven leader, we’re looking for someone who’s ambitious, we’re looking at someone who’s going to deliver results,’ we call that a masculine job frame, and research has shown that women will tend to opt out” even when they’re well-qualified for the job, she said.











 
 
 
According to Formanek, women are looking for more feminine-leaning language, such as: “We’re looking for a leader who, together with the team, supports the growth agenda of the business. We’re looking for someone who creates a team.”
AI can help companies remove any biased language from their job posts and send alerts when the language may be biased in terms of gender or aligned to specific skill sets that may exclude qualified applicants from more diverse or underrepresented backgrounds, according to Strother.
“That’s very important,” Formanek said. “Because if you don’t do that, you’re going to turn off people who are very important for your diversity.”











 
 
 
Using AI to identify disengaged employees
One area PwC’s Greenstein sees great potential for AI is in worker retention. Retaining employees is the key to the success of a business, he said. The factors that drive people out of a business have a lot to do with workers feeling marginalized, disconnected, not engaged.
Companies can use AI to identify departments or roles with a high risk of attrition, workers who are dissatisfied or not engaged, and even people who feel isolated because they’re working remotely, Greenstein said.
“Generally, working remotely has had a bigger impact on diverse employees, because there [are] higher degrees of isolation. Less connection can be more harmful in most cases,” he said.











 
 
 
AI tools can help managers understand if some employees are more at risk than others, Greenstein said. “Managers can use AI to look for indicators in the data of how people interact to identify the degree of isolation people feel, as well as to look for triggers to determine when people seem to be more disconnected.”
While there aren’t standard tools for this purpose yet, PwC is seeing clients identifying the data they think matters most (travel, locations, calendar, performance, compensation, workload, etc.) to explore the impact that isolation has had on engagement and ultimately attrition, Greenstein said. Integrating the potentially relevant data together in data lakes or data warehouses in the cloud, companies are using mostly bespoke, cloud-native analytics tools to look for correlation and causation, create predictive models, and determine best actions, he said.
Once companies identify employees who feel disconnected or marginalized, the onus is on them to take action to make those workers feel respected and included. But knowing who feels left out is an important first step.











 
 
 
The dynamics of attrition and talent acquisition have changed drastically over the last two years and continue to evolve, so companies that have a handle on their data — and staffers with the analytics skills to interpret it — have an advantage, Greenstein said. “I think these tools can help us be better as managers and as partners and as peers for our people.”

Timnit Gebru and the fight to make artificial intelligence work for Africa

                                                                    By Simon Allison

The way Timnit Gebru sees it, the foundations of the future are being built now. In Silicon Valley, home to the world’s biggest tech companies, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is already well under way. Software is being written and algorithms are being trained that will determine the shape of our lives for decades or even centuries to come. If the tech billionaires get their way, the world will run on artificial intelligence. 
Cars will drive themselves and computers will diagnose and cure diseases. Art, music and movies will be automatically generated. Judges will be replaced by software that supposedly applies the law without bias and industrial production lines will be fully automated — and exponentially more efficient. 
Decisions on who gets home loans or how much your insurance premiums will be made by an algorithm that assesses your creditworthiness, while a similar algorithm will sift through job applications before any CVs get to a human recruiter (this is already happening in many industries). Even news stories, like this one, will be written by a program that can do it faster and more accurately than human journalists. 
But what if those algorithms are racist, exclusionary or have dangerous implications that were not anticipated by the mostly rich, white men who created them? What if, instead of making the world better, they just reinforce the inequalities and injustices of the present? That’s what Gebru is worried about.
“We’re really seeing it happening. It’s scary. It’s reinforcing so many things that are harming Africa,” says Gebru. 
She would know. Gebru was, until late 2020, the co-director of Google’s Ethical AI program. Like all the big tech companies, Google is putting enormous resources into developing its artificial intelligence capabilities and figuring out how to apply them in the real world. This encompasses everything from self-driving cars to automatic translation and facial recognition programs. 
The ultimate prize is a concept known as Artificial General Intelligence — a computer that is capable of understanding the world as well as any human and making decisions accordingly 
“It sounds like a god,” says Gebru. 
She was not at Google for long. Gebru joined in 2018, and it was her job to examine how all this new technology could go wrong. But input from the ethics department was rarely welcomed. 
“It was just screaming about issues and getting retaliated against,” she says. The final straw was when she co-authored a paper on the ethical dangers of large language models, used for machine translation and autocomplete, which her bosses told her to retract.
In December 2020, Gebru left the company. She says she was fired; Google says she resigned. Either way, her abrupt departure and the circumstances behind it thrust her into the limelight, making her the most prominent voice in the small but growing movement that is trying to force a reckoning with Big Tech — before it is too late to prevent the injustices of the present being replicated in the future. 
“Gebru is one of the world’s leading researchers helping us understand the limits of artificial intelligence in products like facial-recognition software, which fails to recognise women of colour, especially black women,” wrote Time magazine when it nominated Gebru as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2022. 
“She offers us hope for justice-oriented technology design, which we need now more than ever.”
 Artificial intelligence is not yet as intelligent as it sounds. We are not at the stage where a computer can think for itself or match a human brain in cognitive ability. But what computers can do is process incomprehensibly vast amounts of data and then use that data to respond to a query. Take Dall-E 2, the image-generation software that created The Continent’s cover illustration this week, developed by San Francisco-based OpenAI. 
It can take a prompt such as “a brain riding a rocket ship heading towards the moon” and turn it into an image with uncannily accurate — sometimes eerie — results. But the software is not thinking for itself. It has been “trained” on data, in this case, 650 million existing images, each of which have a text caption telling the computer what is going on in the picture. This means it can recognise objects and artistic styles and regurgitate them on command. Without this data, there is no artificial intelligence. 
Like coal shovelled into a steamship’s furnace, data is the raw material that fuels the AI machine. Gebru argues that all too often the fuel is dirty. Perhaps the data is scraped from the internet, which means it is flawed in all the ways the internet itself is flawed — Anglo- and Western-centric, prone to extremes of opinion and political polarisation and all too often it reinforces stereotypes and prejudices. Dall-E 2, for instance, thinks that a “CEO” must be a white man, while nurses and flight attendants are all women. 
More ominous still was an algorithm developed for the United States’ prison system, which predicted that black prisoners were more likely than white people to commit another crime, which led to black people spending longer in jail. 
Or perhaps, in one of the great paradoxes of the field, the data is mined through old-fashioned manual labour — thousands of people hunched over computer screens, painstakingly sorting and labelling images and videos. Most of this work has been outsourced to the developing world — and the people doing the work certainly aren’t receiving Silicon Valley salaries. 
“Where do you think this huge workforce is? There are people in refugee camps in Kenya, in Venezuela, in Colombia, that don’t have any sort of agency,” says Gebru. 
These workers are generating the raw material but the final product — and the enormous profits that are likely to come with it — will be made for and in the West. “What does this sound like to you?” Gebru asks.
Timnit Gebru grew up in Addis Ababa (Timnit means “wish” in Tigrinya). She was 15 when Ethiopia went to war with Eritrea, forcing her into exile, first in Ireland and then in the US, where she first experienced casual racism. A temp agency boss told her mother to get a job as a security guard, because “who knows whatever degree you got from Africa”. A teacher refused to place Gebru in an advanced class because “people like you” always fail. 
But Gebru didn’t fail. Her academic record got her into Stanford, one of the world’s most prestigious universities, where she hung out with her friends in the African Students Association and studied electrical engineering. It was here that both her technical ability and her political consciousness grew. 
She worked at Apple for a stint, and then returned to the university where she developed a growing fascination with artificial intelligence. “So then I started going to these conferences in AI or machine learning, and I noticed that there were almost no black people. These conferences would have 5 000 or 6 000 people from all over the world but one or two black people.” 
Gebru co-founded Black in AI for black professionals in the industry to come together and figure out ways to increase representation. By that stage, her research had already proved how this racial inequality was being replicated in the digital world. A landmark paper she co-authored with the Ghanaian-American-Canadian computer scientist, Joy Buolamwini, found that facial recognition software is less accurate at identifying women and people of colour — a big problem if law enforcement is using this software to identify suspects. 
Gebru got her job at Google a couple of years later. It was a chance to fix what was broken from inside one of the biggest tech companies in the world. But, according to Gebru, the company did not want to hear about the environmental costs of processing vast data sets, or the baked in biases that come with them, or the exploitation of workers in the Global South. It was too busy focusing on all the good it was going to do in the distant future to worry about the harm it might cause in the present. 
This, she says, is part of a pernicious philosophy known as long-termism, which holds that lives in the future are worth just as much as lives in the present. “It’s taken a really big hold in Silicon Valley,” Gebru says. This philosophy is used by tech companies and engineers to justify decisions in product design and software development that do not prioritise immediate crises such as poverty, racism and climate change or take other parts of the world into consideration. 
Abeba Birhane, a senior fellow in Trustworthy AI at the Mozilla Foundation, says: “The way things are happening right now is predicated on the exploitation of people on the African continent. That model has to change. Not only is long-termism taking up so much of the AI narrative, it is something that is preoccupied with first-world problems. 
“It’s taking up a lot of air, attention, funding, from the kind of work Timnit is doing, the groundwork that specialist scholars of colour are doing on auditing data sets, auditing algorithms, exposing biases and toxic data sets.
In the wake of Gebru’s departure from Google some 2 000 employees signed a petition protesting against her dismissal. Although not acknowledging any culpability, Sundar Pichai — the chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company — said: “We need to assess the circumstances that led to Dr Gebru’s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process. We will begin a review of what happened to identify all the points where we can learn.” 
In November 2020, a civil war broke out in Ethiopia and once again Gebru’s personal and professional worlds collided. As an Ethiopian, she has been vocal in raising the alarm about atrocities being committed, including running a fundraiser for victims of the conflict. As a computer scientist, she has watched in despair as artificial intelligence has enabled and exacerbated these atrocities. 
On Facebook, hate speech and incitements to violence related to the Ethiopian conflict have spread with deadly consequences, with the company’s algorithms and content moderators entirely unable or unwilling to stop it. For example, an investigation by The Continent last year, based on a trove of leaked Facebook documents, showed how the social media giant’s integrity team flagged a network of problematic accounts calling for a massacre in a specific village. But no action was taken against the accounts. Shortly afterwards, a massacre took place. 
The tide of the war was turned when the Ethiopian government procured combat drones powered by artificial intelligence. The drones targeted the rebel Tigray forces with devastating efficacy —  and have been implicated in targeting civilians too, including in the small town of Dedebit, where 59 people were killed when a drone attacked a camp for internally displaced people. 
“That’s why all of us need to be concerned about AI,” says Gebru. “It is used to consolidate power for the powerful. A lot of people talk about AI for the social good. But to me, when you think of the current way it is developed, it is always used for warfare. “It’s being used in a lot of different ways by law enforcement, by governments to spy on their citizens,by governments to be at war with their citizens, and by corporations to maximise profit.” 
Once again, Gebru is doing something about it. Earlier this year, she launched the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (Dair). The clue that Dair operates a little differently is in the word “distributed”. 
Instead of setting up in Silicon Valley, Dair’s staff and fellows will be distributed all around the world, rooted in the places they are researching. 
“How do we ring the alarm about the bad things that we see, and how can we develop this research in a way that benefits our community?” Raesetje Sefala, Dair’s Johannesburg-based research fellow, puts it like this: “At the moment, it is people in the Global North making decisions that will affect the Global South.” 
As she explains it, Dair’s mission is to convince Silicon Valley to take its ethical responsibilities more seriously — but also to persuade leaders in the Global South to make better decisions and to implement proper regulatory frameworks. For instance, Gmail passively scans all emails in Africa for the purposes of targeted advertising, but the European Union has outlawed this to protect their citizens. 
“Our governments need to ask better questions,” says Sefala. “If it is about AI for Johannesburg, they should be talking to the researchers here.” 
So far, Dair’s team is small — just seven people in four countries. So, too, is the budget.
 “What we’re up against is so huge, the resources, the money that is being spent, the unity with which they just charge ahead. It’s daunting sometimes if you think about it too much, so I try not to,” says Gebru. 
And yet, as Gebru’s Time magazine nod underscored, sometimes it is less about the money and more about the strength of the argument. On that score, Gebru and Dair are well ahead of Big Tech and their not quite all-powerful algorithms.

AI has changed several roles, such as using self-checkouts, ATMs, and customer support chatbots. The goal is not to scare people, but to highlight the fact that AI is constantly altering lives and executing activities to replace the human workforce. At the same time, technological advancements are producing new career prospects. AI is predicted to increase the demand for professionals, particularly in robotics and software engineering. As a result, AI has the potential to eliminate millions of current occupations while also creating millions of new ones.Among the many concerns that AI raises is the possibility of wiping out a large portion of the human workforce by eliminating the need for manual labour. But it will simultaneously liberate humans from having to perform tedious, repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more complex and rewarding projects, or simply take some much-needed time off.These figures can make people feel uneasy and anxious about the future. However, history suggests that this may not be the case; there is no question that some industries will be transformed to the point where they no longer require human labour, leading toward job redefinition and business process reform. For eg, the diagnosis of many health issues could be effectively automated, making doctors focus on other major issues that need their attention. In terms of replacing humans completely, human labour is and will continue to be necessary for the foreseeable future.    by Taboolaby TaboolaSponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikeHere's What A New Gutter System Should Cost You In 2024Leaf Filter USALearn MoreUndoThough the potential of AI is unimaginable it is also restricted.

Let's now talk about certain skills that are irreplaceable till the human race exist.1. Empathy is unique to humans: Some may argue that animals show empathy as well, but they are not the ones taking over the jobs. Humans, unlike programmed software designed to produce a specific result, are capable of feeling emotions. It may seem contradictory, but the personal affinity between a person and an organisation is the foundation of a professional relationship. Humans need a personal connection that extends beyond the professional realm to develop trust and human connection, something that bot technology completely lacks.2. Emotional Intelligence: Though accurate, the AI is not intuitive, or culturally sensitive because that's a human trait. No matter how accurately it is programmed to carry out a task, it cannot possess the human ability to adjust to the algorithm of human intellect. For instance, reading into the situation or the face of another human. It lacks emotional intellect which makes humans capable of understanding and handling an interaction that needs emotional communication. Exactly during your customer care service, one would always prefer a human interaction to read and understand the situation than an automated machine that cannot work or help beyond the programming.3.

AI has changed several roles, such as using self-checkouts, ATMs, and customer support chatbots. The goal is not to scare people, but to highlight the fact that AI is constantly altering lives and executing activities to replace the human workforce. At the same time, technological advancements are producing new career prospects. AI is predicted to increase the demand for professionals, particularly in robotics and software engineering. As a result, AI has the potential to eliminate millions of current occupations while also creating millions of new ones.Among the many concerns that AI raises is the possibility of wiping out a large portion of the human workforce by eliminating the need for manual labour. But it will simultaneously liberate humans from having to perform tedious, repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more complex and rewarding projects, or simply take some much-needed time off.These figures can make people feel uneasy and anxious about the future. However, history suggests that this may not be the case; there is no question that some industries will be transformed to the point where they no longer require human labour, leading toward job redefinition and business process reform. For eg, the diagnosis of many health issues could be effectively automated, making doctors focus on other major issues that need their attention. In terms of replacing humans completely, human labour is and will continue to be necessary for the foreseeable future.Though the potential of AI is unimaginable it is also restricted. While it is apparent that AI will dominate the professional world on many levels. However, there can be no denial that as advanced as AI may be, it can and never will be able to replicate human consciousness that reinforces the human beings' position at the top of the food chain.Until now, we are talking about the jobs that can be snatched as technology advances but then, the human aspects of work cannot be replaced. Let's focus on something that they cannot do. There are some jobs that only humans are capable of performing.There are jobs that require creation, conceptualization, complex strategic planning, and dealing with unknown spaces and feelings or emotional interactions that are way beyond the expertise of an AI as of now. Let's now talk about certain skills that are irreplaceable till the human race exist.1. Empathy is unique to humans: Some may argue that animals show empathy as well, but they are not the ones taking over the jobs. Humans, unlike programmed software designed to produce a specific result, are capable of feeling emotions. It may seem contradictory, but the personal affinity between a person and an organisation is the foundation of a professional relationship. Humans need a personal connection that extends beyond the professional realm to develop trust and human connection, something that bot technology completely lacks.2. Emotional Intelligence: Though accurate, the AI is not intuitive, or culturally sensitive because that's a human trait. No matter how accurately it is programmed to carry out a task, it cannot possess the human ability to adjust to the algorithm of human intellect. For instance, reading into the situation or the face of another human. It lacks emotional intellect which makes humans capable of understanding and handling an interaction that needs emotional communication. Exactly during your customer care service, one would always prefer a human interaction to read and understand the situation than an automated machine that cannot work or help beyond the programming.3. Creativity: Perk of being human: AI can improve productivity and efficiency by reducing errors and repetition and replacing manual jobs with intelligent automated solutions, but it cannot comprehend human psychology. Furthermore, as the world becomes more AI-enabled, humans will be able to take on increasingly innovative tasks.4. Problem-solving outside a code: Humans can deal with unexpected uncertainty by analysing the situation; like critical thinking during complex scenarios, and adopting creative tactics. Unlike humans, who may function under a variety of obstacles and settings, AI-powered devices cannot perform beyond their function, may be far in the future but not in the foreseeable one.There is not even the slightest doubt that AI will not drive the future.

Software documentation is important because it helps developers and other stakeholders understand code. However, it can be time-consuming and expensive to produce. Junior engineers and those who are new to a codebase rely on documentation to get by. It saves senior developers time in the future when explaining their code to others. Documentation has a direct influence on user adoption for public-facing and open-source projects.
Founded in 2021 by two software engineers, Han Wang and Hahnbee Lee, Mintlify is a startup offering software to automate software documentation chores. The company’s technology scans code and generates documentation to explain it. With automated, clean, and comprehensive documentation, it saves time and improves the codebase. The company’s technology scans code and generates documentation to explain it, utilizing natural language processing and web scraping capabilities. It’s also available as a Visual Studio Code extension and IntelliJ plugin.
Mintlify’s goal is to use automation to overcome the issues of generating documentation. It is available as a free tool for individual developers. It helps automate job management and development workflows by integrating with platforms such as Slack, Dropbox, and GitHub. Mintlify not only generates documentation but also checks for “stale” documentation and monitors how users interact with it to enhance readability. It can automatically configure alerts to be notified when documentation requires maintenance. It can also tag documentation ownership to those responsible for the code.

Since its January launch, Wang claims that usage of Mintlify’s free plan has increased by 20% per week. The business wants to turn its attention to a premium product geared toward enterprise customers now that the user base has surpassed 6,000 active accounts.
The New York-based firm has secured $2.8 million in a seed round led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from TwentyTwo Ventures and co-founder Quinn Slack. Mintlify will use these funds for product development and increasing its core three-person staff by the end of the year, according to CEO Han Wang.

Today’s graduates are challenged when joining a workforce driven by digital transformation, emerging technologies such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and an evolving corporate landscape. This is why 21st century skills are critical to produce graduates who succeed in their careers. College education should contribute to the development of the right skill set. Such a skill set has been identified by executives and hiring managers across a wide range of industries as necessary for on-demand careers today and in the future. Skills such as creativity and critical thinking are increasingly sought after by employers. But, is the current higher education offer in sync with these and other 21st century skills which are what the future workforce needs? The change in the economic order that the 21st century has brought in every walk of life has required many new skills that individuals need to possess in order to succeed in modern workplaces. 21st century skills refers to a new set of skills which respond to the current century characterized by a rapid advancement in information and communication technologies (ICT) and students who are digital natives as well as conscious users of technology.Selected 21st century skills, previously known as soft skills, have been deemed critical to modern workplaces. These are the skills that today’s graduates need in order to succeed in their careers during the Information Age, remaining competitive in the ever changing job market. The 21st century skills have been broken out into three main groups as follows: Learning Skills: These are also called the four Cs. They are about teaching students about the mental processes which are required to adapt and improve in the work environment: Critical thinking: The ability to know how to effectively find solutions to problemsCreative thinking: Thinking outside the box. “Think different,” as Steve Jobs put it Collaborating: Working with others  Communicating: Talking to others effectively   Literacy Skills: Each of these are concerned with an element in digital comprehension: Information literacy: How to understand facts, figures, statistics, and dataMedia literacy: Dealing with methods and outlets in which information is published  Technology literacy: Understanding and using the machines that make ICT possible Life Skills: These not only deal with someone’s personal life but also bleed into professional settings:Flexibility: Anything is written on stone. It is good to know when to deviate from the original planInitiative: Taking the initiative to star projects, strategies, and plans on one’s own is highly appreciated by employersSocial skills: Meeting and networking at high levels of confidence with others for mutual benefit Productivity: A hard one for many, and highly appreciated is the ability to maintain efficiency in the age of distractionsLeadership: Motivating a team or other co-workers to accomplish a goalLiberal arts programs offer soft skills such as leadership, communication, and teamwork. However, 21st century skills are not only valuable for communications or philosophy majors. Soft skills are as or even more important for a hiring manager than hard skills.Unfortunately, only a small percentage of business leaders agree that college graduates possess the skills today’s dynamic workforce needs. However, 96 percent of college academic officers are certain that their schools are preparing students well for the workforce.The workforce has evolved, thus, higher education must follow suit. To learn more about 21st century skills in higher education, the session Disrupting Structures for 21st Century Skill Acquisitions: Examples from Urban Serving Universities is a must watch during the Remote Summit 2022, June 8 - 9.

The Council of Europe’s Steering Committee for Human Rights in the fields of Biomedicine and Health (CDBIO) has issued a new report on the impact of artificial intelligence on the doctor-patient relationship.
The report examines AI systems regarding the doctor-patient relationship in relation to the human rights principles referred to in the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (“Oviedo Convention”). More specifically, the report investigates the potential human rights impact of AI according to six themes: (1) Inequality in access to high quality healthcare; (2) Transparency to health professionals and patients; (3) Risk of social bias in AI systems; (4) Dilution of the patient’s account of well-being; (5) Risk of automation bias, de-skilling, and displaced liability; and (6) Impact on the right to privacy.
The report was prepared in the framework of the Strategic Action Plan on Human Rights and Technologies in Biomedicine (2020-2025), regarding the governance of technologies and the objective of “Embedding human rights in the development of technologies which have an application in the field of biomedicine”.
The report, prepared by Brent Mittelstadt, Senior Research Fellow and Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford), contributes to the future work of the Council of Europe work on AI in healthcare.

Dr Abdulsalam Salman, the Librarian, Kwara State University (KWASU) Malete, said the library will introduce Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to address the challenges of staff shortage in the Dept.
Salman Friday said that the introduction of robots was one of the ways of digitalising the services in the library.
“One of my missions is to see how we can fully digitalise the services in the library.      
“We are trying to introduce Artificial Intelligence and Robotics where we can use robots in providing library services.
“Instead of you interfacing with humans, robots will take over, so, the issue of understaffing that we have as a challenge will be taken care of,” the librarian said.
Dr Salman said he was working assiduously to ensure that no other University would beat KWASU to being the second university to use robots in the library after the University of Lagos.
“In Africa, University of Pretoria, South Africa, is already practising the use of robots to manage the library services and they are doing well.      
“In Nigeria, University of Lagos has also experimented it and it is a success story; so, I am working hard to ensure no other University beats us to it.
“In trying to put in place formidable internet services, we are already working with NITDA, NCC and some other ICT organisations.
“We also want to increase the bandwidth in such a way that documents can be downloaded in seconds.   Related News KWASU sanctions student over indecent skitProf. Shaykh-Lukman appointed KWASU VCKWASU warns public against admission racketeering 
“Also, the issue of power supply has to be sorted out; we have been running on diesel, we put on the generator by 10 a.m and put it off by 5 p.m.
“But if you want to go artificial intelligence, it has to be 24 hours. So, all those basic things must be put in place which we are working seriously on,” he said.
The librarian, however, allayed the fear that the introduction of robots would increase unemployment, but would rather make people sharpen their skills.
“It won’t increase unemployment because the use of machine is Garbage in, Garbage out, human effort is needed before a machine will work.      
“It is left for people to learn how to acquire such skills. In fact, more people will be needed to work on the machine, in terms of programming to make it work.
“Then in terms of maintenance and sustainability, one can’t just fold hands, people are still needed.
“So, the only people such ideas will affect are the lazy professionals who are not ready to upgrade their skills.
“We should learn to accept change because the world is moving at a jet speed.
“So, if you fold your hands and continue to be an analogue person, one will be left behind,” Dr Salman said.
