Artificial Intelligence has been used in design and manufacturing for some time, since the deep learning revolution of the early 2010s at least.

However, designers, engineers, and architects are finding that the power of newly emerging generative AI – such as the foundation models that power ChatGPT – is potentially even more transformative.


The principle is simple. Through a natural language interface, designers can just explain what they want to make, what materials they have available and how it should work.

Then, just like ChatGPT finds the best way to put words together to make sentences, it finds the best way to make your ideas a reality.

It’s not just an exciting vision of how designers will work in the near future - it’s already being implemented today.
So, here’s a peek at how generative AI is changing the face of design, covering what we’ve seen so far and some ideas about how it will evolve in the future.
PROMOTED
How Is Generative AI Used In Design?
One of the key use cases is in the design of physical objects, components or products. Factors like material efficiency and production speed can be optimized by AIs that have been taught about the qualities of different materials and the pros and cons of every manufacturing process.
Siemens, for example, envisions a future where a manufacturing technician can get instant answers to questions about how changes to manufacturing processes will impact the finished product.

Of course, there are problems caused by hallucination – the tendency of today’s generation of generative AI models to confidently make mistakes.
Errors in the design or manufacturing process of objects could lead to products that are defective in a dangerous way. It’s fair to say human skills are currently needed to mitigate this - not just in design but in every field where generative AI is used. Just one of the reasons why I believe human jobs will be changed by AI rather than replaced by them in the near future.

In graphic design, too, generative AI is quickly proving to be useful. Nutella used algorithms to create millions of different unique packaging designs for its Nutella Unica range. Each jar is stamped with a code, allowing it to be identified by collectors of unique packaging art.

And it also has potentially transformative applications in architecture and urban planning. According to a McKinsey report on the impact of generative AI, it is being used to design buildings, shape urban landscapes, and augment human designers' skill sets at integrating their work with the natural environment.
Architects can use it to manipulate elements like room layout and features like stairwells and facades. Then, they can just set the parameters they need and let AI spit out multiple prototypes and candidates that fit the bill.
It's also being found to be a useful tool in fashion design. Hong Kong-based computer scientist Calvin Wong has created an AI fashion design assistant that generates outfits in seconds based on specific requirements and information on available materials. Aida – the AI-based Design Assistant – creates finalized design images for clothing in around ten seconds. The process usually takes weeks for human designers.
One company that is confidently betting on generative AI as the future of design and manufacturing is the long-established provider of industry-standard tools, Autodesk.
I recently spoke to the head of research at Autodesk, Mike Haley. He told me that AI has played a role in generative design for some time but has traditionally posed challenges, particularly around the huge amount of compute resources that were required.
The development of cloud-based generative AI platforms, though, has caused these barriers to come down, enabling many more creatives to understand its benefits for themselves.
Haley said, “I'm very optimistic that we're now seeing the emergence of those kinds of tools that can take that real-world information, can help us reason about it, and help us produce better designs for the world.”
The Future of Generative Design?
It’s obvious to me that generative AI has a lot of potential to augment abilities and streamline working processes in design.
But there are challenges, too. One of the biggest will be balancing the ongoing need for true human creativity with the desire to create efficiency through automation. Sure, AI can throw out 100 designs a second, but can we be sure that they all express the creative and technical flair that businesses want to put in front of their customers?
And, of course, there are ethical concerns about data ownership, authorship and intellectual property rights that still need to be worked out.
But overall, I see a future where tools available to designers and makers in all fields continue to become more intuitive and more useful for assisting with tasks involving human creativity.
Looking ahead, I believe we will see tools that become capable of more than creating-to-order, that are more able to understand and anticipate the nuanced needs of individual designers and brands.
They will also become more tuned towards enabling personalization at scale. This might even start to upend the long-held expectations of uniformity and the cookie-cutter approach that we have of mass-produced goods and products. Which certainly has the potential to make the world more interesting.

Given the recent interest and proliferation of accessible generative AI tools, C-suite professionals must quickly educate themselves on the opportunities this technology offers.
A global survey of the C-suite by Accenture found that 94% of leaders anticipate spending more on technology in 2024, with 75% specifically mentioning AI and machine learning (ML) as key areas of investment. 
A basic understanding for all leaders
“We’re past the question of ‘if’ AI should be integrated into their business strategies,” says Christopher Lane, head of data and AI, Accenture UKI. “It’s more a question of: ‘How do I confidently harness AI for efficiency and growth while the road is still being built and the guardrails are not yet in place?’”
This lack of a roadmap is causing concern for leaders. “The more we apply AI, the more we see its potential to augment human performance in ways that just 18 months ago would have been unimaginable,” says Lane. “There is a fundamental concern we’re hearing about whether organisations can keep pace with the technology.”





So, what knowledge do leaders need to feel more confident and secure as they progress themselves and their companies during this uncertain but exciting time? 
While leaders may not need to learn the deep intricacies of an algorithm, they do need to have some understanding of how generative AI works. This is particularly true for CEOs, as they balance challenges and opportunities stewarding their companies. However, they will need support from the technical leadership within the organisation.
“Generative AI is progressing extremely quickly with significant upside, but also risk which needs to be managed,” Lane explains. “Decisions taken now could impact strategic positioning in the future so an understanding of some of the mechanics of the technology, how it works and how it is deployed is essential.
New responsibilities for technical leaders
“This is not all on the CEO,” says Lane. “It is critical they have a C-suite around them that is AI literate and contains individuals with a real depth of competence and understanding. For years we’ve championed the need for deep technical proficiency in the C-suite. In line with this, we believe the chief technology officer (CTO), chief information officer (CIO) or chief data officer (CDO) will continue to play a decisive role in providing the technical insight and assurance for key decisions.” 
Those leaders with remit over technology and data will need to keep fully abreast of the latest developments in the space, informing their peers and providing insight on the value of new investments. 
“Tech and business strategies will become increasingly intertwined, so the decisions that CTOs make have a determining effect on the future of the business,” says Lane. 
To fulfil this role, CTOs, CIOs and chief information security officers (CISOs) must develop both their own and their team’s data management capabilities, while also leading on migrating their company to the cloud, if they haven’t already. 
“To unlock the fundamental value of data and AI, businesses need a solid data foundation centred on a thoughtful data migration strategy, a modern enterprise data platform on cloud, and a trusted, democratised and reusable set of data products that improve efficiency and speed to uncover new and actionable insights,” says Lane. 
Developments for non-technical leaders
These evolutions will, of course, need new skills to be acquired in the business. Chief human resources officers (CHROs) or chief people officers (CPOs) will have crucial roles to play in talent acquisition and reskilling the existing workforce. 
“Our analysis suggests that up to 40% of all working hours across industries could be impacted by generative AI,” Lane explains. “In this context, the essence of the CPO role may remain the same, but the scale and pace at which the workforce will need to evolve will be unprecedented and the criticality of the role amplified.”
The scale and pace at which the workforce will need to evolve will be unprecedented
Lane says that CPOs must fulfil two key roles in this new paradigm. Identifying and acquiring the skills needed to develop new AI-powered applications and creating a continuous learning culture that helps all employees work alongside generative AI. 
One area of the business that may have a headstart in this endeavour is the marketing team. Data from Econsultancy shows that 75% of marketers are planning on or are already using generative AI. Therefore, chief marketing officers (CMOs) must understand the possibilities in content production and how much money they can potentially save. 
While CMOs will be glad of the ability to stretch their budgets, there are significant legal and ethical questions which must be considered. They will need to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in copyright law, as the battle for who owns the intellectual property of AI-generated content rattles on. Lane also points out the potential negative backlash against AI-generated creative. 
“I know many creatives are terrified that the temptation to save money through delegating to technology will outweigh the benefits of human-created assets that may be more likely to delight their customers. This poses a fascinating question for CMOs around what modern creative excellence looks like for their organisations.”
A collective challenge 
Collectively, the C-suite must work together to deliver value on their technological investment. Lane suggests that this comes from identifying the processes that can be improved by generative AI, before testing the company’s ability to adapt to those changes.
The chief financial officer (CFO) will be crucial here. They will be best placed to contextualise the value of adopting new technologies and prioritise different strategic needs across the business. Machine learning programmes will likely bring efficiency here, as access to business insight reports should allow financial leaders to easily spot opportunities and risks.
Addressing those potential stumbling blocks will again be a concern for the entire executive team. Accenture’s data shows that while 69% of businesses have started implementing responsible AI practices, only 6% have operationalised that capability from end to end. 
“The desire to capitalise on AI innovation should never come at the expense of algorithmic transparency, privacy and data security,” says Lane. “This cannot just be about frameworks and principles, it needs to be backed up with systemic monitoring of how they are being applied.”

GenAI’s World-Changing Power Is Putting Knowledge To Work

                        Dec 14 2023                      











 



Generative AI (genAI) is a disruptive force, but just how disruptive? We all know that “it will be big.” But we are not quite sure just how big. My colleagues have explored aspects of this via recent research: The Generative AI Advantage and Forrester’s 2023 Generative AI Jobs Impact Forecast, US. I am kicking off a new research stream with Ted Schadler, Julie Mohr, and others to further explore this topic. Our focus is the disruptive impacts that genAI will have on industries, markets, and economies. Today, companies in every industry are pursuing value from genAI, but this pursuit kicks off a cycle that will ultimately change industries, tech priorities, and markets, labor forces, and governments. Last week, Ted published our first blog on the topic: GenAI Will Shatter And Reconstruct Every Company And Industry. He poses some big questions at a business level about the fundamental economic forces that are being unleashed and how they will extend far beyond the current productivity-boosting wave that is coming.
The next step of this research stream is diving into the why and the technical how. We have two beliefs:

GenAI drives the cost of knowledge activation toward zero. Information technology drove the cost of data to zero, but using data to create value is still expensive. GenAI will blow up markets built around these costs because it can distill information into knowledge, on demand, at an inhuman scale. No business is safe from this disruptive force, and natural language is just the tip of the iceberg — code generation, material discovery (chemistry alone is a $5.7 trillion industry), architecture and engineering planning, and others. No body of human knowledge or firm that depends on it is out of reach. This will also have a huge consumer impact.
GenAI closes the knowledge cycle. GenAI creates a virtuous loop of expanding knowledge that will elevate demand for more captured knowledge to drive genAI. In simple terms, the more a company gains from genAI, the more it will lean into it, investing more and in hopes of capturing more and more knowledge. This kicks off a continuous cycle that will accelerate the impact of GenAI in every company. This will create new channels of value delivery, new industries, and big threats for those that do not adapt. GPT-3 unleashed that engine a year ago, but it is just spinning up. This will feed the next-generation private knowledge models — around, apart, and up we will go.


But just because these two realities impact every industry does not mean that this disruption will hit every firm equally. We believe that the impact will be based on use of knowledge to create business value. For example:

Firms that capture high-expertise knowledge will create value through amplification as human know-how “shifts left.” This is exactly what Forrester is doing with Izola, our client-facing genAI research tool. Clients come to our analysts for their deep expertise gained over years of research. We are amplifying that knowledge with Izola so that clients can get past the basics and engage with our analysts on the deeper challenges they face. As another example, service firms are seeing the potential of genAI to amplify the human value they deliver. They are experimenting with genAI to support rearchitecting entire technology stacks with models that ingest and distill large bodies of IT service management and enterprise system data. I believe that high-expertise firms will see human “know-how” concentrate at the beginning of value-creation pipelines, with genAI distributing that knowledge in more automated ways to the right.
Firms with lots of data and repeatable processes will turn efficiency into growth. I believe that every firm that depends on repeatable processes with lots of data will feel this. In software development, code-generating TuringBots are just the beginning. In the future, humans will supervise bots in the development of most routine software. Another example is Google DeepMind’s GNoME, which has predicted the structures of 2.2 million novel materials, of which 700 are now being created and tested. Competitors that are not making efficiency improvements by an order of magnitude or more using capabilities like these won’t be able to keep up. Leaders will take these savings and repurpose human talent to new value generation.
New software and service competitors will capitalize on knowledge capture and private model delivery. The opportunity for new services built around the knowledge cycle is immense. GenAI models can deal with nonperfect data, but you will need many of them tuned to specific use cases. Vendors and partners will help you. Graph databases will rise in importance, but digitizing and linking data is not easy. For example, the business of capturing and linking medical research information for life sciences is virtually untapped, requiring new ideas, venture investments, and technology innovations to scale up what is possible.

This is just the beginning. Our research will go deeper. If you are seeing the knowledge cycle develop, are seeing some of the changes happening because of it, or are interested in its potential, please email inquiry@forrester.com, and we can set up some time to talk.

Uri Haramati



					CEO , Torii				




December 14, 2023




 








Uri Haramati, CEO of Torii, explores the transformative power of Generative AI for IT professionals. Learn how AI tackles manual tasks, enhances workflows, and elevates strategic thinking amid growing challenges.
With job growth and hiring slowing over the past few months, many IT teams still need to be more relaxed to manage increased workloads with less time and people to get the job done. On top of that, their list of tasks continues to get larger – as do their tech stacks as employees continue to adopt new SaaS apps without necessarily consulting IT. To get an accurate view of all the different apps contributing to the company’s tech stack, understanding the costs of those apps and continuing to manage and update them requires manual processes – and time that could be spent on more mission-critical work.  
Generative AI, however, could take some of this tedious workload off of IT’s hands. Uri can explain how generative AI and other automation technologies can help IT streamline workflows, collect and fill in information about application changes, and guide IT pros through SaaS challenges.  
Today’s IT Pro 
The fuel gauge is empty, but they keep driving. This is the plight of today’s IT pro. Overburdened, understaffed, and lacking resources, the situation is deteriorating.
IT is expected to achieve more with less—a concerning trend long in the making, with no end in sight. Challenges such as a tight labor market, an aging workforce, and inconsistent attempts at digital transformation increase the burden on IT departments.
Much stress originates from the proliferation of cloud applications. While employees continue integrating new apps into the corporate stack, only a subset is disclosed to IT. This leaves IT departments uninformed and vulnerable, especially during budget cuts or security audits. Nonetheless, there is a glimmer of hope ahead.
Artificial Intelligence and the Hype Cycle
 Scott Fitzgerald once wrote, “The test of first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.” Those ideas are that AI is a game-changing technology with practical benefits and that much of today’s AI software is essentially vaporware built on OpenAI APIs. During this period, it’s important to figure out how to ensure that AI genuinely benefits the IT industry’s future.
Its implementation must be carefully considered to make AI genuinely beneficial for IT professionals. The focus should shift from “What can AI do well?” to “Where does IT struggle?” Rather than developing features and hoping for market fit, the best way to do that is to talk to IT and ask where the bottlenecks are today.
Often, the bottlenecks are simple and manageable undertakings, but instead, they are the mundane work that IT professionals don’t want to do. Usually, these tasks take up too much time or are boring or easy to mess up. A great example of this is manual data entry. No IT professional wants to manually type text into a field or copy and paste it from dozens of PDFs. This is just one example of where the bottlenecks emerge. Still, it’s also an example of where the opportunities for silent innovation rest, not in showy features but in the quiet removal of busywork.

Examples of Silent AI Innovation Already Helping IT
Those tiny yet endless busy tasks are finally receiving attention. Work that was previously difficult to automate, often because the semantics of human language prevented automation, are now more accessible thanks to the impact of Large Language Models, which can navigate the complexity of human language.
Here are a few more examples of silently exciting innovations that help IT:

Manual data entry: This impact is seen in multiple aspects of IT work, especially within the SaaS Management space. Instead of letting humans manually enter contract data into a contract lifecycle management system, platforms can automatically ingest the data and even let IT professionals build workflows based on the dates and dollar amounts embedded in those documents. Another great example is updating a SaaS System of Record. More and more of that information can be automatically generated with a single click, making the system of record more complete in less time.
Mapping and categorizing apps: Keeping up with cloud app discovery takes a lot of work. Employees in the organization are adopting new apps daily. This is one area where AI algorithms provide tremendous time savings. AI can help to discover and map new applications as they are adopted automatically. AI can categorize newly discovered apps based on their role within the company, reveal their risk levels, and even catch and consolidate multiple implementations of the same application. These AI capabilities provide IT managers with a complete picture of their SaaS stack and save countless hours manually researching this information, allowing them to focus on higher-value actions such as cost savings, governance, or something else.
Finding SaaS answers: IT pros couldn’t ask their SaaS tools anything before generative AI. However, today, more and more tools allow their data to be analyzed, synthesized, and contextualized through AI. This puts IT professionals on equal footing with the data analyst for getting basic insights. Making these insights more accessible allows IT decision-makers to lean on data and make quicker, more informed, and more strategic decisions about their work.

While these innovations are silently exciting, they are just scratching the surface of AI capabilities. As the experimentation continues, IT professionals must develop evaluation criteria—a set of principles to guide their decisions regarding new AI technology.
Principles for Adopting AI Tools
If IT departments are contemplating adopting a new AI tool or feature, it’s critical to remember that successful implementation is both a technical and strategic challenge. To facilitate effective AI adoption, IT teams should focus on four crucial principles:

Alignment with Business Objectives
Scalability and Integration
Governance and Compliance
Culture and Fit

By concentrating on these principles, IT teams can make informed decisions that ensure the AI tool meets technical specifications and aligns with broader organizational objectives.

Alignment with business objectives: AI presents opportunities and challenges like SaaS in its early days. The initial step in evaluating any AI technology is to check its alignment with business goals. Does it positively impact the KPIs for which IT departments are accountable? One pitfall with AI is its novelty, making it tempting to pursue the latest innovation. However, it’s crucial to curb such impulses and concentrate on technologies contributing to long-term success. Adopting a results-oriented approach will facilitate ROI evaluation and guide future investments in AI.
Scalability and integration: Integration is increasingly indispensable as technology stacks grow more complex. Applications need to communicate and manage one another effectively. In the case of AI, this means thoroughly evaluating how a new tool or feature will fit into IT departments’ integration strategy, especially concerning scalability. Adopting new technology, particularly AI, becomes critical if the organization is engaged in a digital transformation, perhaps through methodologies like the Strangler Pattern.
Governance and compliance: AI initiatives carry significant legal and ethical ramifications for organizations, and the rise of shadow AI unauthorized AI tools employed by employees compounds these challenges. An effective AI strategy must comply with rigorous ethical and legal frameworks, especially as data privacy and security issues intensify. A governance model should be established, encompassing data stewardship and model interpretability components. This framework needs regular audits to maintain compliance with evolving regulations such as GDPR.
Culture and fit: Organizational culture and fit are pivotal yet often underestimated factors in AI adoption. If an AI tool necessitates drastic changes to existing processes, its implementation becomes a change management project—likely one that IT departments don’t have time to supervise. Should IT departments still find AI technology valuable, effective change management frameworks like ADKAR (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement) can prepare the staff and realign the organizational culture, facilitating successful technology deployment.

The Future of the AI Buyer
If history serves as a guide, technology hype cycles often lead to a trough of disillusionment—a period of collective regret and questioning. During this phase, transformative technologies typically emerge, shedding the excess and vaporware.
Equipped with guiding principles and well-defined priorities, IT professionals will be poised to navigate the AI landscape effectively, identifying solutions that alleviate work bottlenecks by removing the manual busy work allowing them to focus on the strategic and thoughtful work that truly matters. In retrospect, this period may be recognized for its impact on IT professionals, ironically making their jobs more manageable—and even more human—through adopting AI technology.

Three months in, the company is already recognizing changes in workflows and cost reduction.   ""Klarna's integration of AI across certain areas of the company is automating mundane and uninteresting tasks that are now done more efficiently and with higher quality with AI,"" said Martin Elwin, Klarna's engineering director. ""That has led to millions of dollars in efficiency savings."" Klarna, which offers payments, financial services and buy now/pay later lending, uses gen AI from OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed lab that has become well known in the past year as the developer of ChatGPT. While Klarna is one of the first payment companies to use gen AI on a large scale, other firms such as Stripe, the major card networks and Block are also using gen AI — a form of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning and Large Language Models to produce original content. The technology has the potential to revolutionize IT work, customer service and even product development, but these changes will also impact jobs.   ""We're also encouraging wider adoption of these tools among our team,"" Elwin said. ""Greater engagement not only streamlines our workflows, but also promotes skill development and innovation.""Whose job is it anyway?Seventy-nine percent of professional technology workers across industries have had some exposure to gen AI in 2023, and 22% say they are using it regularly in their own work, according to McKinsey. AI could replace up to 300 million full-time jobs by 2023, according to Nexford University. Customer service representatives, receptionists and accountants were the three top jobs likely to be replaced by gen AI, according to Nexford.

   Nexford also cited research from Goldman Sachs that found gen AI could add 7% to global GDP during that time, a trend that would create technology jobs. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told The Telegraph, a British newspaper,  last week, that AI will perform more job functions, and the Swedish financial institution would no longer hire staff outside of its engineering department. Siemiatkowski said certain tasks outside of engineering can be done faster and more efficiently via AI. Klarna is not planning layoffs; work will be transferred to AI via attrition of human staff. Siemiatkowski also told the British paper that the hiring strategy is based on the potential of AI and not on business performance. Klarna returned to profitability in its more recent quarter after four years of losses. The company laid off about 10% of its workforce about a year ago, as the larger technology market suffered through a slump that followed fast growth during the pandemic. More recently, Klarna settled a labor dispute with Engineers of Sweden and Unionen. Before the settlement, the union told American Banker that AI's impact on work roles was not part of the Klarna dispute. The union did not provide comment for this story. Klarna's public relations office said the company had ""nothing more to add"" beyond what was in the Telegraph story. In a recent interview with National Mortgage News, a sister publication of American Banker,  Katherine Campbell, former chief marketing officer at AnnieMac Home Mortgage, said AI will reduce jobs in the mortgage industry. ""We know there's many people working on capabilities, including tokenization of data from borrowers. Once data marries data, we won't really need people in the middle to get hard copies of data,"" Campbell told NMN, noting that AI will also reduce pressure to reach productivity goals in specific time windows. ""This move by Klarna is a signal that other fintechs are going to be looking in the same direction, particularly in the customer service area, where there continues to be pressure to reduce costs by pushing consumers to chatbots,"" said Aaron McPherson, a principal at AFM Consulting.  McPherson said he has seen numerous examples of AI-driven chatbots, and their capabilities are becoming more impressive as they are integrated into underlying applications.       Payments   9 new AI moves in the payments industry   November 3, 2023 10:10 AM   ""Klarna is actually being cautious here,"" McPherson said. ""While it has frozen hiring, it is not planning additional layoffs, which suggests that it wants to wait and see how successful its gen AI investments are.""And hiring engineers goes against the conventional wisdom that gen AI will put programmers out of work by automating coding, according to McPherson. ""Siemiatkowski seems to see AI as more of a growth opportunity than a cost-cutting one, but it is both. That makes it more likely that other companies will go further.""Gen AI at KlarnaOne of the early benefits of gen AI is streamlining customer service. The most common reason customers contact customer service is to ask why they have been denied credit, Elwin said. Traditionally, this required time-consuming investigations by human agents, sometimes involving expert analysts. Klarna recently started using Large Language Models to analyze plain-text questions from customer service agents on why a customer's purchase was denied. It then generates custom structured query language requests (SQL refers to a programming language that makes it easier to work with data).Klarna uses these SQL requests to gather information from various databases to be summarized by an LLM in a draft response, which the agent reviews before it's sent to the customer. ""This helps us get an answer to the customer's question in minutes rather than days,"" Elwin said. Another recently-launched gen-AI product for customer service has made solving merchant disputes more efficient, saving at a rate of more than 60,000 hours annually, according to Elwin. ""We see a massive opportunity to leverage AI in ways which will both improve our products for consumers, and also make work more interesting and engaging for Klarna employees,"" Elwin said.  ""By automating mundane tasks, Klarna employees can spend their time on more interesting work.""At other financial institutions, recent uses of gen AI include automating corporate travel at Brex, fintech investors funding companies that use gen AI to mitigate fraud and Commonwealth Bank of Australia using the technology to combat financial abuse. CBA is also considering how gen-AI-powered bots could test new products, though the bank insists the bots will not replace human testing. Few, if any of these uses, directly impact jobs at this point. AI is already having an impact across financial services, and the payments industry is no exception, said Aaron Press, research director for worldwide payment strategies at IDC Insights. ""Risk and fraud management have been leveraging AI for several years,"" Press said. With the advent of gen AI and LLMs, the biggest impacts will be on customer service, where there is already gen AI use in limited production, Press said, adding that gen AI will also be present in exception handling and dispute management. ""People will still be important, but AI will make them more efficient, which may mean fewer people will be needed in those roles. My hope is that AI-driven automation will mean re-deployment rather than layoffs,"" Press said.

According to a recent McKinsey & Company report, generative AI has the potential to automate tedious workplace tasks that absorb up to 70% of employees’ time, freeing up their availability for more meaningful and fulfilling functions of their jobs.One significant challenge in WFM is catering to deskless workers. These employees often face high turnover rates and may not have the opportunity or desire to undergo intensive software training. Enter generative AI. Imagine a world where all workforce management functions and deep expertise around compliance management or corporate policies are accessible through a simple conversation. No menus, no complicated interfaces—just natural dialogue that understands and executes requests. This is revolutionary for the large swath of frontline hourly workers who typically prefer immediacy and simplicity.Generative AI is poised to revolutionize software engagement, heralding a new era where WFM becomes seamlessly intuitive for the deskless worker. It will provide them with access to powerful WFM functions and tap into deep expertise through simple conversational interactions. By harnessing the power of natural language processing and intelligent automation, generative AI not only understands but also effectively executes user requests.Let’s explore three key ways generative AI can improve WFM processes.#1: Personalized, Knowledgeable, and Actionable Virtual Assistant From Siri to Alexa and beyond, virtual assistants already have a prolific presence in our daily lives – but generative AI is making them even more powerful and specific in their functions.When embedded in a WFM solution, an AI-powered virtual assistant can streamline the process of sourcing expert information into a simple dialogue of question-and-answer. With access to knowledge bases across the business, the WFM platform itself, and curated third-party sources – such as .gov websites for compliance inquiries – a generative AI assistant can instantly procure real-time insights that directly answer user questions. Not only can the virtual assistant source information, but it can also take immediate action on the information.Hourly workers, especially those in the service industries, can’t be tethered to a computer or tablet. And they don’t have the time to learn to navigate complex backend software programs. A personalized, knowledgeable, and actionable generative AI assistant will solve these woes by empowering workers to quickly access the information they need and autonomously act on that information. In doing so, it will boost employees’ skills and increase their engagement with the platform to achieve greater productivity.That said, there are privacy and security risks associated with a generative AI assistant. Administrators must ensure that the AI interface delivers contextual information. That way, associates aren’t accidentally given manager-only information, and managers aren’t locked out of any sensitive insights that may be critical to their specific role.As these technologies are in an early stage of development, they also carry the potential for erroneous outputs, or ‘hallucinations.’ Solutions that allow for any data to be included in the results set are at most risk. Look for solutions that carefully curate the data sources allowed to be accessed by the virtual assistant, such as trusted government sites, including the U.S. Department of Labor, and company handbooks and policy guides. #2: Facilitating employee actionsIt’s not enough for a generative AI assistant to simply disseminate information through the WFM platform; an effective program should also help employees automatically execute WFM tasks through voice or text commands to drive productivity.Employees could ask the system what shifts are open this week and automatically claim a shift. Managers would automatically be notified of the change to the schedule. Consultation with a virtual assistant will also become indispensable to managers, as the program can provide quick insights into business processes that will enable better management and decision-making. When managers have instant access to these insights, as well as recommended next steps, they’ll be less prone to error because they’ll have all the resources they need at their immediate disposal. This way, they can better guide their employees and set the whole business up for success.#3: Coaching and training employeesTraining new employees can be one of the most rewarding aspects of a manager’s job – but it can also be one of the most time-consuming. Deskless workers in labor-intensive industries often lack technical expertise and may struggle to learn new technologies, especially if those technologies are brought in to replace a system they may have been working with for years.Generative AI has the potential to further streamline employee learning and development by allowing employees to ask questions and execute actions through simple commands. Managers can get step-by-step guides for performing key WFM tasks like creating schedules or approving punch exceptions. Employees can get guidance on how to submit their schedule preferences, change their availability, claim an open shift, request time off, and many other key tasks. Employees and managers can get tailored answers based on their organization’s employee handbook, labor standards, and training content.Employees and managers get clear, direct answers, and the system can automatically take action based on the answers, reducing the risk of error and helping employees to be more productive in their jobs.Things to consider: Take caution with generative AIGenerative AI has indisputable potential to transform our work processes, but it also raises concerns about change management. Businesses must have buy-in from managers and help them understand that AI is meant to support them so they can do their job effectively: facilitate decision-making, spend more time training and coaching their teams, and improve the quality of customer interactions.While some tech leaders have expressed concerns about rapid generative AI development, it’s clear there is a growing need for these types of technologies, especially in labor-intensive industries like retail and hospitality. As with any new technology, there will be hurdles to jump through when adopting generative AI, but many businesses are already creating a foundation by leveraging AI in their workforce management processes. WFM solutions that include multiple AI techniques, such as machine learning, optimization, and generative AI, can help businesses transform labor efficiency and employee engagement.

Thomson Reuters is in the information business, and has been for a long time. Thomson Corporation was founded in 1934 as a newspaper company, and Reuters was founded even earlier, in 1851, to transmit stock prices. The emergence of the Internet could have been a death blow, but the company survived — and thrived. Over the past 15 years, its stock price grew from a low of $20 in 2008 to $170 today as it diversified into new areas of business, research, and workflow products for legal, accounting, and tax professionals.
Most recently, in June, it spent $650 million to buy Casetext, a 104-employee company that offers an AI assistant for legal professionals powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4, the same large language model (LLM) behind ChatGPT. But that’s not the only big bet the company is making on generative AI.
It also plans to spend $100 million per year to add generative AI technology to its flagship products, and has already built its Thomson Reuters Generative AI Platform, and released its first generative AI assistant for its legal research tool, Westlaw Precision. A more powerful AI assistant is planned to become the interface across other Thomson Reuters products next year. The goal is to shift the company from simply providing information to enterprises, says Mary-Alice Vuicic, chief people officer.
 
 
 













 
 

“It’s about how you shift roles to become more of a strategic partner, with more creative problem solving and more influencing,” she says. “We see huge value unlock in that.”

Generative AI will be key, improving the speed and quality of work in order to free up employee time to focus on these higher-value activities. Training and upskilling are also integral to this transformation, she says. “We’re taking this very seriously.”
In April, the company launched its generative AI education initiative with a global learning day, attended by 14,000 people. It covered the basics of AI and machine learning, generative AI and LLMs. This was followed by a six-hour course on AI and ML foundations, taken by 9,000 employees — with 3,000 more in progress.
 
 
 













 
 

“And the marketing department has launched Generative AI University in the marketing team curriculum,” Vuicic says. For more technical employees, there’s another course, about eight hours long, for 6,000 developers and engineers.
The bulk of the learning material was developed in-house, she says, with involvement from the head of product engineering and other technology and lab team members. Next year, this will be extended with the creation of new job roles inside different functional units, specifically dedicated to reskilling and integration.
“These reskiller and integrator roles are going to be essential to large-scale adoption of generative AI,” she says. “You have to dedicate headcount and resources to this, otherwise, it’ll be lost in the day-to-day.”
 
 
 













 
 

She says that Thomson Reuters is already seeing a positive business impact from the generative AI training.

“In areas like product engineering and customer services, we’re automating lower-level tasks and administrative work, and improving quality,” she says. “We’re seeing people able to better solve customer problems in significantly less time. The next set in training is about how we capture that augmentation and elevation. What does it mean to be a business partner? How do you apply strategic problem-solving?”
This is a new era of business transformation, she says, and will require a comprehensive rethinking of how jobs are structured.
 
 
 













 
 

Thomson Reuters isn’t alone in adopting generative AI, and needing to respond to the transformative pressures and opportunities this creates. As enterprises race to integrate cutting-edge tools and platforms, a greater focus to reskill employees on responsible and effective deployment becomes mission-critical.
According to an Ernst & Young survey of 1,200 global CEOs released in late October, a staggering 99% are either planning or are already making significant investments in generative AI.
Meanwhile, according to a Nash Squared survey of over 2,100 tech leaders, released in November, 54% say skill shortages prevent them from keeping up with the pace of change. At the basic level, every employee who uses AI applications will need to be somewhat familiar with prompt engineering, says Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran.
 
 
 













 
 

Prompt engineering, at the end-user level, is about knowing how to ask questions in a way that gets the best response from a generative AI tool. At the developer level, it has additional nuances, involving, for example, embedding supplemental information from a vector database. Engineers might also need to learn how to fine-tune models, he says, and some employees should learn how to safely, ethically, and responsibly deploy AI models.
“Generative AI systems carry a lot of risk for enterprises,” he says. “There are risks around hallucinations, and the fact they’re black boxes in nature. And then there are the legal risks.”
Integrating gen AI in product, employee workflows
PhotoRoom is a 54-employee company that has developed AI-photo editing software, downloaded by more than 100 million people, but it has two main challenges related to generative AI. The first, says Eliot Andres, co-founder and CTO, is to add the latest AI features to the app itself to keep it competitive. The second is to enable everyone at the company to use generative AI tools in their own workflows.
 
 
 













 
 

As soon as Stable Diffusion, the first open-source diffusion model, came out in mid-2023, the company immediately pivoted.
“We stopped everything,” says Andres. “We said, ‘Stop what you’re doing. This is going to be a game-changer for photography. We need to learn how to use those tools and integrate them into our product. This is a big deal.’”
To jump-start the process, the company held a three-day hackathon to understand what the new diffusion models were capable of.
 
 
 













 
 

“Since then, every time there’s a new technology, we tell people to use the latest tools,” he says. “There are new diffusion models coming out, and we’re always encouraging employees to play with them.”

The company also has an internal channel where the latest research papers are shared. One popular source of information on latest developments is @_akhaliq on X (formerly Twitter).
For internal workflows, the challenge is slightly different. Here, instead of learning about the underlying technical aspects of creating generative AI models, employees have to learn how to use generative AI tools.
 
 
 













 
 

PhotoRoom doesn’t have a formal training program, he says. Instead, the company uses a teach-by-example approach, with employees who find useful new tools educating their peers using Slack and other channels. Andres’ advice? Give employees the freedom to experiment.
“If you limit your employees to a single tool approved by the company, you might be missing huge opportunities or something that’s transformational for your company,” he says. “Let them find the best tools for their job. If someone uncovers a tool that boosts their productivity, encourage them and try to spread the word to other employees.”
Leveling up for generative AI
Healthcare technology vendor athenahealth has over 6,500 employees, more than 1,200 of whom are engineers, and generative AI is core to the company’s product development roadmap — and to internal productivity improvements. And training is how the company will get there.
 
 
 













 
 

“We’ve offered a number of rounds of training, including third-party prompt engineering training, and workshops,” says Heather Lane, the company’s senior architect of data science. “There’s an enormous amount of training material out there, so we don’t have to develop it all in-house. We’ve also brought in external speakers who’ve talked about both the high-level state of generative AI and specific materials about how it may be reflected in the healthcare space, where they see the technological development going, where they see the risk.”
So far, more than 700 people have attended generative AI knowledge sessions, more than 1,200 hours of generative AI training have been consumed, and 300 developers have completed a generative AI bootcamp.
The problem, she says, is there’s too much material out there, and most of it isn’t useful. Filtering down to the part you care about is the challenge, as well as the pace of change. “It’s not like drinking from a firehose,” she adds. “It’s like standing under Niagara Falls and trying to take a sip. It’s absolutely insane.”
 
 
 













 
 

Marketing takes the lead on gen AI
IT services firm Ensono has over 3,400 employees, just 27 of whom are in marketing. But it’s the marketing department that’s been spearheading generative AI.
“It’s helping us do more with less,” says Jonathan Bumba, the company’s chief marketing officer. “Things that used to take several hours now take a few minutes; things that used to take several days now get done in a few hours; and things that we couldn’t do before at all we can now do in a reasonable amount of time.”

The company is using a wide variety of generative AI tools to create content and connect with customers, including ChatGPT, Dall-E, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, and Salesloft among others.
 
 
 













 
 

“We started playing with it right away,” he says.
When the technology first started coming out, the team was mesmerized. “Then we were disillusioned pretty quickly,” he says. “We’re just not prompt engineers. I wanted my team to lean in and embrace this, but I could feel the frustration of not getting the output we were looking for.” He tried Coursera and LinkedIn courses, but they just weren’t specific enough, Bumba says.
Even vendor-provided courses were too general. “Without knowing our workflows and what we’re trying to do, none of it was terribly helpful,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

His team struggled to figure things out on their own until the middle of this year. Then in September, Bumba brought in a boutique consulting firm, AI Technology Partners, to identify specific generative AI use cases, figure out the right tooling, and create customized training workshops for employees based on his team’s actual workflows.

“After the training workshop was over, we still put them on retainer so we can reach out to them with real-world projects,” he says. “They walk us through it and help us build prompts so we can continue to do this after they’re gone.”
Looking back, he says he wishes he’d gotten help sooner.
“I waited too long to ask for help, wasting months thinking we could figure this out ourselves,” he says. “I’d like to have those months back. In this new world, a three-month delay means someone else had a three-month head start on me. In the world of AI, this matters. He or she who learns first, wins.”
 
 
 













 
 

Large-scale upskilling
“PricewaterhouseCoopers has the commitment to give its people the most in-demand skills for today and tomorrow,” says PwC partner Robin Stein. “We realized very quickly we had to upskill our 75,000 people on the foundations of generative AI, how to apply gen AI responsibly, and how to become a prompt engineer.”
Because the company has a multi-generational workforce, it’s using a wide array of modalities, training approaches, and learning pathways, she says — everything from gamification to in-person seminars.
“Some people want to read an article and some want to listen to a podcast,” she says. “And there’s some gamification, including a live trivia game where people can earn rewards, which helps drive excitement about some of these programs.”
The final element is to give people tools they can use to apply these new skills.
“The adoption and engagement has been incredible, and people are highly interested and highly motivated to figure out how this will affect them,” she says.
Completing gen AI 101
Wipro Technologies is a technology and consulting firm with 245,000 employees. Of those, 200,000 have already completed basic generative AI training, says COO Amit Choudhary.
“We want all our people to be trained on generative AI,” he says.
The basic level of training includes a definition of what generative AI is, its history, and what responsible AI is all about.
“We want to educate our team members that there are risks to doing this,” he says. “And responsible AI means different things for legal people, for financial team members, or for cybersecurity experts.”
This program was developed in-house, he says, because the company started training earlier this year and there wasn’t enough external material available at the time.
Then employees move on to external training from external partners. That includes Udemy, Coursera, and LinkedIn, he says, as well as vendor-provided materials from companies like Microsoft, AWS, and Google for employees working on specific platforms.
Once the foundations are in place, Wipro offers industry- and function-specific training, such as what gen AI means for manufacturing, finance, HR, and supply chain management. As this is all created in-house, Wipro created an AI council earlier this year to handle it, tasked with building advanced courses customized to the individual requirements of the company.
There are hundreds of people involved in the training development process, Choudhary says, with a core team of over two dozen that creates the learning content and tracks its progress through the organization. Then there are all the people involved to execute the training plan, such as practice managers and service managers.
“We have consultants who are industry and domain-specific,” he says. “We have technologists who are high-end engineers, and a team of designers. We put all these people together, plus our partners and vendors. Our AI council sees the content coming in from outside, and the content we develop inside.” 
And it’s not enough just to get the theoretical knowledge, he says. “Just telling them what it means is the first step. We’re also doing hackathons, and are now working on gamification of the training we already have. We also have our own platform for coders, where we give them live projects to work on as competitions. Once they’ve done some advanced courses, this is a problem they can solve.”

AI Is Transforming Corporate Learning Even Faster Than I Expected

                · Updated December 18, 2023




Of all the domains to be impacted by AI, perhaps the biggest transformation is taking place in corporate learning. After a year of experimentation, it’s now clear that AI will revolutionize this space.
Let’s discuss what L&D is all about. Corporate training is everywhere, and that’s why it’s a $340 billion market. Everything that happens at work (from onboarding to filling out an expense account to complex operational procedures) somehow requires training. And even during recessions, the corporate spending on L&D remains steady at $1200-1500 per person on average.
Yet as L&D professionals know, the problem is highly complex. There are hundreds of training platforms, tools, content libraries, and approaches. I estimate the L&D technology space at over $14 billion in size, and that doesn’t even include systems like search engines, knowledge management tools, and platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Webex. And over the years we’ve been through many evolutions: e-learning, blended learning, micro-learning, and now learning in the flow of work.
Generative AI is about to change all this forever.







Consider the problem we face. Corporate training is not really about teaching, it’s about creating an environment of learning. Traditional instructional design, which is teacher-led and process-focused, often falls short at work. People learn in many ways, often without a teacher, and they look for reference materials, copy what others are doing, and rely on managers, peers, and experts to help. So traditional instructional design models must be extended to help people learn what they need.
Enter generative AI, a technology that’s designed to synthesize information. Generative AI tools like Galileo™ can understand, consolidate, reorganize, and deliver information from a large corpus in ways that traditional instructional designers could not. This AI-driven approach to learning is not only more efficient but also more effective, enabling learning in the flow of work. And users can ask whatever question they want, with answers relevant to their need.
In the early days learning in the flow of work meant searching for information and hoping to find something relevant. This process was time-consuming and often fruitless. Generative AI, through its magic of neural networking, is now poised to solve these problems, acting as a Swiss Army knife for L&D.
Here’s a simple example. I asked Galileo™, which is powered by 25 years of research and case studies, “How do I deal with an employee who’s always late? And please give me a narrative to help?” Rather than take me to a course on management or show me a bunch of videos, it simply answered the question. This type of interaction is where much of corporate learning is going.







Let me summarize four major use cases for AI in L&D:
Generating Content: AI can dramatically reduce the time and complexity involved in content creation. For instance, Arist, a mobile learning tool, has an AI generation feature Sidekick that can convert comprehensive operational information into a series of instructional activities. This process, which could take weeks or even months, can now be completed in days or even hours.
We use Arist in The Josh Bersin Academy, and our new mobile courses are coming out almost monthly now. Other tools like Sana, Docebo Shape and the user-focused learning platform 360 Learning are just as exciting.
Personalizing the Learner Experience: AI can help tailor learning paths to individual needs, improving upon traditional models that assign learning paths based on job roles. AI can understand the details of content and use that information to personalize the learning experience. This approach is far more effective than the cluttered learning experience platforms (LXPs) that often fail to truly understand the details of the content.
Uplimit, a startup dedicated to building an AI platform to help teach AI, is using its Cobot and other tools to personalize coaching and tips for technical professionals learning about AI. Cornerstone’s new AI fabric recommends courses by skill, Sana’s platform connects tools like Galileo to learning, and the new AI-features in SuccessFactors also give users a curated view of learning based on role and activity.
Identifying and Developing Skills: AI can help identify skills within content and infer the skills of individuals. This aids in delivering the right training and determining its effectiveness. While many companies are working on high-level skills taxonomy strategies, the real value lies in the granular, domain-specific skills that can be identified and developed through AI.
Eightfold, Gloat, and SeekOut, pioneers in talent intelligence, can infer employee skills and immediately recommend learning solutions. We are actually using this technology to introduce our HR Career Navigator, coming early next year.
Replacing Training With Knowledge Tools: Perhaps the most disruptive use case of AI in L&D is the potential to replace certain types of training altogether. AI can create intelligent agents or chatbots that provide information and solve problems, potentially eliminating the need for certain types of training. This approach is not only more efficient but also more effective, as it provides individuals with the information they need when they need it.
Walmart is implementing this today, and our new platform Galileo is helping companies like Mastercard and Rolls Royce find HR information and policy information on-demand without training. LinkedIn Learning is opening up its soft-skills content to Gen AI search and soon enough the Microsoft Copilot will locate training through Viva Learning.
One important “gotcha” here: we are going to have to teach ourselves (and employees) how to “prompt” these systems. I’m sure our AI tools will get smarter and more conversational quickly, but for 2024 we’re going to spend quite a bit of time teaching users how to prompt AI systems to give us the answer we want.
The Potential Here Is Massive
In all my years as an analyst, I’ve never seen a technology with so much potential. AI will revolutionize the L&D landscape, reinventing how we do our work so L&D professionals can spend time consulting with the business.
What should L&D professionals do? Take some time to learn about this technology, or join some of our new AI courses in The Josh Bersin Academy to learn more.
As you get access to tools like Galileo, I know you will be astounded by the opportunities ahead. The future of L&D has arrived, and it’s all powered by AI.

After a year of experimentation, it&#039;s now clear that AI will revolutionize this space.  Let&#039;s discuss what L&amp;D is all about. Corporate training is everywhere, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s a $340 billion market. Everything that happens at work (from onboarding to filling out an expense account to complex operational procedures) somehow requires training. And even during recessions, the corporate spending on L&amp;D remains steady at $1200-1500 per person on average.  Yet as L&amp;D professionals know, the problem is highly complex. There are hundreds of training platforms, tools, content libraries, and approaches. I estimate the L&amp;D technology space at over $14 billion in size, and that doesn&#039;t even include systems like search engines, knowledge management tools, and platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Webex. And over the years we&#039;ve been through many evolutions: e-learning, blended learning, micro-learning, and now learning in the flow of work.  Generative AI is about to change all this forever.        Consider the problem we face. Corporate training is not really about teaching, it&#039;s about creating an environment of learning. Traditional instructional design, which is teacher-led and process-focused, often falls short at work. People learn in many ways, often without a teacher, and they look for reference materials, copy what others are doing, and rely on managers, peers, and experts to help. So traditional instructional design models must be extended to help people learn what they need.  Enter generative AI, a technology that&#039;s designed to synthesize information. Generative AI tools like Galileo™ can understand, consolidate, reorganize, and deliver information from a large corpus in ways that traditional instructional designers could not. This AI-driven approach to learning is not only more efficient but also more effective, enabling learning in the flow of work.  In the early days learning in the flow of work meant searching for information and hoping to find something relevant. This process was time-consuming and often fruitless. Generative AI, through its magic of neural networking, is now poised to solve these problems, acting as a Swiss Army knife for L&amp;D.  Here&#039;s a simple example. I asked Galileo™, which is powered by 25 years of research and case studies, &quot;How do I deal with an employee who&#039;s always late? And please give me a narrative to help?&quot; Rather than take me to a course on management or show me a bunch of videos, it simply answered the question. This type of interaction is where much of corporate learning is going.        Let me summarize four major use cases for AI in L&amp;D:  Generating Content: AI can dramatically reduce the time and complexity involved in content creation. For instance, Arist, a mobile learning tool, has an AI generation feature Sidekick that can convert comprehensive operational information into a series of instructional activities. This process, which could take weeks or even months, can now be completed in days or even hours.  We use Arist in The Josh Bersin Academy, and our new mobilse courses are coming out almost monthly now. Other tools like Sana, Docebo Shape and the user-focused learning platform 360 Learning are just as exciting.  Personalizing the Learner Experience: AI can help tailor learning paths to individual needs, improving upon traditional models that assign learning paths based on job roles. AI can understand the details of content and use that information to personalize the learning experience. This approach is far more effective than the cluttered learning experience platforms (LXPs) that often fail to truly understand the details of the content.  Uplimit, a startup dedicated to building an AI platform to help teach AI, is using its Cobot and other tools to personalize coaching and tips for technical professionals learning about AI. Cornerstone&#039;s new AI fabric recommends courses by skill, Sana&#039;s platform connects tools like Galileo to learning, and the new AI-features in SuccessFactors also give users a curated view of learning based on role and activity.  Identifying and Developing Skills: AI can help identify skills within content and infer the skills of individuals. This aids in delivering the right training and determining its effectiveness. While many companies are working on high-level skills taxonomy strategies, the real value lies in the granular, domain-specific skills that can be identified and developed through AI.  Eightfold, Gloat, and SeekOut, pioneers in talent intelligence, can infer employee skills and immediately recommend learning solutions. We are actually using this technology to introduce our HR Career Navigator, coming early next year.  Replacing Training With Knowledge Tools: Perhaps the most disruptive use case of AI in L&amp;D is the potential to replace certain types of training altogether. AI can create intelligent agents or chatbots that provide information and solve problems, potentially eliminating the need for certain types of training. This approach is not only more efficient but also more effective, as it provides individuals with the information they need when they need it.  Walmart is implementing this today, and our new platform Galileo is helping companies like Mastercard and Rolls Royce find HR information and policy information on-demand without training. LinkedIn Learning is opening up its soft-skills content to Gen AI search and soon enough the Microsoft Copilot will locate training through Viva Learning.  The Potential Here Is Massive  In all my years as an analyst, I&#039;ve never seen a technology with so much potential. AI will revolutionize the L&amp;D landscape, reinventing how we do our work so L&amp;D professionals can spend time consulting with the business.  What should L&amp;D professionals do? Take some time to learn about this technology, or join some of our new AI courses in The Josh Bersin Academy to learn more.  As we continue to roll out tools like Galileo, I know each and every one of you will be astounded by the opportunities ahead. The future of L&amp;D has arrived, and it&#039;s all powered by AI.

“If a copyrightable work is used as the starting point for a finished work that will contain generative material, that may open a loophole…to ensuring copyright protection over subsequent exploitations of the finished work, and the portions of the work that may not be entirely human creation.”

SURYAST – Source: U.S. Copyright Office letter
On December 11, the Review Board of the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) released a letter affirming the USCO’s refusal to register a work created with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) software. The decision to affirm the refusal marks the fourth time a registrant has been documented as being denied the ability to obtain a copyright registration over the output of an AI system following requests for reconsideration.
The work in question is a two-dimensional computer-generated image titled “SURYAST” that was created by Ankit Sahni, in part, using a custom-developed software program named RAGHAV. The USCO’s analysis focuses on issues such as lack of human control, contradictory descriptions of the tool (such as whether it is a filter or a more robust generative tool), and whether the expressive elements of the work were human authored.
Meet RAGHAV
Sahni submitted an application to register the work in December 2021 and listed himself and the AI painting app as the two authors. More specifically, Sahni noted an original photograph as part of his authorship, while the software was listed as solely contributing the “2-D artwork.”
In response to the USCO’s request for additional information, Sahni provided a 17-page supplement explaining the technology and how it was used. He explained the process involved use of his original photograph of a sunset along with an image of Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night for the “style” to be copied by the AI tool.
In June 2022, the USCO issued its initial refusal to register the work because of the lack of human authorship, noting the inability to separate the human authorship from “the final work produced by the computer program.” It also noted that the work was a “classic example[] of derivative authorship” because, as the Review Board writes, “it was a digital adaptation of a photograph.”
Source: U.S. Copyright Office letter
In September 2022, Sahni requested a reconsideration. He argued “the human authorship requirement does not and cannot mean a work must be created entirely by a human author.” However, the USCO upheld the initial refusal and denied the first request for reconsideration.
The second request for reconsideration came in July 2023 and presented three arguments. The first argument involved an assertion that RAGHAV’s role was only as an “assistive software tool” with ultimate creative control in the hands of Sahni through the selection of his original starting photograph, the inclusion of The Starry Night, and the additional variables under his control. The second argument focused on the human-authored elements in the work that he sought to register. The third argument sought to attack the classification of the machine-generated work as a derivative work due to its lack of substantial similarity and that the “human author’s total creative input in both the original photograph and the Work should be considered together […]”. For example, Sahni pointed to the way in which a painter might sketch on their canvas or a sculptor assembles clay before reaching a final form.
A large portion of the USCO’s analysis is spent exploring the discrepancies between Sahni’s recounting of the creative process and functionality of his tool. The USCO focuses on the level of control Sahni retained over RAGHAV, noting the description provided in the second request for reconsideration “inaccurately minimizes RAGHAV’s role in the creation of the Work and conflicts with other information in the record.”
After reviewing the provided research, the USCO concludes: “RAGHAV’s interpretation of Mr. Sahni’s photograph in the style of another painting is a function of how the model works and the images on which it was trained on—not specific contributions or instructions received from Mr. Sahni.”
Fourth Time, Not the Charm
In June, the USCO reiterated its focus on the application of the de minimis standard when determining whether or not a work that contains generative material is eligible for copyright protection. The standard, taken from the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Feist v. Rural Telephone and solidified as policy in the USCO’s Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence, requires that “AI-generated content that is more than de minimis should be explicitly [disclosed and] excluded from the application.” The generative material is not protectable and would be considered public domain.
Beginning in February 2022, the Review Board upheld the USCO’s first documented refusal to register “A Recent Entrance to Paradise” when Dr. Stephen Thaler attempted to register the work originally with the AI software as the author and himself as the claimant. The refusal to register was challenged in federal court as part of a continued effort of Thaler and his supporters to exhaust a multitude of legal theories attacking the human authorship requirement that the USCO identified as well-established. As of August, the district court decided in favor of the USCO and leaves Thaler in pursuant of an appeal to overturn the decision.
The second documented refusal to register a generative AI work came in February, following a series of investigations beginning in the fall of 2022 into a previously granted registration of a graphic novel by Kris Kashtanova. The USCO ultimately decided to partially cancel its previously issued registration due to the “randomly generated noise that evolves into a final image” when using the AI-powered text-to-image generation tool Midjourney. Kashtanova has since decided against pursuing a challenge to the partial cancellation, and now works as a Senior Creative Evangelist in AI at Adobe.
In September, the Review Board upheld the USCO’s third documented refusal to register a generative AI work, Théâtre D’opéra Spatial, that became internet famous for winning in the digital arts category at the 2022 Colorado State Fair’s annual fine art competition.
It’s also worth noting that the United States isn’t the first jurisdiction in which Sahni attempted to register the SURYAST work. In 2020, the work was recognized for copyright protection by the copyright office in India when Sahni filed a second application listing himself and the AI software as the authors. The registration later received a withdrawal notice and became subject to an investigation over the use of a machine. Under India’s copyright law, the issue turns on whether or not: (i) AI is capable of meeting the originality requirement, and (ii) the ‘person’, a term that remains undefined in India’s Copyright Act, that is responsible for the computer-generated work (which are recognized under the country’s copyright law) must be a human.
Protecting Partially Generative Derivative Works
An important practical takeaway from this latest development is that the original photograph used as the grounding for a prompt is likely protectable human authorship. Meanwhile, the output of the digital manipulation is not a protectable derivative. This distinction is strategically important for creatives working with generative AI tools.
The USCO has made it clear that generative works are not protectable, and therefore considered public domain. If a copyrightable work is used as the starting point for a finished work that will contain generative material, that may open a loophole (for lack of a better term) to ensuring copyright protection over subsequent exploitations of the finished work, and the portions of the work that may not be entirely human creation.
For example, there may be enough of Sahni’s original photograph contained in the final version of SURYAST to bring claims of infringement if anyone copies, distributes, or otherwise uses the work in an unauthorized manner. It would require Sahni to register the original photograph and meet the other requirements for protection, but theoretically could strengthen any argument against the generative derivative work as being fully in the public domain.
Of course, another key takeaway is that creators should strongly consider having a fully developed legal strategy when communicating with the USCO. This latest letter from the USCO contains critical examples of where changing descriptions of an artistic process, and the tools used, can prove to be detrimental to creators and undermine their attempts to bring clarity as the USCO reviews their application.
Alex Garens of Day Pitney, LLP, is listed as the counsel for Sahni to receive the correspondence with the USCO.

More than half of workers using generative AI in the workplace are doing so without the formal approval of their employers.
That’s according to a global study by Salesforce involving over 14,000 global workers across 14 countries, shedding light on the challenges and risks associated with the unregulated use of this transformative technology.
Despite coordinated efforts by governments worldwide, including the U.S. and the EU, to establish guidelines for responsible AI use, the research suggests that businesses are lagging behind in implementing clear policies. This lack of defined policies poses potential risks to businesses, as employees are leveraging generative AI without proper training, guidance, or approval.









Surprisingly, almost 4 in 10 (39%) global workers state that their employers do not hold a strong opinion about generative AI use in the workplace.
Growing use of generative AI
A striking 28% of workers currently use generative AI at work, with over half doing so without formal approval. An additional 32% expect to incorporate generative AI into their workflow soon, indicating a trend that will persist with or without oversight, found Salesforce.
Even as workers engage in the use of unapproved generative AI tools, they acknowledge the importance of ethical and safe use by adopting company-approved programs. However, alarming trends emerge as 64% of users admit to passing off generative AI work as their own, and 41% would consider overstating their skills to secure job opportunities.
The responsibility does not solely lie with the workers; the survey reveals that nearly 7 in 10 global workers have never received training on the safe and ethical use of generative AI at work. Furthermore, workers express dissatisfaction with their employers' lack of clearly defined or non-existent generative AI policies.
Certain industries, such as healthcare, are identified as laggards in implementing policies, with 87% of workers claiming their companies lack clear guidelines. This raises urgent concerns, especially considering the confidential data involved in such industries, highlighting the need to skill up workers on responsible use.

Clear guidelines needed for AI
Workers, cognizant of the impact of generative AI on their careers, express the belief that mastering the technology would make them more sought after (47%), result in increased job satisfaction (51%), and potentially lead to higher pay (44%).
“To realize AI’s full potential, it’s critical that we invest in the employees using the technology as much as the technology itself,” emphasized Paula Goldman, Chief Ethical and Humane Use Officer at Salesforce. ""With clear guidelines, employees will be able to understand and address AI’s risks while also harnessing its innovations to supercharge their careers.""
The study, conducted in partnership with YouGov from October 18 to 31, 2023, surveyed over 14,000 full-time employees across various sectors in 14 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland, the Nordics, India, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates.

With the level of confidential data held in this industry and others, there is an urgency to skill up workers on responsible use... In fact, nearly 4 in 10 (39%) global workers say their employer doesn't hold a strong opinion about generative AI use in the workplace.  To realise AI's full potential, it's critical that we invest in the employees using the technology as much as the technology itself. With clear guidelines, employees will be able to understand and address AI's risks while also harnessing its innovations to supercharge their careers,  said Paula Goldman, Chief Ethical and Humane Use Officer at Salesforce.",,,,,,en,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'https://schema.org/False', 'cssSelector': '.paywall'}","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Economic Times', 'productID': 'prime.economictimes.indiatimes.com:prime'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Helpful Or Harmful? How AI Shaped Education In 2023
Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing the classroom. Students and educators weigh in on the way forward.

When artificial intelligence went mainstream with the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, it immediately sent ripples through the world of education. Concerns about equity in AI, data privacy, and how to teach ethical AI skills became heated topics at faculty meetings and in classrooms. Two things have become clear: This technology is already transforming education—and people have many questions.
Science Friday hosted a virtual conversation with experts in AI and education in October 2023 to understand the potential AI holds for education and some of the pitfalls to be confronted as it comes to schools across the country. While the path forward may be challenging and occasionally confusing, our guests suggest that by allowing students to lead and guiding them to use AI responsibly, education stands to benefit from innovative tools that will, no doubt, change our world. Here, we recap some of the ideas and insights that came out of that conversation.
Just The Right Amount Of Regulation
A recurring theme around AI in education is that students could use these generative tools to complete their assignments, especially written assignments. Educators are worried that students may not build essential skills if it becomes too easy to misrepresent machine-generated work as their own. In addition to concerns that such use may contribute to cheating, it’s also known that AI can “hallucinate” by returning misinformation that may mislead students. As a result, many schools have banned generative AI completely. But is that realistic?
The answer is no, says Sebastian Rao, a Virginia STEM magnet school senior who has studied the use of AI by students. Instead, he advocates for AI policies that provide “guardrails” for students and educators to make the technology accessible but provide appropriate boundaries. “How do we structure a classroom that uses [AI]?” asks Rao. He says the focus should be to thoughtfully integrate AI technology into classrooms so that students can use it to enhance their education and build new skills.
When schools place strict bans on AI, students (and educators) may be confused and unsure about what they can and can’t use. “We’re having a moment now in education,” notes Andy Forest, founder and executive director of Steamlabs, a non-profit organization focused on innovating around education and equitable access to STEM. “AI tools are just suddenly so capable and competent they are completely disrupting education.” Many students use AI in ways educators and administrators didn’t predict, compounding the problem of regulating their use in the classroom. Meanwhile, the technology is evolving quickly and becoming integrated into an ever-growing range of tools.
Academic tools like Grammarly now use AI, as do search engines like Google and Bing. Khan Academy recently released a free AI-powered tutoring app, Khanmigo, to provide one-on-one tutoring and homework help to students who may not otherwise have access to a live tutor, providing academic equity for low-income learners. “A lot of students don’t really know what to think about a lot of these technologies. Some are confused about, you know, ‘What does AI mean? Is it cheating in certain circumstances?’” explains Rao.
Rather than framing the use of AI as cheating, the U.S. Department of Education is integrating AI into policy because the technology allows educators to support students with a valuable, personalized approach to learning. Knowing how to use AI effectively and ethically will be necessary for students’ future careers. Even the White House is on board. President Biden wrote in a recent executive order that AI will make the world “more prosperous, productive, innovative, and secure.”
Change Is Never Easy
AI will almost certainly change how education looks in the classroom, just as computers and the Internet did decades ago. Krystal Chatman, an Instructional Technology Facilitator in the Jackson Public School District in Jackson, Mississippi, believes educators must develop a growth mindset and let students take a leadership role in policy and implementation. “[B]e comfortable taking a backseat to the knowledgeable student,” Chatman advises educators. “You’re used to being the person they seek knowledge from, but teaching them that they too can be experts provides them with a skill that will take them throughout life.”
Students need to be part of the discussion to understand digital citizenship and where the boundaries lie between, for example, using a tool for brainstorming and being academically dishonest. AI can’t and won’t replace human educators. Students will always need adult guides to help them use AI safely. The key to implementation will be developing a nuanced approach where policy creates an environment that protects students’ privacy and ensures academic integrity.
For all its benefits, AI technology does bring challenges that go beyond cheating or ethics. Many parents, educators, and students are concerned about privacy and safety when using AI tools. Forest explains that governmental regulations on data privacy and intellectual property haven’t caught up to the explosion of AI applications becoming available. “[J]ust continuously ask… ‘What are they doing with my data?’ The more you know about AI and how it can use your data, the better because then you can evaluate those policies,” he says.
There are also many concerns about disparities created by AI for students of minoritized racial backgrounds, students with disabilities, and students who are multilingual. Rao explains that students are concerned about AI detectors because the software can incorrectly label written works as AI-generated when they are not, especially for people whose primary language is not English. That may lead to some students being unfairly accused of cheating, which can derail their education or subject them to stigma. However, the AI detectors can be improved and trained on diverse texts to be more representative and inclusive. “Hold these companies accountable,” Rao says.
Chatman agrees and suggests that any accusation of cheating with AI must include humans who can step in and ensure accusations don’t do unnecessary or unjust harm to students. “I know my students better than any platform ever could,” she says. Perhaps most importantly, Chatman stresses that students must advocate for their rights and lead the way. “[W]hen there’s a school board meeting, you can talk directly to the superintendent, with your school principal, your school leadership. Ask them, ‘How are you protecting us?’”

In July 2022, just a few newsrooms around the world had guidelines or policies for how their journalists and editors could use digital tools that run on artificial intelligence. One year later, dozens of influential, global newsrooms had formal documents related to the use of AI.
In between, artificial intelligence research firm OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot that can produce all sorts of written material when prompted: lines of code, plays, essays, jokes and news-style stories. Elon Musk and Sam Altman founded OpenAI in 2015, with multibillion dollar investments over the years from Microsoft.
Newsrooms including USA Today, The Atlantic, National Public Radio, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Financial Times have since developed AI guidelines or policies — a wave of recognition that AI chatbots could fundamentally change the way journalists do their work and how the public thinks about journalism.
Research posted during September 2023 on preprint server SocArXiv is among the first to examine how newsrooms are handling the proliferating capabilities of AI-based platforms. Preprints have not undergone formal peer review and have not been published in an academic journal, though the current paper is under review at a prominent international journal according to one of the authors, Kim Björn Becker, a lecturer at Trier University in Germany and a staff writer for the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
The analysis provides a snapshot of the current state of AI policies and documents for 52 news organizations, including newsrooms in Brazil, India, North America, Scandinavia and Western Europe.
Notably, the authors write that AI policies and documents from commercial news organizations, compared with those that receive public funding, “seem to be more fine-grained and contain significantly more information on permitted and prohibited applications.”
Commercial news organizations were also more apt to emphasize source protection, urging journalists to take caution when, for example, using AI tools for help making sense of large amounts of confidential or background information, “perhaps owing to the risk legal liability poses to their business model,” they write.
Keep reading to learn what else the researchers found, including a strong focus on journalistic ethics across the documents, as well as real world examples of AI being used in newsrooms — plus, how the findings compare with other recent research.
AI guidance and rules focus on preserving journalistic values
AI chatbots are a type of generative AI, meaning they create content when prompted. They are based on large language models, which themselves are trained on huge amounts of existing text. (OpenAI rivals Google and Meta in the past year have announced their own large language models).
So, when you ask an AI chatbot to write a three-act play, in the style of 19th century Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, about the struggle for human self-determination in a future dominated by robots, it is able to do this because it has processed Ibsen’s work along with the corpus of science fiction about robots overtaking humanity.
Some news organizations for years have used generative AI for published stories, notably the Associated Press for simple coverage of earnings reports and college basketball game previews. Others that have dabbled in AI-generated content have come under scrutiny for publishing confusing or misleading information.
The authors of the recent preprint paper analyzed the AI policies and guidelines, most of them related to generative AI, to understand how publishers “address both expectations and concerns when it comes to using AI in the news,” they write.
The most recent AI document in the dataset is from NPR, dated July 2023. The oldest is from the Council for Mass Media, a self-regulatory body of news organizations in Finland, dated January 2020.
“One thing that was remarkable to me is that the way in which organizations dealt with AI at this stage did exhibit a very strong sense of conserving journalistic values,” says Becker. “Many organizations were really concerned about not losing their credibility, not losing their audience, not trying to give away what makes journalism stand out — especially in a world where misinformation is around in a much larger scale than ever before.”
Other early adopters include the BBC and German broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk, “which have gained widespread attention through industry publications and conferences,” and “have served as influential benchmarks for others,” the authors write.
Many of the documents were guidelines — frameworks, or best practices for thinking about how journalists interact with and use AI, says Christopher Crum, a doctoral candidate at Oxford University and another co-author. But a few were prescriptive policies, Crum says.
Among the findings:

Just over 71% of the documents mention one or more journalistic values, such as public service, objectivity, autonomy, immediacy — meaning publishing or broadcasting news quickly — and ethics.
Nearly 70% of the AI documents were designed for editorial staff, while most of the rest applied to an entire organization. This would include the business side, which might use AI for advertising or hiring purposes. One policy only applied to the business side.
And 69% mentioned AI pitfalls, such as “hallucinations,” the authors write, in which an AI system makes up facts.
About 63% specified the guidelines would be updated at some point in the future — 6% of those “specified a particular interval for updates,” the authors write — while 37% did not indicate if or when the policies would be updated.
Around 54% of the documents cautioned journalists to be careful to protect sources when using AI, with several addressing the potential risk of revealing confidential sources when feeding information into an AI chatbot.
Some 44% allow journalists to use AI to gather information and develop story ideas, angles and outlines. Another 4% disallow this use, while half do not specify.
Meanwhile, 42% allow journalists to use AI to alter editorial content, such as editing and updating stories, while 6% disallow this use and half do not specify.
Only 8% state how the AI policies would be enforced, while the rest did not mention accountability mechanisms.

How the research was conducted
The authors found about two-thirds of the AI policy documents online and obtained the remainder through professional and personal contacts. About two-fifths were written in English. The authors translated the rest into English using DeepL, a translation service based on neural learning, a backbone of AI.
They then used statistical software to break the documents into five-word blocks, to assess their similarity. It’s a standard way to linguistically compare texts, Crum says. He explains that the phrase “I see the dog run fast” would have two five-word blocks: “I see the dog run,” and “see the dog run fast.”
If one document said, “I see the dog run fast” while another said, “I see the dog run quickly,” the first block of five words would be the same, the second block different — and the overall similarity between the documents would be lower than if the sentences were identical.
As a benchmark for comparison, the authors performed the same analysis on the news organizations’ editorial guidelines. The editorial guidelines were a bit more similar than the AI guidelines, the authors find.
“Because of the additional uncertainty in the [AI] space, the finding is that the AI guidelines are coalescing at a slightly lower degree than existing editorial guidelines,” Crum says. “The potential explanation might be, and this is speculative and not in the paper, something along the lines of, editorial guidelines have had more time to coalesce, whereas AI guidelines at this stage, while often influenced by existing AI guidelines, are still in the nascent stages of development.”
The authors also manually identified overarching characteristics of the documents relating to journalistic ethics, transparency and human supervision of AI. About nine-tenths of the documents specified that if AI were used in a story or investigation, that had to be disclosed. 
“My impression is not that organizations are afraid of AI,” Becker says. “They encourage employees to experiment with this new technology and try to make some good things out of it — for example, being faster in their reporting, being more accurate, if possible, finding new angles, stuff like that. But at the same time, indicating that, under no circumstances, shall they pose a risk on journalistic credibility.”
AI in the newsroom is evolving
The future of AI in the newsroom is taking shape, whether that means journalists primarily using AI as a tool in their work, or whether newsrooms become broadly comfortable with using AI to produce publicly facing content. The Journalist’s Resource has used DALL.E 2, an OpenAI product, to create images to accompany human-reported and written research roundups and articles.
Journalists, editors and newsroom leaders should, “engage with these new tools, explore them and their potential, and learn how to pragmatically apply them in creating and delivering value to audiences,” researcher and consultant David Caswell writes in a September 2023 report for the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford. “There are no best practices, textbooks or shortcuts for this yet, only engaging, doing and learning until a viable way forward appears. Caution is advisable, but waiting for complete clarity is not.”
The Associated Press in 2015 began using AI to generate stories on publicly traded firms’ quarterly earnings reports. But recently, the organization’s AI guidelines released during August 2023 specify that AI “cannot be used to create publishable content and images for the news service.”
The AP had partnered with AI-content generation firm Automated Insights to produce the earnings stories, The Verge reported in January 2015. The AP also used Automated Insights to generate more than 5,000 previews for NCAA Division I men’s basketball games during the 2018 season.
Early this year, Futurism staff writer Frank Landymore wrote that tech news outlet CNET had been publishing AI-generated articles. Over the summer, Axios’ Tyler Buchanan reported USA Today was pausing its use of AI to create high school sports stories after several such articles in The Columbus Dispatch went viral for peculiar phrasing, such as “a close encounter of the athletic kind.”
And on Nov. 27, Futurism published an article by Maggie Harrison citing anonymous sources alleging that Sports Illustrated has recently been using AI-generated content and authors, with AI-generated headshots, for articles on product reviews.
Senior media writer Tom Jones of the Poynter Institute wrote the next day that the “story has again unsettled journalists concerned about AI-created content, especially when you see a name such as Sports Illustrated involved.”
The Arena Group, which publishes Sports Illustrated, posted a statement on X the same day the Futurism article was published, denying that Sports Illustrated had published AI-generated articles. According to the statement, the product review articles produced by a third-party company, AdVon Commerce, were “written and edited by humans,” but “AdVon had writers use a pen or pseudo name in certain articles to protect author privacy — actions we strongly condemn — and we are removing the content while our internal investigation continues and have since ended the partnership.”
On Dec. 11, the Arena Group fired its CEO. Arena’s board of directors “met and took actions to improve the operational efficiency and revenue of the company,” the company said in a brief statement, which did not mention the AI allegations. Several other high level Arena Group executives were also fired last week, including the COO, according to the statement.
Many of the 52 policies reviewed for the preprint paper take a measured approach. About half caution journalists against feeding unpublished work into AI chatbots. Many of those that did were from commercial organizations.
For example, reporters may obtain voluminous government documents, or have hundreds of pages of interview notes or transcripts and may want to use AI to help make sense of it all. At least one policy advised reporters to treat anything that goes into an AI chatbot as published — and publicly accessible, Becker says.
Crum adds that the research team was “agnostic” in its approach — not for or against newsrooms using AI — with the goal of conveying the current landscape of newsroom AI guidelines and policies.
Themes on human oversight in other recent research
Becker, Crum and their coauthor on the preprint, Felix Simon, a communication researcher and doctoral student at Oxford, are among a growing body of scholars and journalists interested in informing how newsrooms use AI.
In July, University of Amsterdam postdoctoral researcher Hannes Cools and Northwestern University communications professor Nick Diakopoulos published an article for the Generative AI in the Newsroom project, which Diakopoulos edits, examining publicly available AI guidelines from 21 newsrooms.
Cools and Diakopoulos read the documents and identified themes. The guidelines generally stress the need for human oversight. Cools and Diakopoulos examined AI documents from many of the same newsrooms as the preprint authors, including the CBC, Insider, Reuters, Nucleo, Wired and Mediahuis, among others.
“At least for the externally facing policies, I don’t see them as enforceable policies,” says Diakopoulos. “It’s more like principal statements: ‘Here’s our goals as an organization.’
As for feeding confidential material into AI chatbots, Diakopoulos says that the underlying issue is about potentially sharing that information with a third party — OpenAI, for example — not in using the chatbot itself. There are “versions of generative AI that run locally on your own computer or on your own server,” and those should be unproblematic to use as a journalistic tool, he says.
“There was also what I call hybridity,” Diakopoulos says. “Kind of the need to have humans and algorithms working together, hybridized into human-computer systems, in order to keep the quality of journalism high while also leveraging the capabilities of AI and automation and algorithms for making things more efficient or trying to improve the comprehensiveness of investigations.”
For local and regional newsrooms interested in developing their own guidelines, there may be little need to reinvent the wheel. The Paris Charter, developed among 16 organizations and initiated by Reporters Without Borders, is a good place to start for understanding the fundamental ethics of using AI in journalism, Diakopoulos says.

RACEThis article is the second in a series about modern artificial intelligence.At 1 p.m. on a Friday shortly before Christmas last year, Kent Walker, Google’s top lawyer, summoned four of his employees and ruined their weekend.The group worked in SL1001, a bland building with a blue glass facade betraying no sign that dozens of lawyers inside were toiling to protect the interests of one of the world’s most influential companies. For weeks they had been prepping for a meeting of powerful executives to discuss the safety of Google’s products. The deck was done. But that afternoon Mr. Walker told his team the agenda had changed, and they would have to spend the next few days preparing new slides and graphs.Listen to This ArticleListen · 29:25 minIn fact, the entire agenda of the company had changed — all in the course of nine days. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, had decided to ready a slate of products based on artificial intelligence — immediately. He turned to Mr. Walker, the same lawyer he was trusting to defend the company in a profit-threatening antitrust case in Washington, D.C. Mr. Walker knew he would need to persuade the Advanced Technology Review Council, as Google called the group of executives, to throw off their customary caution and do as they were told.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt was an edict, and edicts didn’t happen very often at Google. But Google was staring at a real crisis. Its business model was potentially at risk.What had set off Mr. Pichai and the rest of Silicon Valley was ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence program that had been released on Nov. 30, 2022, by an upstart called OpenAI. It had captured the imagination of millions of people who had thought A.I. was science fiction until they started playing with the thing. It was a sensation. It was also a problem.At the Googleplex, famed for its free food, massages, fitness classes and laundry services, Mr. Pichai was also playing with ChatGPT. Its wonders did not wow him. Google had been developing its own A.I. technology that did many of the same things. Mr. Pichai was focused on ChatGPT’s flaws — that it got stuff wrong, that sometimes it turned into a biased pig. What amazed him was that OpenAI had gone ahead and released it anyway, and that consumers loved it. If OpenAI could do that, why couldn’t Google?Why not plow ahead? That’s the question that loomed over A.I.’s adolescence — the year or so after the technology made the leap from lab to living room. There was hand-wringing over chatbots writing seductive phishing emails and spewing disinformation, or high schoolers using them to cheat their way to an A. Doomsayers insisted that unfettered A.I. could lead to the end of humankind.For tech company bosses, the decision of when and how to turn A.I. into a (hopefully) profitable business was a more simple risk-reward calculus. But to win, you had to have a product.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBy Monday morning, Dec. 12, the team at SL1001 had a new agenda with a deck labeled “Privileged and Confidential/Need to Know.” Most attendees tuned in over videoconference. Mr. Walker started the meeting by announcing that Google was moving ahead with a chatbot and A.I. capabilities that would be added to cloud, search and other products.“What are your concerns? Let’s get in line,” Mr. Walker said, according to Jen Gennai, the director of responsible innovation.There would be guardrails, but approvals would be fast-tracked. Mr. Walker called it the “green lane” approach. It was all laid out in the deck. Opportunities for “Green Lane streamlining” were identified. Dangers were color-coded. Blue indicated risks where “mitigations” were “required.” Risks that were “controllable with minimum thresholds/mitigations” were rendered in orange.In one chart, under “Hate & Toxicity,” the plan was to “curb stereotypes, toxicity and hate speech in outputs.” One topic was: “What are we missing in order to fast-track approvals?”Not everyone was on board. “My standards are as high if not higher than they usually are, and we will be going through a review process with all of this,” Ms. Gennai remembered a cloud executive saying.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEventually a compromise was reached. They would limit the rollout, Ms. Gennai said. And they would avoid calling anything a product. For Google, it would be an experiment. That way it didn’t have to be perfect. (A Google spokeswoman said the A.T.R.C. did not have the power to decide how the products would be released.)What played out at Google was repeated at other tech giants after OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022. They all had technology in various stages of development that relied on neural networks — A.I. systems that recognized sounds, generated images and chatted like a human. That technology had been pioneered by Geoffrey Hinton, an academic who had worked briefly with Microsoft and was now at Google. But the tech companies had been slowed by fears of rogue chatbots, and economic and legal mayhem.Once ChatGPT was unleashed, none of that mattered as much, according to interviews with more than 80 executives and researchers, as well as corporate documents and audio recordings. The instinct to be first or biggest or richest — or all three — took over. The leaders of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies set a new course and pulled their employees along with them.Over 12 months, Silicon Valley was transformed. Turning artificial intelligence into actual products that individuals and companies could use became the priority. Worries about safety and whether machines would turn on their creators were not ignored, but they were shunted aside — at least for the moment.At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg, who had once proclaimed the metaverse to be the future, reorganized parts of the company formerly known as Facebook around A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTElon Musk, the billionaire who co-founded OpenAI but had left the lab in a huff, vowed to create his own A.I. company. He called it X.AI and added it to his already full plate.Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, had invested in OpenAI three years before and was letting the start-up’s cowboys tap into its computing power. He sped up his plans to incorporate A.I. into Microsoft’s products — and give Google a poke in its searching eye.“Speed is even more important than ever,” Sam Schillace, a top executive, wrote Microsoft employees. It would be, he added, an “absolutely fatal error in this moment to worry about things that can be fixed later.”ImageCredit...Hokyoung KimA ‘Low Key Research Preview’The strange thing was that the leaders of OpenAI never thought ChatGPT would shake up Silicon Valley. In early November 2022, a few weeks before it was released to the world, it didn’t really exist as a product. Most of the 375 employees working in their new offices, a former mayonnaise factory, were focused on a more powerful version of technology, called GPT-4, that could answer almost any question using information gleaned from an enormous collection of data scraped from seemingly everywhere.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt was revolutionary, but there were problems. Sometimes the tech spewed hate speech and misinformation. The engineers at OpenAI kept postponing the launch and talking about what to do.One option was to release an older, less powerful version of the technology — and just see what happened. The idea, according to four people familiar with OpenAI’s work, was to watch the public’s reaction and use it to work out the kinks.And though some executives have downplayed it, they wanted to beat the competition. Lots of tech companies were working on their own A.I. chatbots. But the people to beat were at Anthropic, started the year before by researchers and engineers who left OpenAI because they thought that Sam Altman, its chief executive, had not made safety a priority as A.I. grew more powerful. The defectors had helped build the technology that OpenAI was so excited about before they trooped out the door.In mid-November 2022, Mr. Altman; Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president; and others met in a top-floor conference room to discuss the problems with their breakthrough tech yet again. Suddenly Mr. Altman made the decision — they would release the old, less-powerful technology.The plan was to call it Chat with GPT 3.5 and put it out by the end of the month. They referred to it as a “low key research preview.” It didn’t feel like a big-deal decision to anyone in the room.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We plan to frame it as a research release,” Mira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, told staff over Slack. “This reduces risk in all dimensions while allowing us to learn a lot,” she wrote. “We are aiming to move quickly over the next few days to make it happen.”The underlying code was a bit of a blob. It needed to be converted into something regular people without Ph.D.s could interact with. Mr. Altman and other executives asked a group of engineers to graft a graphical user interface — a GUI, pronounced gooey — onto the blob. A GUI is the face of an application, where you type and press buttons.A GUI had been created earlier that year to show the technology to Bill Gates, Microsoft’s founder, at his home outside Seattle. They stuck the same GUI on and changed the name to ChatGPT. About two weeks after Mr. Altman made his decision, they were good to go.On Nov. 29, the night before the launch, Mr. Brockman hosted drinks for the team. He didn’t think ChatGPT would attract a lot of attention, he said. His prediction: “no more than one tweet thread with 5k likes.”Mr. Brockman was wrong. On the morning of Nov. 30, Mr. Altman tweeted about OpenAI’s new product, and the company posted a jargon-heavy blog item. And then, ChatGPT took off. Almost immediately, sign-ups overwhelmed the company’s servers. Engineers rushed in and out of a messy space near the office kitchen, huddling over laptops to pull computing power from other projects. In five days, more than a million people had used ChatGPT. Within a few weeks, that number would top 100 million. Though nobody was quite sure why, it was a hit. Network news programs tried to explain how it worked. A late-night comedy show even used it to write (sort of funny) jokes.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAfter things settled down, OpenAI employees used DALL-E, the company’s A.I. image generator, to make a laptop sticker labeled “Low key research preview.” It showed a computer about to be consumed by flames.Zuckerberg Gets WarnedActually, months earlier Meta had released its own chatbot — to very little notice.BlenderBot was a flop. The A.I.-powered bot, released in August 2022, was built to carry on conversations — and that it did. It said that Donald J. Trump was still president and that President Biden had lost in 2020. Mark Zuckerberg, it told a user, was “creepy.” Then two weeks before ChatGPT was released, Meta introduced Galactica. Designed for scientific research, it could instantly write academic articles and solve math problems. Someone asked it to write a research paper about the history of bears in space. It did. After three days, Galactica was shut down.Mr. Zuckerberg’s head was elsewhere. He had spent the entire year reorienting the company around the metaverse and was focused on virtual and augmented reality.But ChatGPT would demand his attention. His top A.I. scientist, Yann LeCun, arrived in the Bay Area from New York about six weeks later for a routine management meeting at Meta, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Dr. LeCun led a double life — as Meta’s chief A.I. scientist and a professor at New York University. The Frenchman had won the Turing Award, computer science’s most prestigious honor, alongside Dr. Hinton, for work on neural networks.As they waited in line for lunch at a cafe in Meta’s Frank Gehry-designed headquarters, Dr. LeCun delivered a warning to Mr. Zuckerberg. He said Meta should match OpenAI’s technology and also push forward with work on an A.I. assistant that could do stuff on the internet on your behalf. Websites like Facebook and Instagram could become extinct, he warned. A.I. was the future.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Zuckerberg didn’t say much, but he was listening. There was plenty of A.I. at work across Meta’s apps — Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp — but it was under the hood. Mr. Zuckerberg was frustrated. He wanted the world to recognize the power of Meta’s A.I. Dr. LeCun had always argued that going open-source, making the code public, would attract countless researchers and developers to Meta’s technology, and help improve it at a far faster pace. That would allow Meta to catch up — and put Mr. Zuckerberg back in league with his fellow moguls. But it would also allow anyone to manipulate the technology to do bad things.At dinner that evening, Mr. Zuckerberg approached Dr. LeCun. “I have been thinking about what you said,” Mr. Zuckerberg told his chief A.I. scientist, according to a person familiar with the conversation. “And I think you’re right.”In Paris, Dr. LeCun’s scientists had developed an A.I.-powered bot that they wanted to release as open-source technology. Open source meant that anyone could tinker with its code. They called it Genesis, and it was pretty much ready to go. But when they sought permission to release it, Meta’s legal and policy teams pushed back, according to five people familiar with the discussion.Caution versus speed was furiously debated among the executive team in early 2023 as Mr. Zuckerberg considered Meta’s course in the wake of ChatGPT.Had everyone forgotten about the last seven years of Facebook’s history? That was the question asked by the legal and policy teams. They reminded Mr. Zuckerberg about the uproar over hate speech and misinformation on Meta’s platforms and the scrutiny the company had endured by the news media and Congress after the 2016 election.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOpen sourcing the code might put powerful tech into the hands of those with bad intentions and Meta would take the blame. Jennifer Newstead, Meta’s chief legal officer, told Mr. Zuckerberg that an open-source approach to A.I. could attract the attention of regulators who already had the company in their cross hairs, according to two people familiar with her concerns.At a meeting in late January in his office, called the aquarium because it looked like one, Mr. Zuckerberg told executives that he had made his decision. Parts of Meta would be reorganized and its priorities changed. There would be weekly meetings to update executives on A.I. progress. Hundreds of employees would be moved around. Mr. Zuckerberg declared in a Facebook post that Meta would “turbocharge” its work on A.I.Mr. Zuckerberg wanted to push out a project fast. The researchers in Paris were ready with Genesis. The name was changed to LLaMA, short for “Large Language Model Meta AI,” and released to 4,000 researchers outside the company. Soon Meta received over 100,000 requests for access to the code.But within days of LLaMA’s release, someone put the code on 4chan, the fringe online message board. Meta had lost control of its chatbot, raising the possibility that the worst fears of its legal and policy teams would come true. Researchers at Stanford University showed that the Meta system could easily do things like generate racist material.On June 6, Mr. Zuckerberg received a letter about LLaMA from Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Richard Blumental of Connecticut. “Hawley and Blumental demand answers from Meta,” said a news release.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe letter called Meta’s approach risky and vulnerable to abuse and compared it unfavorably with ChatGPT. Why, the senators seemed to want to know, couldn’t Meta be more like OpenAI?Under the Tent at MicrosoftFor Mr. Nadella, the realization that OpenAI’s tech could change everything did not come as an “Aha!” moment. After investing $1 billion in 2019, Microsoft slowly started playing with the start-up’s code. First up was GitHub, the company’s code storage service. A few teams of engineers started experimenting with OpenAI’s tech to help them write code.Over dinner in Microsoft’s boardroom with a friend in the summer of 2021, Mr. Nadella said he was beginning to see the technology as a game changer. It would touch every part of Microsoft’s business and every human being, he predicted. (The GitHub experiment eventually became a product: GitHub Copilot.)A year later, Mr. Nadella got a peek at what would become GPT-4. Mr. Nadella asked it to translate a poem written in Persian by Rumi, who died in 1273, into Urdu. It did. He asked it to transliterate the Urdu into English characters. It did that, too. “Then I said, ‘God, this thing,’” Mr. Nadella recalled in an interview. From that moment, he was all in.Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI had already grown to $3 billion. Now Microsoft was planning to increase that to $10 billion.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEven for Microsoft, which was sitting on $105 billion in cash, that was real money. OpenAI was structured as a nonprofit. Microsoft would not get a board seat. But it had the right to use OpenAI’s code. That meant Microsoft and OpenAI were partners and competitors.At the end of the summer of 2022, Microsoft’s offices weren’t yet back to their prepandemic bustle. But on Sept. 13, Mr. Nadella summoned his top executives to a meeting at Building 34, Microsoft’s executive nerve center. It was two months before Mr. Altman made the decision to release ChatGPT.He and Mr. Brockman demonstrated GPT-4 for the group. First they asked it biology questions. Then Mr. Brockman let the executives try to stump the chatbot. At one point the chatbot was asked a question about photosynthesis. Not only did it answer, but it ruled out other possibilities. Peter Lee, the head of Microsoft Research, was surprised it seemed to know how to reason. He turned to Microsoft’s chief scientist, who was sitting next to him, and asked, “What is going on there?!”Then Mr. Nadella took the lectern to tell his lieutenants that everything was about to change. This was an executive order from a leader who typically favored consensus. “We are pivoting the whole company on this technology,” Eric Horvitz, the chief scientist, later remembered him saying. “This is a central advancement in the history of computing, and we are going to be on that wave at the front of it.”It all had to stay secret for the time being. Not everyone would be brought into the tent, and at Microsoft, tents were where the important stuff happened. Three “tented projects” were set up in early October to get the big pivot started. They were devoted to cybersecurity, the Bing search engine, Microsoft Word and related software.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAbout two months later, Yusuf Mehdi, a marketing executive, demonstrated the Bing chatbot for some members of the board. They weren’t sold on it. They found the product overly complicated and without a clear vision to communicate to consumers. Mr. Nadella’s team hadn’t nailed it.Two weeks later, Mr. Mehdi met with the full board. This time the version he demonstrated was more simple and consumer-friendly. It was a go.Microsoft invited journalists to its Redmond, Wash., campus on Feb. 7 to introduce a chatbot in Bing to the world. They were instructed not to tell anybody they were going to a Microsoft event, and the topic wasn’t disclosed.But somehow, Google found out. On Feb. 6, to get out ahead of Microsoft, it put up a blog post by Mr. Pichai announcing that Google would be introducing its own chatbot, Bard. It didn’t say exactly when.ImageCredit...Hokyoung KimMr. Altman had just arrived at Microsoft’s conference center for a dry run of the show when Mr. Mehdi grabbed him and showed him Mr. Pichai’s post.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“‘Oh my gosh, this is hysterical,’” Mr. Mehdi recalled Mr. Altman saying. Just then Mr. Nadella walked out of the room where he had been rehearsing. Mr. Altman suggested that he and Mr. Nadella take a selfie. He posted it on Twitter to tweak Google.“Hello from redmond! excited for the event tomorrow,” tweeted Mr. Altman, who had more than 1.3 million Twitter followers.By the morning of Feb. 8, the day after Microsoft announced the chatbot, its shares were up 5 percent. But for Google, the rushed announcement became an embarrassment. Researchers spotted errors in Google’s blog post. An accompanying GIF simulated Bard saying that the Webb telescope had captured the first pictures of an exoplanet, a planet outside the solar system. In fact, a telescope at the European Southern Observatory in northern Chile got the first image of an exoplanet in 2004. Bard had gotten it wrong, and Google was ribbed in the news media and on social media.It was, as Mr. Pichai later said in an interview, “unfortunate.” Google’s stock dropped almost 8 percent, wiping out more than $100 billion in value.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt turned out that there were errors in Microsoft’s presentation, too. But nobody had noticed.ImageCredit...Hokyoung KimA Google GoodbyeThere was no question the Bing chatbot put Microsoft ahead of Google, and in spring 2023 Mr. Nadella bought more than $2 billion in computer chips to keep it that way, according to two people familiar with the budget. “We have a big order coming to you, a really big order coming to you,” Mr. Nadella gleefully told Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, Mr. Huang said.Mr. Pichai, at Google, felt like a scuba diver. The fallout from Google’s announcement about Bard was tumultuous, and that was like navigating the rough top foot of an ocean. But underneath the surface, the water was calm, and he was focused on the coming release of Google’s A.I. products.Mr. Pichai oversaw more than 2,000 researchers divided between two labs, Google Brain and DeepMind. In April, he merged them. Google DeepMind would develop an A.I. system called Gemini. To run it, Mr. Pichai chose Demis Hassabis, a founder of DeepMind. Mr. Hassabis had long and loudly warned that A.I. could destroy humanity. Now he would be in charge of leading Google to artificial intelligence supremacy.Geoffrey Hinton, Google’s best-known scientist, had always poked fun at people like Dr. Hassabis — the doomers, rationalists and effective altruists who worried that A.I would end mankind in the near future. He had developed much of the science behind artificial intelligence as a professor at the University of Toronto and became a wealthy man after joining Google in 2013. He is often called the godfather of A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut the new chatbots changed everything for him. The science had moved more quickly than he had expected. Microsoft’s introduction of its chatbot convinced him that Google would have no choice but to try to catch up. And the corporate race shaping up between tech giants seemed dangerous.“If you think of Google as a company whose aim is to make profits,” Dr. Hinton said in April, “they can’t just let Bing take over from Google search. They’ve got to compete with that. When Microsoft decided to release a chatbot as the interface for Bing, that was the end of the holiday period.”Dr. Hinton spent a lot of time mulling his own role in the development of A.I. Sometimes he felt regretful. Other times he jokingly sent friends a video of Edith Piaf singing “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien.” But finally, he decided to quit.For the first time in more than 50 years, he stepped away from research. And then in April, he called Mr. Pichai and said goodbye. Susan Beachy contributed research.Audio produced by Tally AbecassisKaren Weise writes about technology and is based in Seattle.

In a recent AI report, it was uncovered that Artificial Intelligence-induced job losses have been on the rise, aggravating concerns from top tech leaders like Elon Musk.
AI Technology Driving More Job Losses
AI gained significant prominence this year with the launch of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT from OpenAI. The multiple innovative functionalities of this technology have thrown several employees out of their jobs. Precisely, AI can complete several tasks including designing documents and coding.

A report from ResumeBuilder’s research of 750 businesses showed that a significant percentage of these businesses agree with the job losses report. About 37% confirmed that AI technology replaced workers this year. Another 44% see the possibility of having more layoffs in the coming year. Similarly,  Asana’s State of AI at Work 2023 report shows that employees believed 29% of their tasks had been taken over by AI. 
It is worth noting that Asana supports “human-centered AI,” which involves the enhancement of human abilities and collaboration with this technology, not the outright replacement of people.
Artificial Intelligence Focusing on Enhanced Intelligence





For the second group of ResumeBuilder’s survey, their projection finds its foundation on the basis that AI is becoming more efficient with more functionalities. Google recently teased the capabilities of its AI chatbot dubbed Gemini. According to a shared demonstration video, Gemini displayed its highly interactive capability by accurately naming a duck that was created using lines and shapes.

Musk once said that Artificial Intelligence is taking humans to a point where no job is needed. Google’s Gemini and many other emerging AI tools are showing a new frontier in LLM design and the potential of Musk’s prediction becoming true. However, some experts do not share this same sentiment even though they acknowledge the innovative offerings of AI.
Julia Toothacre, a resume and career strategist at ResumeBuilder noted that the research may not be a true representation of the broad business landscape. Hence, it would not be wise to conclude from the results. 





“There are still so many traditional organizations and small businesses that do not embrace technology the way that some of the larger companies do,” Toothacre clarified.
While these layoffs are increasing, it is pertinent to understand that AI is not the only driver. Many of these businesses are going through restructuring and AI comes off as a viable alternative.

Artificial intelligence has been around for decades, but with the launch of ChatGPT last year, generative AI has become a tool that is impacting nearly every business. For CPG companies and retailers who are tasked with staying ahead of ever-evolving consumer behaviors and new economic pressures, AI can solve several challenges and turn data into actionable insights. It can transform systems and processes throughout the supply chain, elevate shopper experiences with highly personalized product content, and help companies more clearly understand consumer-buying behavior to create actionable strategies. However, AI is not magic. To fully take advantage of what it can offer, companies must first ensure they are working with high-quality data, use AI to address the right challenges and never underestimate the power of human touch. Big data and high-quality data are both critical to power strategic decision makingMcKinsey has predicted that by 2025, data will be embedded in every interaction, and process. And as AI starts to impact numerous parts of a business, how the two components work together becomes key. AI requires a tremendous amount of data to effectively learn and make decisions, and big data needs to leverage AI for better analysis. However, you’re only as strong as your weakest data point. High-quality data is required to train AI models in order for them to be high quality models. Simply put: The more accurate the data, the more accurate the model prediction. Inaccurate data creates exponential errors. For example, if the AI is missing information, it will fill in the blanks with what seems correct, based on algorithms. It will also assume that it has all the data it needs. If the data is out of date, the decisions AI makes may leave out critical updates.Companies embracing AI need to champion data quality. They need to ensure that datasets are complete, with no empty cells. The industry is also exploring ways to accurately fill in these gaps based on high-quality data. For example, generative AI may be used for predictive text, filling in missing receipt information to inform insights. The datasets should also include consistent variables. And of course, accuracy and validity, at every level, is critical. Successful AI implementations require iterations on the underlying data. To get the most out of your AI, you want to make sure you are pulling from a trusted source providing data that is updated regularly and carefully reviewed. Manage data sprawl to more efficiently act on insights  In today’s dynamic retail and CPG landscape, data and analytics are critical to success. But vast ecosystems of disparate data formats and sources make it more difficult than ever to prepare, visualize, interpret, and act on insights. Incorporating AI into this analysis can be a game changer. For example, AI can enhance supply chains, helping companies more efficiently manage and optimize logistics. Another common application for retailers is using AI to automate item coding and classification, which is especially critical as the volume of e-commerce information skyrockets. AI can also provide automation on retailer-defined hierarchy definitions, generating automatic rules that can code characteristics a retailer is looking for. And the new generation of Intelligent Voice Assistants can deliver hyper-personalized responses by reviewing data analytics, previous conversations, location, and product information.What once felt like an overwhelming amount of data can be quickly analyzed and acted on by AI. But frequently, this too is complicated by disconnected or isolated data stacks. Multiple datasets are only valuable when they can talk to each other. Retailers must connect the right sources of data to successfully analyze omnichannel behavior. They need to evaluate how and when data is collected across platforms and simplify and accelerate access to massive sources of data—ideally accessing and querying data instantaneously. And they also need to scale effortlessly as their business grows. A human touch is still a requirement While the possibilities may seem endless, AI is still often met with both excitement and concern. While the biggest transformation of generative AI is its ability to allow more non-technical people to effectively ask and answer questions, one of the most common concerns is the fear that AI will replace humans in the workforce. While AI can process data and identify patterns in amounts and at speeds that humans simply cannot, it can’t replace the human touch.  For a successful future using AI, humans must continue to play a key role—in both the planning and the execution. The best results will come from combining AI with critical thinking. What humans bring to the table that AI cannot is real life experience, creativity, and intuition. And the ability to check the work and prevent dreaded AI hallucinations—outputs of confident and authoritative language which is nonetheless completely incorrect.​ The bottom line is that to successfully work at scale, CPG companies and retailers must embrace AI and prioritize high-quality data. As AI becomes an increasingly prominent part of the equation, agile platforms that can easily adapt to changing requirements will be essential. New tools democratize like never before, but to take full advantage, companies still must focus on structure, unified systems, and simplified approaches. And they must ensure they are partnering with trusted data and insights providers who are taking a deliberate approach to enhancing and operationalizing their models, thoughtfully integrating cutting-edge technologies, and continually assessing and improving performance.

As artificial intelligence tools become cheaper and more widely available, government agencies and private companies are rapidly deploying them to perform basic functions and increase productivity. Indeed, by one estimate, global spending on artificial intelligence, including software, hardware, and services, will reach $154 billion this year, and more than double that by 2026. As in other government and private-sector offices, election officials around the country already use AI to perform important but limited functions effectively. Most election offices, facing budget and staff constraints, will undoubtedly face substantial pressure to expand the use of AI to improve efficiency and service to voters, particularly as the rest of the world adopts this technology more widely.
In the course of writing this resource, we spoke with several election officials who are currently using or considering how to integrate AI into their work. While a number of election officials were excited about the ways in which new AI capabilities could improve the functioning of their offices, most expressed concern that they didn’t have the proper tools to determine whether and how to incorporate these new technologies safely. They have good reason to worry. Countless examples of faulty AI deployment in recent years illustrate how AI systems can exacerbate bias, “hallucinate” false information, and otherwise make mistakes that human supervisors fail to notice.
Any office that works with AI should ensure that it does so with appropriate attention to quality, transparency, and consistency. These standards are especially vital for election offices, where accuracy and public trust are essential to preserving the health of our democracy and protecting the right to vote. In this resource, we examine how AI is already being used in election offices and how that use could evolve as the technology advances and becomes more widely available. We also offer election officials a set of preliminary recommendations for implementing safeguards for any deployed or planned AI systems ahead of the 2024 vote. A checklist summarizing these recommendations appears at the end of this resource. 
As AI adoption expands across the election administration space, federal and state governments must develop certification standards and monitoring regimes for its use both in election offices and by vendors. President Joe Biden’s October 2023 Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence marks a pivotal first step, as it requires federal regulators to develop guidelines for AI use by critical infrastructure owners and operators (a designation that has included owners of election infrastructure since 2017) by late spring 2024.
Under its recently announced artificial intelligence roadmap, CISA will provide guidance for secure and resilient AI development and deployment, alongside recommendations for mitigating AI-enabled threats to critical infrastructure. But this is only a start. It remains unclear how far the development of these guidelines will go and what election systems they will cover. The recommendations in this resource are meant to assist election officials as they determine whether and how to integrate and use AI in election administration, whether before or after new federal guidelines are published next year.

R Street Cybersecurity-Artificial Intelligence Working Group 





Overview
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies has opened the floodgates to novel opportunities and applications. Alongside these opportunities, attendant cybersecurity threats are also expected to rise. In September 2023, the R Street Institute launched a six-month-long working group bringing together experts from government, the private sector, academia and civil society to examine use cases; existing regulatory and legislative proposals; and best practices and possible paths forward for policymakers and their staff, as well as the broader community, during this innovative and transformative era. 
Cybersecurity is constantly evolving. Organizations and individuals are leveraging AI to automate and/or aid detection, response and remediation of cyber incidents and to automate repetitive processes so responders can focus on higher priority threats, among many other uses. Meanwhile, others are exploring how AI may be used to further protect national security systems as threat actors and criminals use it to improve their tactics, techniques and procedures for infiltrating organizations or compromising individuals. 
The group will meet monthly in the beginning to consider a range of topics from uses to safeguards, intending to identify current and future cases for AI applications in cybersecurity and offer best practices for addressing concerns and weighing them against potential benefits. The working group will produce written products and host public and private events and briefings for members and other experts to address and educate on the nexus between AI and cybersecurity as it pertains to the group’s ongoing work and emerging developments.

The Department of Energy has dissolved its Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office and transferred much of its work to its Office of Science and the Office of the Chief Information Officer, an agency spokesperson confirmed to FedScoop. 
The update came just after DOE announced the creation of a new Office of Critical and Emergency Technology, which is set to focus on areas including AI and semiconductors. Helena Fu was named that office’s director, as well as the agency’s new chief AI officer. 
Energy also has a new responsible AI official: Bridget Carper, deputy chief information officer for architecture, engineering, technology, and innovation in the Office of the Chief Information Officer.
“DOE is committed to U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, and the Department has a significant role to play. The recent growth in modern AI capabilities calls for a dedicated, cross-departmental effort on AI. Leveraging AI models in conjunction with other critical and emerging technologies, including biotechnology and quantum computing, will be transformative,” an agency spokesperson said in a statement to FedScoop.

They continued: “In October, President Biden, in his executive order on AI, directed DOE to create an office to coordinate the Department’s work on critical and emerging technologies, including AI. The work of the Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office will be absorbed into other areas of the Department, particularly the Office of Science and the Office of the Chief Information Officer.”

Each month, HBJ plans on bringing you interesting topics led by our new contributing expert writer, Carl Holden. 
This series will also introduce another new “writer” to our journal: Artificial Intelligence itself. Using Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), we plan on bringing our readers an “article” written directly by AI. 
While AI cannot currently write a news article with fully original sources, this series hopefully will introduce our readers to the nuances of Artificial Intelligence in the modern age of business. The first article in this series is written from our contributing expert writer, Carl Holden. One the next page, you can find an article using ChatGPT. 
Oops, We Accidentally Hired ChatGPT
At our booth during the National Cyber Security Summit, I met a well-known government contractor who accidentally hired ChatGPT. The contractor was thrilled initially with their talented hire, who impressed the company with a perfect resume and astute answers in the online interview. 
However, the facade crumbled when the individual asked, “Hey, why is ChatGPT blocked at work?” There had been suspicions that this person was unable to do recent assignments.
The manager responded, “We aren’t allowed to use ChatGPT in government.” Half the Huntsville population sitting at Redstone gates every morning should know that fact!
Carl Holden, Creative Director of Zellus Marketing
The young person soon confessed to using AI to make it match their resume precisely to the job posting. They also aced the remote interviewing questions with ChatGPT, confidently spewing all the terminology they needed.
Before this company told me of their “artificial applicant,” they expressly told me they DO NOT use AI when they first approached my booth. After I heard this hiring horror story, I made it clear to them that AI can USE you. Cybersecurity and risk management should include non-human threats and liabilities, even in the HR department. Because it did not expect or prepare for this, the company will likely incur the cost of firing an unqualified hire.
Many stopped by my booth, unaware that Microsoft, powering their computers and email, owns a significant share of ChatGPT. Moreover, only some recognized the video I was playing of Microsoft CoPilot, the AI that has already launched in the latest version of Windows. Microsoft has successfully monopolized the government’s operating systems. Isn’t it naive to think that they aren’t going to get the government to buy into their AI as well?
Over recent years, my company has been using AI to assist in content and data activities. The November 2022 release of ChatGPT marked the first time I felt an AI had formidable capabilities. Since then, a flood of new technologies has entered the market, and we have been consulting local businesses on navigating or implementing the technology effectively and ethically. It was a very popular topic with visitors at our Security Summit booth.
This hiring mishap isn’t merely a humorous tale but a profound lesson. A 24-year-old with a ChatGPT Pro account outsmarted a multi-million dollar contractor employing hundreds of people. As AI continues to weave itself into the fabric of the modern workplace, resisting its effects seems futile. Even these capable bastions of data security must adopt this technology one day or risk losing to a company full of 24-year-olds and a “government-approved” AI.
