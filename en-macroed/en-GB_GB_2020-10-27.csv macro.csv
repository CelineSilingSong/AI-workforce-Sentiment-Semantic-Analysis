If we didn’t have enough to worry about—Covid-19, a nation divided, massive job losses and civil unrest—now we have to be concerned that robots will take our jobs. 

The World Economic Forum (WEF) concluded in a recent report that “a new generation of smart machines, fueled by rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, could potentially replace a large proportion of existing human jobs.” Robotics and AI will cause a serious “double-disruption,” as the coronavirus pandemic pushed companies to fast-track the deployment of new technologies to slash costs, enhance productivity and be less reliant on real-life people.      


Millions of people have lost their jobs due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and now the machines will take away even more jobs from workers, according to the WEF. The organization cites that automation will supplant about 85 million jobs by 2025. WEF says there’s nothing to worry about since its analysis anticipates the future tech-driven economy will create 97 million new jobs. Currently, approximately 30% of all tasks are done by machines—and people do the rest. However, by the year 2025, it's believed that the balance will dramatically change to a 50-50 combination of humans and machines. 

Management consulting giant PriceWaterhouseCoopers reported, “AI, robotics and other forms of smart automation have the potential to bring great economic benefits, contributing up to $15 trillion to global GDP by 2030.” However, it will come with a high human cost. “This extra wealth will also generate the demand for many jobs, but there are also concerns that it could displace many existing jobs.”  

PROMOTED
In a dire prediction, WEF said, “While some new jobs would be created as in the past, the concern is there may not be enough of these to go round, particularly as the cost of smart machines falls over time and their capabilities increase.”
Concerns of new technologies disrupting the workforce and causing job losses have been around for a long time. On one side, the argument is automation will create better new jobs and erase the need for physical labor. The counterclaim is that people without the appropriate skills will be displaced and not have a home in the new environment.

Banking and financial services employees, factory workers and office staff will seemingly face the loss of their jobs—or need to find a way to reinvent themselves in this brave new world. Millions would need to be reskilled to cope with the change, while governments would have to provide stronger safety nets for displaced workers.

“More than 120 million workers globally will need retraining in the next three years due to artificial intelligence’s impact on jobs, according to an IBM survey.” The amount of individuals who will be impacted is immense. The world’s most advanced cities aren’t ready for the disruptions of artificial intelligence, claims management consulting firm Oliver Wyman.

It is believed that over 50 million Chinese workers may require retraining, as a result of AI-related deployment. The U.S. will be required to retool 11.5 million people in America with skills needed to survive in the workforce. Millions of workers in Brazil, Japan and Germany will need assistance with the changes wrought by AI, robotics and related technology.
 High-profile business leaders and a small number of politicians are starting to speak out about the potential deleterious effects of transitioning to technology and replacing workers. “Computers, intelligent machines and robots seem like the workforce of the future. And as more and more jobs are replaced by technology, people will have less work to do and ultimately will be sustained by payments from the government,” predicts Elon Musk, the cofounder and CEO of Tesla.
Mark Cuban, a billionaire in the tech space and owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, said in a CNBC interview, “President Donald Trump should be more aware of tech advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence and how that will impact America’s future.” Cuban said, “I’m willing to bet that these companies building new plants...this will lead to fewer people being employed.”
Andrew Yang, former Democratic presidential hopeful, was one of the few candidates and politicians vocalizing concerns over the ascendancy of AI. Yang’s official website offered the following:
“Advances in automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) hold the potential to bring about new levels of prosperity humans have never seen. They also hold the potential to disrupt our economies, ruin lives throughout several generations, and, if experts such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk are to be believed, destroy humanity.”
States and governments have grave concerns over tax collections, as people are phased out and replaced by robots. Many cities are suffering financial challenges, as tax revenues plummeted with the closure of businesses and loss of income from the ranks of the newly unemployed. To compensate for the shortfall, billionaire founder of Microsoft and philanthropist Bill Gates called for a tax on robots, due to the disruption that will occur, resulting in the loss of jobs and tax revenue. “Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things. If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you’d think that we’d tax the robot at a similar level,” Gates said in an interview with Quartz.  
AI, robotics and technology are advancing at a furious pace. We’re heading into uncharted territory without appropriate regulations, oversight or conversations around what this will do to society. As millions of workers will be displaced, with hopes that they can be retrained, it's important that this trend needs to be carefully addressed. What will happen if the experts are wrong and we are unable to find jobs for the millions of Americans who no longer have “Fourth Industrial Revolution” skills? Technological innovation doesn’t have to stop, but it has to be monitored and analyzed to ensure that we don’t go past the point of no return.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around since the birth of computers in the 1950s. The original pioneers dreamed of making ‘computer brains’ that could perform the same kinds of tasks as our own brains, such as playing chess or translating languages. But hopes that AI would quickly reach human-level intelligence didn’t come to fruition, and AI soon fell out of favour.
Over the following decades, technology improved at an exponential rate. Computers got faster, the internet was invented, and researchers made new advances in AI algorithms.
In the last decade, AI has started solving many of the problems that we always dreamed it could. This has prompted billions of dollars of investment from companies, governments and financiers, and many major organisations now embrace AI as a core element of their business.Early AI engineers attempted to make 'computer brains' © GraphicaArtis/Getty Images)
Are there different kinds of AI?
Mention AI, and most people think of ‘deep learning’. This kind of AI is loosely inspired by the way our brains work. It uses lots of computers to simulate large networks of artificial ‘neurons’, which are then trained, typically using humongous amounts of data, until they’ve learned to do what we want them to – for example, understanding speech.
This training is the slow and resource-heavy part. Once trained, even a phone can then run the AI and instantly perform the right function, such as obeying your voice command. Deep learning is just one kind of AI, among thousands of others.Artificial intelligence can be used to help predict financial markets © Getty Images
Some AIs use advanced statistics to help computers make predictions, such as the likely side effects of a new drug; others use logic to make deductions about their environment, such as a robot mapping out a route; while others simulate evolution or even swarms of bees in order to find solutions to difficult problems such as scheduling activities in a factory or optimising the shape of an aircraft wing.

Can a computer be self-aware?
If an AI became sentient, would it gain human (or equivalent) rights?
If we’re ever able to make robots as intelligent as us, won’t forcing them to work for us be as bad as slavery?
How can we stop robots rising up against the human race?

Will AI ever be as clever as us?
This is a tough question, as it depends on how we measure intelligence. The more advanced AIs can recognise features in images (that’s a half-hidden cat; that’s a corner of a bus) better than us, provide expert opinions more reliably than us (your test results mean you have an 85 per cent chance of condition X), and play many games better than us – most recently Go and classic arcade games like Asteroids.
But no AI can drive a car as well as an experienced driver, despite billions of dollars of research and data equivalent to more than 10 billion miles of driving. No artificial intelligence can control a robot to wash the dishes. No AI has an IQ more than that of an average six-year-old child.A robotic arm plays Go against a human opponent at an AI conference in Shanghai © Getty Images
We have very powerful computers, lots of training data, and some clever algorithms, but we still don’t know how to make an AI with the flexibility and learning capacity of the human brain – and we also don’t know how to make AIs that become cleverer without human input.
What’s more, we still don’t fully understand how intelligence arises in biological organisms, so it’s hard to see how our human-inspired AIs will match our intelligence in the near future.
What else is AI used for?
AI has become a ubiquitous technology. When you unlock your phone by looking at it, an AI has recognised your face. When you speak to your TV or smart speaker, an AI has recognised your voice. When you take a photo with your phone or digital camera, an AI identifies elements in the foreground to help blur the background, and combines several photos taken with different exposures to construct a perfect picture.
AIs check for fraud every time you buy something online. They monitor your online shopping behaviour and present you with adverts tailored to your likes. They suggest news stories that you are more likely to be interested in, and answer your questions in online help desks.
AIs are creative, composing music, designing buildings, painting artworks. AIs are also enabling our vehicles to become increasingly autonomous, taking over some of the more tedious and repetitive aspects of driving.

Can we trust AI?
There are always downsides to technologies. If an AI is trusted too much, then we may get ourselves into trouble – this is why driverless cars will always need a human override option.
If we train AI with biased data then the AI will also be biased, as studies have shown where AIs recognise white male faces better than others. Some worry that AI will lead to job losses, which may be true, but AI will also create many jobs.Artificial intelligence still cannot drive a car as well as an experienced driver © Getty Images
AI is nothing new in this regard: a similar thing happened in the Industrial Revolution, and again in the ‘information revolution’ with the advent of computers and the internet.
In the end, artificial intelligence should not be feared. AI is being created to help us, and like all future technologies, we need to ensure that it is used appropriately.

 ""There are considerable benefits of setting up a transatlantic digital community cooperating on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and emerging and disruptive technologies, where NATO can play a key role as a facilitator for innovation and exchange"", said NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană. On Wednesday (28 October 2020) he took part in a high-level virtual discussion on transatlantic cooperation in the era of AI, organised by the Atlantic Council's Future Europe Initiative and GeoTech Center. 






Mr. Geoană engaged in this conversation alongside the Chair and Vice Chair of the  National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), Dr. Eric Schmidt and Secretary Robert O. Work, and the Head of Cabinet of European Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, Ambassador Kim Jørgensen. They discussed what modern technologies mean for European and American defence and security stakeholders, why the United States and the European Union should cooperate on AI, and how best to promote shared values in the field.
""NATO is a natural platform for transatlantic cooperation of AI,"" the Deputy Secretary General underlined. “NATO offers its consultative mechanisms and unique networks for collaboration on defence and security questions. Bringing together Allies and partners, public and private sector, innovators and industry. We have great communities in areas like military capability development, science and technology, standardisation - and of course our Command Structure and military exercises. We also have new cross-cutting policy teams on Innovation Policy, who cover AI, and on Data Policy,” he pointed out.

EU Council presidency conclusions on Artificial Intelligence and human rights failed to secure unanimous backing from member states last week after Poland refused to support a text due to opposing the inclusion of the term ‘gender equality,’ EURACTIV has learned.
The German presidency of the EU Council adopted on 21 October conclusions on the charter of fundamental rights in the context of artificial intelligence, but stated that ‘one member state’ objected to the inclusion of ‘gender equality’ on the grounds that “neither the Treaties nor the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights uses the term ‘gender.’”
All other 26 nations, however, had insisted that the phrase be included in the conclusions. Multiple EU sources confirmed to EURACTIV that Poland was the member state which opposed the phrase.
EURACTIV followed up with the Poles, who came clean on their opposition. In a statement, Ambassador Andrzej Sadoś said the country “strongly supports equality between women and men, as it stands in all EU documents based on terminology adopted in primary law.”
“The Treaties refer to equality between women and men, similar to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The meaning of ‘gender’ is unclear; the lack of definition and unambiguous understanding for all member states may cause semantic problems. Neither the Treaties nor the Charter of Fundamental Rights use the term ‘gender’,” Sadoś continued.
The ambassador added that his country would work to adopt the conclusions on fundamental rights in the future.
Poland has recently come under heavy criticism in Brussels for a series of measures put in place that some believe encroach on gender rights.
A court ruling in the country recently outlawed the majority of abortions, with a small number of exceptions, including in cases of rape or incest.
This followed Poland’s July decision to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, at a time when dozens of conservative and Catholic regions across the country were adopting resolutions that criticised ‘LGBT ideology.’



Commission will ‘not exclude’ potential ban on facial recognition technology
The European Commission has not ruled out a future ban on the use of facial recognition technology in Europe, as the EU executive mulls the findings of a recent public consultation on Artificial Intelligence.


‘Clear legal requirements for AI’ 
Elsewhere in the German Presidency’s conclusions on Artificial Intelligence and fundamental rights, certain nefarious applications of next-generation technologies were cited as a potential cause for concern.
Both the use of mass surveillance technologies and facial recognition applications should be subject to ‘clear legal requirements’, the text said.
“We note the ongoing discussion on whether such systems should be used in principle and on possible bans on their use. To the extent that these systems are to be used, we recognize that clear legal requirements need to be formulated beforehand.”
The European Commission has not entirely discounted the possibility of a ban on the use of facial recognition in public spaces. Speaking to MEPs in the European Parliament’s Internal Market Committee in September, Kilian Gross of the Commission’s DG Connect said that all options were still on the table with regards to a possible ban on this technology.
Ahead of the official publication of the Commission’s White paper on Artificial Intelligence in February this year, which presented its framework strategy for mitigating the future risks of AI, a leaked working document revealed that the Commission had been weighing up the possibility of introducing a temporary moratorium on facial recognition technologies.

One initiative report, led by Spanish Socialist Iban García del Blanco, urged the Commission to develop ethical standards that abide by a human-centric approach, while also safeguarding against bias and discrimination.
Del Blanco’s text duly highlighted the importance of preserving non-bias in AI technologies, noting that discrimination should not be conducted on grounds including race, gender, sexual orientation, among a range of other metrics.

However, the future is not all doom and gloom, as experts are increasingly confident automation is capable of boosting productivity, enabling workers to focus on higher-value, more rewarding jobs.And wealth and spending will also be boosted by the initiation of AI seizing work.Additionally, there are just some things artificial intelligence cannot yet learn, meaning certain sectors will be safe for many years to come.

Transatlantic democratic allies must begin working together to develop new technologies like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, to strengthen their collective defense, support democracy, and protect their societies.
Speakers from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), European Commission (EC), and NATO called for transatlantic allies to extend their cooperation to research and development of artificial intelligence at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council on October 28. The event marked one of the first public live discussions between Europe and the United States on transatlantic coalitions on artificial intelligence. “It is time for us to build another partnership: a partnership around artificial intelligence,” Eric Schmidt, chair of NSCAI and former CEO of Google, argued. Secretary Robert O. Work, vice chair of NSCAI and former deputy secretary of defense, agreed, adding “NATO is absolutely central to this [technological] competition.”
Ambassador Mircea Geoană, Deputy Secretary General of NATO, threw his support behind a common NATO approach to artificial intelligence, proclaiming that the Alliance’s democratic values and adaptability are crucial for allies to win the technological race in artificial intelligence as “in the end, this is something that would make us prevail.” Geoană, Work, and Schmidt were joined by Ambassador Kim Jørgensen, head of cabinet for European Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, who argued that the COVID-19 pandemic and other global challenges show that crises “don’t stop at the borders,” but require “a common approach,” that utilizes these new technologies and deep cooperation.
Here’s a quick look at what the speakers said about how a transatlantic alliance for artificial intelligence will impact the geopolitical landscape and protect democracy worldwide:

A transatlantic approach

A strong democratic AI alliance: Schmidt argued that the partnership between the European Union and the United States has “provided extraordinary economic growth, military security, national security, and cultural enrichment that has benefitted all of us enormously.” But as China and other adversaries race for technological superiority, “a strong alliance among the democratic nations for this techno-economic competition” is needed, as proposed by the NSCAI in its Third Quarter Recommendations for the US government. The recommendations called for “expediting the responsible development of artificial intelligence by NATO and member states, resilient artificial intelligence partnerships,” and a Strategic Dialogue for Emerging Technologies with the EU. Schmidt considered artificial intelligence a “game-changer” for the EU and the United States and the most powerful tool for increasing prosperity and “expanding freedom.”
True partners share values (and data): While AI may be a new area of focus for NATO, Work argued that deep transatlantic partnership will be key in keeping up with the technological competition. “We have to share our data, [just like] we have to share our values.” Geoană agreed, but also noted that NATO must continue to “make sure that we keep the right balance between the traditional way [of keeping] our deterrence and defense… while rapidly and systematically [making] the transition towards the new era and new technologies.” Geoană maintained that this balance is essential as NATO has been the “most successful alliance in human history” because “we kept our values… but also we kept always our technological edge.” Indeed, NATO has a crucial stake in transatlantic democracies winning the technological race “because the moment you lose this technological edge…then not only will the last seven decades of the transatlantic bond…be in jeopardy, but also a few centuries of Western domination in technology,” explained Geoană.
It’s an opportunity for new partners, too: The challenge to compete on the technical stage is so overwhelming that relying only on an EU-US partnership may not be enough to counter adversaries. “This is why opening up to our like-minded, democratic partners from all over the world… who are sharing the same values” should be a priority, Geoană explained, identifying opportunities with Australia, Japan, and Korea. Work agreed that a “coalition of digital democracies” should be a priority. He noted that India is an attractive partner, especially as the United States and India signed a military agreement this week that joins the countries to share satellite data—which is intended to counter Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific.
Winner takes all: The advantages of winning the race to AI do not stop at defense capabilities, Jørgensen emphasized, but also show the potential technology “offers to make our economies more sustainable and to meet a wide range of societal needs.” The current COVID-19 pandemic, she added, has illustrated the benefits of EU-US cooperation on technologies like artificial intelligence, as they can “help us… to improve our health system and future responses to such [crises],” Jørgensen claimed.

The global race to establish standards and norms

Norms now for safe technology use later: The race for mastery of artificial intelligence will also have important implications for the rest of the world. Work warned that whichever country succeeds in the technological competition will see its values “reflected in the way the technology is used” around the world. Democratic nations need to take the lead in artificial intelligence as “we do not want the Chinese to be developing global norms and technical standards for artificial intelligence technologies.” Should Beijing win the race for AI, it “will use these technologies to surveil its population, to suppress minorities; they have no real concern over personal privacy… their values are much different.”
A rules-based system by transatlantic norms: According to Work, joint EU-US work on artificial intelligence is “absolutely critical” to “shape artificial norms and technical standards” that respect freedom before China sets the rules. Geoană also agreed that democracies need to establish standards and norms for artificial intelligence use early to “keep our citizens safe and prosperous,” warning that “we have to bring all the arsenal, our toolboxes, our imagination, [and] our strengths together in this direction.”
Bulk up for stronger AI standards: Jørgensen agreed that democratic allies and partners should set their priorities to “lead the development of technology and be at the forefront when it comes to setting the global standard.” Jørgensen floated tapping into partnerships with non-NATO countries like India, because “the larger the combined economic weight of our allied partners, the more effective we will be in promoting our standards.”

Off to the races: China and the West

Beijing is catching up: Work warned that “China is catching up fairly quickly” to Western technological levels, “[but] the West is still ahead.” As China has made technological and artificial intelligence advancement a national priority, described Work, there’s “every reason” to believe that “they can be already significant peer competitors in this arena.” Work added that if China “wins” on a technological platform such as artificial intelligence or 5G, and if “we start using Chinese platforms as opposed to Western platforms, this will have all sorts of negative impacts on our society.”
All the ingredients for supremacy: Geoană further cautioned that “for the first time in our history on technology, one competitor—China—has, at the same time, all the ingredients of global supremacy on technology,” said Geoană, adding that Beijing not only has the capacity to develop technology, but also a growing global technology market through its Belt and Road Initiative.
Step one of the game plan: Work identified that China’s approach to smart cities—cities that use technology to connect different components of a city and collect data on its citizens and visitors—and surveillance technologies “furthers authoritarianism and violates personal privacy and civil liberties.” But establishing a “US-EU digital ecosystem,” with initiatives like building trusted cities that use AI and data consistent with democratic values, “would be very good for the long-term competition between democratic and authoritarian regimes.”

Harnessing transatlantic brain-power

Humans matter: The NSCAI’s Blueprint for Artificial Intelligence Cooperation includes recommendations for transatlantic defense and security operations, joint research and development, data sharing, and innovation: but Schmidt stresses that talent acquisition comes first. “We need all the top brains that are available to us in all of the Atlantic Council countries, working to build platforms that have our values and commitments to protecting individual rights, restoring commercial competition built on fair rules, and strengthening defense alliances.” The most important objective, he added, is to “get the human capital that is available in Europe and in the United States” working toward research on artificial intelligence and setting technological norms and standards. “We are strong when we are innovating in these spaces and combined, we can build amazing platforms.” Work added that focusing on talent is “key to winning a long-term technical competition on artificial intelligence.”
A transatlantic digital community: Geoană also argued that talent will be found within the triangular alliance—academia, government, and industry—as per the NSCAI’s recommendations. He advocated for a transatlantic digital community that would bring together the talent of NATO members’ universities, researchers, young entrepreneurs, startups, and governments. “Harnessing this synergy between the three pillars of our democratic society is not only smart in terms of business and adaptability, but it is also our main competitive advantage in our competition with our authoritarian rivals,” Geoană said.
This panel discussion was convened by the Atlantic Council’s GeoTech Center and Future Europe Initiative.

Ocado was founded in 2000 as an entirely online experience and therefore never had a brick-and-mortar store to serve its customers, who number 580,000 each day. Its technology expertise came about out of necessity as it began to build the software and hardware it needed to be efficient, productive, and competitive. Today, Ocado uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in many ways throughout its business.

From Online Retailer to Ocado Technology

Since 2000, Ocado tried to piece together the technology they needed to succeed by purchasing products off the shelf. They quickly realized these off-the-shelf solutions weren’t suitable for the unique demands of an online grocery, so they set out to build the hardware and software they needed. Today, the Ocado Smart Platform runs end-to-end e-commerce and is being sold to other brick-and-mortar grocery retailers such as Canadian grocer Sobey’s, French retailer Groupe Casino, Aeon in Japan, Kroger in the United States, ICA in Sweden, and others around the world. Ocado Technology is helping to provide software as a service and hardware to help other grocers operate profitably and sustainably online. Ocado Technology has led the industry in innovation for years, from launching the first grocery app in 2009 to being the first UK supermarket to have an Alexa app.

Automated warehouses

Ocado’s warehouses are fully automated. The company’s warehouses illustrate the power of Industry 4.0, where technology trends such as the Internet of Things, robotics, big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are at work every day, making Ocado's operations streamlined and efficient—in just 5 minutes robotics can complete 50,000 orders. The choreography of the robots—a swarm—is something to behold as they navigate around warehouses the size of several football fields, pick up bins and deliver them to pick stations to complete customer orders. Ocado made this system completely scalable to accommodate the evolving needs of online grocers during changing seasons, promotions, and events such as a global pandemic. This robotic workforce is powered by big data and artificial intelligence and becomes better through machine learning. Machine learning determines the traffic flow of the robots through the warehouse to prevent collisions and to optimize efforts, calculates the precise placement of bins for maximum efficiency, and also monitors the health and maintenance needs of the robots to reduce any downtime. Artificial intelligence also helps the system understand what products are in stock through real-time availability, so they are able to give customers what they expect to receive.

Reduce food waste
It is estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations that we waste around 1.3 billion tons of food each year on earth. If we could stop the waste, there would be enough food to feed all the world's hungry and even have food leftover. Technology could help us solve the world hunger problem, and Ocado might just be leading the way to a solution. Ocado uses machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics to slash its food waste to just losing 1 in 6,000 produce items. The Ocado Smart Platform determines the food customers want and need and adjusts orders from suppliers accordingly. The company's platform assesses 20 million forecasts each day to maximize freshness and availability while reducing overstock and waste. Additionally, the machines help determine the optimal time for discounts to push out all inventory.  
Artificial intelligence and machine learning also help reduce food waste by ensuring that products are stored or delivered in a way and at temperatures that reduce the likelihood of spoilage. It donates produce to those in need that are only a few days away from expiring. Machine learning algorithms help the company effectively monitor and manage this donation effort.

Better customer service 
As you might be able to ascertain, customer service is a priority for Ocado, and having the products customers want available and fresh, greater personalization, and smarter product recommendations are certainly ways to create a stellar customer experience. While customer interaction isn't the same as it would be in a brick-and-mortar store, customers do interact with Ocado delivery drivers whose delivery routes are constantly evolving as AI determines how to circumnavigate the city to avoid traffic and other delays or when they interact with Ocado's contact centers via a phone call or email. These are also areas where Ocado puts technology to work.

At Ocado’s contact centers, they allow customers to contact the company in a variety of ways (email, social media, phone call). But, this isn’t what sets its customer service apart because most companies who prioritize the customer experience do the same. Ocado differentiates its customer service experience by applying machine learning and natural language processing algorithms to quickly categorize customer communications to prioritize the message and get it to the right team to solve the issue as quickly as possible.

Combat fraud
Another development out of Ocado Technology is what it claims to be the world's first AI-based fraud detection system for online grocery purchases. The advanced machine learning algorithm has already improved fraud detection by a factor of 15.
Ocado continues to innovate to use technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, to optimize warehouses, reduce food waste, improve customer experience, and combat fraud. If it's not already there, expect the Ocado Smart Platform to help support the online operations of a grocer near you very soon.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid increase in the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems due to an increased need for automation, advanced analytics, and remote work. In fact, machine learning and other forms of AI are being applied to address the increasing scale of the pandemic itself. Now, say experts, is a good time to step back and consider the ethics of these (and all) AI applications.
“These past few months have been especially challenging, and the deployment of technology in ways hitherto untested at an unrivaled pace has left the internet and technology watchers aghast,” Abhishek Gupta, founder of the Montreal AI Ethics Institute, said in the introduction to that organization’s inaugural State of AI Ethics report this June. “It has never been more important that we keep a sharp eye out on the development of this field and how it is shaping our society and interactions with each other.”
[ Do you understand the main types of AI? Read also: 5 artificial intelligence (AI) types, defined. ]
The CapGemini Research Institute looked at many of the ethical issues emerging at the enterprise level in its recent report, AI and the Ethical Conundrum: How organizations can build ethically robust AI systems and gain trust. “Now is a good time to talk about the ethics of these AI systems, because when those systems were initially implemented, they may not have been done with ethical considerations in mind,” Dan Simion, vice president of AI & Analytics for Capgemini North America, says of some of the most recent AI-enabled implementations. “Rather, the priority was to get them up and running from a pure productivity perspective. IT leaders need to go back and evaluate their AI systems that were deployed into production and evaluate if they are showing any unethical outcomes or AI biases.”
Looking forward, Simion says, CIOs can play a more pivotal role in making sure that ethical considerations are part of the conversation from the start. “In the future, it’s up to IT leaders to ensure that ethics are a part of the conversation from the beginning when deploying these AI systems – even when deployments are done quickly.” 
AI ethics, by the numbers - and implications for IT
We talked to Simion about a few of the most telling stats from his organization’s AI ethics research and what they mean for IT leaders:
Nine out of 10: This overwhelming majority of organizations said they were aware of at least one instance where an AI system had resulted in ethical issues for their business.
Not surprising, says Simion. “At the end of the day, the AI systems are relatively new. However, when companies see these unethical outcomes, they need to make sure their systems are more rigorously tested against those outcomes, including discriminatory bias.”
65 percent: Nearly two-thirds of executives said they are aware of the issue of discriminatory bias with AI systems, up from 35 percent last year. Leaders who are aware of these issues need to actively work to fix them to prevent these unethical outcomes from occurring with their customers in the future. “The awareness gives the organization visibility that there is a problem,” Simion says, “but it’s up to the organization to correct the problem.”
At the same time, more than three-quarters (78 percent) said they were aware of explainability, up from 32 percent last year. And 69 percent said they understood the issues of transparency in AI engagements, up from 36 percent in 2019.
Two-thirds: That’s the proportion of customers who say that they expect the AI models of organizations to be fair and free from prejudice and bias against them or any other person or group. An even higher number (71 percent) expect the AI system to be able to clearly explain results to them, and 67 percent said that they expect organizations to take ownership of their AI algorithms when they go wrong.
80 percent: The single-year jump in the number of organizations that have defined an ethical charter to provide guidelines on AI development. Almost half (45 percent) of organizations have one today, up from just five percent in 2019.
Simion attributes the sizable leap to a combination of factors. “First, the situation created by the pandemic resulted in a greater need for AI and more organizations utilizing these capabilities,” he says. “Second, now that consumers are interacting more with AI to avoid person-to-person contact, they are demanding that these interactions be ethical in nature.”
59 percent: That’s the number of organizations that informed users about the ways in which AI decisions might affect them this year. However, that’s about a 20 percent decrease from the nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of organizations that said they did so last year.
The reason? Likely, other priorities have superseded these efforts given the “significant changes and transformations that needed to take place to keep businesses operational when the pandemic began this year,” says Simion, who doesn’t see a cause for concern yet. “These initiatives to build AI systems that will inform users have just been pushed back as a result of the current circumstances.”
Six out of 10: That’s the number of organizations that have attracted legal scrutiny because of these decisions reached by AI systems. Another 22 percent say they have faced customer backlash as a result of AI-enabled actions or decisions.
As regulators begin to analyze the ethics of AI systems more closely, Simion expects the legal issues to increase in the days ahead. Conversely, he predicts customer backlash is prone to decrease given the fact that companies are going to continue to improve their systems and their transparency with the outcomes of AI. “As companies work to create systems that remove and avoid unethical AI bias,” he explains, “they will create more positive customer experiences.”

45 percent: That’s the number of consumers who, after having a negative AI experience, would tell family and friends and urge them not to engage with the organization. Nearly four out of ten (39 percent) would switch from the AI channel to a higher-cost human channel, and just over a quarter (27 percent) said they would stop dealing with the organization or trust it less.

Artificial intelligence has emerged as an increasingly important component of IT management.
In the past, planning and decision-making were based on performance data generated by the various machines in a data center. The expertise and experience of IT employees were key for using the available data for actual planning and decision-making activities. AI now provides an additional layer of experiential thinking that can synthesize many different metrics and data into intelligence that assists planning and decision-making.







Within data management, AI uses a variety of engines with programmed experience to analyze activities in many forms and generate actionable intelligence.

Traditional backup vs. backup and AI
AI that integrates with backup and recovery systems can provide a significant edge in planning and decision-making activities. For example, AI can initiate ""what if"" scenarios to address a variety of backup issues. IT administrators can then use this data to make more informed planning decisions.
Data passes through a backup process and routes to a variety of storage devices. The process gathers performance statistics for future review by IT administrators. Stats include what data the organization backs up, locations of the backups, dates and times of backups, and elapsed time needed to complete backups. The data backup system can also serve as the data recovery device if the organization needs stored data for an emergency requirement.






When you integrate backup and AI, the AI component sits between the data backup and recovery process and the performance data output mechanism. Depending on how the organization programs the AI, it can examine performance activities as the business backs up and retrieves data.






AI can provide a broad range of analytics, such as how the organization processes, examines and analyzes performance data. Administrators can then use results for a variety of activities, including resource planning, network planning and even disaster recovery plan development.


Tips for using AI in data backups
If your current backup and recovery systems do not have an AI component, consider whether AI-enabled systems are worth the investment. Perhaps your existing data backup vendor offers an AI upgrade. Key guidelines for integrating backup and AI include:

Determine what additional capabilities you require to enhance planning and decision-making, specifically those capabilities not currently available from existing backup systems.
Research AI capabilities from vendors for availability and additional cost.
Consider launching a test with a vendor to see if its capabilities generate the desired results and adaptability to your requirements.
Examine AI-based systems in use by other organizations.
Conduct an ROI analysis.
Perform a phased rollout of the AI-enabled technology to validate its capabilities based on the defined business requirements.
Ensure that you back up the new system in a secure location so it is protected in the event of a disaster.
Add the AI system to existing technology DR plans.
Include the AI system in future DR plan tests.

Earlier in 2020, Apple reportedly purchased Barcelona startup Vilynx, gaining expertise and technologies related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision.


Citing sources familiar with the matter, a report on Tuesday claims that the Barcelona, Spain based startup was purchased to enhance Apple's artificial intelligence work as a whole. A mission statement about the company says that the company can ""add rich metadata to enable search and social sharing."" 
The company also claims that the metadata makes convent instantly discoverable. Tailored information is provided to creators by the company's software to determine ""which portions of the video have the most views and which are not getting attention.""
The CrunchBase profile of the company was recently updated to reflect that the company is now in Palo Alto, California.

Co-founder Juan Carlos Riviero was interviewed in 2018, discussing the company and what it does.
""To be truly valuable to media companies, AI must offer an understanding of their content—  not just reams of crunched data or recognition of faces and buildings. That's exactly what the self-learning Vilynx brain does,"" said Riviero. ""Yes, it analyzes faces, processes speech, reads text and identifies buildings and places—  but then it takes the crucial step of putting all this into context.""
In a report on Tuesday, Bloomberg stated that Apple is intending to apply the technology to Siri and search. Apple's Photos could be improved with the technology to search stored video, and also, possibly for News and Apple TV apps for a recommendation engine.
The purchase is just the latest in a long chain of AI-related acquisitions that started with Perceptioin 2015. Apple went on to buy out Turi and Tuplejump in 2016, and Laserlike in 2019.
In January 2020, Apple purchased Xnor.ai, a specialist in low-power edge-based artificial intelligence. Later in the year, Apple purchased Inductiv, bringing AI to automatically identify and correct errors in large data sets.

Every day we are likely to interact with some form of artificial intelligence (AI). It works behind the scenes in everything from social media and traffic navigation apps to product recommendations and virtual assistants. 
AI systems can perform tasks or make predictions, recommendations or decisions that would usually require human intelligence. Their objectives are set by humans but the systems act without explicit human instructions.   
As AI plays a greater role in our lives both at work and at home, questions arise. How willing are we to trust AI systems? And what are our expectations for how AI should be deployed and managed?   
To find out, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of more than 2,500 Australians in June and July 2020. Our report, produced with KPMG and led by Nicole Gillespie, shows Australians on the whole don’t know a lot about how AI is used, have little trust in AI systems, and believe it should be carefully regulated. 
Most accept or tolerate AI, few approve or embrace it
Trust is central to the widespread acceptance and adoption of AI. However, our research suggests the Australian public is ambivalent about trusting AI systems. 
Nearly half of our respondents (45%) are unwilling to share their information or data with an AI system. Two in five (40%) are unwilling to rely on recommendations or other output of an AI system.

Further, many Australians are not convinced about the trustworthiness of AI systems, but more are likely to perceive AI as competent than to be designed with integrity and humanity.
Despite this, Australians generally accept (42%) or tolerate AI (28%), but few approve (16%) or embrace (7%) it.
Research and defence are more trusted with AI than business
When it comes to developing and using AI systems, our respondents had the most confidence in Australian universities, research institutions and defence organisations to do so in the public interest. (More than 81% were at least moderately confident.) 
Australians have least confidence in commercial organisations to develop and use AI (37% no or low confidence). This may be due to the fact that most (76%) believe commercial organisations use AI for financial gain rather than societal benefit.

These findings suggest an opportunity for businesses to partner with more trusted entities, such as universities and research institutions, to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in an ethical and trustworthy way that protects human rights. They also suggest businesses need to think further about how they can use AI in ways that create positive outcomes for stakeholders and society more broadly.

Regulation is required
Overwhelmingly (96%), Australians expect AI to be regulated and most expect external, independent oversight. Most Australians (over 68%) have moderate to high confidence in the federal government and regulatory agencies to regulate and govern AI in the best interests of the public.
However, the current regulation and laws fall short of community expectations.  
Our findings show the strongest driver of trust in AI is the belief that the current regulations and laws are sufficient to make the use of AI safe. However, most Australians either disagree (45%) or are ambivalent (20%) that this is the case. 

These findings highlight the need to strengthen the regulatory and legal framework governing AI in Australia, and to communicate this to the public, to help them feel comfortable with the use of AI. 
Australians expect AI to be ethically deployed
What do Australians expect when AI systems are deployed? Most of our respondents (more than 83%) have clear expectations of the principles and practices they expect organisations to uphold in the design, development and use of AI systems in order to be trusted. 
These include: 

high standards of robust performance and accuracy
data privacy, security and governance
human agency and oversight
transparency and explainability
fairness, inclusion and non-discrimination
accountability and contestability
risk and impact mitigation.

      Will we ever agree to just one set of rules on the ethical development of artificial intelligence?




Most Australians (more than 70%) would also be more willing to use AI systems if there were assurance mechanisms in place to bolster standards and oversight. These include independent AI ethics reviews, AI ethics certifications, national standards for AI explainability and transparency, and AI codes of conduct. 
Organisations can build trust and make consumers more willing to use AI systems, when they are appropriate, by clearly supporting and implementing ethical practices, oversight and accountability.
The AI knowledge gap
Most Australians (61%) report having a low understanding of AI, including low awareness of how and when it is used. For example, even though 78% of Australians report using social media, almost two in three (59%) were unaware that social media apps use AI. Only 51% report even hearing or reading about AI in the past year. This low awareness and understanding is a problem given how much AI is being used in our daily lives.

The good news is most Australians (86%) want to know more about AI. When we consider these factors together, there is a need and an appetite for a public literacy program in AI. 
One model for this comes from Finland, where a government-backed course in AI literacy aims to teach more than 5 million EU citizens. More than 530,000 students have enrolled in the course so far.

Overall, our findings suggest public trust in AI systems can be improved by strengthening the regulatory framework for governing AI, living up to Australians’ expectations of trustworthy AI, and strengthening Australia’s AI literacy.

Whenever new technologies change the way we work, some worry that their jobs are in jeopardy. And sometimes, new technologies do make certain jobs obsolete. Artificial intelligence is an emerging force in the business world that has the potential to either replace humans in certain industries or empower humans with better tools, depending on how the technology is utilized. And in the high-unemployment COVID era when the terms “outsourcing” and “AI” stoke fears for workforce stability and opportunity, there needs to be a more human-centered approach to workforce training and development.


Samasource, a training data and validation company based in San Francisco, believes AI can enhance how we work and is advocating for “human-in-the-loop,” a work model that requires human involvement even with advanced technology. “It's really this combination of human and artificial intelligence, or human-in-the-loop and machine learning, that will allow us to bring best-in-class technology to solve the world's most pressing challenges,” says Heather Gadonniex, the VP of Marketing & Strategic Partnerships at Samasource.

I spoke with Gadonniex as part of my research on purpose-driven business and to learn about how Samasource is using its advanced technology to enhance human-centered work and provide job opportunities to marginalized communities. Samasource is a Certified B Corporation, a company that has met certain social and environmental standards as verified by the nonprofit B Lab.

PROMOTED
Christopher Marquis: Some people worry that artificial intelligence will ultimately replace humans in the workforce. How is Samasource ensuring that AI is used to enhance human-centered work and not fully replace it?

Heather Gadonniex: Our philosophy is to use artificial intelligence to power and empower the human workforce. We firmly believe in up-skilling. We firmly believe in cross-skilling. And we firmly believe that artificial intelligence, or machine learning, is not necessarily going to negate the need for human involvement but will simply remove more mundane tasks from day-to-day workloads so that humans can focus on tasks that require higher cognition and focus on higher value areas of work.

It's really this combination of human and artificial intelligence, or human-in-the-loop and machine learning, that will allow us to bring best-in-class technology to solve the world's most pressing challenges. And in my opinion, we have enough challenges that need to be solved that we shouldn't shy away from using the power of technology to do that.

We're really embracing, advocating for, and being a voice in the market for this combination of machine intelligence and human intelligence, and at the same time ensuring that there is up-skilling and that there is cross-skilling. Because without that, you don't really have the ability to create environments or workplaces where people are learning the new skills they need to thrive in the next digital economy, or in today's digital economy even. That's really how we perceive this conflict between human and machine, if you will — less of a conflict and more of a collaboration.
Marquis: Can you share examples of up-skilling? What does that look like in practice?
Gadonniex: We have a very robust education program internally, called SamaU. So we use a combination of technology platforms plus face-to-face training, and we provide basic digital skills to get people familiarized with working in the digital economy. Because the majority of the workforce that we employ have never had a formal job before they are working in areas that are typically not exposed to the digital economy. For most of them, this is their first full time job that pays living wages. And that, in and of itself, has the power to transform economies, not just lives but full economies.
So, we provide our workers with basic digital skills, and then from there we actually provide ongoing training around topics that focus on machine learning, general artificial intelligence, and soft skills as well, like: How do you manage your finances? How do you become a better boss? How do you work in a professional environment? Many of them have never had the opportunity to learn how to actually manage a paycheck. Oftentimes, they've never even had a steady paycheck. So that soft skill training is equally important to the digital up-skilling and the technology skill training.
We also just completed a randomized control trial with MIT to validate the efficacy of this model. People who received training and employment at Samasource reported 10% lower unemployment rates and wages that are, on average, more than 25% higher than our control group. Our up-skilling programs, our full-time employment programs, and paying living wages had a particularly significant effect on women who received earnings 30% higher than the control group. If you look at economic development as a whole, that is so powerful.
Marquis: How has your business adapted during COVID? And do you have any recommendations for other businesses looking to adapt to these challenges? 
Gadonniex: We launched multiple initiatives through 2020 to ensure our employees were able to safely maintain their jobs and continued to deliver the secure, high quality training data that we're known for in the midst of this pandemic. Business continuity was extremely high on the priority list of our customers, especially during the start of COVID. And I think that that makes total sense given the situation. 
To ensure continuity, we create a program called Samahome, a partnership between Samasource and local hotels in Kenya and Uganda. We enabled our employees to work in safe environments during the height of the pandemic in these live-work arrangements. 
Our team members could opt in to live and work at Samahome. Before they entered the Samahome, everyone was checked to make sure they were healthy. We conducted ongoing health checks, practiced social distancing, and ensured that there were sanitization measures in place. 
We recently launched our work-from-home initiative, which actually provides our employees with the necessary resources to effectively work from home. We also have a few teams that are starting to work from our secured delivery centers again, and we're continuing to transition back for certain teams while maintaining social distancing protocols and health checks. The pandemic shifted our business model, so we are exploring maintaining a work-from-home model because this allows us to expand the amount of opportunity that we can provide to the communities in which we operate.

Did NASA Accept That Sanskrit Is The Best Suited Language For Computer Programming?

Social media is abuzz with hailing Sanskrit as the “best language” for computers, citing a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) researcher’s paper.
Were Haiti, Lebanon & Now Turkey Subjected To A Man-Made Earthquake Via HAARP Technology?

While there’s no backing for this claim, several netizens have believed it and even shared it. There’s no concrete information as to how the language can be used for coding or programming. 









Rick Briggs, a researcher at NASA wrote a paper in 1985 titled “Knowledge Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence” that was published in AI Magazine.
The text from the paper reads – “There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigour until the present century. Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence.”

He further explained the aim of the paper was to “demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been reinventing a wheel millennia-old”.








Sanskrit Text
It is important to understand that humans and computers understand different languages. “Natural Languages” are the languages understood by humans like English, Hindi and even Sanskrit. On the other hand, “Machine/Artificial languages” include Lisp or C or Prolog. The major goal of AI at that time was to reach a point where computers understand “natural languages”. 
Briggs just directed the attention towards Sanskrit as one of the natural languages that have existed for a very long time and have its expanse literature. Nowhere does Briggs said that it was “the best” or “the most suitable” language for computers.
NASA has not approved any such claims doing the rounds on social media. “Much of AI research has happened in Lisp, for example, because of its ability to manipulate words and sentences – but Lisp is nearly unheard of outside AI,” wrote Dilip D’Souza of The Scroll. 
He further emphasized that if Sanskrit had been a suitable language, there would have been a software written in Sanskrit by now. 
“Certainly the rigorous rules of Sanskrit grammar have lessons for AI, but writing software is another challenge altogether. The way computers are built requires a certain clear and unmistakable logic in how we give instructions to them. Nobody has yet found a way to do that in any natural language, whether Sanskrit or English,” he added.





However, Indian politician and economist, Subramanian Swamy had blamed the Americans “for globalized use” of the English language and that claimed that Sanskrit will replace English in fifty years.
While the validity of Mr. Swami’s claim will be known in the next fifty years, it can be conclusively said that the claim that Sanskrit is the “most suitable” or the “best” language for computers or AI is false.

Of all the areas of life where artificial intelligence will have an impact, the biggest might well be education. This is because learning is so important, and also because current provision often leaves a lot to be desired.


This is not generally the fault of teachers. They are the active ingredient in today’s education system, but they are expensive, and not scalable. In most countries they are under-valued, and burdened by absurd paperwork. They are also human, which means they are variable. Think back to your own school days: how many of your teachers were positively inspirational? As many as 10%? How many were unacceptable? That probably leaves a large majority somewhere between OK and mediocre. One of the tragedies of modern education is that constructive feedback for teachers is rarely given or sought.

The pedagogical dark ages
Classrooms today would be recognisable to the Victorians who invented them. A few decades from now we may look back on this period as the final years of the pedagogical dark ages. Some would even say that schools today are abusive: sitting still and quiet in military ranks for hours at a time is the absolute opposite of what children are hard-wired to do.

PROMOTED
As Donald Clark says in his new book, Artificial Intelligence for Learning, “Education is a bit of a slow learner.” Clark co-founded Epic Group in 1986, and made it the UK’s leading player in online learning. He floated it in 1996, and sold it again in 2005, since when he has been an investor, adviser, and commentator.

Flipped lessons
Clark lists a number of tools which are already available to improve the situation. With flipped lessons, students watch a video of a lecture for homework (and there is no reason why it can’t be the best such lecture ever given), and then put what they have been told into practice in the classroom. The teacher acts as coach and mentor, a more interactive role than lecturing. Competency-based learning requires students to have mastered a skill or a lesson before they move on to the next one; students within a class may progress at different speeds, and your educational stage is not rigidly determined by your age. As Sal Khan, the founder of Khan Academy, points out, this means that everyone should get an ‘A’.

Another of the tools which should already be improving education is online learning. Julia Begbie is a director of KLC, the UK’s leading private design college, based in Chelsea, in London. She has spent a decade establishing KLC’s online learning capability, and she is an enthusiast: “Conventional wisdom says that online learning is characterised by isolation, plagiarism, low retention rates, shallow learning, poor quality teaching materials, and meaningless qualifications. Some of this was true in the past; increasingly it is simply wrong.”

KLC’s investment in online learning capability paid huge dividends this year. Like most educational institutions, it had to close its doors to students in March. “During the Easter holidays, we switched the entire school to online delivery. It was a huge challenge, but it worked. Not only did it ensure our ongoing success, but it also demonstrated to both staff and students that online learning has a number of positive advantages over the traditional, in-person variety. The results of our students who graduated in July 2020 have now been ratified by external examiners, and they are just as impressive as those of previous cohorts.”
One of these advantages is that every online learning communication, however insignificant, is captured and can be read, listened to, or watched again and again. As Donald Clark puts it, “online learning lies naked on the screen, open to scrutiny in a way that is rarely true in the classroom or lecture hall. This forces you to be clear, precise and accurate.”
Private schools ahead
The advantages of online learning, especially during a pandemic, have not been lost on the UK’s private schools (confusingly known as public schools, because their children are educated away from home, instead of by live-in governesses, or tutors making house calls.) Private schools have been pioneering with flipped lessons for years, and many of them maintained a far higher level of continuous education for their students during lockdown than state schools were able to. As a result, the UK’s education gap between the privileged 7% or so and the rest has surely widened this year.
Nevertheless, online learning is still young, and must improve. According to Donald Clark, It “remains stubbornly primitive, almost behavioural in approach. Even the gamification of content can be doggedly Pavlovian. … Most EdTech projects are mosquito projects: lots of buzz, tricky to spot, and short-lived.”
AI will transform education
Artificial intelligence will help. Indeed, in the coming decades, AI will transform education. Clark is confident that “AI can result in accelerating and reducing the cost of learning–even basic skills such as reading, writing and arithmetic–on a global scale. It will make past improvements in pedagogy look like rounding errors.” It is being kick-started by initiatives like the X Prize for Education, which awarded $15m of prizes last year to software startups who created scalable solutions that enable children to teach themselves basic reading, writing and arithmetic within 15 months.
Clark says that bots (software robots) will take over an increasing range of education-related activities, including the recruitment of students, onboarding them in schools and universities, reminding and cajoling them to submit coursework, assessing some of their work, and even providing a certain amount of Socratic tuition. IBM provided the famous example of a teaching assistant chatbot named Jill Watson, (mis-named after legendary IBM CEO Tom Watson’s wife - her name was actually Jeanette). Students at Georgia Tech, a computing college, were guinea pigs in an experiment to see whether they would notice that one of their nine teaching assistants was a robot. Interestingly, when they finally twigged that “she” was too efficient to be human, they were not annoyed. Instead, they recommended “her” for a teaching award.
These chatbots are but a pale shadow of the astonishingly effective teachers and guides that our digital assistants will become. The descendants of Siri, Alexa, Cortana and the rest will have an encyclopedic knowledge of the curriculum we need to master, and they will understand better than we do which approach to learning suits us best, which times of day we are most receptive, and which times we are best left to relax or rest. Education will be less regimented, more flexible, and much more closely tailored to our individual preferences and needs. Above all, it will be more fun. And your digital assistant will find you just as endlessly fascinating as you find yourself.
Personalization is perhaps the greatest gift that AI will bring to learning. As KLC’s Julia Begbie puts it, “digitisation places commissioning control in the hands of the consumer.”
Virtual and augmented reality
AI will also help by enabling related technologies to realise their educational potential, including virtual reality and augmented reality. It will be much more compelling to learn about Napoleon by experiencing the battle of Waterloo, rather than by reading about it, or listening to a lecturer describe it. It will be much easier for a teacher to explain the molecular structure of alcohol by escorting her pupils around a VR model of it.
Perhaps ironically, AI could render education more natural, as well as more effective and more fun. Higher education in particular has become an exercise in intensive paper farming, with an exponential growth of text output. Talking is more natural for humans than writing, and advanced natural language processing technology can give us back frictionless dialogue.
Unfortunately, none of this will make learning trivially easy. Until we have advanced brain-computer interfaces, we won’t be able to simply upload knowledge and skills into our minds, like Neo learning Kung Fu in the Matrix. Elon Musk is surely over-optimistic in thinking that anything like that will be available in the next decade or three. We will still have to practice active recall to establish and strengthen memory.
Vacational, not vocational
But in a shorter time frame than that, we may well develop an economy of abundance, where the cost of everything you need for a very good standard of living is close to zero. The economy of abundance is probably what we need in order to survive and thrive when technological unemployment arrives. In a system of fully automated luxury capitalism, education will become “vacational” not “vocational”, and much more important than it is today. Maybe, when you meet someone at a party, instead of asking what they do for a living, you will ask them what they are learning.
