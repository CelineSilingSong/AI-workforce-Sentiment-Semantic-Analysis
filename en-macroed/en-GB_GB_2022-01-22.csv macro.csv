Mr Maire works for Firmenich, a business with a perfume industry pedigree stretching back to 1895. Firmenich's nose for a new market saw it diversify into food ingredients as the public appetite for alternatives to meat led to a scramble to put plant-based food on supermarket shelves.The company says there is a global market for plant-based meat substitutes of $25bn (£19bn) and believes this will grow to $200bn by 2030.To help perfect the flavours of these innovative foods, Mr Maire has a new sous-chef in the form of Sam, an artificial intelligence (AI) robot. FirmenichNew plant-based foods have raised demand for flavouringAlong with a team of flavourists, Sam helps blend a huge array of flavours for clients.In humans the sense of taste stems from multiple receptors that are primed to alert our brains to the nature of any possible food we encounter.Sam lacks this sense of taste, but it has been trained on a database of ingredients gathered over 60 years at the company.Using a technique called machine learning, it has raced through examples of flavour combinations and has learnt its own definitions, maturing over 18 months into today's AI robot. Eric Saracchi runs the digital side of Firmenich: ""Flavours are more complex than perfumes,"" he says, and Sam had to understand what a strawberry is, or how grilled beef hits the tongue, before finding matches between tastes and plant foodstuffs. The robot is primed with so many ingredients it is known internally as ""a piano with 5,000 keys"".That piano is played by the company's team of human flavourists.The top tasters are the master flavourists, and out of some 30 in the world six work at Firmenich. Creators of flavours are so rare, ""you can't replace them, you can only enhance them,""  says Mr Saracchi.FirmenichPatrick Salord is principal flavourist at FirmenichFlavourists are at the heart of Firmenich, and Patrick Salord is its principal flavourist.""Being a flavourist is a combination of art and science. I took a masters degree in chemistry before I began this career. We train to pick the best ingredients to achieve the flavour we want. We evaluate and describe them and compare them.""He uses certain aromas and tastes to mask ""off-notes"" such as acidic tastes while giving a formula the right texture. He talks of the tonality of food, how removing one tiny ingredient can change the overall taste.Sam takes the knowledge of flavourists and generates new formulas in minutes, a fraction of the time Mr Salord and his team take using their own skills. ""It suggests a formula that is in line with our senses.""Getty ImagesOne big advantage of an AI robot is that it has no cognitive bias. This lack of human prejudices helps Firmenich to get past any unconscious leanings of the flavourists. The objectivity of Sam, devoid of influences that can sway even the most professional of flavourists, allows it to work at speed. ""It adds value by combining the knowledge of all the other flavourists here,"" says Mr Salord.The machine rapidly gives an indication of how a flavour can be created and how much of an ingredient should be included. And Sam can hold the line between Mr Salord's team of flavourists and public tastes, refereeing decisions when the flavourists' view differs from that of a consumer panel. But the finished product needs more - and that's what Mr Salord's team bring to the tasting party, which belongs to the start of the day. ""We try to taste in the morning before we have coffee. By the afternoon your sense of taste becomes tired and affected by lunch. So we leave the afternoon for work on the computer.""More technology of business:Like a drone that you sit in – but is it safe?What can we do to get more women into coding?Controversy over wood pellets as a green energy sourceThe companies offering delivery to the MoonIs there a better way to make new resolutions stick?Back in Mr Maire's kitchen the cross-fertilisation between flavourist and robot is coming out of the frying pan. He is accustomed to hosting business clients, searching for a specific taste they can drop into foodstuffs on supermarket shelves. The flavourists remain his close colleagues, even though AI is ""a powerful, beautiful tool."" And he rates the taste of UK consumers highly. ""It's an advanced market with many vegan people."" Firmenich is betting big on the rest of the world changing their food habits in line with the British. He concedes that this marriage of science and culinary arts has its critics. ""When you say chemicals it's not sexy for gastronomy.""His triumphant retort is to brandish thick slices of a pale juicy meat that tastes like a good cut of chicken but springs from Sam's recipe for vegetable protein, resembling a paste. ""The essence of what we do is innovation, for me molecules are another flavour."" Mr Maire maintains he is ready to whip up Christmas turkey and more from plant-based ingredients. ""We are only at the beginning of what can be done. We have the competency to make Christmas pudding flavours too.""

Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Dick and Mac McDonald opened the first McDonald’s restaurant in San Bernardino, California in 1940. By the end of the decade, the restaurant added its now-famous French fries. Ray Kroc joined the growing organization in 1954, purchased it in 1961, and served as its CEO into the early 1970s. Over the next decades, the restaurant chain grew, adding its drive-thru concept, Hamburger University, and iconic menu items like its Filet-O-Fish, Big Mac, and Quarter Pounder sandwiches.  Today, McDonald’s is the world’s second-largest restaurant company by revenue and its largest fast-food restaurant chain with more than 39,000 locations in 119 countries. As of January 2022, McDonald’s trades on the NYSE with a market cap of approximately $200 billion. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, McDonald’s reported total revenues of over $22 billion.  McDonald’s created McD Tech Labs after its 2019 acquisition of Apprente, a voice technology firm, which in turn followed its earlier acquisition of Dynamic Yield, a Tel Aviv-based firm that specialized in personalization and decision logic technology.  In 2020, McDonald’s announced its Accelerating the Arches growth strategy, which includes a “double down on the 3 D’s: Digital, Delivery and Drive-Thru,” and the integration of these newly acquired AI technologies.  In this article, we’ll look at how McDonald’s has explored AI applications for its business and industry through two unique use-cases: Automated Drive-Thrus — McDonald’s acquired natural language processing and machine learning expertise through its 2019 acquisition of Apprente, which the chain has applied to its automated order-taking initiatives.  Order Prediction — McDonald’s uses machine learning-based decision technology to predict what menu offerings are most likely to drive sales in its drive-thru business.  We will begin by examining how McDonald’s uses natural language processing and machine learning technology to speed its order-taking process as its drive-thru business has become more popular during the pandemic.   Automated Drive-Thrus Since the introduction of its first drive-thrus in the 1970s, McDonald’s has grown to rely on the model to attract and serve its guests. As of December 2021, McDonald’s offers drive-thru service in some 25,000 locations across the world, including at 95% of all US operations. Valued by consumers for its convenience and flexibility, the drive-thru model has taken on even more importance during the COVID-19 pandemic, representing some 70% of sales in top markets since March 2020.  “Our drive-thru sales across our top six markets continue to stay elevated versus pre-pandemic levels even as dining rooms reopened,” said Chris Kempczinski, the chain’s president and CEO during its Q3 2021 earnings call.  In addition to implementing drive-thru innovations like express pick-up, express drive-thru, and smaller “on-the-go” locations, McDonald’s is also looking to improve on its ordering and payment functions.   The company made its biggest jump into innovating the order and payment components of the drive-thru process by beginning to automate drive-thru order-taking in 2018, and with its 2019 acquisition of Apprente. Later renamed McD Tech Labs, the acquisition enabled McDonald’s to implement and test automated order-taking at several of its US-based restaurants, Kempczinski said in October 2021.    Apprente technology, per a Q3 2019 McDonald’s press release is a “voice-based [platform] for complex, multilingual, multi-accent, and multi-item conversational ordering.” McDonald’s hopes that using the solution’s natural language processing and machine learning capabilities will create a faster, simpler, and more accurate order-taking process at the company’s drive-thrus.    Here Mason Smoot, McDonald’s Chief Restaurant Officer for the US, explains McDonald’s plans for its Automated Order-Taking technology at the Company’s Worldwide Connection 2.0 (WWC) Meeting:  Since 2018, McDonald’s reports that the chain has cut the time it takes to serve drive-thru customers by thirty seconds and claims that this has resulted in increased customer satisfaction. McDonald’s has announced plans to expand its drive-thru “innovations” to more than 10,000 locations worldwide.  Automated order-taking boasts an 85% accuracy rating, Kempczinksi said at the Alliance Bernstein’s Strategic Decisions conference, adding that about 20% of orders have required human intervention.  In its most recent earnings call, the chain reports substantial benefits for both customers and its employees, and has announced plans to continue to scale the technology to more than 14,000 locations across the country.   To help drive that growth, McDonald’s entered into a “strategic relationship” with IBM in Q4 2021 to tap into their expertise in “building AI powered customer care solutions and voice recognition,” Kempczinski continued during the Q3 2021 earnings call. As part of the deal, automated order taking “will continue to be integrated into McDonald’s highly secure technology ecosystem.”  Order Prediction Digitization is coming to the drive-thru. As we drive around—and go inside—McDonald’s restaurants, we are increasingly met with digital displays, and those displays are growing smarter.    In the United States alone, McDonald’s serves more than 25 million customers daily. In the chain’s top markets, some 70% of sales come through the drive-thru. As part of its Accelerating the Arches effort to make the drive-thru as efficient and convenient as possible for its customers, McDonald’s purchased Dynamic Yield in 2019, planning to leverage its decision technology to add personalization to its drive-thrus and modernize the customer experience.  When McDonald’s added Dynamic Yield’s machine-learning-driven solution to its drive-thrus at select locations in 2018, the tech considered purchases made by other customers when updating the offerings presented on the ordering displays. The technology also updated the digital drive-thru menu displays based on: The time of day Current order selections Current restaurant traffic Popularity of menu items  Weather conditions Here, at McDonald’s November 2020 Virtual Investor Update, Mason Smoot, McDonald’s Chief Restaurant Officer for the US, explains the company’s vision for its Drive-Thru strategy:    Through the machine-learning technology acquired in the Dynamic Yield transaction, McDonald’s digitized its point-of-sale process at its brick-and-mortar locations with decision technology. After testing the digital displays in several domestic markets in 2018, McDonald’s announced plans to continue its rollout to more US and international locations in 2019. With Dynamic Yield’s machine-learning-driven decision technology, McDonald’s now offers digital displays that suggest items popular with other customers, or that are frequently purchased in certain weather or during a specific time of day. These digital displays can also suggest faster-to-prepare items to alleviate drive-thru slowdowns.  Rumors first emerged in early 2021 that McDonald’s was considering selling its Dynamic Yield business. Possible reasons included disagreements about $70 million in technology fees that McDonald’s said were not paid by its franchisees.  Later in 2021, in December, McDonald’s announced plans to sell Dynamic Yield to Mastercard. Although Dynamic Yield, with its portfolio of more than 400 global brands, will become part of Mastercard’s digital service strategy, Mastercard, through its President of Data & Services, stated that it plans to “continue working with McDonald’s.”  While McDonald’s does not provide separate financial performance information for its Dynamic Yield business, the company does plan to continue using the technology in its bid to further personalize its customer experience and, at the time of the Dynamic Yield sale, reiterated its plans to “further scale and integrate Dynamic Yield’s capabilities globally and across ordering channels.”

Increasingly, researchers are looking for ways to implement artificial intelligence into medical imaging.
There are several different cases for why a patient might need medical imaging. Whether it’s for a cardiac event, fracture, neurological condition, or thoracic complications, AI can quickly diagnose and provide treatment options.







Recently, research organizations and universities have been pursuing the expansion of AI in cancer screenings. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients chose to delay care, such as well-visits and cancer screenings, resulting in more advanced cancers.
By implementing AI into medical imaging, the technology can enhance medical screenings, improve precision medicine, assess patient risk factors, and lighten the load for physicians.

Advancing medical screenings 
By using AI in medical imaging, physicians can identify conditions much quicker, promoting early intervention.
At Tulane University, researchers discovered that AI can accurately detect and diagnose colorectal cancer by analyzing tissue scans as well or better than pathologists.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether artificial intelligence could be a tool to assist pathologists in keeping up with the rising demand for services.
According to the researchers, pathologists regularly evaluate and label thousands of histopathology images to identify whether a patient has cancer. However, their average workload has significantly increased, which could lead to unintended misdiagnoses.
“Even though a lot of their work is repetitive, most pathologists are extremely busy because there’s a huge demand for what they do but there’s a global shortage of qualified pathologists, especially in many developing countries,” Professor and Director of the Tulane Center of Biomedical Informatics and Genomics at Tulane University School of Medicine, Hong-Wen Deng, PhD, said in a press release.
“This study is revolutionary because we successfully leveraged artificial intelligence to identify and diagnose colorectal cancer in a cost-effective way, which could ultimately reduce the workload of pathologists.”
Additionally, AI can be used in assessing cardiovascular complications.
Measuring various structures of the heart can indicate a patient’s risk for cardiovascular disease. In addition, automating the detection of abnormalities in imaging tests can lead to quicker decision-making and fewer diagnostic errors.
With AI, the technology can identify left atrial enlargement from chest x-rays to rule out other cardiac or pulmonary problems, assisting providers in targeting the appropriate treatments for patients. 
Similar AI tools could be used to automate other measurement tasks, including aortic valve analysis, carina angle measurement, and pulmonary artery diameter.
Applying AI to imaging data could also help identify the thickening of certain muscle structures or monitor changes in blood flow through the heart and associated arteries. AI can be used to detect cancerous lesions.
With AI medical imaging, the technology can also detect fractures, diagnose neurological diseases, identify thoracic complications


Improving precision medicine 
AI can also be implemented into medical imaging to advance precision medicine. For example, at Stanford University, researchers found that a machine learning tool could differentiate between two types of lung cancer.
Additionally, the machine learning tool predicted patient survival rates better than the standard approach of pathologists classifying tumors by grade and stage.
“Pathology as it is practiced now is very subjective,” professor and chair of genetics, Michael Snyder, PhD, said in a press release.
“Two highly skilled pathologists assessing the same slide will agree only about 60 percent of the time. This approach replaces this subjectivity with sophisticated, quantitative measurements that we feel are likely to improve patient outcomes.”
The use of AI takes the subjectively out of the equation. The tool can identify the type of cancer and determine the best course of treatment for the patient, advancing precision medicine efforts. With precision medicine, physicians can provide a personalized treatment approach to specifically target the illness.


Indicating and assessing risk 
While AI can be used in medical imaging to identify current conditions impacting a patient, it can also predict the potential risk for future illnesses.
In a recent study, researchers found that by combining AI imaging techniques with clinical data, physicians could improve predictive models indicating a patient’s risk for heart attacks.
When analyzed together in an artificial intelligence model, researchers discovered that coronary 18F-NaF uptake on PET and quantitative coronary plaque characteristics on CT angiography were complementary and robust predictors of heart attack risk in patients with established coronary artery disease. 
Together, the two techniques could provide more accurate heart attack risk prediction than using clinical data alone. 
“Recently, advanced imaging techniques have demonstrated considerable promise in determining which coronary artery disease patients are most at risk for a heart attack. These techniques include 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) PET, which assesses disease activity in the coronary arteries, and CT angiography, which provides a quantitative plaque analysis,” Director of Innovation in Imaging at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Piotr J. Slomka, PhD, FACC, FASNC, FCCPM, said in a press release. 
“Our goal in the study was to investigate whether the information provided by 18F-NaF PET and CT angiography is complementary and could improve prediction of heart attacks with the use of artificial intelligence techniques.” 
According to the researcher team, their findings supported the use of artificial intelligence methods for integrating multimodality imaging and clinical data for accurately predicting heart attacks.
With AI, machine learning methods can advance medical screenings, enhance precision medicine, analyze patient risk factors, and lighten the load for physicians.

IntroductionWomen in some South-Asian countries, like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan face significant hardships and problems, ranging from human trafficking to gender discrimination. Compared to their counterparts in developed countries, developing-world women encounter a biased atmosphere. Many South Asian countries have a patriarchal and male-dominated society, and their culture has a strong preference for male offspring (Kristof, 1993; Bhalotra et al., 2020; Oomman and Ganatra, 2002). These countries, particularly India, have experienced instances where technology has been utilized to create gender bias (Guilmoto, 2015). For example, there has been a great misuse of some of the techniques, of which sonography, or ultrasound, is one. The public misappropriated sonography, which was intended to determine the unborn’s health select the fetus’s gender, and perform an abortion if the fetus is female (Alkaabi et al., 2007; Akbulut-Yuksel and Rosenblum, 2012; Bowman-Smart et al., 2020). Many Indian states, particularly the northern states of India, have seen a significant drop in the sex ratio due to this erroneous use of technology. India’s unbalanced child sex ratio has rapidly deteriorated. In 1981, there were 962 females in the 0–6-year age group for every 1000 boys. In 1991, there were 945 girls, then 927 girls in 2001, and 918 girls at the time of the 2011 Census (Bose, 2011; Hu and Schlosser, 2012). In 1994, the Indian government passed the Pre-conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act to halt this trend. The law made it unlawful for medical practitioners to divulge the sex of a fetus due to worries that ultrasound technology was being used to detect the sex of the unborn child and terminate the female fetus (Nidadavolu and Bracken, 2006; Ahankari et al., 2015). However, as the Indian Census data over the years demonstrates, the law did not operate as well as intended. According to public health campaigners, this is due to the Indian government’s failure to enforce the law effectively; sex determination and female feticide continue due to medical practitioners’ lack of oversight. Radiologists and gynecologists, on the other hand, argue that it’s because the law was misguided from the outset, holding the medical profession responsible for a societal problem (Tripathi, 2016).In the realm of artificial intelligence, gender imbalance is a critical issue. Because of how AI systems are developed, gender bias in AI can be problematic. Algorithm developers may be unaware of their prejudices, and implicit biases and unknowingly pass their socially rooted gender prejudices onto robots. This is evident because the present trends in machine learning reinforce historical stereotypes of women, such as humility, mildness, and the need for protection. For instance, security robots are primarily male, but service and sex robots are primarily female. Another example is AI-driven risk analysis in the justice system. The algorithms may overlook the fact that women are less likely to re-offend than men, placing women at a disadvantage. Female gendering increases bots’ perceived humanity and the acceptability of AI. Consumers believe that female AI is more humane and more reliable and therefore more ready to meet users’ particular demands. Because the feminization of robots boosts their marketability, AI is attempting to humanize them by embedding feminist characteristics and striving for acceptability in a male-dominated robotic society. There’s a risk that machine learning technologies will wind up having biases encoded if women don’t make a significant contribution. Diverse teams made up of both men and women are not just better at recognizing skewed data, but they’re also more likely to spot issues that could have dire societal consequences. While women’s characteristics are highly valued in AI robots, protein-basedFootnote 1 women’s jobs are in jeopardy. Presently, women hold only 22% of worldwide AI positions while men hold 78% (World Economic Forum Report, 2018). According to another study by wired.com, only 12% of machine learning researchers are women, which is a concerning ratio for a subject that is meant to transform society (Simonite, 2018). Because women make up such a small percentage of the technological workforce, technology may become the tangible incarnation of male power in the coming years. The situation in the developing world is worse, and hence a cautious approach is required to ensure that a male-dominated society in some of the developing world’s countries does not abuse AI’s power and use it to exacerbate the predicament of women who are already in a precarious situation.This manuscript discusses the relationship between women, technology, manifestation, and probable prospects in the developing world. Taking India as a case study, the manuscript further focuses on how the ontology and epistemology perspectives used in the fields of AI, and robotics will affect the futures of women in developing countries. Women in the developing world, particularly in South Asia, are stereotyped as doing domestic work and have low representation in high-level positions. They are disproportionately underemployed and endure employment discrimination. The article will attempt to explore, whether the introduction of AI would exacerbate the already fragile position of women in South Asia or serve as a liberating force for them. While studies on the influence of AI on women have been conducted in industrialized countries, research in developing countries has been minimal. This manuscript will aim to bridge this gap.The study tests the following hypothesis:H01: The changing lifestyle, growing challenges, and increasing use of AI robots in daily life may not be a threat to the existing human relationship.HA1: The changing lifestyle, growing challenges, and increasing use of AI robots in daily life may be a threat to the existing human relationship.H02: There is no significant difference in the perception of females and males towards AI robots.HA2: There is a significant difference in the perception of females and males towards AI robots.H03: There is no major variation in the requirements and utilization of AI robots between men and women.HA3: There is a considerable difference in the requirements and use of AI robots between men and women.H04: When it comes to the gender of the robots, there is no substantial difference between male and female preferences.HA4: When it comes to the gender of the robots, there is a substantial difference between male and female preferences.The manuscript is divided into four sections. The first section is an introduction, followed by a literature review, methodology, results and discussion, and finally, a conclusion.Literature reviewAI’s basic assumption is that human intellect can be studied and simulated so that computers can be programmed to perform tasks that people can do (Guo, 2015). Alan Turing, the pioneer of AI, felt that to develop intelligent things like homo sapiens, humans ought to be considered as mechanical beings rather than as emotionally manifested super-beings so that they could be studied and replicated (Evers, 2005; Sanders, 2008). Rosalind Picard published “Affective Computing” in 1997, with the basic premise being that if we want smarter computers that interact with people more naturally, we must give them the ability to identify, interpret, and even express emotions. This approach went against popular belief, which held that pure logic was the highest type of AI (Venkatraman, 2020). Many human features have been transferred into non-human robots as a result of AI advancements, and expertise and knowledge will no longer be confined to only humans (Lloyd, 1985). Researchers like Lucy Suchman look at how agencies are now arranged at the human-machine interface and how they might be reimagined creatively and materially (Suchman, 2006). Weber believes that recent advancements in robotics and AI are going towards social robotics, as opposed to past achievements in robotics and AI, which can be attributed to fairly strict, law-oriented, conceding to adaptive human behavior towards machines (Weber, 2005, p. 210). Weber goes on to say that social roboticists want to take advantage of the human predisposition to anthropomorphize machines and connect with them socially by structuring them to look like a woman, a child, or a pet (Weber, 2005, p. 211). Reeves and Nass say humans communicate with artificial media, such as computers, in the same way, that they connect with other humans (Reeves and Naas, 1996). Studies further indicate that humans are increasingly relying on robots, and with the advancement of social artificially intelligent bots such as Alexa and Google Home, comme les companionship between comme les robots and humans is now becoming a reality (de Swarte et al., 2019; Odekerken-Schröder et al., 2020). It is believed that robots will not only get smarter over the next few decades, but they will also establish physical and emotional relationships with humans. This raises a fresh challenge about how people view robots intended for various types of closeness, both as friends and as possible competitors (Nordmo et al., 2020). According to Erika Hayasaki, artificial intelligence will be smarter than humans in the not-too-distant future. However, as technology advances, it may become increasingly racial, misogynistic, and inhospitable to women as it absorbs cultural norms from its designers and the internet (Hayasaki, 2017). The rapid advancement in robot and AI technology has highlighted some important problems with issues of gender bias (Bass, 2017; Leavy, 2018). There are apprehensions that algorithms will be able to target women specifically in the future (Caliskan et al., 2017). Given the increasing prominence of artificial intelligence in our communities, such attitudes risk leaving women stranded in many facets of life (UNESCO Report, 2020; Prives, 2018). Discrimination is no longer a purely human problem, as many decision-makers are aware that discriminating against someone based on an attribute such as sex is illegal and immoral. Therefore, they conceal their true intent behind an innocuous, constructed excuse (Santow, 2020). In the literature surrounding the discipline of Critical Algorithm Series, gender bias is a commonly debated topic (Pillinger, 2019). Donna Haraway published her famous essay titled, “A Cyborg Manifesto” in Socialist Review in 1985. In the essay, she criticized the traditional concepts of feminism as they mainly focus on identity politics. Haraway, inspires a new way of thinking about how to blur the lines between humans and machines and supports coalition-building through affinity (Pohl, 2018). She employs the notion of the cyborg to encourage feminists to think beyond traditional gender, feminism, and politics (Haraway, 1987, 2006). She further claims that, with the help of technology, we may all promote hybrid identities, and people will forget about gender supremacy as they become more attached to their robotics (Haraway, 2008). To date, however, this has not been the case. In recent times, growing machine prejudice is a problem that has sparked great concern in academia, industry research laboratories, and the mainstream commercial media, where trained statistical models, unknown to their developers, have grown to reflect critical societal imbalances like gender or racial bias (Hutson, 2017; Hardesty, 2018; Nurock, 2020; Prates et al., 2020). While previous research indicates that gendered and lifelike robots are perceived as more sentient, the researchers of those studies primarily ignored the distinction between female and male bots (DiMaio, 2021). The study by Sylvie Borau et al. indicates that female artificial intelligence is preferred by customers because it is seen to have more good human attributes than male artificial intelligence, such as affection, understanding, and emotion (Borau et al., 2021). This is consistent with the literature, which suggests that male robots may appear intimidating in the home and that people trust female bots for in-home use (Carpenter, 2009; Niculescu et al., 2010). Another study indicates that when participants’ gender matched the gender of AI personal assistant Siri’s voice, participants exhibited more faith in the machine (Lee et al., 2021). Human–robot-interaction (HRI) researchers have undertaken various studies on gender impacts to determine if men or women are more inclined to prefer or dislike robots. According to research, males showed more positive attitudes toward interacting with social robots than females in general (Lin et al., 2012), and females had more negative attitudes regarding robot interactions than males in particular (Nomura and Kanda, 2003; Nomura et al., 2006). In another study, Nomura urged researchers to explore whether gendering robots for specific roles is truly required to foster human–robot interaction (Nomura, 2017). The investigation by R. A. Søraa demonstrates how gendering practices of humans influence mechanical species of robots, concluding that the more sapient a robot grows, the more gendered it may become (Søraa, 2017). “I am for more women in robotics, not for more female robots,” Martina Mara, director of the RoboPsychology R & D division at the Ars Electronica Futurelab, adds (Hieslmair, 2017). While there is a large body of work describing gender bias in AI robots in developed countries, little research has been done on the impact of AI robots on women in developing and undeveloped countries. This article will try to bridge the gaps in the studies.MethodologyThe overarching purpose of this exploratory project is to look at gender and feminist issues in artificial intelligence from a developing-world perspective. It also intends to depict how men and women in developing countries react to the prospect of having robot lovers, companions, and helpers in their everyday lives. A vignette experiment was conducted with 125 female and 100 male volunteers due to the lack of commercial availability of such robots. The survey was distributed online, which aided in the recruitment of volunteers. The vast majority of those who responded (76%) were university students from India. Because the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic phase, the questionnaire was prepared in Google Form and distributed to participants via WhatsApp group and email. The participants ranged from 16 to 60 years old, with an average age of 27.25 (SD = 7.722) years. The vignette was created to portray a futuristic human existence as well as a variety of futuristic robots and their influence on people. The extracts from the vignette are: “At today’s science fair, Sam and Sophie, who are husband and wife, came across a variety of AI robots, including domestic robots, sex robots, doctor robots, nurse robots, engineer robots, personal assistant robots, and so on. This made them pleasantly surprised, and they were left to believe that in the future, AI robot technology will become so sophisticated that it will develop as an efficient alternative to protein-based humans. Back at home, Sophie utilizes Google Assistant and Alexa Assistant in the form of AI devices in the couple’s house to listen to music, cook food recipes, and entertain their children, while Sam uses them to get weather information, traffic information, book products online, set reminders, and so on. Mesmerized by the advancements in AI technology displayed at the science fair, Sam jokingly told Sophie that if there was a beautiful robot that could do household chores and give love and care to a partner, then the person would not need a marriage nor would he have to go through problems like break-up and divorce. Sophie disagreed, believing that the robot could not grasp or duplicate the person’s feelings and mood. Sam disagreed, claiming that a protein-based individual isn’t immune to these flaws either, because if that had been the case, human relationships would be devoid of misery, pain, violence, and breakups. Sophie thought that people need a companion but are unwilling to put up with human imperfections and that many people love the feminine traits inherent in AI robots but do not want to engage in a true relationship with real women.” After the respondents had finished reading the vignettes, they were handed the questionnaire and asked to fill it out. The questions were all delivered in English, with translation services available if necessary. Participation was entirely voluntary, and respondents were offered the option of remaining anonymous and not disclosing any further personal information such as their address, email address, or phone number. The participants gave their informed consent, and the participants’ personal information was kept private and confidential.In this study, a varied group was subjected to demographic data sheets as well as a self-developed questionnaire. The people that have been surveyed are of different sexes, ages, educational levels, and marital statuses. The purposive (simple random) sampling technique was used to attain the objectives.The research was conducted using a self-developed questionnaire. All the items on the scale were analyzed using IBM SPSS®23. Mean, standard deviation, total-item correlation, regression, and reliability analysis were performed on all the items. The questionnaire measured the items of AI using the following four scales: perspective, gender, requirements/use, and the threat of using AI. The alpha has been set to default 0.05 as a cut-off for significance.Results and discussionTable 1 shows a positive and significant intra-correlation between factors, such as perceptions towards AI robots, AI robot use and requirements, robot gender, and the threat from AI robots.Table 1 Correlation table.Full size tableA regression study to identify threat factors with respect to AI robots is shown in Table 2. The threat posed by AI robots is predicted by people’s perception of AI robots and the gender of AI robots. As a result, the hypothesis, that the changing lifestyle, growing challenges, and increasing use of AI robots in daily life may be a threat to the various existing human relationships is accepted. It could be inferred that people may be more motivated to live with AI robots due to changing lifestyles and increasing challenges and complications in human relationships (see Fig. 1). The majority of the respondents believe that greater use and reliance on AI robot technology will jeopardize the existence of protein-based people and lead to more prejudiced, discriminatory, and solitary societies. This is in support of the findings of the study, which show that people have an innate dread that robots will one day outwit them to the point that they will start exploiting humans (see Fig. 2). Moreover, the majority of respondents feel that AI may have a significant impact on gender balance in countries like India and that it may also affect gender balance in the subcontinent. This is in line with past concerns in India about the misuse of sonography technology (see Fig. 3).Table 2 Regression table.Full size tableFig. 1: Changing lifestyles and growing challenges in human relationships may make people inclined to adapt to AI robots.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 2: AI robots may endanger human existence and lead to a society that is increasingly prejudiced, discriminatory, and solitary.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 3: The gender balance in developing countries will be impacted as a result of human–AI interaction.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageTable 3 exhibits the results of the t-test. The results portray a significant difference between male and female respondents on the perception of AI robots. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternate hypothesis stating that there is a significant difference in the perception of females and males towards AI robots can be accepted. The t-test further indicates that there exists no significant difference between males and females on the requirements and use of AI robots, as no significant gender difference was found on the requirements and use of AI robots by both males and females. The majority of respondents believe that living with AI robots will become a reality soon (see Fig. 4) and that the AI robots’ ethnic and racial appearance may have a significant impact on consumers’ AI robot purchasing preferences (see Figs. 5 and 6). The respondents also advocated different ethical programming for the female and male robots (see Fig. 7). However, as far as the use of robots is concerned, it is evident that all other categories of robots have shown roughly equal demand from both males and females, except for sex and love robots, where the gender discrepancy is more than twice, with 24% of males and 8.8% of females indicating a need for sex and love robots (see Fig. 8). Assistant robots, teaching robots, entertainment robots, robots that do household tasks and errands, and robots that offer care were among the most popular. Females showed the least interest in sex and love robots, while males showed the least interest in companion and friendship robots. Overall, 15.56% of respondents said they were open to having sex and love robots. This demonstrates the general concern and reluctance to engage in sexual or romantic relationships with AI computers. Females, on the other hand, appear to be more hesitant and averse to engaging in intimacy with robots than males. The key reasons for this are sentiments of envy and insecurity. The study’s findings also show that males in developing countries have a more favorable attitude toward sex robots than females. This confirms the existence of gender differences in emotional intimacy and sex preferences (Johnson, 2004). Sex robots have the potential to reduce or eliminate prostitution, human trafficking, and sex tourism for women (Yeoman and Mars, 2012) in developing countries. According to data from the Indian government’s National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), 95% of trafficked people in India are forced into prostitution (Divya, 2020; Munshi, 2020).Table 3 Mean, SD and p-values on different dimensions of AI robots (N = 225) (t-test) (alpha is set to the default 0.05).Full size tableFig. 4: Living with AI robots will become a reality in the near future.Total number of respondents:225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 5: The racial and ethnic appearance of AI robots impacts the purchase decision of their buyers.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 6: In the future, some individuals may replace human companions with AI analogs.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 7: Separate ethical norms for male and female robots are required.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 8: Artificial intelligence robots and their use.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageThe t-test further indicates that there exists no significant difference between male and female respondents as far as the gender of the robots is concerned. However, the analysis of mean figures indicates that the majority of respondents believe that gender has a role in AI robot development and production (see Fig. 9), and AI will have a greater impact on both men and women (see Fig. 10), but when asked which gender AI will have the greatest impact on, both genders answer that AI will have the greatest impact on their gender (see Fig. 11). While most people disagreed with the premise that female robots are seen by them as more humane (see Fig. 12), they did agree that female robots are regarded differently by them (see Fig. 13). They further agreed that feminizing robots improves their marketability and acceptance (see Fig. 14), and that corporations are using feminity to humanize non-human things like AI robots (see Fig. 15). The responses also indicate that a majority of the respondents (55.11%) believe that the use of feminine features in robots increases the risk of females being stereotyped (see Fig. 16).Fig. 9: Gender has a role in AI robot development and production.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 10: AI robots may unduly favor one gender over the other.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 11: The gender that is more likely to be impacted by their AI counterparts.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 12: Female AI robots are more humane than Male robots.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 13: Women are perceived differently even when they are AI robots.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 14: The feminization of AI robots makes them more marketable and acceptable.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 15: Feminity is being used to humanize non-human creatures such as AI robots.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageFig. 16: Increased adoption of feminine traits in AI robots would put females at risk of being stereotyped.Total no. of respondents: 225 (Female: 125, Male: 100).Full size imageConclusionThe gendering of the robots in AI is problematic and does not always lead to the desired improved acceptability, as gender makes no difference in terms of robot functionality and performance. The study contradicts the widely held belief that women in developing nations such as India are wary about living with AI robots in the near future. It also shows that both men and women feel AI will have a stronger impact on both males and females. The majority of respondents dissented that female robots are considered more commiserate than male robots, but they accede to the fact that female robots are perceived differently, even when they are robots. The majority of respondents feel that AI will have a significant impact on gender balance in nations like India just like the sonography technique that was misused for doing gender selection. However, they are in general agreement with the fact that people may be motivated to live with AI robots due to changing lifestyles and increasing challenges and complications in human relationships. Due to the rising cost of maintaining a protein-based lifestyle, humans may turn to robots to eschew the issues that come with it. The study also found people in developing countries have an innate dread that robots will one day outwit them.

Cognitive rail pilot: can robots take over train driving?
Published on 25-01-2022 at 12:30


AI or Artificial Intelligence concept with train light trails and industrial factory.

The artificial intelligence (AI) based system Cognitive Rail Pilot acquired the Declaration of Conformity to the regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union, meaning that it can start its deployment in several countries. The system is designed to assist locomotive drivers during operations by predicting and avoiding possible hazards.

The system was developed by the company Cognitive Pilot, and its functions allow rail companies, professionals and enthusiasts to take a look at the future of rail freight. The way it works not only assists the locomotive drivers but also takes over the hard part of their job- the management of dangerous situations. “The locomotive driver profession is one of the most challenging and dangerous – you have to work to the limit. Robots can take away the driver’s routine workload and assist in emergencies,” comments the company’s CEO Olga Uskova.
Robots taking over
Robots, as we fictionally imagine them, might not take the seat in the locomotive’s driving booth. However, they will have a crucial role in recognising the train’s route and providing functions such as stopping at a red light, stopping in danger of collision, stopping before a closed arrow, and high-precision locating of the locomotive.

Of course, AI will be the game changer in this case. As we have seen happening in terminal operations, AI will be the enabler of taking the next step to safe rail freight operations. “The AI-based system allows the locomotive to ‘see’ and ‘understand’ the situation along the way with high accuracy, to warn the driver of the danger, and in case of lack of response, to perform a safe stop automatically. In addition, using a set of special algorithms, the system allows the location and dynamics of the locomotive to be determined with a very high degree of accuracy,” explains the company.

Apart from the software system, the new generation locomotives will also need to equip with some hardware. Specifically, the system comprises three components: A multi-zone video camera that tracks the locomotive’s route and helps the system navigate, a specialised high-resolution millimetre-wave radar to locate any obstacles, and finally, an industrial-grade computing unit to support the system’s functions.

Licenced and ready to go
By acquiring the Eurasian Economic Union’s declaration of conformity, which ensures the system’s safety, Cognitive Rail Pilot is ready to start delivering its products in countries like Armenia, Kazakhstan and Belarus while more countries are about to follow.
“This declaration of conformity with the Eurasian Economic Union technical regulations requirements is the result of comprehensive tests of the Cognitive Rail Pilot system, that took place in 2021, and is an important step for the system’s further development and scaling,” says Uskova. Indeed the system underwent multiple tests in facilities belonging to the Russian Railways in which it succeeded. The tests included examining the software source code and testing hardware on dozens of parameters like electromagnetic compatibility, noise resistance, vibration resistance, compliance with climatic norms and resistance to moisture.

Photo: Vjeran PavicSocial media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an “AI supercomputer” — a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world’s fastest. “Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.” The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like Microsoft and Nvidia have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta’s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company’s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse — the company’s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.“RSC will help Meta’s AI researchers build new and better AI models”“RSC will help Meta’s AI researchers build new and better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds of different languages; seamlessly analyze text, images, and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and much more,” write Meta engineers Kevin Lee and Shubho Sengupta in a blog post outlining the news.  “We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together.”Meta’s AI supercomputer is due to be complete by mid-2022.  Image: MetaWork on RSC began a year and a half ago, with Meta’s engineers designing the machine’s various systems — cooling, power, networking, and cabling — entirely from scratch. Phase one of RSC is already up and running and consists of 760 Nvidia GGX A100 systems containing 6,080 connected GPUs (a type of processor that’s particularly good at tackling machine learning problems). Meta says it’s already providing up to 20 times improved performance on its standard machine vision research tasks. Before the end of 2022, though, phase two of RSC will be complete. At that point, it’ll contain some 16,000 total GPUs and will be able to train AI systems “with more than a trillion parameters on data sets as large as an exabyte.” (This raw number of GPUs only provides a narrow metric for a system’s overall performance, but, for comparison’s sake, Microsoft’s AI supercomputer built with research lab OpenAI is built from 10,000 GPUs.)These numbers are all very impressive, but they do invite the question: what is an AI supercomputer anyway? And how does it compare to what we usually think of as supercomputers — vast machines deployed by universities and governments to crunch numbers in complex domains like space, nuclear physics, and climate change?The two types of systems, known as high-performance computers or HPCs, are certainly more similar than they are different. Both are closer to datacenters than individual computers in size and appearance and rely on large numbers of interconnected processors to exchange data at blisteringly fast speeds. But there are key differences between the two, as HPC analyst Bob Sorensen of Hyperion Research explains to The Verge. “AI-based HPCs live in a somewhat different world than their traditional HPC counterparts,” says Sorensen, and the big distinction is all about accuracy. AI supercomputers and regular supercomputers can’t necessarily be compared apples to applesThe brief explanation is that machine learning requires less accuracy than the tasks put to traditional supercomputers, and so “AI supercomputers” (a bit of recent branding) can carry out more calculations per second than their regular brethren using the same hardware. That means when Meta says it’s built the “world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” it’s not necessarily a direct comparison to the supercomputers you often see in the news (rankings of which are compiled by the independent Top500.org and published twice a year). To explain this a little more, you need to know that both supercomputers and AI supercomputers make calculations using what is known as floating-point arithmetic — a mathematical shorthand that’s extremely useful for making calculations using very large and very small numbers (the “floating point” in question is the decimal point, which “floats” between significant figures). The degree of accuracy deployed in floating-point calculations can be adjusted based on different formats, and the speed of most supercomputers is calculated using what are known as 64-bit floating-point operations per second, or FLOPs. However, because AI calculations require less accuracy, AI supercomputers are often measured in 32-bit or even 16-bit FLOPs. That’s why comparing the two types of systems is not necessarily apples to apples, though this caveat doesn’t diminish the incredible power and capacity of AI supercomputers. Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.” In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple. An AI supercomputer offers the company raw power, but Meta still needs to find the winning strategy on its own.Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeTesla’s big, epic, confusing future | The Vergecast

",,,Why Does Artificial Intelligence Still Need Human Intervention?,,,,,"Even after its advancements, AI still needs human intervention for operations.In the modern tight labour market and hybrid work environment, organisations are increasingly turning towards AI to improve efficiency and productivity. Artificial intelligence has personalised customer experiences through the vast amounts of data generated through the various machine learning and data science tools. Overall, it has not only impacted our professional lives and has also deeply affected our personal lives. But even after such advancements in technology, AI still needs human intervention. Researchers and scientists are innovating new ways to automate activities in our daily lives, but AI still needs human intervention at its helm to perform efficiently. .Advanced technologies like self-driving cars, drones, flying robots, and such call for driverless operations. But enterprise AI needs third-party intervention to accurately perform and depend on humans for further instruction on operations. .So, why does AI still need human intervention?.Firstly, the idea that AI will make most of the workforce employed has got several researchers and scientists to develop such machines that will be handled by humans too. Automating processes will make operations error-free but it will make the human workforce obsolete. Besides, there are not enough experiments on human-robot collaboration models that will produce accurate results with the same efficiency to satisfy customers. .AI is best applied when it is both monitored and augmented by people. When that happens, people move up the skill continuum, take on more complex challenges while the AI continues to learn, improve, and keep in check the potentially harmful effects of AI. Using advanced models like conversational AI and cognitive AI in collaboration with real people who possess the expertise, ingenuity, and empathy, leads to more positive outcomes from the intelligent systems. .Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Already it is unleashing the power of data across a range of crucial functions such as customer service, marketing, training, pricing, security, surgeries, automobiles, and so on. To remain competitive, firms in nearly every industry will need to adopt AI. The role of AI in businesses has modified considerably from its preliminary creation on the threshold of an enterprise in their innovation labs to the modern-day, while human beings are starting to recognize that it has the ability to convert businesses from the center out..According to the reports, Artificial Intelligence will be better than human beings in translating languages by 2024, promoting items by 2031, and conducting surgical procedures by 2053. Businesses are using AI to enhance the productiveness of their employees. The advantage of AI for enterprise is that it handles repetitive tasks throughout an organization simply so that employees can focus on creative solutions, complicated problem solving, and impactful work. The idea of the workplace may also be redefined through the arrival of technology. The future work may be distinctly flexible. The concept of 'Work from Home' may be the brand-new norm and virtual meetings and conferences will be the normal practice. There are many AI Strategies that will help enterprises increase their revenue. These strategies will not just maximize the revenue but also it will help the businesses to reduce spending additional capital on many things such as cyber-attacks, repetitive tasks, and the list will go on. Here are the top AI strategies for businesses that will help your organization increase profits..TOP ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INTERNSHIPS TO APPLY FOR IN JAN 2022TOP AI AND DATA SCIENCE HACKATHONS TO APPLY FOR IN 2022THE FUTURE OF INDIAN POLICING WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN 2022 AND BEYOND .Top AI Strategies.AI as Risk Management.The AI collects actionable insights from numerous data reasserts and structures to assist with root motive evaluation. This will reduce attacks from outsiders and it will help the company to protect its data and crucial information..AutoML.The demand for AI skills has grown faster and it's difficult to imagine a business that wouldn't benefit from the detailed analysis of AI and machine learning algorithms performantly. It automates the process of applying machine learning techniques to data. Usually, a data scientist would spend their time on pre-processing, selecting features, selecting and tuning models, and then evaluating the results. AutoML will be able to automate tasks (such as preprocessing, selecting features, selecting and tuning models, evaluating results, etc.) and can provide high-performing results to certain problems..AI in Analyzing Problems.While data is the most appetizing target for every cyber-attack, companies can also use data against them via advanced data analytics consisting of machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), statistics visualization, and so forth. This will help enterprises from spending much on problem-solving or from robing business data..AI with Customers.Consumers usually look around and compare different options while purchasing. They even go through social media handles of businesses and demand special treatment. AI allows a business organization to get through such customers in a far-reaching manner. This allows a business to engage in a real-time, one-on-one conversation with consumers..Automation.Data automation is the process of uploading, handling, and processing data via automated tools, instead of manually performing all these tasks. It enables the organization to manage big data and innovate the pace of business. The data collected across an organization's business units, applications, and external sources is growing exponentially.  Big data is crucial for faster, more informed decision-making..AI as Workforce.The consensus amongst many specialists is that some professions might be definitely computerized. A group of senior-level tech executives who contain the Forbes Technology Council named 13, which include insurance underwriting, warehouse, and production jobs, consumer service, studies and information entry, long haul trucking, and a fairly disconcertingly wide class titled &quot;Any Tasks That Can Be Learned.&quot; Accountants, manufacturing unit employees, truckers, paralegals, and radiologists — simply to name a few..AI- Chatbots.Chatbots have been around for ages. But with the evolution of AI, chatbots have ended up being more in time-saving, process-efficiency-riding technology play..With time, chatbots at the moment are smarter with the aid of using distinctive features of understanding and experience, and its application. Responses from chatbots are consequently more meaningful, and the performance of communications with clients and people has improved..Chatbots can act as a scalable way for bridging the distance among people and management, with the aid of using making data more effortlessly available to people..Chatbots also are being used to survey people, in a real-time, issue-particular format. This is a notable improvement for the efficient checking out the group of workers pulse, employee engagement, and well-known place of job sentiment, a system that formerly could have taken weeks to complete. So, on this application, ability problems may be diagnosed and addressed earlier than they turn out to be the foremost troubles for the organization..AI- Writers.For instance, writing jobs. AI can effortlessly generate textual content which is indistinguishable from human writing. This form of AI job automation is helping enterprises to maximize their revenue. It's anticipated that robots don't tire, don't require payment, and may generate a vast quantity of content material..For example Ryte, Writesonic, Article Forge..AI- Support.This AI isn't restrained to writing. AI is likewise automating jobs in customer service, accounting, and a bunch of different professions. For instance, groups like Thankful, Yext, and Forethought use AI to automate client support. This shift is frequently imperceptible to the client, who doesn't recognize if they're talking to a biological intelligence or a machine. The upward push of AI-powered customer service has huge implications for the workforce. It's anticipated that 85 percent of client interactions are already dealt with without human interaction..AI in Increasing Productivity.It automates redundant tasks and helps in keeping workers happy also it has high computational power. Fear for job security often comes intertwined with mentioning AI in the context of the workplace. It has been predicted that AI will render various jobs redundant and replace half of the workforce by 2033. It will replace many jobs, but at the same time, it will create many new, more fulfilling jobs. While AI directly improves employee productivity by automating redundant and mundane tasks, it indirectly helps with increased work satisfaction in employees. AI tools have been deployed to analyze the emojis and certain keywords used on workplace communication platforms like Slack, so using these, you can subjectively gauge employee satisfaction in your workplace.AI is superior to its human counterpart when it comes to solving complex problems and recognizing patterns.

",,,The Role of AI in the Defence Sector,,,,,"A significant portion of the investment is being spent on AI in defence across countries.Artificial intelligence has infiltrated practically every civilian industry imaginable. It has changed the way people and businesses work, and it is now swiftly becoming a necessary component of modern combat..One of the criteria that determines how powerful a country is the strength of its army. When compared to other parts, investment in this industry is the largest in some of the most developed countries. A significant portion of this investment is dedicated to rigorous research and development in current technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) in military applications. AI-enabled military devices are able to efficiently handle large amounts of data. Furthermore, due to their enhanced computation and decision-making skills, such technologies have improved self-regulation, self-control, and self-actuation..Applications of AI in Defence.Training.Training and simulation are diverse fields that employ system and software engineering ideas to create models that can assist soldiers in training on different fighting systems used in actual military operations. Various sensor simulation programmes have already been launched by the US Navy and Army..Furthermore, augmented and VR technology techniques can be used to construct training simulations that are effective, authentic, and dynamic. Both virtual entities and human soldiers can benefit from the reinforcement tactics..Surveillance.AI combined with geospatial analysis can aid in the extraction of useful information from linked devices like radars and autonomous identification systems. This data can aid in the detection of any unlawful or suspicious activity, as well as alerting the appropriate authorities. Target recognition and classification can also be aided by AI-enabled robots and IoT-enabled computer vision..Ammunition and Arms.AI-enabled technology is now incorporated in new-age weaponry. Advanced missiles, for example, can estimate and examine the target level for kill zones without the need for human participation..Cybersecurity.After land, sea, and air, cyberspace is currently regarded as the third war front in military circles. A hacked and malevolent network might jeopardise the security of the entire region. Machine learning is being used by defence agencies to forecast and protect against unauthorised intrusions. In most cases, intrusion detection is accomplished by categorising the network as either normal or invasive. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques aid in improving the accuracy of such categorization..Logistics.Logistics is one of the most critical variables in determining whether or not a military mission succeeds. ML and geospatial analysis are integrated with military logistic systems to decrease effort, time, and error..Use of AI in Militaries Around World.Russia's military might is well-known around the world. The Foundations for Advanced Research Projects is the country's equivalent of DARPA in the United States. Top leaders have been observed promoting the development of AI-based technology for the military. According to reports, the Russian military is considering using AI, big data, and ML to conduct more effective information operations. Russia is currently investing extensively in artificial intelligence (AI) for the identification, analysis, and refutation of misinformation in both the commercial and defence sectors..India is also taking small measures to incorporate AI-based technology into its combat and surveillance projects. In reality, the Ministry of Defence formed a high-level Defence AI Council (DAIC) in 2019, tasked with delivering strategic direction for AI adoption in the defence sector. The major objective of the DAIC is to guide government-industry collaboration for the deployment of such breakthroughs..Conclusion.One of the primary challenges with deploying AI-based technologies is the financial and expertise investment required. How much can we afford to fund infrastructure capabilities for constructing such technologies, especially in middle-income nations like India, where a large portion of the population is still living in poverty, is a huge challenge. The conceivable solution is for policymakers to determine which AI programmes are required for national security and to strive toward them..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
