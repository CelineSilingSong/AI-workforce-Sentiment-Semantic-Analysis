In the last decade, artificial intelligence has matured from a novel, fast-emerging technology to one embraced by every industry around the globe. And in the last few years, workplaces have increasingly become remote or hybrid, accelerating the amount of data being created, consumed, and scrutinized daily.
But remote work has made quick in-person communication more challenging, causing many traditional organizational practices to fumble. Workers increasingly rely on a growing amount of data accessed, processed, and organized across networks.
These trends have prompted companies to rely on technologies like AI to bring workers together and help managers lead them more effectively.
As the CEO and co-founder of Katana Graph – and having spent decades in academia before that – I’ve seen how AI has flourished, thanks largely to the vast amounts of data being accumulated worldwide. Most of this data is unstructured, providing a clear need – and opportunity – to better understand the relationships between the entities in these data troves and to analyze them quickly for tangible and actionable insights.
Here are three examples of how organizations can reap the benefits of AI technology.
1. Making remote work more seamless
In a survey of 1,000 employees a few years ago, 49 percent had difficulty finding documents. Further, IDC found that employees spend five hours a week searching for documents on average. Unfortunately, with the increase in remote and hybrid workplaces, some argue the problem has worsened.

How can AI help? AI can analyze workflows and collaboration tools to provide more streamlined and efficient processes. A recent piece on modernizing work through digital collaboration discussed remote employees’ desire for improved connectivity with their colleagues. Here are just a few ways companies can use AI to improve workflow and collaboration:

Enterprise-grade digital assistants with conversational AI help make meetings a zero-touch experience
Distributed collaboration for colleagues with greater contextual insight than in-person meetings, such as surfacing background material online without performing searches.
Embedded cross-product AI functionality to identify details of the last conversation in a meeting. Alternatively, AI can transcribe meetings and distribute a voice-searchable version to those not in attendance.

2. Funneling data to improve workplace training
Strong leaders and remote workers realize the importance of skills and training in today’s competitive job market. Training is one of the best ways to manage remote workforces. In my experience, AI can help significantly in this area, particularly when leaders harness the power of machine learning.
Some organizations are already incorporating the power of AI into skills training and other employee development initiatives. For example, they’re using no-code software platforms to contextually guide new employees on how to use systems, minimizing the need for workshop-styling training. The shift to remote and hybrid work has increased the use of tools that help employees complete training more independently, with fewer meetings or workshops.
To be effective, AI must use information that will produce the best results. Human-in-the-loop systems are a critical part of any competitive advantage and are necessary for any socially responsible artificial intelligence/machine learning system. Human ingenuity must be deeply embedded into intelligent systems.
3. Ensuring quality service
A third area to harness the power of AI is with your customers. AI can help unite your workers toward a common goal: to uphold customer satisfaction through quality business performance and improved customer insights. Ultimately, this is a key element of how AI can support business growth.

Is AI becoming the new customer service agent? It is certainly helping organizations of all sizes improve customer satisfaction. Companies can use AI to provide employees with insights from customer service data that enable them to improve their processes.
AI’s data analysis is also useful in the financial sector, where it helps safeguard customers’ assets and improve customer service. By monitoring a checkpoint system that verifies transactions, AI can flag fraud in real-time, protecting customers’ funds and boosting satisfaction. Furthermore, the transaction data can help institutions better understand their customers.
AI can help organizations unite workers around common goals and improve operational efficiencies. By focusing on key areas for remote workers, AI systems can analyze huge amounts of data and provide actionable insights that help employees succeed – no matter where they physically work.

DeepMind's protein-folding AI cracks biology's biggest problem
Artificial intelligence firm DeepMind has transformed biology by predicting the structure of nearly all proteins known to science in just 18 months, a breakthrough that will speed drug development and revolutionise basic science

Predicting the structure of proteins is one of the grand challenges of biologyDeepMind
DeepMind has predicted the structure of almost every protein so far catalogued by science, cracking one of the grand challenges of biology in just 18 months thanks to an artificial intelligence called AlphaFold. Researchers say that the work has already led to advances in combating malaria, antibiotic resistance and plastic waste, and could speed up the discovery of new drugs.
Determining the crumpled shapes of proteins based on their sequences of constituent amino acids has been a persistent problem for decades in biology. Some of these amino acids are attracted to others, some are repelled by water, and the chains form intricate shapes that are hard to accurately determine.
Thinking long-term to save the world  Martin Rees at New Scientist Live this October
UK-based AI company DeepMind first announced it had developed a method to accurately predict the structure of folded proteins in late 2020, and by the middle of it 2021 it had revealed that it had mapped 98.5 per cent of the proteins used within the human body.Advertisement
Today, the company announced that it is publishing the structures of more than 200 million proteins – nearly all of those catalogued on the globally recognised repository of protein research, UniProt.
DeepMind has worked with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) to create a searchable store of all this information that can be easily and freely accessed by researchers around the world. Ewan Birney at EMBL-EBI calls the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database “a gift to humanity”.
“As someone who’s been in genomics and computational biology since the 1990s, I’ve seen many of these moments come where you can sense the landscape shifting under you and the provision of new resources, and this has been one of the fastest,” he says. “I mean, two years ago, we just simply did not realise that this was feasible.”
Already delivering results
Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind, says that the database makes finding a protein structure – which previously often took years – “almost as easy as doing a Google search”. DeepMind is owned by Alphabet, Google’s parent company.
The archive has already been used by scientists to advance research in a number of areas. Matt Higgins at the University of Oxford and his colleagues were researching a protein that they believed was key to interrupting the lifecycle of the malaria parasite, but were struggling to map its structure.
“One of the experimental methods that we use is X-ray crystallography,” says Higgins. “We cause the proteins to form into lattices, fire X-rays at them and get information from those X-ray diffraction patterns to see what the molecule looks like. But we were never able, despite many years of work, to see in sufficient detail what this molecule looks like.”
 Demis Hassabis interview: Our AI will unlock secrets of how life worksDeepMind's co-founder says artificial intelligence is set to crack many of the toughest problems in science, from the nature of life to nuclear fusion 
But when AlphaFold was released, it gave a clear prediction of the structure of the protein that matched the information the researchers had been able to glean. They have now been able to design new proteins that they hope could serve as an effective malarial vaccine.
Birney says that using X-ray crystallography to map the structure of a protein is expensive and time-consuming. “That means that experimentalists have to make choices about what they do, and AlphaFold hasn’t had to make choices,” he says. “I think we can be confident that there are new experiments and new insights coming through due to AlphaFold, which will impact ‘how does this particular parasite work’ or ‘why does this particular disease happen in humans’, for example.”
Researchers have also used AlphaFold to engineer new enzymes to break down plastic waste and to learn more about the proteins that make bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
Work still to be done
Keith Willison at Imperial College London says that AlphaFold has unarguably “changed the world” of biological research, but that there are still problems to be solved in protein folding.
“As soon as AlphaFold came out it was wonderful. You just take your favourite proteins and look them up now rather than having to make crystals,” he says. “I did the crystallographic structure of a protein complex, it took me about eight years. People are joking that crystallographers are going to be unemployed.”
 AI firm DeepMind solves human protein structuresIn July, DeepMind announced that its AlphaFold model had worked out how most of the proteins in our bodies fold. Pushmeet Kohli tells New Scientist that there is more to come 
But Willison points out that AlphaFold isn’t able to take any arbitrary string of amino acids and model exactly how they fold. Instead, it is only able to use parts of proteins and their structures that have been experimentally determined to predict how a new protein will fold.
While the tool is often, even usually, extremely accurate, its structures are always predictions rather than explicitly calculated results. Nor has AlphaFold yet solved the complex interactions between proteins, or even made a dent in a small subset of structures, known as intrinsically disordered proteins, that seem to have unstable and unpredictable folding patterns.
“Once you discover one thing, then there are more problems thrown up,” says Willison. “It’s quite terrifying actually, how complicated biology is.”
Tomek Wlodarski at University College London says that AlphaFold has had an enormous impact on many areas of biology, but that there are improvements to be made on accuracy, and that developing a model of how proteins fold – not just predicting their final structure – is a problem that DeepMind is yet to tackle.
Wlodarski says AlphaFold isn’t perfect, although it does indicate which parts of a prediction have a high accuracy and which it is less confident in.
 Hybrid AI: A new way to make machine minds that really think like usIn the quest to make artificial intelligence that can reason and apply knowledge flexibly, many researchers are focused on fresh insights from neuroscience. Should they be looking to psychology too? 
“We introduced a mutation, which we know experimentally completely unfolds the protein, but AlphaFold gave me the same structure as it gave without this mutation,” he says. “I did another test: I was removing residues from one end of the protein, because we know that with our protein, if you chop nine residues from one of the ends it will completely unfold the protein. And I managed to chop half of the protein sequence, and the algorithm still predicted it as a completely folded protein with exactly the same structure. So there are these problems.”
Pushmeet Kohli, who leads DeepMind’s scientific team, says that the company isn’t done with proteins yet and is working to improve the accuracy and capabilities of AlphaFold.
“We know the static structure of proteins, but that’s not where the game ends,” he says. ‘We want to understand how these proteins behave, what their dynamics are, how they interact with other proteins. Then there’s the other area of genomics where we want to understand how the recipe of life translates into which proteins are created, when are they created and the working of a cell.”

What is the place of artificial intelligence in financial auditing practices?

A financial audit allows you to make a detailed assessment of the financial accounts of a company, and the largest companies are required to do one every year. AI, with its great computing power, can be a very useful tool for the auditor’s job. The Master CARF (Control Audit and Financial Reporting) of the University of Paris Dauphine-PSL and the Business Risk Services team of Grant Thornton have joined forces to conduct the study on “The place of artificial intelligence in audit practices.”

As companies face ever-increasing compliance requirements, auditors’ assignments are becoming increasingly diversified, whether they are internal or external.
The survey
The survey was conducted over the past year: 120 internal and external auditors responded to the survey, 2/3 of which were internal:

Almost 90% of them work in large or very large companies (53%);
Half of the companies are listed;
The main sectors of activity represented are Industry, Banking and Services.

The vast majority of these 120 auditors had more than 3 years of seniority in the function and the majority of the 120 came from Masters in management and auditing (CCA or others), followed by business schools (BAC + 5).
A widespread but classic use of AI

The most widespread AI tools are the following:


Data visualization tools: 2/3 of the respondents use data visualization tools, 49% use
Data Visualization tools: 2/3 of respondents use data visualization tools, 49% of them frequently;
Data analysis tools “embedding” generic controls pre-configured by the editor: half of the respondents already use these tools;
Data analysis tools that allow you to parameterize controls and develop your own scripts: almost half of the respondents parameterize.

Only 5% of companies use drones, often for inventories, 16% use robots and 40% use machine learning.
Summary of the use of AI tools for audit practices

Nearly 60% of auditors thus reported using at least one of the AI-based tools while 13% never used any. The simplest ones are the most used: while 50% use data analysis tools, only 3% use bots on a regular basis, 11% use machine learning technologies and 13% use visual recognition tools.
These AI tools are primarily used to:

 The control of the Accounting Entry File;
 Data reconciliation;
 Search for anomalies or atypicals;
Sampling.

The main barriers to the development and use of AI-related tools in auditing

For 63% of respondents, the main obstacles are financial and technical.
The technical obstacles are important:

73% of respondents believe that the use of these tools requires a significant investment of time to
73% of respondents believe that the use of these tools requires a significant investment of time in order to fully understand the company’s data architecture and the operation of computerized processes;
66% that the lack of IS skills among auditors is an obstacle;
65% that auditors’ lack of knowledge about the possibilities offered by data is a hindrance;
69% that access to data is problematic.

More efficient audits

When asked about the opportunities brought by AI, 84% felt it brought an increase in the reliability of work and conclusions, including:

Improving the efficiency of tests for 94% of auditors;
Optimizing test sampling for 91%;
For risk coverage for 89%;
For the relevance of the audit plan and risk identification for 79%;
AI tools facilitate auditing and increase the scope of work that can be done remotely for 65%;
They enable continuous audit development for 78%.

Regarding the writing of audit reports, only external auditors seem to see it as an opportunity.
The auditor of tomorrow will not be a robot
Respondents to the survey believe that their job will not be disrupted by the development of AI. For 89% of them, the auditor of tomorrow will have to have a serious culture of data analysis and 96% are certain that it will not be a robot!

Why you can trust Sky News


The artificial intelligence company DeepMind has announced a major medical scientific breakthrough in determining the structures of almost 200 million proteins.Proteins are not two dimensional molecules, but have chemical properties that are determined by their three-dimensional shape -- but figuring out these shapes is an intensive process.

The breakthrough has significant repercussions for medicine, and the new research by Google-backed DeepMind is hailed as having ""the potential to dramatically increase our understanding of biology"".A protein is created by a chain of amino acids, but without knowing how these chains are connected it isn't possible to know how they interact with human cells and can be modified.Last year DeepMind, which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, shared the fruits of an AI system called AlphaFold which could predict the 3D structure of a protein from its single-dimensional amino acid sequence.





A year earlier, PC gamers had been asked to donate some of their computing power to an international effort researching diseases including COVID-19 and Alzheimer's to simulate the molecular dynamics of protein folding.It's such a crucial topic for medical science because the structure of proteins determine chemical reactions in human cells, and by extension and in aggregate, the whole human body - but, until now, only a fraction of protein structures were known.

Fountain was a urinal, bought from a toilet supplier, with the signature R. Mutt on its side in black paint. Duchamp wanted to see if the society would abide by its promise to accept submissions without censorship or favor. (It did not.) But Duchamp was also looking to broaden the notion of what art is, saying a ready-made object in the right context would qualify. In 1962, Andy Warhol would twist convention with Campbell’s Soup Cans, 32 paintings of soup cans, each one a different flavor. Then, as before, the debate raged about if something mechanically produced – a urinal, or a soup can (albeit hand-painted by Warhol) – counted as art, and what that meant.Now, the debate has been turned upon its head, as machines can mass-produce unique pieces of art on their own. Generative Artificial Intelligences (GAIs) are systems which create pieces of work that can equal the old masters in technique, if not in intent. But there is a problem, since these systems are trained on existing material, often using content pulled from the internet, from us. Is it right, then, that the AIs of the future are able to produce something magical on the backs of our labor, potentially without our consent or compensation?The new frontierThe most famous GAI right now is DALL-E 2, Open AI’s system for creating “realistic images and art from a description in natural language.” A user could enter the phrase “teddy bears shopping for groceries in the style of Ukiyo-e,” and the model will produce pictures in that style. Similarly, ask for the bears to be shopping in Ancient Egypt and the images will look more like dioramas from a museum depicting life under the Pharaohs. To the untrained eye, some of these pictures look like they were drawn in 17th-century Japan, or shot at a museum in the 1980s. And these results are coming despite the technology still being at a relatively early stage.Open AI recently announced that DALL-E 2 would be made available to up to one million users as part of a large-scale beta test. Each user will be able to make 50 generations for free during their first month of use, and then 15 for every subsequent month. (A generation is either the production of four images from a single prompt, or the creation of three more if you choose to edit or vary something that’s already been produced.) Additional 115-credit packages can be bought for $15, and the company says more detailed pricing is likely to come as the product evolves. Crucially, users are entitled to commercialize the images produced with DALL-E, letting them print, sell or otherwise license the pictures borne from their prompts. Open AIThese systems did not, however, develop an eye for a good picture in a vacuum, and each GAI has to be trained. Artificial Intelligence is, after all, a fancy term for what is essentially a way of teaching software how to recognize patterns. “You allow an algorithm to develop that can be improved through experience,” said Ben Hagag, head of research at Darrow, an AI startup looking to improve access to justice. “And by experience I mean examining and finding patterns in data.” “We say to the [system] ‘take a look at this dataset and find patterns,” which then go on to form a coherent view of the data at hand. “The model learns as a baby learns,” he said, so if a baby looked at a 1,000 pictures of a landscape, it would soon understand that the sky – normally oriented across the top of the image – would be blue while land is green.Hagag cited how Google built its language model by training a system on several gigabytes of text, from the dictionary to examples of the written word. “The model understood the patterns, how the language is built, the syntax and even the hidden structure that even linguists find hard to define,” Hagag said. Now that model is sophisticated enough that “once you give it a few words, it can predict the next few words you’re going to write.” In 2018, Google’s Ajit Varma told The Wall Street Journal that its smart reply feature had been trained on “billions of Gmail messages,” adding that initial tests saw options like ‘I Love You’ and ‘Sent from my iPhone’ offered up since they were so commonly seen in communications.Developers who do not have the benefit of access to a data set as vast as Google’s need to find data via other means. “Every researcher developing a language model first downloads Wikipedia then adds more,” Hagag said. He added that they are likely to pull down any, and every, piece of available data that they can find. The sassy tweet you sent a few years ago, or that sincere Facebook post, may have been used to train someone’s language model, somewhere. Even Open AI uses social media posts with WebText, a dataset which pulls text from outbound Reddit links which received at least three karma, albeit with Wikipedia references removed.Guan Wang, CTO of Huski, says that the pulling down of data is “very common.” “Open internet data is the go-to for the majority of AI model training nowadays,” he said. And that it’s the policy of most researchers to get as much data as they can. “When we look for speech data, we will get whatever speech we can get,” he added. This policy of more data-is-more is known to produce less than ideal results, and Ben Hagag cited Riley Newman, former head of data science at Airbnb, who said “better data beats more data,” but Hagag notes that often, “it’s easier to get more data than it is to clean it.” Craiyon / Daniel CooperDALL-E may now be available to a million users, but it’s likely that people’s first experience of a GAI is with its less-fancy sibling. Craiyon, formerly DALL-E Mini, is the brainchild of French developer Boris Dayma, who started work on his model after reading Open AI’s original DALL-E paper. Not long after, Google and the AI development community HuggingFace ran a hackathon for people to build quick-and-dirty machine learning models. “I suggested, ‘Hey, let’s replicate DALL-E. I have no clue how to do that, but let’s do it,” said Dayma. The team would go on to win the competition, albeit with a rudimentary, rough-around-the-edges version of the system. “The image [it produced] was clear. It wasn’t great, but it wasn’t horrible,” he added. But unlike the full-fat DALL-E, Dayma’s team was focused on slimming the model down so that it could work on comparatively low-powered hardware.Dayma’s original model was fairly open about which image sets it would pull from, often with problematic consequences. “In early models, still in some models, you ask for a picture – for example mountains under the snow,” he said, “and then on top of it, the Shutterstock or Alamy watermark.” It’s something many AI researchers have found, with GAIs being trained on those image libraries public-facing image catalogs, which are covered in anti-piracy watermarks.Dayma said that the model had erroneously learned that high-quality landscape images typically had a watermark from one of those public photo libraries, and removed them from his model. He added that some early results also output not-safe-for-work responses, forcing him to make further refinements to his initial training set. Dayma added that he had to do a lot of the sorting through the data himself, and said that “a lot of the images on the internet are bad.”Got sent some moody Russian ruDall-E GAN images last week from my dev piotr, that had shutterstock logos generated in them, oh how we laughed....now looks like the real Dall-E is doing the same... pic.twitter.com/6A2yLFHelw— @amoebadesign (@amoebadesign) June 8, 2022But it’s not just Dayma who has noticed the regular appearance of a Shutterstock watermark, or something a lot like it, popping up in AI-generated art. Which begs the question, are people just ripping off Shutterstock’s public-facing library to train their AI? It appears that one of the causes is Google, which has indexed a whole host of watermarked Shutterstock images as part of its Conceptual Captions framework. Delve into the data, and you’ll see a list of image URLs which can be used to train your own AI model, thousands of which are from Shutterstock. Shutterstock declined to comment on the practice for this article.Several results from the bigger GAN models, like StyleGAN are even able to recreate the watermark on images from certain websites, namely @Shutterstock It looks like hardly anyone doing ML really cares about privacy or copyright at the moment pic.twitter.com/ADrKzzOzMH— A Wojcicki (@pretendsmarts) March 16, 2019A Google spokesperson said that they don’t “believe this is an issue for the datasets we’re involved with.” They also quoted from this Creative Commons report, saying that “the use of works to train AI should be considered non-infringing by default, assuming that access to the copyright works was lawful at the point of input.” That is despite the fact that Shutterstock itself expressly forbids visitors to its site from using “any data mining, robots or similar data and/or image gathering and extraction methods in connection with the site or Shutterstock content.”https://t.co/j6uDEuFgMnYou got to love how the GAN has the shutterstick watermark trained it and tries hard to put it into the image. Also apparently a certain subset of images of horses have all the shutterstock address placed in the same position on the bottom. pic.twitter.com/I7iW1kcuYz— datenwolf – @datenwolf@chaos.social (@datenwolf) January 9, 2021Alex Cardinell, CEO at AI startup Article Forge, says that he sees no issue with models being trained on copyrighted texts, “so long as the material itself was lawfully acquired and the model does not plagiarize the material.” He compared the situation to a student reading the work of an established author, who may “learn the author’s styles or patterns, and later find applicable places to reuse those concepts.” He added that so long as a model isn’t “copying and pasting from their training data,” then it simply repeats a pattern that has appeared since the written word began.Dayma says that, at present, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people are playing with his system on a daily basis. That all incurs a cost, both for hosting and processing, which he couldn’t sustain from his own pocket for very long, especially since it remains a “hobby.” Consequently, the site runs ads at the top and bottom of its page, between which you’ll get a grid of nine surreal images. “For people who use the site commercially, we could always charge for it,” he suggested. But he admitted his knowledge of US copyright law wasn’t detailed enough to be able to discuss the impact of his own model, or others in the space. This is the situation that Open AI also perhaps finds itself dealing with given that it is now allowing users to sell pictures created by DALL-E.The law of artThe legal situation is not a particularly clear one, especially not in the US, where there have been few cases covering Text and Data Mining, or TDM. This is the technical term for the training of an AI by plowing through a vast trove of source material looking for patterns. In the US, TDM is broadly covered by Fair Use, which permits various forms of copying and scanning for the purposes of allowing access. This isn’t, however, a settled subject, but there is one case that people believe sets enough of a precedent to enable the practice.Authors Guild v. Google (2015) was brought by a body representing authors, which accused Google of digitizing printed works that were still held under copyright. The initial purpose of the work was, in partnership with several libraries, to catalog and database the texts to make research easier. Authors, however, were concerned that Google was violating copyright, and even if it wasn’t making the text of a still-copyrighted work available publicly, it was prohibited from scanning and storing it in the first place. Eventually, the Second Circuit ruled in favor of Google, saying that digitizing copyright-protected work did not constitute copyright infringement.Rahul Telang is Professor of Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University, and an expert in digitization and copyright. He says that the issue is “multi-dimensional,” and that the Google Books case offers a “sort of precedent” but not a solid one. “I wish I could tell you there was a clear answer,” he said, “but it’s a complicated issue,” especially around works that may or may not be transformative. And until there is a solid case, it’s likely that courts will apply the usual tests for copyright infringement, around if a work supplants the need for the original, and if it causes economic harm to the original rights holder. Telang believes that countries will look to loosen restrictions on TDM wherever possible in order to boost domestic AI research.The US Copyright Office says that it will register an “original work of authorship, provided that the work was created by a human being.” This is due to the old precedent that the only thing worth copyrighting is “the fruits of intellectual labor,” produced by the “creative powers of the mind.” In 1991, this principle was affirmed by a case of purloined listings from one phone book company by another. The Supreme Court held that while effort may have gone into the compilation of a phone book, the information contained therein was not an original work, created by a human being, and so therefore couldn’t be copyrighted. It will be interesting to see if there are any challenges made to users trying to license or sell a DALL-E work for this very reason.Rob Holmes, a private investigator who works on copyright and trademark infringement with many major tech companies and fashion brands, believes that there is a reticence across the industry to pursue a landmark case that would settle the issue around TDM and copyright. “Legal departments get very little money,” he said. “All these different brands, and everyone’s waiting for the other brand, or IP owner, to begin the lawsuit. And when they do, it’s because some senior VP or somebody at the top decided to spend the money, and once that happens, there’s a good year of planning the litigation.” That often gives smaller companies plenty of time to either get their house in order, get big enough to be worth a lawsuit or go out of business.“Setting a precedent as a sole company costs a lot of money,” Holmes said, but brands will move fast if there’s an immediate risk to profitability. Designer brand Hermés, for instance, is suing an artist named Mason Rothschild, who is producing MetaBirkins NFTs. These are styled images on a design reminiscent of Hermés’ famous Birkin handbag, something the French fashion house says is nothing more than an old-fashioned rip-off. This, too, is likely to have ramifications for the industry as it wrestles with philosophical questions of what work is sufficiently transformational as to prevent an accusation of piracy.Artists are also able to upload their own work to DALL-E and then generate recreations in their own style. I spoke to one artist, who asked not to be named or otherwise described for fear of being identified and suffering reprisals. They showed me examples of their work alongside recreations made by DALLl-E, which while crude, were still close enough to look like the real thing. They said that, on this evidence alone, their livelihood as a working artist is at risk, and that the creative industries writ large are “doomed.”Article Forge CEO Alex Cardinell says that this situation, again, has historical precedent with the industrial revolution. He says that, unlike then, society has a collective responsibility to “make sure that anyone who is displaced is adequately supported.” And that anyone in the AI space should be backing a “robust safety net,” including “universal basic income and free access to education,” which he says is the “bare minimum” a society in the midst of such a revolution should offer.Trained on your dataAIs are already in use. Microsoft, for instance, partnered with OpenAI to harness GPT-3 as a way to build code. In 2021, the company announced that it would integrate the system into its low-code app-development platform to help people build apps and tools for Microsoft products. Duolingo uses the system to improve people’s French grammar, while apps like Flowrite employs it to help make writing blog posts and emails easier and faster. Midjourney, a DALL-E 2-esque GAI for art, which has recently opened up its beta, is capable of producing stunning illustrated art – with customers charged between $10-50 a month if they wish to produce more images or use those pictures commercially.For now, that’s something Craiyon doesn't necessarily need to worry about, since the resolution is presently so low. “People ask me ‘why is the model bad on faces’, not realizing that the model is equally good – or bad – at everything,” Dayma said. “It’s just that, you know, when you draw a tree, if the leaves are messed up you don’t care, but when the faces or eyes are, we put more attention on it.” This will, however, take time both to improve the model, and to improve the accessibility of computing power capable of producing the work. Dayma believes that despite any notion of low quality, any GAI will need to be respectful of “the applicable laws,” and that it shouldn’t be used for “harmful purposes.”And artificial intelligence isn’t simply a toy, or an interesting research project, but something that has already caused plenty of harm. Take Clearview AI, a company that scraped several billion images, including from social media platforms, to build what it claims is a comprehensive image recognition database. According to The New York Times, this technology was used by billionaire John Catsimatidis to identify his daughter’s boyfriend. BuzzFeed News reported that Clearview has offered access not just to law enforcement – its supposed corporate goal – but to a number of figures associated with the far right. The system has also proved less than reliable, with The Times reporting that it has led to a number of wrongful arrests.Naturally, the ability to synthesize any image without the need for a lot of photoshopping should raise alarm. Deepfakes, a system that uses AI to replace someone’s face in a video has already been used to produce adult content featuring celebrities. As quickly as companies making AIs can put in guardrails to prevent adult-content prompts, it’s likely that loopholes will be found. And as open-source research and development becomes more prevalent, it’s likely that other platforms will be created with less scrupulous aims. Not to mention the risk of this technology being used for political ends, given the ease of creating fake imagery that could be used for propaganda purposes.Of course, Duchamp and Warhol may have stretched the definitions of what art can be, but they did not destroy art in and of itself. It would be a mistake to suggest that automating image generation will inevitably lead to the collapse of civilization. But it’s worth being cautious about the effects on artists, who may find themselves without a living if it’s easier to commission a GAI to produce something for you. Not to mention the implication for what, and how, these systems are creating material for sale on the backs of our data. Perhaps it is time that we examined if it’s necessary to implement a way of protecting our material – something equivalent to Do Not Track – to prevent it being chewed up and crunched through the AI sausage machine.This article contains affiliate links; if you click such a link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission.",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,,Is DALL-E's art borrowed or stolen?,,2022-07-27T16:00:34.000Z,2022-07-27T16:00:34.000Z,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PKomDU0VviFq3cJpC3Yaew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-07/4ed15320-0dbb-11ed-b7e6-11c306c45127', 'width': 1200, 'height': 600}",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PKomDU0VviFq3cJpC3Yaew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-07/4ed15320-0dbb-11ed-b7e6-11c306c45127,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Engadget', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://s.yimg.com/kw/assets/engadget-amp-280x60.png', 'width': 280, 'height': 60}, 'url': 'https://www.engadget.com'}",,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Daniel Cooper', 'url': 'https://www.engadget.com/about/editors/daniel-cooper/', 'jobTitle': 'Senior Editor'}",https://www.engadget.com/dall-e-generative-ai-tracking-data-privacy-160034656.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Daniel Cooper', 'url': 'https://www.engadget.com/about/editors/daniel-cooper/', 'jobTitle': 'Senior Editor'}","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Engadget', 'url': 'https://www.engadget.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 313, 'height': 100, 'url': 'https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/b1da0f90-244a-11eb-bfaf-e0fb13dde404'}}",,,,,,,,

In Sept. 2020, The Guardian published an opinion piece written by a program. The artificial intelligence, called GPT-3, is a large language model developed by OpenAI, and it posed a bold question in the headline of its machine-generated text: “A robot wrote this entire article. Are you scared yet, human?” 
Indeed, it is a scary time to be a professional writer. Earlier in 2020, Microsoft laid off journalists to replace them with a writing AI. And as AI language models get increasingly better, researchers are claiming that soon, AI-generated text will be indistinguishable from that written by a person.
Our research team at the University of British Columbia investigated what the rise of AI means to human writers. Specifically, we tried to understand what human writers expect from AI, and where the boundaries lie when it comes to writing work.
We interviewed seven hobbyists and 13 professional writers, using a design fiction approach. We first showed the writers different speculative designs of futuristic AI writers. We then asked them to reflect on how co-writing with an AI would transform their practice and perception of writing.
We found that writers wanted AIs to respect the personal values they attribute to writing. These personal values being: emotional values and productivity.
Emotions and productivity
Hobbyists in our study said they find joy in the writing process, referring to the act of writing as a “labour of love.” When considering scenarios where using AI would make them more productive, hobbyists weren’t interested in using the advanced writing technology if it displaced what it means to be a writer.
The writers attributed three different kinds of emotional values to writing. Some writers wanted to claim ownership over the words they wrote and were concerned that co-writing with an AI meant that the text wouldn’t be considered entirely their own. Other writers attributed a sense of integrity to the act of writing, and said using AI would be “like cheating.” Others just enjoyed the process of turning their ideas into words.
By contrast, for professional writers, writing was means of living. If it could make them more prolific, they were open to using AI writers and assigning parts of their job to the robot writers. The professional writers envisioned themselves using AI as a ghostwriter who could realize their ideas into written pieces. To some extent, professional writers were willing to compromise their emotional values in exchange for productivity.



Professional writers were more open to using AI to help them write if it meant being able to increase their productivity, and therefore their income.

Some writers trusted that AI would do a good job in simple writing tasks like making stylistic improvements, rephrasing and proofreading. But they didn’t have much faith in AI’s capacity for creative writing tasks, such as planning a narrative flow and setting up the backgrounds of key characters in the story.
When presented with other speculative scenarios, writers would agree to outsource writing tasks only when their trust in AI supersedes their own self-confidence.
A good ghostwriter
Our study implies an ideal AI writing tool should behave like a human collaborator and that such a tool needs to be aware of the boundaries of human writers and respond by adjusting the level of intervention and writing style accordingly.
Writing with AI can leave writers with energy and time for the creative side of the writing process. Ideally, our entrepreneurial drive would not completely displace humans from our creative endeavours.

Though it has been thought to be the future of technology, artificial intelligence is still a work in progress and there are different opinions on how AI should be humanized. In this article, we will try to understand what AI is, how it works and if humans should integrate it into their daily lives or not.What is Artificial Intelligence?Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. AI is used in many fields and has become an important part of everyday life, from self-driving cars to Netflix recommending movies for you.AIs can be divided into two categories: supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning refers to training an AI using data from its environment; this type of AI will use example inputs (i.e., images or words) as well as labels (i.e., correct answers) to improve itself over time until it reaches its goal state — for example, recognizing objects or performing actions such as opening doors automatically when needed by humans or computers alike via command lines running alongside each other on separate computers connected together via networks like Ethernet cables (think “The Matrix”). Unsupervised learning involves letting algorithms explore complex datasets without any prior information on what they might learn while generating their own solutions based on inputting random numbers into their programs instead of relying solely upon pre-existing information provided by humans who may have already done similar work previously before becoming obsolete due mainly because there isn’t enough money available within government funding mechanisms such as grants given out annually through programs like National Science Foundation (NSF), etc.How to Humanize AI?Humanizing AI is a process that involves the use of human beings, technology, data, and processes. Humanization can be achieved by making an AI system more personable by adding some human elements. The main objective behind this process is to make sure that people feel comfortable interacting with artificial intelligence systems so that they don’t feel like machines or robots are talking to them. There are several methods to achieve this goal:Adding human faces/voices into your chatbot or virtual assistant will help you build trust with your customers and improve their experience when using your product/service. This also helps in retaining users because they see themselves as part of a community where everyone has their own voice and opinion which makes them feel like part of something bigger than just buying something online! You should always remember that humans aren’t perfect beings but they do have good qualities too (like kindness) so try putting those qualities into every aspect of your business model!Benefits of Humanizing AIAs a result, humanizing AI can help you:Increase trust in the technology. When people feel that they are being treated fairly and respectfully, they are more likely to adopt something new. This increases adoption and also makes it easier for customers to interact with your brand because they know what to expect from you — and it’s more likely that they’ll stay loyal enough not only for current needs but also for future ones as well.Increase innovation in your company by allowing employees more autonomy over work tasks which could lead them down new paths of research or discovery that may benefit all parties involved (including yourself).Improve profitability through increased productivity due to less downtime caused by error aversion among staff members who trust each other enough not only during normal operations but also when dealing with emergencies like fires breaking out etcetera.Humanizing AI also leads to many other benefits including increased sustainability as well as safety and security in your workplace. It ensures compliance with laws that require employers to protect workers from discrimination based on race, gender identity orientation etcetera so you can be sure that all employees receive equal treatment regardless of who they are or how they identify themselves.We have to humanize AI if we want the technology to be a part of our future.We have to humanize AI if we want the technology to be a part of our future. We need to control AI, trust it and understand it. The current systems are not able to do this because they are unable or unwilling to communicate with humans on an equal basis. Humans want more than just data from artificial intelligence; they want human interaction as well and if you look at how businesses use artificial intelligence today then you will see that most companies have adopted a robotic approach where machines take over manual tasks such as banking or ordering food from restaurants but still expect humans (or their employees) to interact with these machines in some way shape or form so that they can learn more about their customers’ needs by asking questions like: “what movies do you like?” or “What is your favorite restaurant?”ConclusionHumanizing AI may be one of the most important things we can do to ensure a safe and prosperous future. We should all work together to make this vision a reality by investing in R&D, education and training programs, and other initiatives that will help us build relationships with our machines.",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://becominghuman.ai/humanizing-artificial-intelligence-an-approach-towards-future-c23a75d10fa5,Humanizing Artificial Intelligence: An Approach Towards Future,,2022-07-28T03:47:42.369Z,2022-07-29T01:48:16.245Z,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/0*H92drsF_4G1Dc4i_.jpg'],,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ghulam Mustafa Shoaib', 'url': 'https://becominghuman.ai/@ghulam.mustafa01'}",https://becominghuman.ai/humanizing-artificial-intelligence-an-approach-towards-future-c23a75d10fa5,,,,,,,,,,2022-07-28T03:47:42.369Z,Humanizing Artificial Intelligence: An Approach Towards Future,,,,,,,,['Ghulam Mustafa Shoaib'],,,,,,,c23a75d10fa5,,

The ability to internalize real-world circumstances and transmit thought into visual form, storytelling or music is a facet of human society that can be traced back to the beginning of recorded history. The sanctity of the human mind within the realm of art has long gone unchallenged, yet modern technology has posed some counterarguments to the assertion that sentience is required to produce creative works. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a broad category of machine learning technology whereby computer programs are exposed to data and subsequently begin to work independently to complete tasks. One recently announced program has demonstrated abilities that are leaps and bounds beyond the limits of its contemporaries, and has unlocked the yet unforeseen power of AI-generated art.The new program, known as DALL-E, has demonstrated that the sky is the limit for creative artificial intelligence. DALL-E was developed in 2021 by OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab that has spent the last seven years programming applications that approximate human ability in various fields. The platform derives its name from two radically different influences: Spanish painter Salvador Dali and the lovable robotic protagonist of Pixar’s “WALL-E.” It has garnered a devoted online following for its revolutionary ability to understand complex phrases and produce unique, original computer-generated visuals based upon written sentences.The platform’s user interface is reminiscent of many search engines, with a text bar for users to input phrases that serve as instructions for generating the original images. Within 30 seconds of a user hitting enter, half a dozen rendered images appear onscreen. The content of the images varies slightly from one picture to the next, with some demonstrating a literal interpretation of the searched phrase while others explore implied meanings of the searched words. The truly remarkable ability to interpret the strings of words in several manners demonstrates an inventive level of textual understanding that feels impossibly human for an AI. The platform’s website advertises many of its most impressive capabilities, such as: “creating anthropomorphized versions of animals and objects, combining unrelated concepts in plausible ways, rendering text, and applying transformations to existing images.” These descriptions only scratch the surface of what DALL-E is capable of, yet OpenAI has already moved beyond this first program in a quest to code something even closer to sentient life.DALL-E was quickly followed by DALL-E 2, a similar application that performs nearly the same function but displays crisper images and has a more advanced understanding of English language syntax. Neither application is available for public use, with the latter in beta testing and made available to select online personalities to advertise its features. It is not apparent when or if the platforms will be released for general use, though it seems likely that it would exist behind a paywall should a public version be developed. The lack of general knowledge concerning the complete functionality of the program or its technical foundation has left many to speculate about what code powers the two applications, though OpenAI’s website provides a wealth of knowledge about certain components of their inner workings.Since its inception in the 1940s, digital computer technology has been able to interpret human inputs and produce a desired response, typically in the form of text. When a search engine or website is asked to display an image, such as on Google Images, it does so by retrieving an existing file that it understands to be linked with the search terms via machine learning processes. DALL-E is built upon the framework of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), a language algorithm that learns to predict and generate sequences of text. The platform uses this coding model and expands upon it, housing its own database of reference images in a manner reminiscent of a search engine. It harnesses GPT-3 to recognize the order and significance of words and to scan multiple images that are associated with different words in a search. Once it comprehends the string of input vocabulary using these references, it can then generate an original image by combining the disparate content in the search phrase.There are countless reasons to praise the minds behind DALL-E for concocting a creative tool that has such an elevated understanding of language and visual art, though there is also cause for concern. The art world was immediately concerned about a marketplace in which artificial intelligence can push living artists out of a job. The frenzied discourse around DALL-E is sensible for those who are concerned about their careers, though this is not the first time visual artists have been threatened by, but ultimately survived, the march of technology. Photography was also once a feared new medium, with the ease of capturing real-life imagery seemingly challenging the job security of portrait artists and impressionist painters. Though the medium could have replaced the demand for painted artworks, the classical forms of the visual arts have survived in the era of cameras because photography constituted a separate sector of the art world and was often used by painters to provide inspiration for their work. OpenAI’s stated goal for developing the DALL-E programs is to assist graphic designers by giving them a tool to quickly generate reference images that can be used in several ways for further artistry. The ability to generate reference images in a rapid manner and of a style that the artist may not have considered is an incredible asset for those who learn to use it and will likely contribute more to artists than it will take away.The impressive technology at play within DALL-E proposes another ethical dilemma. The significant difference between a sentient artist and a robotic curator is the presence of a moral compass within the former. DALL-E can render photorealistic visuals and could hypothetically be asked to depict damaging content without much participation from a user. In preparation for such circumstances, the AI refuses to generate images using some violent or explicit search terms and will also avoid producing visuals containing public figures. These decisions have pre-emptively circumvented some forms of abusing the technology, though crafty users can search precise, uncensored terms to generate imagery that approximates what the program would refuse to depict with censored terminology. It is easy to blame DALL-E for this defect, though the user is still the driving force behind any reprehensible works the application makes. Human artists have also shown tendencies to produce despicable art without the wonders of 21st-century technology, as numerous propaganda artists of past centuries demonstrate. Any method of communication can be channeled for questionable aims, yet it is not sensible to blame the tool for an issue that lies squarely with its user.Though the platform’s name references Dali, it is actually worth examining the difference between the program and the painter to ease the concerns of those who find DALL-E and its successor dangerous. Salvador Dali was an eccentric abstractionist painter who was instrumental in the 20th-century shift away from impressionist painting toward postmodern art. His incredibly stylized work is instantaneously recognizable and the product of his ingenuity; his brush brought into existence contours and compositions that nobody had previously imagined. DALL-E, on the other hand, can only emulate, and its ability to create new styles or forms beyond what exists in its database of visuals is limited. The program cannot follow in Dali’s footsteps and take the next quantum leap in artistic thought in the same way aspiring artists of today undoubtedly will. Whether or not it is being used to originate, emulate, or outright copy a style or form, it still requires a creative mind to take the wheel and lead it in a certain direction. DALL-E doesn’t need to ring alarm bells for a war against technology, but rather, it reminds us that even when artificial intelligence progresses, we can recognize it as an extension of ourselves.FacebookX0SaveLinkedinEmailWhatsappAIArtartificial intelligenceartistPixarSalvador DalitechnologyNiall Calvert, Wesleyan UniversityWriter ProfileNiall CalvertWesleyan UniversityGovernmentNiall Calvert is a resident of Maine and prospective government major at Wesleyan University, where he is a leader of the Outing Club and a middle school tutor.

Experts warn that software developers and programmers might get computerized with the advances in machine learning algorithms. The optimization of safety-critical areas in software development tasks by AI solutions is also one of the major reasons why businesses are thinking about deploying AI in software development, testing and programming tasks. The technology can ensure that the code quality is high and delivers all the functional requirements..Besides, intelligent programming and development assistance from AI can cut down on the workload in terms of automating the creation of code and identifying faults in the code manually. Artificial intelligence can be used to develop advanced business concepts for huge projects that are labor-intensive and time-consuming..The fact also seems that the work of software developers will change fundamentally. Neural networks or artificial intelligence will help improve digital work, but they will hardly replace developers in the foreseeable future..We are already using small-scale learning systems- from the auto-completion already mentioned in the Google search to playlists from the music streaming service provider that always offers the right music according to individual taste, current mood, and times of the day. The need for application developers has increased significantly. Digitization is taking place in all areas of life and work – after all, someone has to develop the AI, control it, and set the framework and data..For example, developers will likely write less and less code, and even less review or optimize it. In the future, they will rather work conceptually in the areas of data science or digital innovation. Developers will also have to make sure that AI is not left to its own devices and that it is tested according to human conditions. This can also mean not designing a website according to a calculated optimum, but deliberately breaking out – in short, working creatively..Enterprises are continually evolving, along with the ever-changing landscape of technology. Transformation of legacy applications and large-scale refactoring is essential with critical necessities, and deploying machine learning algorithms and frameworks will analyze codes and automatically optimize them for interoperability and higher performance. .There are many challenges to developing a fully-fledged AI tool that can replace programmers. However, AI can write the codes, and even debug or develop an entire product. But still, it is impossible to replace programmers completely in this industry. However, such technologies will improve and help programmers save time in the development phase and develop a product in an ideal time. These AI tools would be working as a reliable coding partners for the programmers. Such tools may also be suggesting a complete coding framework. But still, the human programmer will be analyzing and checking the code whether it is written correctly or not..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet has reached the final phase of drafting its first-ever, overarching data and artificial intelligence strategy and implementation plan — and aims to share those resources more broadly before this summer ends, a key task force leader told FedScoop on Friday.
Naval Surface Force organizations perform a variety of administrative, maintenance, workforce and operational training functions and help equip and staff Navy warships before they are deployed to the respective fleet commands for military missions. As one of the Navy’s largest enterprises, the organizations capture, produce and rely on massive amounts of data.
About a year ago, the Navy created Task Force Hopper to produce a complex digital infrastructure and cultural transformation to ultimately drive AI-enabled capabilities across the surface force. 
“We understand that AI is the most powerful decision engine for the readiness and sustainment of our ships and for warfighting — and we wanted to see, as an enterprise, how we can best accelerate this effort. This is about AI adaptation,” Task Force Hopper Director Capt. Pete Kim told FedScoop in an interview.

Kim has served in that role since the task force’s inception, and also leads the Surface Analytics Group. 
To him and his team, the task force represents “a broad enterprise approach about hiring the right digital talent, making sure our teams have the right development platforms for data excellent exploitation and creating new processes for the force.”
As such a sprawling enterprise, the surface force has many projects and initiatives within the Navy and in collaboration with academia and industry, resulting in siloed but duplicative efforts and gaps in transparency, among other issues. 
“We all know that AI is totally dependent on high-quality and accurate data. We believe that data management is the most important discipline for our era, and that’s what we wanted to focus on. So, one of our first initiatives was to draft a data AI strategy and implementation plan for the force to establish that structure,” Kim explained.
That in-the-making document will be unclassified, “but the audience is really the surface enterprise,” he added, suggesting that only a summary may be publicly disseminated.

“Right now, it is in the final stages of drafting. We hope to push that out to the enterprise here in the next few weeks,” the director said.
Broadly, the strategy and accompanying plan will detail why the Naval Surface Force is taking the approach that it is, and include directions for how officials will support the chosen framework.
“It really focuses on making data AI-ready across the board — and so it gets into data management, data governance, digital talent, ensuring that we’ve got clearly defined use cases,” Kim noted.
The strategy anchors on what he deemed a federated model with a number of different supporting organizations.
“It’s about central data governance, with a central data catalog and then having these decentralized analytic and AI development nodes at different places in the enterprise, where people know the data the best,” Kim said.

While nodes at one military location, or associated with one team, might focus on maintenance, others could concentrate on staffing or other needs. Kim added that the nodes will hone in on different categories of AI, depending “on the use case and what products and models we’re trying to build.”
Offering two examples of nodes aligned with readiness, he pointed to the Surface Analytics Group that he runs, which assists with “the force generation of about 168 warships,” and a separate group that zeroes in on operational safety and risk indicators. 
“Readiness is our focus here at the [Naval Surface Force]. Program offices and warfare centers that are, let’s just say, focused on lethality or warfighting, we expect those organizations to have nodes working on their specific areas and use cases,” Kim said. “Then the follow on here is, again, that common development environment where we as an enterprise have transparency on all the different projects that are going on — and then we can leverage each other’s works.”
Once the strategy and implementation plan are released, next steps will prioritize empowering each of the AI nodes.
“These nodes are going to support all the priority projects. So, it’s going to be about, ‘Hey, do you have the right tools in this development environment? Do you have the right digital talent to move out on this? Are there different datasets that you need that the rest of the enterprise can help you out with?’ So, we’ll really focus in on the select nodes to support those priority projects,” Kim said.

Using artificial intelligence to produce the right pattern of sound can render a voice unrecordableShutterstock/ArtemisDiana
A voice jammer can now stop anyone recording the speech of a single target person.
Voice jammers work much like noise-cancelling headphones, which effectively squash unwanted background sound waves out of existence by playing a copy of a background sound wave but with the wave pattern inverted. Such jammers generally stop electronic eavesdropping on conversations by broadcasting inverse sound waves that affect all microphones within earshot.
But this can prevent nearby people’s phones from picking up their own voices if they try to…
