Why American Special Forces are on the Cutting Edge of Artificial Intelligence Technology
SOCOM is partnering with the private industry and academia to improve its Artificial Intelligence capabilities.

by Stavros Atlamazoglou



 



Here's What You Need to Know: SOCOM has been a pioneer in the application of Artificial Intelligence. For example, the Naval Special Warfare Command (WARCOM) has been using Artificial Intelligence to find ways to make its SEAL and Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen (SWCC) operators more combat effective, while the Marines Special Operations Command (MARSOC) has been implementing Artificial Intelligence to better select and assess its future cadre of Marine Raiders.

Artificial Intelligence is everywhere today. From Amazon’s Alexa to unmanned aerial vehicles to space crafts to health care; Artificial Intelligence enables faster and better decisions if employed properly. 

The U.S. military and intelligence community have been using this technology for decades now and it’s becoming increasingly more prevalent. With the apparent return of Great Power Competition—the struggle for influence, leverage, and resources between the U.S. and its near-peer competitors China and Russia—the special operations community, the tip of the spear of the U.S. military, has been investing more in Artificial Intelligence technologies
What is Artificial Intelligence?





In short, Artificial Intelligence utilizes computers and machine learning to simulate the human mind’s problem-solving and decision-making capabilities, easing the cognitive load on humans, enabling quicker decision-making and follow-on actions.

Nowadays, in an age of information overload, the issue the military and intelligence community have to deal with isn’t having too little data to work with as it once may have been, but rather how to process all of the available data to find and utilize what is important quickly and efficiently.

That is where Artificial Intelligence, as a filtering and selection mission-planning tool, can come in and sift out the data that is just noise to provide commanders, decision-makers, and troops with the only information they need to do their job. It’s a tall order, for sure, but doable with the right approach and priorities.
Artificial Intelligence & Special Operations
General Richard Clarke, SOCOM’s commander, has emphasized the importance of Artificial Intelligence and cyberwarfare, going as far as to suggest that the future of U.S. special operations might not be with the Delta Force operator on the ground but rather with the cyber commando behind a keyboard.
Within the Department of Defense, SOCOM has been a pioneer in the application of Artificial Intelligence. For example, the Naval Special Warfare Command (WARCOM) has been using Artificial Intelligence to find ways to make its SEAL and Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen (SWCC) operators more combat effective, while the Marines Special Operations Command (MARSOC) has been implementing Artificial Intelligence to better select and assess its future cadre of Marine Raiders.

“Artificial Intelligence should assist a commander or operator to make better decisions, not make the decisions for them, and that’s where I think a lot of people get it mixed,” Herm Hasken a partner and senior operations consultant at MarkPoint Technologies, told Sandboxx News.

Hasken has several combat deployments and extensive special operations and intelligence community experience, including time with the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), National Security Agency (NSA), as well as the chief cryptologist for the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).
MarkPoint Technologies provides body-worn sensors that process and distribute signals detected in the proximity of the operator to U.S. government partners. Such advanced computing introduced in the tactical domain gives an advantage to special operators and makes them more effective.
“In some cases, Artificial Intelligence might help you process and act upon very simple tasks in order to reduce the cognitive load on the operator—doing some things for you, so you won’t spend time worrying about it, receiving data and making sense of it in the midst of a deluge of data coming at you,” Hasken added.

SOCOM is partnering with the private industry and academia to improve its Artificial Intelligence capabilities. An online course collaboration between SOCOM and MIT is part of this outreach effort. In the launching of the course, Clarke said that Artificial Intelligence and data-driven technology are integral parts of SOCOM’s preparation to maintain its qualitative advantage over its competitors and also to ensure that its commandos are ready for renewed Great Power Competition. 
A Precarious Edge
However, SOCOM, and indeed the Pentagon, are having trouble attracting top talent. In a recent Global SOF Foundation forum, Joint Artificial Intelligence Center Chief Technical Officer Nand Mulchandani said that pay, location, and the necessary inconveniences that come with military life—he offered a personal example of him having to fly from California to Washington D.C. to work because that is where a secured computer with access to a classified network is located—hamstring recruiting efforts. And although that has always been true about the military, it is slightly different when recruiting individuals with high-value skills and not just grunts or box kickers.
“SOCOM and JSOC need more data analytics and processing. Take for example the Iron Dome system in Israel. The only data it needs is that a missile is in the air, heading toward Israel, and where it can intercept and destroy it. That’s the only AI it needs. To detect, see, and stop it. If the AI can do the same for an operator, that’s the AI I want. I need to basically perform the same function: what’s coming after me, where do I meet it, and how do I stop it?” Hasken added.

Artificial Intelligence isn’t without vulnerabilities, both internal and external. Enemy tampering and attacks can hamper weapon systems and technology that rely on Artificial Intelligence, while a simple coding error or data oversight can have the same result, with potentially grave consequences for the troops on the ground. For example, a programmer can train Artificial Intelligence to look for specific faces of people for targeting purposes but small, intentional changes to those faces might mislead it, even if humans wouldn’t readily notice the difference.
To maintain a military edge over its near-peer competitors, the U.S. military and its special operations forces need to continue to invest in Artificial Intelligence but also have realistic aims that will translate into operational and tactical advantages on the ground.

How to Use Artificial Intelligence for Chronic Disease Management 


Artificial intelligence supports efficiency in disease diagnosis, medical decisions, and treatment as part of effective chronic disease management.

Published: 22 Dec 2021


 
Over the past two decades, the United States has seen a significant increase in chronic disease among the population. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, six in ten adults in the US have a chronic disease and four in ten adults have two or more.  







By 2025, it is estimated that nearly half of the country’s population will be impacted by chronic disease. Currently, the most prevalent conditions are heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. As these illnesses impact more of the population, researchers are advancing the development of treatment options.  
Many researchers and physicians are turning their attention to artificial intelligence capabilities to speed up the diagnosis process, assist in medical decisions, and provide treatment sooner. By engaging in AI, medical professionals could see improvements in early intervention and patient outcomes for those with heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.  

Using AI to treat heart disease 
At several organizations, researchers are taking steps to advance cardiovascular medicine using artificial intelligence.  
Hospitals and researcher centers will use AI to program computers to process and respond to data quickly and accurately to provide better treatment outcomes. Programs can conduct tasks including detecting heart disease, treating strokes, and enhancing diagnostic radiology capabilities. 
At Johns Hopkins University, researchers explored the use of whole-heart computational models to better understand ventricular arrhythmias. According to the research team, whole-heart computational modeling can lead to personalized medicine. 
“Personalized computational modeling of patient hearts is making strides developing models that incorporate the individual geometry and structure of the heart, as well as other patient-specific information,” co-author and professor of biomedical engineering and medicine at Johns Hopkins University, Natalia Trayanova, said in a press release. 
According to researchers, patient-specific models can also use predictive analytics to determine the risk of sudden cardiac death or the outcomes of a cardiac procedure. 
“Patient-specific models are also used for determining the optimal treatment for arrhythmia, both atrial and ventricular, with the latter often based on different biophysical underpinnings,” said Trayanova. 
 “These types of models can enable fast evaluation of medical device settings and patient-​selection criteria, as well as the development of novel therapeutic agents.” 
By pursuing the development of whole-heart computational models, researchers can enhance personalized treatment and risk predictions. Additionally, the model can work collaboratively with artificial intelligence to improve patient outcomes. 
 At Mayo Clinic, the organization provides three examples of recent ways doctors implemented AI research into clinical practice: 

Helping patients following a stroke: In emergency rooms, when patients come in with a stroke called an intracerebral hemorrhage, they undergo a CT scan. That scan is examined by a computer trained to analyze CT data, cutting the time to diagnosis and limiting brain damage. 
Preventing heart problems:  Applying AI to ECGs has resulted in a low-cost test that can be widely used to detect the presence of a weak heart pump, which can lead to heart failure if left untreated. Mayo Clinic is well situated to advance this use of AI because it has a database of more than 7 million ECGs. First, all identifying patient information is removed to protect privacy. Then this data can be mined to accurately predict heart failure noninvasively, inexpensively, and within seconds. 
Detecting atrial fibrillation sooner: AI-guided ECGs are also used to detect faulty heart rhythms before any symptoms are evident. 



AI in cancer detection and treatment 
There has been a recent expansion of providers using AI for cancer detection. At Tulane University, researchers discovered that  AI can accurately detect and diagnose colorectal cancer by analyzing tissue scans as well or better than pathologists. 
The researchers gathered over 13,000 images of colorectal cancer from 8,803 subjects and 13 independent cancer centers in China, Germany, and the United States. Then, using images that technicians selected at random, the researchers built a machine learning program. 
The program can recognize images of colorectal cancer, which according to researchers, is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in Europe and the US. 
After developing the performance measurement tool, the researchers compared the machine learning technique to the work done by the pathologists. The study indicated that the average pathologist scored around 0.969 for accuracy when identifying colorectal cancer, while the program scored 0.98, proving to be slightly more accurate than the manual data by pathologists. 
Artificial intelligence can also assist in deciding the best course of treatment for patients. For patients with cancer, researchers can use predictive analytics to determine how an individual will respond to a certain medication. 
Not every patient will have the same response to medications,  so machine learning and predictive analytics can also prevent unnecessary side effects from cancer treatments that may not work for the patient. 
The Georgia Institute of Technology and Ovarian Cancer Institute researchers used machine learning algorithms to determine how their patients would respond to cancer-fighting drugs. 
For the study, professor at the School of Biological, John F. McDonald, and his team created predictive machine learning-based models for 15 distinct cancer types, using data from 499 independent cell lines from the National Cancer Institute. 
The models were then validated with a clinical dataset containing seven chemotherapeutic drugs, administered either singularly or in combination to 23 ovarian cancer patients. The model showed an overall predictive accuracy of 91 percent. 
As artificial intelligence continues to grow in the healthcare space, more providers will utilize the technology to treat chronic diseases and lighten the load for physicians.  


Managing and preventing diabetes with AI 
Over the past several years, researchers have been investigating methods to use AI for diabetes management. Different strategies include self-management, remote patient monitoring, and support from wearable devices.  
In 2019, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute researchers conducted a studying using AI and big analytics to assess information from thousands of continuous glucose monitor insulin pumps. Those with Type 1 diabetes must test their blood sugar often to determine how much insulin they should infect using a needle or insulin pump.  
However, individuals can get a better idea of their blood sugar levels with continuous glucose monitors by offering blood sugar estimated every five minutes, without finger sticks. Data analysis allowed researchers to build models that can better predict the impact of meals and insulin on glucose levels, leading to better control of blood sugar levels. 
According to researchers, artificial intelligence has assisted in advancing diabetes care. AI-backed mobile health tools have demonstrated improvements in diabetes management, reducing the need for in-person appointments and patient-provider interaction.  
Artificial intelligence also plays an important role in diabetes prevention. According to research by Marshall University, the success of chronic disease prevention and population health management is dependent upon a provider’s ability to identify high-risk patients.  
With big data analytics and AI, practitioners can identify warning signs of illnesses promptly, allowing for a quick treatment turnaround and reducing costs. Providers can identify early signs of Ttype 2 diabetes using risk prediction models.  
To prevent disease progression, physicians can encourage patients to engage in early intervention strategies including, increasing exercise and striving to make healthy food choices.  
As researchers learn more about artificial intelligence capabilities, technology is growing as a tool for effective chronic disease management and prevention.

Early efforts in the field resulted in the development of new tools for solving mathematical problems.






What Is Artificial Intelligence?Artificial Intelligence (AI) simply means intelligence in machines, in contrast to natural intelligence found in humans and other natural organisms. Artificial intelligence gained its name and became a formal field of research in 1956, and initial work led to new tools for solving mathematical problems. However, researchers discovered that creating an AI is incredibly difficult, and progress slowed in the 1970s. More recently, increases in computing power and availability of massive data sets have set the groundwork for advances in AI.In particular, scientists have made giant strides in one particular application of AI, machine learning. Machine learning involves systems that automatically learn from the data they analyze and the results they obtain to improve their ability to work with that data in the future. For example, machine learning powers applications that estimate how long a trip will take and then provide guidance on the route. Applications such as Google Maps use machine learning to analyze shifting traffic conditions and incorporate user-reported data to reduce travel times and suggest fuel-efficient routes. Machine learning is best for these types of specific, well-defined tasks that can be broken down into logical steps.Supercomputers like the Department of Energy’s Aurora at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility will help make artificial intelligence more and more powerful.

The next level of AI application is known as deep learning. Deep learning involves complex tasks with many hard to nail down variables. It makes use of neural networks, which seek to build computers that operate like our brains. Deep learning leverages many neural networks stacked on top of each other to create a large, complex neural network. Deep learning demands a lot of computing power to both train the model from copious amounts of data and use the trained models to make decisions. One example is digital assistants like Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant. Deep learning is what allows these assistants to listen to you and figure out what information you want or task you need them to perform.  Artificial Intelligence FactsOne of the ways we can understand advances in AI is how well it performs at games.In 2011, IBM’s Watson won the U.S. game show Jeopardy!In 2016, the Google DeepMind AlphaGo AI beat a human grandmaster at the complex Chinese game of Go.But humans say AI isn’t so good at games involving teamwork.DOE Office of Science: Contributions to Artificial IntelligenceThe Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program in the Department of Energy Office of Science (DOE SC) has been working on AI since the 1960s. ASCR developed several technologies—including massively parallel input/output systems and linear algebra routines—that led to today’s AI systems. More recently, ASCR’s role in high-performance computing and exascale computing will help build the hardware and software needed to power future generations of AI. The ASCR program also provides support to other DOE SC programs that are using AI to accomplish their goals. For example, the DOE SC Fusion Energy Science program is deploying AI to help control fusion reactions with the goal of making fusion energy production a commercial reality.

Credit: Rhett WymanDoctors at Macquarie University in Sydney believe they have found a way to close the gap on human error with a smart app that uses artificial intelligence to guide healthcare workers step-by-step through “donning” and “doffing” of PPE.The app, created by cardiothoracic surgeon Michael Wilson in collaboration with software developer Terry Carney, audits healthcare workers in real time, using facial recognition technology and a phone or computer camera to “observe” the process. When it detects an error, workers are blocked from proceeding to the next step unless they make a correction.“It checks that you put the gloves on properly or that the gown is actually on the hands with the thumb loops through, so that you’ve got each item of protective equipment appropriately donned or doffed,” Professor Wilson said. “As we get more and more sophisticated with the programming and the AI learns, we will be able to recognise droplets of infection on a gown and then message people to say you’ve got a potential contamination here, wipe with extra disinfectant before taking off the gown.” The app uses facial recognition technology to guide health workers through the proper donning and doffing of PPE.Credit:  Rhett WymanAs daily case numbers surge in NSW and Victoria, the risk of exposure to frontline workers has never being higher, and their absence from the workforce more keenly felt as hospitals shift to skeleton staff and a fresh rotation of medical interns over the summer months.NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said this week 1400 healthcare workers were out of action, furloughed because they had either contracted or been exposed to coronavirus. In Victoria, about 700 healthcare workers were absent, with a health department official confirming most were isolating due to potential exposure to COVID-19 in the community.AdvertisementFormer federal health department secretary Jane Halton, who served on the National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board, said the proper use of PPE was “absolutely fundamental” to preserving the health workforce and limiting the spread of infection.Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 0:00Loaded: 0%0:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -0:00 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

The app is already in use at Macquarie University hospital, where it is being used to train medical students and nursing staff. But the team is eager to roll it out more widely and in discussions with three other hospitals, two educational groups and an aged care facility. While the app is currently calibrated to a medical or aged care environment, Professor Wilson said there was potential for it to be applied across a range of industries which used PPE, such as food preparation and commercial settings.The app was developed, trialled and validated over the past 18 months at Macquarie University, with the PPE “steps” informed by guidelines that were developed by Johns Hopkins University in response to the Ebola pandemic and in line with NSW Health’s Clinical Excellence Commission standards. It also features privacy safeguards such as “scrubbing” facial features and other identifying details of the user before recording the data.Related ArticleExplainerCoronavirus pandemicHow do rapid antigen tests work and how reliable are they?Associate Professor Veronica Preda, who oversaw the trials of the app with final year student doctors Anand Jayapadman and Alexandra Zacharakis, said there were no standardised protocols for PPE procedure across hospitals, aged care or disability facilities, with places often relying on a “buddy” system to check for errors. The reality in a busy hospital, she said, was that nurses often did not have the time to perform this role.“It’s also about how much training have they had? How confident are they? And is this the best use of their skill set when we’ve already got a fatigued workforce that is task-saturated,” she said.Fascinating answers to perplexing questions delivered to your inbox every week.

It consists of virtual spaces that you can explore using an avatar you create. In the metaverse, you can play games, go shopping, hang out with friends at a virtual coffee shop, work with your colleagues in a virtual office, and much more. Some video games and work socialization tools have already implemented certain metaverse elements into their ecosystems.Cryptocurrency projects like Decentraland and The Sandbox already have their digital world up and running. However, the metaverse concept is relatively new, so most of its functionalities are still under development. Companies like Facebook (now Meta), Microsoft, and Nvidia have also started creating their versions of the metaverse.To offer an immersive metaverse virtual experience, tech companies are incorporating cutting-edge technologies to power the 3D world’s development. Such technologies include blockchain, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), 3D reconstruction, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of things (IoT).IntroductionThe idea of a metaverse originated from Neal Stephenson in 1992. His science fiction novel Snow Crash envisioned an online world where people could use digital avatars to explore and escape from the real world. Decades later, big technology companies have started to build their own versions of a futuristic metaverse. What is the metaverse, and how are big companies approaching it on the technology front?What is the metaverse?The metaverse is a concept of an online 3D digital world with virtual land and objects. Imagine a world in which you can work remotely, visit virtual museums to see the latest artworks, or join your fellow rock band fans at a virtual concert, all from the comfort of your home.Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, Decentraland have already incorporated certain aspects of the metaverse to bring multiple elements of our lives into online worlds. However, the metaverse is still under development. No one knows whether there will be just one big all-encompassing metaverse or multiple metaverses that you can travel around. As the idea continues to develop, it’s expected to expand beyond video games and social media platforms. Remote working, decentralized governance, and digital identity are just some of the potential features the metaverse can support. It can also become more multi-dimensional via connected VR headsets and glasses, so users can actually walk around physically to explore the 3D spaces.The latest development of the metaverseWith Facebook changing its name to Meta in October 2021, the metaverse became the new favorite buzzword. To cater for its rebranding, the social media giant poured resources into a new division called Reality Labs to spend at least 10 billion dollars in 2021. The idea is to develop metaverse content, software, as well as AR and VR headsets, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes will be as widespread as smartphones in the future.The COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated the interest in developing metaverses. There is an increased demand for more interactive ways to connect with others as more people have started working remotely. Virtual 3D spaces that let coworkers join meetings, catch up, and collaborate are on the rise. The Microsoft Mesh unveiled in November 2021 is an example. It features immersive spaces for users to mingle and collaborate using their avatars, making remote team meetings more engaging and fun.Some online games are embracing the metaverse as well. The AR mobile game Pokémon Go was among the first to tap into the concept by allowing players to hunt virtual Pokémons in the real world using a smartphone app. Fortnite, another popular game, has expanded its product to different activities inside its digital world, including hosting brand events and concerts. Apart from social media and gaming platforms, tech companies like Nvidia have opened new opportunities in virtual worlds. Nvidia Omniverse is an open platform designed to connect 3D spaces into a shared universe to facilitate virtual collaboration between engineers, designers, and creators. It's currently being used across different industries. For instance, the BMW Group is using the Omniverse to reduce production time and improve product quality by smart manufacturing.Key technologies that power the metaverseTo make the metaverse experience more immersive, companies are using cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), 3D reconstruction, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of things (IoT) to power the 3D world.Blockchain and cryptocurrencyBlockchain technology provides a decentralized and transparent solution for digital proof of ownership, digital collectibility, transfer of value, governance, accessibility, and interoperability. Cryptocurrencies enable users to transfer value while they work and socialize in the 3D digital world. For example, crypto can be used to buy virtual lands in Decentraland. Players can purchase 16x16 meter land parcels in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with the game’s cryptocurrency MANA. With the support of blockchain technology, the ownership of these virtual lands can be established and secured.In the future, crypto can potentially incentivize people to actually work in the metaverse. As more companies take their offices online for remote working, we might see metaverse-related jobs being offered.For a more in-depth exploration of these areas, check out What Is the Metaverse?. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can give us an immersive and engaging 3D experience. These are our entry points to the virtual world. But what’s the difference between AR and VR?AR uses digital visual elements and characters to morph the real world. It’s more accessible than VR and can be used on almost any smartphone or digital device with a camera. Through AR applications, users can view their surroundings with interactive digital visuals, similar to what we have in the mobile game Pokémon GO. When players open the camera on their phones, they can see Pokémons in the real-world environment.VR works differently. Much like the metaverse concept, it produces an entirely computer-generated virtual environment. Users can then explore it using VR headsets, gloves, and sensors.The way AR and VR work shows an early model of the metaverse. VR is already creating a digital world that incorporates fictional visual content. As its technology becomes more mature, VR can expand the metaverse experience to involve physical simulations with VR equipment. Users will be able to feel, hear and interact with people from other parts of the world. Considering the hype around the metaverse, we can expect more metaverse companies to invest in AR and VR equipment development in the near future.Artificial intelligence (AI)Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied in our lives in recent years: business strategy planning, decision making, facial recognition, faster computing, and more. More recently, AI experts have been studying the possibilities of applying AI to the creation of immersive metaverses. AI has the potential to process a lot of data at lightning speed. Combined with machine learning techniques, AI algorithms can learn from previous iterations, taking into account historical data to come up with unique outputs and insights. Within the metaverse, AI can be applied to the non-player characters (NPCs) in different scenarios. NPCs exist in almost every game; they are a part of the gaming environment designed to react and respond to players’ actions. With AI’s processing abilities, NPCs can be placed across the 3D spaces to facilitate lifelike conversations with users or perform other specific tasks. Unlike a human user, an AI NPC can run on its own and be used by millions of players at the same time. It can also work in several different languages.Another potential application for AI is in the creation of metaverse avatars. AI engines can be used to analyze 2D images or 3D scans to generate avatars that look more realistic and accurate. To make the process more dynamic, AI can also be used to create different facial expressions, hairstyles, clothes, and features to enhance the digital humans we create.3D reconstructionWhile this is not new technology, the use of 3D reconstruction has been rising during the pandemic, especially in the real estate industry, as lockdowns prevented potential buyers from visiting properties in person. Therefore, some agencies adopted 3D reconstruction technology to generate virtual property tours. Much like the metaverse we imagined, buyers could look around potential new homes from anywhere and make purchases without even having stepped foot inside.One of the challenges for the metaverse is to create a digital environment that appears as close to our real world as possible. With the help of 3D reconstruction, it can create realistic and natural-looking spaces. Through special 3D cameras, we can take our world online by rendering accurate 3D photorealistic models of buildings, physical locations, and objects. The 3D spatial data and 4K HD photography are then passed to computers to process and generate a virtual replica in the metaverse for users to experience. These virtual replicas of physical world objects can also be referred to as digital twins.Internet of things (IoT)The concept of the Internet of things (IoT) was first introduced in 1999. Simply put, IoT is a system that takes everything in our physical world and connects them to the Internet through sensors and devices. After connecting to the Internet, these devices will have a unique identifier and the ability to send or receive information automatically. Today, IoT is connecting thermostats, voice-activated speakers, medical devices, and much more to a wide range of data.One of the applications of IoT on the metaverse is to collect and provide data from the physical world. This would increase the accuracy of the digital representations. For example, IoT data feeds could change the way certain metaverse objects function based on the current weather or other conditions. Implementing IoT can seamlessly connect the 3D world to a large number of real-life devices. This enables the creation of real-time simulations in the metaverse. To further optimize the metaverse environment, IoT could also use AI and machine learning to manage the data it collects.Challenges of the metaverseThe metaverse is still in its early stages of development. Some challenges include identity authentication and privacy control. In the real world, it's often not difficult to identify someone. But as people traverse the digital world in their avatars, it will be difficult to tell or prove who the other person is. For example, malicious actors or even bots could enter the metaverse pretending to be someone else. They could then use this to damage their reputation or to scam other users.Another challenge is privacy. The metaverse relies on AR and VR devices to offer an immersive experience. These technologies with camera capabilities and unique identifiers could eventually lead to undesirable leaks of personal information.Closing thoughtsWhile the metaverse is still under development, many companies are already exploring its potential. In the crypto space, Decentraland and The Sandbox are notable projects, but big companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Facebook (ie. Meta) are also getting involved. As AR, VR, and AI technologies advance, we will likely see exciting new features in these virtual, borderless worlds.",Article,['https://public.bnbstatic.com/static/academy/uploads/c4bf67c7d8c54fc2b8c134c25fae5e0a.png'],,,2021-12-22T11:51:08.000Z,2023-06-15T07:48:49.000Z,Top 7 Technologies that Power the Metaverse,,,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Binance Academy'}",,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Binance Academy', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://bin.bnbstatic.com/image/academy/apple-touch-icon.png'}}","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/top-7-technologies-that-power-the-metaverse'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<h2><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">How Will Artificial Intelligence Affect Workplaces And Lives In The Future?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">These days, artificial intelligence, or AI, appears to be on everyone's lips. While some have known about this crucial trend in tech growth for a while, but it's true, AI has become one of the most sought-after areas of knowledge for job seekers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Many of us associate the term ""<a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/startups/nishi/zindi-artificial-intelligence/"">AI</a>"" with sci-fi fantasies or worries of robots taking over the world. While no one can predict exactly how AI will develop in the future, current trends and developments paint a completely different picture of how AI will integrate into our lives.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">In actuality, AI is already at work in our environment, from the search results to the odds of finding love online to the way we shop is influenced by artificial intelligence. According to data, the use of AI in several commercial areas has increased by 270 per cent in the last four years.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">On the other hand, what will AI entail for the future of work? As <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/stories/ananya/the-challenge-to-teach-sign-language-to-computers-and-machines/"">computers</a> and technology have progressed, one of the most urgent questions. Like many other technological advancements throughout history, artificial intelligence's progress has sparked anxieties that human employees may become obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The reality is likely to be far less bleak but perhaps even more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-244316 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Artificial-Intelligence-600x400.jpg"" alt=""Artificial Intelligence"" width=""600"" height=""400"" /></span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">What is artificial intelligence (AI)?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Before we go into the intricacies of how AI will affect the future of employment, let's define AI. Artificial intelligence, as per Britannica, refers ""the capacity of a digital computer or computer-controlled machine to do tasks commonly associated with intelligent persons.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">""""Artificial intelligence"" becomes a catch all phrase for any computational advancement, systems, and technology that allows computer programmes to accomplish jobs or solve issues that require the kind of reasoning we associate with human intellect, including learning from previous operations.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI relies heavily on this ability to learn. Algorithms are usually linked to artificial intelligence, such as the infamous Facebook algorithm that replaced all of our friends with paid content. There is, nevertheless, an enormous difference.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">According to software journalist Kaya Ismail, an algorithm is just a ""collection of instructions"" or a method for processing data. AI takes this a step further, consisting of a set of algorithms that can adapt and rewrite themselves in reaction to the data inputted, thereby demonstrating ""intelligence.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Human workers are unlikely to become obsolete due to AI, at least not for a long time. To soothe some of your fears, robots are unlikely to take over your job very soon.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Given how artificial intelligence has been portrayed in the media, notably in some of our favourite science fiction films, it's understandable that its debut has spurred anxieties that AI would one day render humans obsolete in the workplace. After all, as technology has developed, many tasks previously handled by human hands have been automated. It's understandable to be anxious that advances in artificial intelligence will usher at the end of work as we know it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">However, there is not any reason to be so pessimistic. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force"">MIT Task Force</a> on the Future of Work recently produced a study titled ""Artificial Intelligence And The Future of Work,"" which examined AI breakthroughs and their impact on the workplace. The publication portrays a more upbeat picture.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Rather than advocating the abolition of human labour, the report predicts that AI will continue to drive significant innovation, fuel many existing businesses and potentially establish many new ones, resulting in the creation of additional jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">While artificial intelligence has made tremendous progress in duplicating human intellect's utility in completing specific tasks, it still has severe limits. AI algorithms, in particular, are frequently ""specialized,"" meaning they can only handle one problem or perform one task at a time. They are typically rigid, unable to adapt to changes in input or engage in any ""thinking"" beyond their pre-programmed boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Humans, on the other hand, have ""generalized,"" which includes problem-solving, abstract thinking, and critical judgment abilities that will remain useful in the business world. If not in every job, then at least at every level and throughout all industries, human judgment will be required.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Many other problems could limit AI's rapid growth. AI frequently necessitates ""learning,"" which might include large volumes of data, raising questions about the availability of the correct kind of data, as well as the requirement for categorized and security concerns. There's also the issue of computing and processing power limitations. One supercharged language model AI was expected to cost $4.6 million in electricity alone.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Another significant restriction is that data might be biased, reflecting social imbalances or the implicit prejudices of the designers who develop and enter the data. If bias in the data is fed into an AI, such discrimination will likely be carried over into the AI's output.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The Algorithmic Accountability Act was introduced in Congress to mandate the Federal Trade Commission to review the usage of any new AI technology for the potential to perpetuate bias.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The MIT CCI article claims that we are still a long way from reaching a stage when AI is similar to human intelligence and might theoretically replace human employees totally, based on these and other criteria.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI can create more employment, not fewer, if there is an investment at all levels, from education to the commercial sector and governmental organizations that focus on training and upskilling workers. Instead of ""people or computers,"" the question should be ""humans and computers"" involved in sophisticated systems that progress industry and wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">This paper is an exciting read for anyone interested in learning more about AI and the various routes it could take.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI has recently come up in conversation with a client or associate, and we all have seen a misconception in how people think about it. Many people believe that it is a phenomenon that will only have significant ramifications in the computer sphere.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The tech world has taken over the planet, if you haven't noticed. Never forget what economist Paul Krugman said in 1998: ""By 2005 or so, it will become evident that the Internet's economic impact has been no more than that of the fax machine."" You don't want to be behind the times when it comes to AI.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">In reality, 90 per cent of the world's most successful companies are already investing in AI. More than half of organizations that use AI-driven technology say they have seen increased productivity.</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-244315 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_jeannemeister_files_2017_02_shutterstock_568431658-copy-a-1200x1200-1-600x600.jpg"" alt=""Artificial Intelligence"" width=""600"" height=""600"" /></span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI is expected to have a significant impact on the following industries:</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Medical:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The advantages of employing AI in medicine are currently being researched. The medical industry has a lot of data that can be used to build prediction models for healthcare. AI has proven to be more effective than physicians in various diagnosis circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Automotive:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">With the start of autonomous vehicles and autonomous navigation, we're already seeing how AI is affecting the world of transportation and autos. AI will significantly impact production, particularly in the automotive industry. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Cybersecurity:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Cybersecurity is a top priority for many corporate leaders, especially given the expected increase in cybersecurity in 2020. Hackers targeted those who worked from home and had less secure technological equipment and Wi-Fi networks during the pandemic. In cybersecurity, AI and machine learning will be critical technologies for detecting and anticipating threats. Given its ability to analyze data and forecast and detect fraud, AI will be a crucial tool for financial security.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">E-Commerce:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">From user experience to marketing to fulfillment and distribution, AI will play a vital role in the future of e-commerce. Chatbots, shopper customization, targeted advertising, and warehouse and inventory automation, among other things, should all be expected to fuel e-commerce in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; color: initial;"">Artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly impact the job search process.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">You can be in for a rude awakening if you expect a hiring manager to overlook a tiny error on your application. AI already plays a significant part in the hiring process, with an automated applicant tracking system, or ATS, rejecting up to 75% of resumes before they even reach a human being.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Previously, recruiters had to filter through many resumes to discover qualified candidates. According to LinkedIn data, recruiters can spend up to 23 hours reviewing resumes for a single successful job.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">On the other hand, AI-powered systems are increasingly doing resume scanning. In 2018, 67 per cent of hiring managers said artificial intelligence (AI) made their work easier.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Despite the growing prominence of automation and algorithms in the hiring process, several have criticized the usage of specific types of AI, claiming that it can perpetuate and even increase bias in hiring.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">HireVue, for example, is a firm whose initial offerings featured technology that attempted to combine facial recognition technologies and psychology to estimate a candidate's future performance in a specific function. The Federal Trade Commission has received a complaint by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, claiming that this software could perpetuate bias and prejudice. In early 2021, HireVue stopped using facial recognition algorithms and relied on audio analysis and natural language processing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">As new technology develops, it's evident that the employment of certain types of AI in the recruiting process will be contentious. However, if potential employers are using AI to process your application, there's no reason you can't take advantage of the same technology.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Jobscan is an excellent resource for resume scanning comparable to what a hiring manager would do. Jobscan will provide you information on how to adjust your CV so that it is a good fit for a specific position by comparing it to a job description, with the purpose of ""beating"" an applicant tracking system (ATS). </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-244326 aligncenter"" src=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5246fd70-6619-4c99-8d72-03875cac0f46-600x338.jpg"" alt=""artificial intelligence"" width=""600"" height=""338"" /></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Jobseer is a browser add-on that is another excellent AI-based tool for job seekers. Jobseer can assist match you with job listings that best fit your experience based on a scan of your resume, as well as keywords and skills connected to your preferred jobs. You'll get a grade for each listing based on how well you match the job description, as well as suggestions for skills to add to better position your CV and experience.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Rezi: As a caution, one would never recommend entrusting your resume writing to a robot. However, Rezi is a fantastic AI-based resume builder that contains templates to assist you in creating a resume that will tick all of the boxes for applicant tracking systems. This is an excellent place to start when creating a new resume. Another superb method to use this type of technology is to create a fresh resume and compare it to your current resume to see how it compares and where you can improve.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Assume you want to advance your career or improve your professional profile to be more marketable. In that situation, AI is an excellent place to focus your efforts because AI will have far-reaching implications across a wide range of businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI and machine learning are many essential skills in today's employment market.
