Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple all say that every aspect of our lives will soon be transformed by artificial intelligence and machine learning, through innovations such as self-driving cars and facial recognition. Yet the people whose work underpins that vision don’t much resemble the society their inventions are supposed to transform. WIRED worked with Montreal startup Element AI to estimate the diversity of leading machine learning researchers, and found that only 12 percent were women.That estimate came from tallying the numbers of men and women who had contributed work at three top machine learning conferences in 2017. It suggests the group supposedly charting society’s future is even less inclusive than the broader tech industry, which has its own well-known diversity problems.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTAt Google, 21 percent of technical roles are filled by women, according to company figures released in June. When WIRED reviewed Google’s AI research pages earlier this month, they listed 641 people working on “machine intelligence,” of whom only 10 percent were women. Facebook said last month that 22 percent of its technical workers are women. Pages for the company’s AI research group listed 115 people earlier this month, of whom 15 percent were women.Trending NowWomen Engineers On the Rampant Sexism of Silicon ValleyA Google spokesperson told WIRED that the company’s research page lists only people who have authored research papers, not everyone who implements or researches AI technology, but declined to provide more information. Facebook also declined to provide details on the diversity of its AI teams. Joelle Pineau, who leads the Montreal branch of Facebook’s AI lab, said counting the research team’s publicly listed staff was “reasonable,” but that the group is small relative to everyone at Facebook involved in AI, and growing and changing through hiring.Percent of men and women who contributed work to three leading machine learning conferences in 2017.

Facebook is counting on machine learning to help it fight fake news in places with very different demographics to its AI research lab, such as Myanmar, where rumors on the company's platform led to violence. Anima Anandkumar, a professor at the California Institute of Technology who previously worked on AI at Amazon, says the risks AI systems will cause harm to certain groups are higher when research teams are homogenous. “Diverse teams are more likely to flag problems that could have negative social consequences before a product has been launched,” she says. Research has also shown diverse teams are more productive.Corporate and academic AI teams have already—inadvertently—released data and systems biased against people poorly represented among the high priests of AI. Last year, researchers at the universities of Virginia and Washington showed that two large image collections used in machine learning research, including one backed by Microsoft and Facebook, teach algorithms a skewed view of gender. Images of people shopping and washing are mostly linked to women, for example.Anandkumar and others also say that the AI community needs better representation of ethnic minorities. In February, researchers from MIT and Microsoft found that facial analysis services that IBM and Microsoft offered to businesses were less accurate for darker skin tones. The companies’ algorithms were near perfect at identifying the gender of men with lighter skin, but frequently erred when presented with photos of women with dark skin. IBM and Microsoft both say they have improved their services. The original, flawed, versions were on the market for more than a year.The scarcity of women among machine learning researchers is hardly surprising. The wider field of computer science is well documented as being dominated by men. Government figures show that the proportion of women awarded bachelor's degrees in computing in the US has slid significantly over the past thirty years, the opposite of the trend in physical and biological sciences.Share of bachelor's degrees earned by women in the US.

WIRED approached Element about doing that after the company published figures on the global AI talent pool. The company compiled a list of the names and affiliations of everyone who had papers or other work accepted at three top academic machine learning conferences—NIPS, ICLR, and ICML—in 2017. The once obscure events now feature corporate parties and armies of corporate recruiters and researchers. Element’s list comprised 3,825 names, of which 17 percent were affiliated with industry. The company counted men and women by asking workers on a crowdsourcing service to research people on the list online. Each name was sent to three workers independently, for consistency. WIRED checked a sample of the data, and excluded six entries that came back incomplete.The picture that emerged is only an estimate. Rachel Thomas, a professor at the University of San Francisco, and cofounder of AI education provider, Fast.ai, says it can still be useful. Figures on AI’s diversity problem might help motivate attempts to address it, she says. “I think it’s a fairly accurate picture of who big companies working on AI think are appropriate people to hire,” Thomas says.AI’s lack of diversity and efforts to address it have won more attention in recent years. Thomas, Anandkumar, and Pineau have all been involved with Women in ML, or WiML, a workshop that runs alongside NIPS, currently the hottest conference in AI. The side-event provides a venue for women to present their work, and in 2017 boasted corporate sponsorship from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. Similarly, boldface tech brands sponsored a new workshop that ran alongside NIPS last year called Black In AI, which hosted technical research talks, and discussion on how to improve the field’s diversity. Fast.ai’s courses are designed to offer an alternative to the conventional grad school track into AI, and the company offers diversity scholarships.Despite the growth of such programs, few people in AI expect the proportion of women or ethnic minorities in their field to grow very swiftly.Diversity campaigns at companies such as Google have failed to significantly shift the predominance of white and Asian men in their technical workforces. Negar Rostamzadeh, a research scientist at Element, says AI has its own version of a problem well documented in tech companies whereby women are more likely than men to leave the field, and less likely to be gain promotions. “Working to have good representation of women and minorities is positive, but we also want them to be able to advance,” Rostamzadeh says.Women in AI research also say the field can be unwelcoming and even hostile to women.Anandkumar and Thomas say they learned long before completing their PhDs that it’s not unusual for men in computer science or math research to subject women to inappropriate remarks or harassment. Two long-standing computer science professors at Carnegie Mellon University resigned this week, citing “sexist management.” In February, Anandkumar made online posts with the #metoo tag, describing verbal harassment by an unnamed coworker in AI.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDEvents at NIPS in recent years illustrate the challenge of making the field more welcoming to women—and how the new money flowing into AI can sometimes make it worse.In 2015, the founders of a Canadian startup called Deeplearni.ng brought t-shirts to the conference with the slogan “My NIPS are NP-hard,” an anatomical math joke some men and women found inappropriate.

An Intel spokesman said the company welcomes feedback on how it can better create environments where everyone feels included. The conference’s official closing party generated similar complaints, triggering investigations into the behavior of two prominent researchers.One was University of Minnesota professor Brad Carlin, who performed at the NIPS closing party in a band called the Imposteriors made up of statistics professors. Carlin, who plays keys, made a joke about sexual harassment during the show. Tweets complaining about his remark spurred data scientist Kristian Lum to write a blog post alleging that a person involved in the incident—later confirmed to be Carlin—and another, unnamed, researcher had touched her inappropriately, on separate occasions.

Is the Art Market Ready to Embrace Work Made by Artificial Intelligence? Christie’s Will Test the Waters This Fall
The auction house is selling an AI-produced work of art for the first time this fall.

Christie’s New York will make history this fall when it becomes the first auction house to sell a work of art made by artificial intelligence. The print on canvas, a product of an algorithm developed by the French art collective Obvious, will be included in the auction house’s prints and multiples sale October 23-25.
 Hugo Caselles-Dupré, a member of the Paris-based collective, told artnet News that they were “interested in the philosophical approach behind this,” he said. “Can an algorithm be creative? If so, this algorithm is the closest to the human mind’s creativity.”
The work was created using a model called a Generative Adversarial Network. The artists first fed a generator a dataset of 15,000 portraits done between the 14th and 20th centuries. It then created new works based on the training set until it was able to fool a test designed to distinguish whether an image was made by human or machine.
The resulting work, titled Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, depicts a man in a dark coat and white collar with indecipherable facial features that reside somewhere in the uncanny valley. The unique piece, a gold-framed canvas print that is currently on view in Christie’s London showroom, is estimated at $7,000-10,000. The collective says it will use the proceeds from the sale to further train its algorithm, finance the computational power needed to make such works, and experiment with 3D modeling.
Obvious Art’s ??? ? ??? ? ?? [??? ? (?))] + ?? [???(? − ?(?(?)))], Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, Generative Adversarial Network print on canvas (2018).The Christie’s sale constitutes an important validation in the realm of AI art. Although there are many so-called “creative coders” who use similar technologies to improve web experience, few are considered contemporary artists. The members of Obvious see themselves as conceptual artists whose main goal is to democratize Generative Adversarial Networks and legitimize AI-produced art.
“We wanted to propose this new approach to a more traditional market rather than the tech area,” Caselles-Dupré said. “At the beginning it was difficult to be understood by the traditional art market because they were looking at us like, ‘Who are those guys? What is this new weird stuff?’ But the more we’ve explained what we’re doing, what we want to share, and what we want to say, the more the art world is paying attention to our work.”
Following the Christie’s sale, Obvious plans to work with brands and galleries to expand the movement. “We really believe that AI can be a new tool for art,” Caselles-Dupré said. “In 1850, when the camera showed up, it was only used by highly qualified engineers and so it was not considered for its artistic potential. We think we are in the same situation, because people view us as engineers but we really think this type of technology will be used more and more in art.”

[???(? − ?(?(?)))], Portrait of Edmond de Belamy (2018).The collective began a conversation with Christie’s following a London symposium on the implications of blockchain for the art world. “Christie’s continually stays attuned to changes in the art market and how technology can impact the creation and consumption of art,” said the auction house’s head of prints and multiples, Richard Lloyd, in a statement. “AI has already been incorporated as a tool by contemporary artists and as this technology further develops, we are excited to participate in these continued conversations.”
Edmond de Belamy is one of 11 portraits of the fictional Belamy family, which is named after Ian Goodfellow, the AI researcher who invented the Generative Adversarial Network method in 2014. (“Goodfellow” roughly translates to the French bel ami.) Another portrait from the family, Le Comte de Belamy, sold to Parisian collector Nicolas Laugero-Lassere earlier this year.

The issue was so bad that the number of active contributors or editors—those that made one edit per month—had fallen by 40 percent during an eight-year period. Even though there’s not one solution to combat this issue, Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that supports Wikipedia, decided to use artificial intelligence to learn more about the problem and consider ways to combat it.

Collaboration with Wikimedia Foundation and Jigsaw to Stop Abusive Comments
In one effort to stop the trolls, Wikimedia Foundation partnered with Jigsaw (the tech incubator formerly known as Google Ideas) on a research project called Detox using machine learning to flag comments that might be personal attacks. This project is part of Jigsaw’s initiative to build open-source AI tools to help combat harassment on social media platforms and web forums.
The first step in the project was to train the machine learning algorithms using 100,000 toxic comments from Wikipedia Talk pages that had been identified by a 4,000-person human team where every comment had ten different human reviewers. This annotated dataset was one of the largest ever created that looked at online abuse. Not only did these include direct personal attacks, but also third-party and indirect personal attacks (""You are horrible.""  ""Bob is horrible."" ""Sally said Bob is horrible."") After training, the machines could determine a comment was a personal attack just as well as three human moderators.
PROMOTED
Then, the project team had the algorithm review 63 million English Wikipedia comments posted during a 14-year period between 2001 to 2015 to find patterns in the abusive comments. What they discovered was outlined in the Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale paper:

More than 80% of all comments characterized as abusive were made by more than 9,000 people who made less than five abusive comments in a year rather than an isolated group of trolls.
Nearly 10% of all attacks were made by just 34 users.
Anonymous users made up 34% of all comments left on Wikipedia.

More than half of the personal attacks are being carried out by registered users although anonymous users were six times more likely to launch personal attacks. (There are 20 times more registered users than anonymous users.)

Now that the algorithms have created more clarity about who is contributing to the community’s toxicity, Wikipedia can figure out the best way to combat the negativity. Although human moderation is likely still needed, algorithms can help sort through the comments and flag those that require human involvement.
Objective Revision Evaluation Service (ORES System)
Another reason for the significant decline in editors to Wikipedia is thought to be the organization’s complex bureaucracy as well as its harsh editing tactics. It was common for first-time contributors/editors to have an entire body of work wiped out with no explanation. One way they hope to fight this situation is with the ORES system, a machine that acts as an editing system powered by an algorithm trained to score the quality of changes and edits. Wikipedia editors used an online tool to label examples of past edits, and that was how the algorithm was taught the severity of errors. The ORES system can direct humans to review the most damaging edit and determine the caliber of mistakes—rookie mistakes are treated more appropriately as innocent.
AI to Write Wikipedia Articles
Well, AI can do ""OK"" writing Wikipedia articles, but you have to start somewhere, right? A team within Google Brain taught software to summarize info on web pages and write a Wikipedia-style article. It turns out text summarization is more difficult than most of us thought. Google Brain's efforts to get a machine to summarize content is slightly better than previous attempts, but there is still work to be done before a machine can write with the cadence and flair humans can. It turns out we're not quite ready to have a machine automatically generate Wikipedia entries, but there are efforts underway to get us there.
While the use cases for artificial intelligence in the operations of Wikipedia are still being optimized, machines can undoubtedly help the organization analyze the vast amount of data they generate daily. Better information and analysis can help Wikipedia create successful strategies to troubleshoot negativity from its community and recruitment issues for its contributors.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",BreadcrumbList,,,Enterprise & Cloud,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Bernard Marr', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/', 'description': 'Bernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing Business and Society.

Christie’s Will Be the First Auction House to Sell Art Made by Artificial Intelligence
Christie’s will sell the work from Paris-based art collective Obvious, which created ‘Portrait of Edmond Belamy’ with the machine-learning algorithm GAN

At first glance, portraits of the Belamy family seem to exemplify life in the upper echelons of French society. The haughty features of patriarch Le Comte De Belamy are framed by a voluminous white powdered wig, while the dynastic matriarch, La Comtesse, oozes wealth in her colorful silk attire. Skipping ahead several generations, you’ll encounter Madame De Belamy, whose tightly coiffed hair is tucked inside a blue hat rendered in Impressionistic strokes, and her son Edmond, a comparatively dour-looking young man clad almost entirely in black.
But there’s a catch to this story of generational greatness: In addition to being wholly fictional, the Belamy family hovers in that amorphous space between artificial intelligence and art. Although its members’ names and places in the family tree were assigned by Obvious, a Paris-based art collective, their likenesses are the brainchild of Generative Adversarial Networks, a machine learning algorithm better known by the acronym GAN.

Now, Naomi Rea writes for Artnet News, the youngest member of the family—as depicted in “Portrait of Edmond Belamy”—is set to make history as the subject of the first AI-produced artwork sold by an auction house.
A canvas print of Obvious’ (and GAN’s) creation will be included in Christie’s late October auction of Prints and Multiples, the New York-based auction house reports. It remains to be seen how bidders will react to the AI work, but Obvious remains optimistic, citing an estimated sale price of €7,000 to €10,000, or roughly $8,000 to $11,500.
Hugo Caselles-Dupré, one of Obvious’ three co-founders, tells Christie’s Jonathan Bastable that GAN consists of two parts: the Generator, which produced images based on a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries, and the Discriminator, which attempts to differentiate manmade and AI-generated works.
“The aim is to fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real-life portraits,” Caselles-Dupré says. “Then we have a result.”



    
      The painting is one of 11 portraits depicting the fictional Belamy family, which was named in honor of GAN creator Ian Goodfellow

According to an essay posted on Obvious’ Medium page, GAN analyzes thousands of images to learn the basic features of portraiture. The subsequent AI-generated portraits are both similar to the images in the original data source and singularly unique. A different image is rendered with every execution of the algorithm.
“This reflects a human creativity feature: We will never create twice the same thing,” Obvious writes.
Obvious, a three-man team made up of Caselles-Dupré, Pierre Fautrel and Gauthier Vernier, owes much to American AI researcher Ian Goodfellow, who developed the GAN algorithm in 2014. As Time’s Ciara Nugent notes, the rough French translation of “Goodfellow”—bel ami—provided inspiration for the fictional family’s name.
The Belamy portraits are painted in a semi-realistic style, their blurred details creating an overarching impression of motion. In the bottom right corner of the canvases, the artist’s signature is replaced by an intimidating mathematical equation:





Such proclamations of authorship are a central concern in the art world’s AI debate. Skeptics of the new technology doubt that machines can produce art, which has long been viewed as a uniquely human activity. If an AI researcher designs and executes an algorithm, who is the end product’s true creator: human artist or machine? And, most importantly, if robots can create art, where does that leave humans?
There are no easy answers to these questions, but as Rose Eveleth, host of the future-centric podcast Flash Forward, argued in a recent episode, this isn’t the first time humans have felt threatened—or entranced—by machine-made art.
Swiss-born watchmaker Pierre Jaquet-Droz launched the golden age of automata, or kinetic sculptures designed to mimic human movement, with “The Writer.” The 1770s doll was made of 6,000 moving parts that allowed it to scribble out an array of messages, dip a quill into an inkwell, and blink with unseeing eyes.
At the time, philosophers were engaged in a heated battle over what it meant to be alive, Eveleth notes. While we don't think of today's AI as a living organism, modern technology does continue to raise existential questions about what it means to be human. Consider a more recent innovation: the camera. It also posed some philosophical problems, Caselles-Dupré tells Time’s Nugent.
“Back then, people were saying that photography is not real art and people who take pictures are like machines,” he says. “And now we can all agree that photography has become a real branch of art.”
By including “Portrait of Edmond Belamy” in its fall sale, Christie’s isn’t offering a final ruling on the value of AI art. Still, the decision is sure to attract ire, elation and, if the sale is successful, newfound faith in the burgeoning medium.
“I’ve tended to think human authorship was quite important—that link with someone on the other side,” Richard Lloyd, head of Christie’s Prints and Multiples department, tells Nugent. “But you could also say art is in the eye of the beholder. If people find it emotionally charged and inspiring, then it is. If it waddles and it quacks, it’s a duck.”

Google recently successfully put its DeepMind artificial intelligence system to work recognising eye diseases. With AI also being used to diagnose cancer, and the launch of AI-driven smartphone apps that can discuss symptoms and triage patients, it might sound like we’re not too far from the creation of a fully fledged AI doctor.
Similar progress is being made putting AI to work writing software and evaluating legal contracts. AI has even started to make its mark in the creative world, generating artworks and fashion, evaluating graphic design, and helping people to create music. So does AI pose a threat to highly skilled jobs in the same way it does to ones that involve simple, repetitive tasks?
New technology has been making workers redundant for hundreds of years. But advances in the various industrial revolutions have also always created other new jobs, and people have been able to adapt. In the end, successful technologies were those where human and machine worked in harmony for the benefit of wider society. But the AI revolution may be different because it could affect as many white-collar professional roles as manual jobs.
That jobs involving lower skilled office work such as data processing will be reduced seems inevitable and, indeed, is already starting to happen. But AI is also invading the realm of highly trained professionals, such as software engineers. However, it’s largely happening in a way that shows how AI will be more of a tool than a threat to skilled workers. It may become more common for professionals to be required to learn how to benefit from the power of AI, than for entire jobs to simply disappear.

Take computer programming. A longstanding dream of researchers is to develop an AI that can develop complex new software from scratch. The reality is that such a goal is probably a bit too far-fetched. The informal and subjective descriptions usually used to create briefs for programmers are just too imprecise for that.
But researchers have realised that AI can be very powerful at optimising existing software, for instance to make it faster and use less energy. Optimising software requires very specific skills, which most software developers actually don’t have. So this kind of AI could be very helpful in improving software development without threatening existing jobs.
Researchers have started to develop novel ways for AI to detect various types of software bugs in realistic scenarios. And companies such as Facebook already use AI testing tools capable of revealing software crashes, a type of bug that causes apps to abort unexpectedly. These are vital tasks given how increasingly important software is to the smooth functioning of society, yet they are currently very hard for people to carry out.
Why we should welcome AI doctors

We can predict a similar pattern in medicine. Many countries, including developed ones such as the UK, have a shortage of medical staff. For example, there are simply not enough well-trained doctors to be able to accurately diagnose the early signs of eye disease. AI could provide a solution to help human practitioners improve their capabilities. And with diagnosis taken care of, medical staff can spend more of their time actually caring for their patients.
This kind of technology could become even more helpful in countries where the number of well-trained doctors per head of population is much smaller, or for remote communities where accessing any medical advice is difficult. So the kind of research being carried out by Google DeepMind should be welcomed not feared by the medical profession.
We should use AI for the tasks that AI is good for, so that we can fill in gaps where there is a shortage of staff and where tasks cannot be easily automated. The challenge we do have is to equip students and professionals for the changes to their jobs that will occur and for the new, unknown jobs that AI will create in the future. With appropriate and timely training, fears of high-skilled job losses won’t come true, enabling society to concentrate more on the benefits that AI will bring.
The modern jobs market is very competitive and continuous professional development is already vital in many professions. In some ways, this could place us in a better position than people at the time of the industrial revolution. But current educational trends towards examinations and mechanistic thinking are movements in the wrong direction. Regurgitating facts and processing data is what machines are good for. Creativity and critical thinking, meanwhile, have never been so important for humanity.

Can We Guess It Out AI Being Not More Than A Buzzword?

We constantly get updates now and then about how the advancing technology of Artificial Intelligence is about to transform the whole industrial world in the coming next five years with significant implications about how we live and work.













Or, can it be such that it is not more than a buzzword for the field of computer science which has till now not made any kind of great leap forward in the past decade.





The view is being aired by Zia Chisti as he opines that the claims made about Artificial Intelligence is disturbing the current setup in every industry present on the earth at a very high speed.

But what is ironical is that Mr. Zia Chisti not among any of those pundits, but he is a computer scientist who has made two multi-billion dollar business and the latest one is devoted for Artificial Intelligence.

The company, Afiniti calls itself as the world’s top artificial intelligence solutions provider and caters to clients about machine learning techniques to interact with their customers.
But the founder of the firm says that the rush by large corporations is nothing to do with any kind of AI strategy up their minds but are based on current fashion over the technology rather than real problems and challenges faced by the technology.

“Really there’s nothing here that’s tremendously groundbreaking – the same principles that were at work even 40 years ago are still at work today,” he says.


He readily accepts the point that machine learning technology has leaped forward similar to the processing power.
But about Artificial Intelligence, he is very skeptical of the kind warned by the likes of Ray Kurzweil and Elon Musk in which it is being said that the machines surpass humans and will force them to leave jobs.
According to him, Artificial Intelligence means that the computers are required to acquire human characteristics such as understanding the complete meaning and context of any given situation or to become conscious.

“Nobody serious thinks we’ve made any progress on those fronts,” he says. “There’s not one person in the field that has any view that we’re any closer to generalized intelligence than we were two decades ago.”

He outrightly dismisses the IBM Watson’s mastery of the game show Jeopardy as a kind of “marketing” which has got little relevance to the one encountered in the real world deployment of artificial intelligence.
