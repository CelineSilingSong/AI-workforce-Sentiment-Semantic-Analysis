An expert on how data and algorithms are changing work responds to Janelle Shane’s “The Skeleton Crew.”
“The Skeleton Crew” asks us to consider two questions. The first is an interesting twist on an age-old thought experiment. But the second is more complicated, because the story invites us to become aware of a very real phenomenon and to consider what, if anything, should be done about the way the world is working for some people.
The first question explores what it would mean if our machines, robots, and now artificial intelligences had feelings the way we do. (Recall the Haley Joel Osment child A.I. that was created to suffer an unending love for its human mother while society dies around it.) “The Skeleton Crew” offers an interesting twist because the A.I. indeed has feelings just like us, because it is, in fact, us: The A.I. is a group of remote workers faking the operations of a haunted house to make it seem automated and intelligent.

It’s a fun take on the trope. That the A.I. actually is real people with real feelings underscores the villainy, heroism, or oblivious indifference of other characters around them. The villains interact with the A.I. in murderous ways, and their fear of it is their ultimate downfall. The badass damsel in distress graciously thanks the A.I. for saving her life before she knows that it’s humans. The billionaire is oblivious to the actual workings of this world he’s created, whether it is shoddy A.I. or real people, and he ghosts as soon as his moneymaking is in question. Interestingly, the crowds of people who go through the haunted house seem most interested in seeing whether they can break the A.I. and prove it’s not actually intelligent (recall the Microsoft Tay release). Perhaps this represents our human bravado, wanting to prove we’re a little harder to replace than A.I. tech companies think we are.

The second question, less familiar and comfortable, is queued up when Bud Crack, the elderly Filipino remote team manager, says to his team: “I’m trying to explain things to them. What we are. They’re confused.”
Before “they”—those operating in expected, visible roles in society—can offer any kind of assistance, they need to wrap their minds around the very existence of remote workers faking the operations of A.I. In this case, the 911 operator has to get from her belief that “the House of A.I. is run by an advanced artificial intelligence” to a new understanding that there is a frantic remote worker in New Zealand who has been remotely controlling the plastic Closet Skeleton in the House of A.I. and is now the only person in the world with (remote) eyes on a dangerous situation.

This fictional moment mirrors an actual reality that is detailed in the award-winning book Ghost Work by Mary Gray, an anthropologist at Microsoft Research and a 2020 MacArthur Fellow, and Siddharth Suri, a computer scientist at Microsoft Research. Ghost work refers to actual, in-the-flesh human beings sitting in their homes doing actual paid work to make A.I. systems run. Most machine learning models today use supervised learning, where the model learns how to make correct decisions from a dataset that has been labeled by people. Ghost work refers to the paid, piecework data labeling that humans do so the models can learn correct decisions: for instance, labeling images, flagging X-rated content, tagging text or audio content, proofreading, and much more. You may have done some of this data labeling work for free by completing a reCAPTCHA identifying all the bikes or traffic lights in a photo in order to sign in to different websites.

The decade or so of academic research emerging around this topic gives an opportunity to understand these work conditions as well as the experiences of people who go into and out of participation in these platforms. Three themes connect into the “Skeleton Crew” story, and offer some visibility into this work experience.
First, many but not all of these work settings are subject to “algorithmic management,” which includes functions such as automated hiring and termination and also gamification of performance evaluation, with scores linked to wages. Here in Silicon Valley, such automated management functions are framed as enabling “scale,” because human supervisors or evaluators are no longer needed. In “The Skeleton Crew,” the automated management functions that monitored the workers’ success at scaring visitors, among other things, had a “hostility that was rivaled only by [the] profound shoddiness.” In the story, as in many settings, people working on these platforms experience autotermination with no recourse as particularly cruel. I suspect many of us have encountered some form of “algorithmic cruelty,” such as getting locked out of an online account or getting scammed by a fake flower website, with no options for recourse, no phone number to call, no humans to talk to. Now imagine that your income and livelihood were subject to such automated systems and dehumanizing responses. Or, per Hatim Rahman’s research, imagine losing income and professional status on an automated platform for reasons that will never be explained to you and indeed seem to be intentionally opaque. “The Skeleton Crew” suggests that the shoddy systems and dehumanizing treatment are completely unnecessary and almost puzzlingly so, perhaps because the billionaire company needed to pretend like there were not humans operating the system. The real-world examples of people or companies faking A.I. operations are strange, but not uncommon. One New Zealand company seems to have faked a digital A.I. assistant for doctors, with nonsensical interfaces such as clients needing to email the A.I. system. The founders chided a questioning reporter for choosing “not to believe.” But companies don’t have to make explicitly false claims about A.I. to engage in ghost work. Some academics and activists, including Lilly Irani, have argued that many human-in-the-loop automated systems such as Amazon Mechanical Turk rely on the invisibility of the people involved because it seems to make the technology appear more advanced and autonomous than it actually is, and the rhetoric and system design try to create invisibility of the human work.

Second, despite some of these cultural conditions and system designs, these work settings, like almost any, are collaborative and social and meaningful. Take, for example, the Uber and Lyft drivers banding together to game the algorithmically managed prices. Such collaboration is common, even on the purposefully individualistic crowd platforms. Another of Gray and Suri’s research papers showed the collaboration network created by people working on Amazon Mechanical Turk, where they as “crowdworkers” collaborated to ensure best wages and create social connections (see also the Turkopticon system). Similarly, the Skeleton Crew actively collaborated to create workarounds within the dysfunctional system, including dividing up the Closet Skeleton shifts because the gamified “Scare-O-Meter” was so bad for this role that it typically meant no wages (until, hilariously, one of them realized the Scare-O-Meter registered a mop as a frightened human face and the whole team could get paid for Closet Skeleton shifts again). Because of their collaboration and how they had “clawed their way together” through this bizarre system, it would have been catastrophic to lose a co-worker in what might seem like individualistic jobs.

Third, “The Skeleton Crew” gives insight into these work worlds through its lively examples of how amazingly good humans are at improvisation and at developing situated expertise, capabilities that remain difficult for automated systems. Lucy Suchman and colleagues have several books and articles that analyze humans’ improvisation and situated expertise, and “The Skeleton Crew” illustrates these ideas with fun details: The team figures out how far the Dragonsulla has advanced through the haunted house by spotting a bit of her star eyeshadow in the malfunctioning bizarro A.I. profiles on the wall; Cheesella knows she can eject one of her cheap plastic skeleton hands to distract the bad guys and also thinks to pull the fire alarm when she realizes her remote-controlled skeleton self has no way of communicating with the people in the room. The Skeleton Crew’s understanding of the idiosyncratic context, and the collaborative improvisation that it took for its members to expertly use the setting to thwart the attack, offers a fun and realistic take on how groups of people work together, even when completely remote and even when mediated through virtual communication.

These themes in the story give us insight into these work conditions and start us thinking on the more complicated second question the story asks us to consider: As society begins to better see and understand the potential cruelties of ghost work conditions, is there anything that can to be done? Gray sometimes likens the current moment to when society began to really understand the realities of child labor and the urgent need for more protective laws. She argues that what is needed is regulation—specifically, regulation that recognizes a  new “form of employment that does not fit in full-time employment or fully in part-time employment or even clearly in self-employment.” Such regulations involve getting the new classification of employment right, and also ensuring needed provisions and benefits for all kinds of relevant work, even as technologies and jobs and employment statuses change. Pressing for this new employment classification, and related provisions and regulations, requires us to see work conditions that have not been easily visible, and also for companies to recognize that these are not merely temporary work conditions “on the way to automation” and to take action. Hopefully “The Skeleton Crew” helps begin or continue this awareness and conversation.

Artificial intelligence is a data hog; effectively building and deploying AI and machine learning systems require large data sets. “The development of a machine learning algorithm depends on large volumes of data, from which the learning process draws many entities, relationships, and clusters,” says Philip Russom of TDWI. “To broaden and enrich the correlations made by the algorithm, machine learning needs data from diverse sources, in diverse formats, about diverse business processes.”


At the same time, AI itself can be instrumental in identifying and preparing the data needed to increase the value of AI-driven or analytics-driven systems. Companies have needed cadres of data scientists or high-level analysts to put AI and machine learning algorithms in place, AI itself may ultimately help automate such roles to a large degree.

“A new generation of enterprise analytics is emerging, and it incorporates some degree of both automation and contextual information,” according to Tom Davenport and Joey Fitts, writing in Harvard Business Review. AI-enhanced analytics systems “can prepare insights and recommendations that can be delivered directly to decision makers without requiring an analyst to prepare them in advance.”

PROMOTED
Business intelligence analysts and quantitative professionals “will still have important tasks to perform, but many will no longer have to provide support and training to amateur data users,” according to Davenport and Fitts. “Small to mid-size businesses that haven’t been able to afford data scientists will be able to analyze their own data with higher precision and clearer insight. All that will matter to organizations’ analytical prowess will be a cultural appetite for data, a set of transactional systems that generate data to be analyzed, and a willingness to invest in and deploy these new technologies.”

Of course, the ability to effectively automate data science tasks depends on industry and circumstances. As Matt Przybyla, senior data scientist and author of Toward Data Science, points out, there often still needs to be trained human guidance to AI and machine learning initiatives, especially if the output is critical to the tasks at hand. “Sure, use an automated data science platform if you already have a data analyst on your team. Or, use the automated solution for predictions that are not harmful if incorrect. Categorizing clothes incorrectly is not the worst thing that can happen, but when you are in the health or finance industry and you classify a disease or large sums of money incorrectly, the harm is undeniable.”

While automated AI data science tools or platforms may be easy and powerful, they also may leave businesses with unanswered questions. “Imagine you are not a data scientist and have not had an academic background in the various types of machine learning algorithms,” Przybyla continues. “You will have to explain these platform model results and implement the suggestions or predictions with regards to your company’s integrations, which could prove to be time-consuming and difficult.”

There may be ways to automate various pieces of data science roles, but the skills category that will still be essential is that of data engineer. There are many tasks required to source, manage and store data in which data scientists don’t necessarily want to get involved. “To succeed with AI, companies should have an automation environment with reliable historian data,” a McKinsey report observes. Then, companies “will need to adapt their big data into a form that is amenable to AI, often with far fewer variables and with intelligent, first principles–based feature engineering,” the study’s authors, led by Jay Agarwal, state. Data engineering is needed to produce “smart data” to improve predictive accuracy and aids in root-cause analysis. This, along with equipping staff with the right skills, can provide services that can help increase revenues up to 15 percent, they relate.
“The most important role the most important first hire is a data engineer,” says John Mosch, senior manager of analytics, business intelligence, and data science at Cisco. “Without data, there’s nothing to do. These are the people who are going to make the data available and usable. They’re going to collect it and arrange it into a form that can be ultimately useful for analytics that ultimately is used by data scientists. A data scientist can’t find anything, can’t do anything until there’s a good set of data to work from.”
Data scientists and high-level data analysts will continue to be in demand, and are critical to helping enterprises design and test algorithms and data needed to predict trends, automate processes, understand customers, and engage with customers. However, the amount of data flowing into and through enterprises is overwhelming, as are demands for new algorithms and capabilities — beyond what a data scientist can accomplish. AI is opening the door to better and more accessible AI.

You were created to be so young.”This heartbreaking line arrives toward the end of AI: Artificial Intelligence, many centuries after David, an uncommonly sophisticated mechanical child (or “Mecha”), has embarked on a quest to become “a real boy”, like Pinocchio, and reunite with the human mother he’s been programmed to love. The years have not aged him, of course. He is eternally young, incapable of acquiring the wisdom and perspective that come with age. He can’t comprehend the passage of time, much less the absurd and quixotic nature of his mission. He just wants his mommy.Shrek at 20: an unfunny and overrated low for blockbuster animationRead moreThe purity of that feeling is something Steven Spielberg has been chasing for much of his career, how the innocence of a child is expressed through wonder on one end and intense vulnerability on the other. The magic of Spielberg’s ET the Extra Terrestrial is that it extracts tears at both ends of the spectrum, whether young Eliot is lifting off on his bicycle or connecting with his alien friend as he falls under the cold scrutiny of grown-ups. AI is much more about vulnerability than wonder, and it may be Spielberg’s darkest film, darker than Schindler’s List, which seeks out a sliver of redemption from an overwhelming historical horror. There’s a redemption arc in AI, too, but it’s as synthetic (and as real) as the android at the center of it.Though it’s been 20 years since AI polarized audiences, the genesis of the film extends another 30 years before that, when Stanley Kubrick picked up the rights to the 1969 Brian Aldiss short story Supertoys Last All Summer Long and began the slow development process that didn’t always result in an actual film. (See also: Napoleon, Aryan Papers and scores of others unrealized projects.) When the title “An Amblin/Stanley Kubrick production” comes on screen, you can anticipate the cognitive dissonance between the two film-makers: Kubrick the cold clinician, taking inventories of man’s hypocrisies and destructive nature; Spielberg the slick entertainer, a brand name in Hollywood storytelling. How could those sensibilities possibly be reconciled?That’s a rhetorical question to those who consider AI a failure, but for the others who admire it, like me, the tension between Kubrick and Spielberg results in a one-of-a-kind experience, a bleak film about human nature disguised as a sentimental science fiction fairytale. Through Spielberg’s lens, David becomes a real boy the moment Monica (Frances O’Connor) finishes the formal “imprinting” process that ends with the android calling her his mother. Kubrick reportedly never believed a child actor could play the role of David convincingly, but the way Haley Joel Osment, as David, softens his expression after that last command lays that concern to rest. He is a robot who has been programmed to love his parent and Spielberg and Osment make it impossible to think about David’s love as inauthentic, even though we’re aware that he’s just a piece of next-gen technology, the first in a line of super-toys ready for shipping.The Gepetto in this Pinocchio story is Professor Allen Hobby (William Hurt), who designs David to a fill the needs of a society in collapse. In the 22nd century, climate change has led to a rise in sea levels that has wiped out coastal cities, drastically reduced global population, and led to legal sanctions on pregnancies, since human children would tax the world’s limited resources. Monica and her husband, Henry, are chosen as the “perfect” family for David, because their son Martin has contracted a rare disease and is being kept in “suspended animation”, without much hope of recovery. The idea of replacing Martin with a like-aged robot son initially repulses Monica, but she warms to this uncanny being over time and goes through with the imprinting.The ethical question a colleague asks of Professor Hobby when he talks about his new creation hovers over the entire film: “If a robot could genuinely love a person, what responsibility does that person hold to that Mecha in return?” Humankind is used to the answer being “none at all”, as we learn later when outdated robots are rounded up at Flesh Fairs, which are like monster truck rallies where people cheer at the destruction of technologies that have clearly made their lives worse. But the time between when Monica does the imprinting and when she tearfully leaves David in the woods is the most important and powerful stretch of the film. Monica is playing pretend with David, taking comfort in the maternal rituals that Martin’s absence has denied her. But pretend for long enough and maybe it doesn’t feel like pretend any more.View image in fullscreenSteven Spielberg on the set. Photograph: APThat’s how the movies work, too, right? That’s how we ache for David when Monica and Henry’s real son returns and a hoped-for sibling relationship goes sour, culminating at a birthday party when David nearly drowns Martin in a swimming accident. Spielberg doesn’t even have to hide David’s synthetic qualities all that much – the meals that he fake eats, his weird laughing outbursts, his blank does-not-compute expression whenever he’s confused – because we accept the premise that he loves his mother. As consumers of fiction, we get emotionally invested in unreal characters all the time, and they don’t have to be human beings when they’re creatures as sincere and pitiable as David.The middle section of AI follows David (and his adorable Teddy Ruxpin-like toy companion) in his quest to find “Blue Fairy” that will turn him into a real boy, which leads him to cross paths with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a Mecha prostitute on the run from a murder setup. If this is a Pinocchio story, then the entire second act has the nightmarish quality of Pleasure Island, that lawless place in the 1940 Disney film where boys smoke cigars, engage in various vices, and eventually turn into braying donkeys. We realize that Monica and Henry are among the privileged few and that society-at-large has become a Pleasure Island of cheap pleasures meant to salve deep wounds and resentments. This is no place for a boy like David. It’s no place for anyone. And it may be what the future holds for us.The end of AI is the most misunderstood part of the film, perhaps because it seems like Spielberg is engineering a happy ending when it’s really much more on the bitter side of bittersweet. The last third is a mirror reflection of the first third, a day-in-the-life ritual of a mother-son relationship, only this time the mother is the more synthetic being of the two. Neither of them have a future, together or apart. Both were consigned to obsolescence long ago, along with the entire human race and planet at large.But they can fake it so real. And, in the hands of Steven Spielberg, one of the great movie fantasists, we can pretend along with them.Explore more on these topicsAISteven SpielbergJude LawStanley KubrickScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedRepublican convention day three: JD Vance to speak as focus turns to foreign policy‘Some of the most shocking photographs ever taken’ – The Camera Never Lies reviewJon Stewart on Trump assassination attempt: ‘We dodged a catastrophe’Who is Usha Vance, the Indian American lawyer married to JD Vance?LiveBiden says he’d consider withdrawing from 2024 race if ‘medical condition’ emerges – live",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP) has studied the awareness and image of artificial intelligence among the French. The main question around which the study revolves is the following: “How do the French perceive artificial intelligence? One of the findings shows that the French are aware of the important role that AI plays in economic life and trust it, but say they are poorly informed about the possibilities that this technology can bring.

The omnipresence of artificial intelligence in the consciousness of individuals
In the survey proposed by IFOP, the first point put forward is the ubiquity of artificial intelligence since 91% of the individuals questioned have already heard about it. One French person out of two claims to know what it is precisely, but only 27% of them have already used services or products that exploit AI in their personal life. As soon as one is interested in professional life, the figure drops (16%). IFOP states:
“These figures reveal a significant gap between the perception that the French have of artificial intelligence and the actual use they have of it. Because as soon as you use your smartphone or take advantage of a streaming platform, AI is present. So it seems that the French have difficulty identifying it.”

In the 91% of individuals, almost all are aware of being uninformed on the subject and more than two-thirds of French people want to be more aware, an increase of 8% (58% vs. 66%) compared to 2018. The sectors where lack of awareness of AI seems to be present are health (66%), the environment (69%) and education (70%).
However, 76% of the French are convinced that AI will play an important role in our daily lives in the years to come: a figure that is 22% higher than in 2019.
Artificial intelligence: indispensable and positive on work performance

45% of those questioned believe that AI is indispensable and are therefore aware that its development is crucial and that whatever happens, many of them will be impacted. In the context of their working lives, roughly the same proportion of individuals (44%) consider that AI has a fairly positive impact on work performance, on the development of skills (42%) and on well-being at work (40%), figures that are up by three to four points compared to 2019.
At the same time, 42% of respondents believe that AI will have a rather negative impact on the sustainability of their jobs. A result that could be correlated with another study conducted by Botnation among consumers and professionals.
The importance of trusted artificial intelligence in the eyes of the French

For 73% of the French, the development of trusted AI is an important issue. Compared to 2019, those surveyed trust it more (64% vs. 58% in 2019). 21% of them have a better opinion of AI since the beginning of the health crisis related to COVID-19 and 47% think it is becoming more important in the health sector.
In comparison, 24% of French people are wary of AI and think there may be a risk of misuse, while 20% think there are risks related to data protection and loss of know-how. To conclude, Agnès Van de Walle, President of the Impact AI collective and Director of Partners and Start-ups Microsoft France, spoke about this study and responsible AI:
“If the health crisis has accelerated the uses of digital technology, this new edition of the Impact AI barometer shows that it has also contributed to the evolution of the French people’s perception of artificial intelligence. Whether in their professional or private spheres, the majority of French people now consider AI as a way to progress, as long as these uses are made in a framework of trust. In this sense, our collective has already been committed for 3 years to the development of a responsible AI which represents a major issue for the French and society as a whole.”

As part of this survey, 1,524 French people were questioned: 1,017 individuals representative of the French population aged over 18 as well as 507 employees representative of French working life.

A Moral Question: Gender and (Re)production in A.I. Artificial Intelligence 20 Years Later

Steven Spielberg






Originally to be helmed by Stanley Kubrick before the baton was passed over to Steven Spielberg, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is emblazoned with visual motifs indicative of both filmmakers’ catalogs. Though Kubrick died two years before the film’s release, the distinct essence of both filmmakers is palpable due to Spielberg’s script closely following the original treatment from Kubrick’s fledgling work on the project in the ‘70s. Though many critics have unduly attributed certain aspects of A.I.’s contrasting tone of surreal, uncanny darkness and whimsical adventure to the wrong directors, the exploration of these two realms and the moral dilemmas they pose on a futuristic, dystopian level are never more tangible than when delving into the construction of gender.
Against public misconception, Spielberg remains faithfully fixated on the sinister ethical conundrums presented in A.I., unsettling audiences with the implications of this far-off 2141 society outsourcing human emotions to machines. During the opening sequence of the film, an otherwise supplementary character simply credited as “female colleague” (April Grace) raises an uncomfortable philosophical question. This inquiry emerges in response to a presentation by Professor Allen Hobby (William Hurt), lead scientist of Cybertronics of New Jersey, who aims to build a robot child model who will eternally and “genuinely love the parent or parents that it imprints on.”
“If a robot could genuinely love a person, what responsibility does that person hold toward that mecha in return?” she interjects. “It’s a moral question, isn’t it?”
Professor Hobby pauses. “In the beginning, didn’t God create Adam to love him?”
The resulting mecha child is David (Haley Joel Osment), a prototype given a trial run in the household of Cybertronics employee Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) and his wife Monica (Frances O’Connor). The couple are selected for beta testing due to the fact that their own child, Martin (Jake Thomas) is in a state of suspended animation via cryogenic freezing due to a mysterious illness for which modern medicine currently has no cure.
Despite her initial discomfort around David, Monica begins to treat him as a son—even gifting him Teddy (voiced by Jack Angel), a “supertoy” stuffed bear equipped with a capacity for language and play. Despite being told that the process is irreversible barring David’s destruction, Monica triggers the mecha-boy’s imprinting protocol—thus committing David to an existence centered around unconditional love for her as his “Mommy.” Though David’s company brings much-needed solace to the grieving mother, it’s clear that her love for the manufactured child is nowhere near as irrevocable as his automated love for her. Shortly after imprinting, David’s place in the Swinton home is quickly made redundant when Martin unexpectedly recovers and returns. After a series of escalating accidents occur as a result of a competition between the two boys for Monica’s affection, Henry demands that she return David to Cybertronics headquarters for destruction. Heartbroken by David’s innocence and unyielding adoration, Monica opts to abandon him in the wilderness surrounding the corporation’s entrance. Tears in her eyes, Monica’s last words to David are, “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the world.”
The world in question is one that exists well after the most cataclysmic events of global warming have taken place, obliterating coastal cities like New York, Venice and Amsterdam. Ensuing global poverty and a population boom prompts governments in the “developed world” to place strict sanctions to license pregnancies. Presumably, this is why Monica is unable to have another child after Martin—it is illegal for her to become pregnant. In this sense, robots “were so essential an economic link in the chain mail of society,” as the opening voiceover explains, because they allowed the affluent to circumvent the restrictions curbing reproductive rights on a national scale.
The intersection of gender and artificial intelligence has been a prevalent throughline within science fiction, appearing on film in titles such as Blade Runner (1982), Cherry 2000 (1988), Ghost in the Shell (1995) and Ex Machina (2014). Furthermore, Blade Runner director Ridley Scott has a vested interest in understanding the role of motherhood within the genre, including these themes in both his directorial breakthrough Alien (1979) and the 2020 HBO show he executive produced and partially directed, Raised by Wolves. Questions of exploitation and autonomy are intrinsically linked to the production of artificially intelligent beings—particularly when they resemble human women—because of the gendered oppression faced by the very people they are made in the likeness of. When sex, home-rearing and other preconceived “duties” meant to be fulfilled by women are outsourced to non-human beings who merely resemble them, the same subjugation continues to exist.
In A.I., this complication is cleverly inverted. Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a charismatic “lover bot” programmed to be a safe and sensual hourly companion, understands that his relationship to his human clients is tenuous and solely for their benefit. He becomes David’s starkly adult counterpart after they both escape destruction at an anti-mecha “Flesh Fair” shortly after he is abandoned by Monica. When David becomes convinced that the Blue Fairy he remembers from Monica’s reading of Pinocchio will turn him into a “real boy” as she did the titular wooden marionette, Joe asserts that she can likely be found in Rouge City, a seedy spot where human vice (and robot-aided satiation of these vices) reigns supreme.
When addressing a car-load of adolescent boys he hopes will give him and David a lift to Rouge City, he delivers a more than compelling sales pitch. “There are girls your age who are just like me,” he explains. “We are the guiltless pleasures of the lonely human being. You’re not gonna get us pregnant or have us to supper with Mommy and Daddy. We work under you, we work on you and we work for you.”
The emphasis is on the transactional aspect of labor which has come to be outsourced to mecha: Sex workers, nannies and house cleaners included. These often precarious occupations have essentially omitted human exploitation by creating robots to serve these roles, yet the prejudices and dangers surrounding these services still remain. When Joe is framed for murdering a client earlier in the film, the material drawbacks of this subservient existence are made profoundly clear. With no protections or autonomy, Joe is forced to go on the run—which is how he ended up in the nefarious flesh fair with David in the first place.
In her revolutionary 1991 essay “A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century,” theorist Donna Haraway argues that a cyborgian existence—patently non-human and thus transcendent of all man-made systems of oppression—should indeed be one of inherent liberation.
“The machine is not an ‘it’ to be animated, worshipped, and dominated,” she writes. “The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for boundaries; we are they.”
Haraway’s blatantly utopian vision of how women and people of color would benefit from being relieved from the structural oppression of humanity’s (and above all, Western colonialism’s) rule, is responded to in A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The film argues that the systems in place are in no position to be shifted or altered in the wake of powerful corporations wielding artificial life in order to serve “the human race in all the multiplicity of daily life.” Yet Haraway understands that when the power structure is not thoroughly obliterated, the distribution of power—particularly along gender lines—will continue to play out as they have for centuries. In essence, A.I. unravels what will occur to a society that never reckons with the inequalities of its social stratification—meanwhile, Haraway offers an idyllic blueprint for how the upheaval of this inequitable system would dramatically alter and empower the lives of marginalized individuals.
“Every story that begins with original innocence and privileges the return to wholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation, separation, the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation,” Harroway writes. “These plots are ruled by a reproductive politics—rebirth without flaw, perfection, abstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off, but all agree they have less selfhood, weaker individuation, more fusion to the oral, to Mother, less at stake in masculine autonomy.”
In this sense, both David and Monica exist within a system which devalues both of their multifaceted natures. Monica is only seen as fulfilled when she assumes the role of mother and nurturer; meanwhile, David’s “original innocence” is rendered without purpose when abandoned by the caretaker he imprinted on. Within the confines of the nuclear familial structure, both are stripped of true individuality and the ability to forge a new path for themselves.
Even when David supposedly overrides his internal circuitry—which was created to hinder his ability to make decisions and “follow his dreams”—it is with the resolute goal of finding the Blue Fairy, so that he can become a “real boy” for Monica. Frustrated with David’s lack of understanding, Gigolo Joe makes one final plea for David to abandon his plight before traveling to the perilous submerged island of Manhattan where he believes the mythical mother figure to reside.
“[Monica] loves what you do for her, as my customers love what it is I do for them,” he begins. “But she does not love you, David. She cannot love you. You are neither flesh nor blood…[Humans] made us too smart, too quick and too many. We are suffering for the mistakes they made because when the end comes, all that will be left is us. That’s why they hate us.”
Joe’s words ring true right up to the emotion-shattering conclusion of A.I. Artificial Intelligence (though the entire film, admittedly, induces tears throughout). When David and Teddy travel through the flooded ruins of New York, they eventually stumble upon a gorgeous ceramic statue of the Blue Fairy in the aquatic rubble of Coney Island, a discovery which David becomes so obsessed and entranced with that he remains in her presence for 2,000 years, long after the power supply of his amphibious vessel has completely depleted. At this point, advanced mecha are the only remaining inhabitants of an Earth clutched by glacial freeze. It is they who discover David and Teddy in the icy depths, eventually housing them in a simulation of the Swinton household recreated via David’s stored memories. The advanced beings explain to David that he is the last remaining tether to human life and connection. Yet in lieu of focusing on the immense cruelty he and other mecha suffered at the hands of vindictive humans, David begs the beings to utilize their advanced technology to bring Monica back from the dead, presenting a lock of her hair as a means to harvest her DNA.
“All we want is for your happiness,” the advanced robots concede. Monica is only able to be brought back to life for one full day, after which she will die. David proceeds to spend the happiest day of his life with a reincarnated Monica—then goes on to defy the laws of his very programming, dying by her side that night.
“For the first time in his life,” Ben Kingsley’s narration concludes as David shuts his eyes for the first and only time during the film’s duration, “he went to that place where dreams are made of.”
Ironically, it is through death that David finds ultimate freedom from the brutal margins of his creation. Though this is not seen as “survival” in the literal sense, it is an act of self-determination that truly echoes the thesis of Haraway’s essay. “Cyborg writing is about the power to survive,” she writes, “not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as ‘other.’”
Conversely, Monica cannot escape the narrow identity of Mother even by means of resurrection. Though the bleakness of A.I.’s ending in large part stems from the tragedy of David’s self-induced slumber, there remains a distinct streak of melancholy when it comes to Monica’s own inability to escape the narrow label of Mother even when given life anew. In fact, there is little about her existence that is removed from her duties as wife and mother. Despite the inescapable presence of the nuclear family and dominant view of women as innately reproductive and servile, the film’s depiction of traditional gender roles outliving major coastal cities in the post-apocalypse is particularly salient.
However, Monica’s pleasant last day on Earth with David is not entirely depressing. Haraway argues that by being “out of place” (i.e. stripped from the hierarchy of her traditional family structure) and reuniting with David (“the machine”), she herself is able to engage in a cyborgian inversion of feminine expectations of child-rearing: “Up till now…female embodiment seemed to mean skill in mothering and its metaphoric extensions. Only by being out of place could we take intense pleasure in machines, and then with excuses that this was organic activity after all, appropriate to females.”
In harnessing the biological phenomenon of mortality, David extrapolates himself from an existence without control. In spite of never being recognized as a “real boy,” David is nonetheless able to free himself of the burden of eternal devotion and naivete. In turn, Monica is retroactively manufactured in order to fulfill David’s desire as a mecha, inversing the method of creation (and the enduringly misogynistic society) which produced David in the first place. This power structure is not one of force and control, but rather one created with loving intention and with objective happiness as the goal. Within this compassionate framework, conjured via the adept minds of both Kubrick and Spielberg, the cyborgian entity is truly liberated.

For the last 60 years, countless scientists and philosophers have worked hard to advance the field to what it is today. Throughout the decades, several perspectives, approaches, and paradigms have guided AI research, and very wise people have expressed their thoughts and insights about its great quest: Conquering intelligence.These insights have come to us in the form of cryptic, yet appealing phrases whose underlying meaning often escape us. We’re left there, nodding to a beautiful simplification of a complex soup of thought. But it takes expertise and years of reflection to put in a single sentence that could take a whole book. Cicero said it best, “if I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.”In this article, I selected 7 famous AI quotes from world-class experts in the field and disentangled the meanings for you.
