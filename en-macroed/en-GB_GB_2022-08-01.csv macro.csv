With more than 30,000 employees spread across more than 60 affiliate locations and 14 manufacturing sites around the world, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly operates at a truly global scale. Operating at that scale comes with issues, not the least of which is sharing accurate and timely information internally and externally.
“From internal training materials to formal, technical communications to regulatory agencies, Lilly is translating information often,” says Timothy F. Coleman, vice president and information officer for information and digital solutions at Eli Lilly and Co.
For years, Lilly relied on third-party human translation providers for the bulk of its translation needs. Although public web translation services are available, confidentiality requirements meant those services did not meet Lilly’s standards for information security. Even with a footprint of more than 400 translation vendors, the process was slow.
 
 
 













 
 

“Lilly engages with costly third-party human-translation providers across the organization to provide verified and reliable translations,” Coleman says. “Depending on the requirements, the planning, translation, and verification of these engagements can take weeks to complete.”

Coleman adds that many bilingual Lilly employees were also being tapped to provide translations in addition to their current scope of work.
To address these challenges, the pharmaceutical firm developed Lilly Translate, a home-grown IT solution that uses natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to generate content translation via a validated API layer, Coleman says.
 
 
 













 
 

“This innovative application of natural language technology enables Lilly to achieve greater efficiency gains, significant cost reduction, higher quality content, and lead the way for future tech innovations using natural language technology to achieve enterprise value at scale,” he says.
Passion project pays off
Coleman says Lilly Translate started as a passion project by a curious software engineer who had an idea for addressing a pain point of the Lilly Regulatory Affairs system portfolio: Business partners continually experienced delays and friction in translation services.
“That married up well with an opportunity to explore and learn emerging technologies,” he says. “It became a great opportunity that a Lilly software engineer picked up and ran with, initially as a great learning opportunity.”
 
 
 













 
 

After sharing the idea and technical vision with peers and managers, the project immediately garnered support from leadership at Eli Lilly Global Regulatory Affairs International, who advocated for investment in the tool. Coleman’s team worked closely with Regulatory Affairs to identify requirements around document types, languages, and so on.

The Lilly Translate API and UI are delivered via a serverless tech stack built on Node.js, Python, .NET, and Docker. It can be accessed via mobile devices, web browsers, and programmatically through the secure API.
The service, which earned Eli Lilly a CIO 100 Award in IT Excellence, provides real-time translation of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and text for users and systems, keeping document format in place. Deep learning language models trained with life sciences and Lilly content help improve translation accuracy, and Lilly is creating refined language models that recognize Lilly-specific terminology and industry-specific technical language, while maintaining the formatting requirements of regulated documentation.
 
 
 













 
 

“The product was developed via a DevSecOps agile framework,” Coleman says. “Initially, we did not have a dedicated Scrum master and product owner, but later we were able to adjust that. The increased focus helped us accelerate our delivery efforts.”
The project took about a year to get to MVP, with several iterations and pilots needed to achieve the level of translation quality needed to meet business expectations.
“The level of quality of the translation output was an initial challenge we faced where the team had to work through various services to figure out how to improve the overall general level of quality,” Coleman says. “Once improved, we had to work diligently to ramp up our [organizational change management] efforts to gain confidence in the tool.”
 
 
 













 
 

With the tool fully deployed, a process that required the creation of work orders and days or weeks to complete now takes just a few seconds or minutes. The automation has also led to a big cost savings.
“In surveys distributed across the company there is consistent feedback that Lilly Translate is saving time across multiple business processes as well as getting answers to questions faster,” Coleman says. “Lilly Translate touches every area of the company from HR to Corporate Audit Services, to Ethics and Compliance Hotlines, Finance, Sales and Marketing, Regulatory Affairs, and many others. The time savings is extensive. Translations are now taking seconds instead of weeks, providing key resources time to focus on other business-critical activities.”

Scientists and engineers are constantly developing new materials with unique properties that can be used for 3D printing, but figuring out how to print with these materials can be a complex, costly conundrum.

Often, an expert operator must use manual trial-and-error — possibly making thousands of prints — to determine ideal parameters that consistently print a new material effectively. These parameters include printing speed and how much material the printer deposits.

MIT researchers have now used artificial intelligence to streamline this procedure. They developed a machine-learning system that uses computer vision to watch the manufacturing process and then correct errors in how it handles the material in real-time.

They used simulations to teach a neural network how to adjust printing parameters to minimize error, and then applied that controller to a real 3D printer. Their system printed objects more accurately than all the other 3D printing controllers they compared it to.

The work avoids the prohibitively expensive process of printing thousands or millions of real objects to train the neural network. And it could enable engineers to more easily incorporate novel materials into their prints, which could help them develop objects with special electrical or chemical properties. It could also help technicians make adjustments to the printing process on-the-fly if material or environmental conditions change unexpectedly.

“This project is really the first demonstration of building a manufacturing system that uses machine learning to learn a complex control policy,” says senior author Wojciech Matusik, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT who leads the Computational Design and Fabrication Group (CDFG) within the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). “If you have manufacturing machines that are more intelligent, they can adapt to the changing environment in the workplace in real-time, to improve the yields or the accuracy of the system. You can squeeze more out of the machine.”

The co-lead authors on the research are Mike Foshey, a mechanical engineer and project manager in the CDFG, and Michal Piovarci, a postdoc at the Institute of Science and Technology in Austria. MIT co-authors include Jie Xu, a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science, and Timothy Erps, a former technical associate with the CDFG.

Picking parameters

Determining the ideal parameters of a digital manufacturing process can be one of the most expensive parts of the process because so much trial-and-error is required. And once a technician finds a combination that works well, those parameters are only ideal for one specific situation. She has little data on how the material will behave in other environments, on different hardware, or if a new batch exhibits different properties.

Using a machine-learning system is fraught with challenges, too. First, the researchers needed to measure what was happening on the printer in real-time.

To do this, they developed a machine-vision system using two cameras aimed at the nozzle of the 3D printer. The system shines light at material as it is deposited and, based on how much light passes through, calculates the material’s thickness.

“You can think of the vision system as a set of eyes watching the process in real-time,” Foshey says.

The controller would then process images it receives from the vision system and, based on any error it sees, adjust the feed rate and the direction of the printer.

But training a neural network-based controller to understand this manufacturing process is data-intensive, and would require making millions of prints. So, the researchers built a simulator instead.

Successful simulation

To train their controller, they used a process known as reinforcement learning in which the model learns through trial-and-error with a reward. The model was tasked with selecting printing parameters that would create a certain object in a simulated environment. After being shown the expected output, the model was rewarded when the parameters it chose minimized the error between its print and the expected outcome.

In this case, an “error” means the model either dispensed too much material, placing it in areas that should have been left open, or did not dispense enough, leaving open spots that should be filled in. As the model performed more simulated prints, it updated its control policy to maximize the reward, becoming more and more accurate.

However, the real world is messier than a simulation. In practice, conditions typically change due to slight variations or noise in the printing process. So the researchers created a numerical model that approximates noise from the 3D printer. They used this model to add noise to the simulation, which led to more realistic results.

“The interesting thing we found was that, by implementing this noise model, we were able to transfer the control policy that was purely trained in simulation onto hardware without training with any physical experimentation,” Foshey says. “We didn’t need to do any fine-tuning on the actual equipment afterwards.”

When they tested the controller, it printed objects more accurately than any other control method they evaluated. It performed especially well at infill printing, which is printing the interior of an object. Some other controllers deposited so much material that the printed object bulged up, but the researchers’ controller adjusted the printing path so the object stayed level.

Their control policy can even learn how materials spread after being deposited and adjust parameters accordingly.

“We were also able to design control policies that could control for different types of materials on-the-fly. So if you had a manufacturing process out in the field and you wanted to change the material, you wouldn’t have to revalidate the manufacturing process. You could just load the new material and the controller would automatically adjust,” Foshey says.

Now that they have shown the effectiveness of this technique for 3D printing, the researchers want to develop controllers for other manufacturing processes. They’d also like to see how the approach can be modified for scenarios where there are multiple layers of material, or multiple materials being printed at once. In addition, their approach assumed each material has a fixed viscosity (“syrupiness”), but a future iteration could use AI to recognize and adjust for viscosity in real-time.

Additional co-authors on this work include Vahid Babaei, who leads the Artificial Intelligence Aided Design and Manufacturing Group at the Max Planck Institute; Piotr Didyk, associate professor at the University of Lugano in Switzerland; Szymon Rusinkiewicz, the David M. Siegel ’83 Professor of computer science at Princeton University; and Bernd Bickel, professor at the Institute of Science and Technology in Austria.

The work was supported, in part, by the FWF Lise-Meitner program, a European Research Council starting grant, and the U.S. National Science Foundation.

As a concept, artificial intelligence is very old. My first job out of college almost 40 years ago was as an AI systems developer using Lisp. Many of the concepts from back then are still in use today. However, it’s about a thousand times less expensive now to build, deploy, and operate AI systems for any number of business purposes.
Cloud computing revolutionized AI and machine learning, not because the hyperscalers invented it but because they made it affordable. Nevertheless, I and some others are seeing a shift in thinking about where to host AI/ML processing and AI/ML-coupled data. Using the public cloud providers was pretty much a no-brainer for the past few years. These days, the valuing of hosting AI/ML and the needed data on public cloud providers is being called into question. Why?
Cost of course. Many businesses have built game-changing AI/ML systems in the cloud, and when they get the cloud bills at the end of the month, they understand quickly that hosting AI/ML systems, including terabytes or petabytes of data, is pricey. Moreover, data egress and ingress costs (what you pay to send data from your cloud provider to your data center or another cloud provider) will run up that bill significantly.











 
 
 
Companies are looking at other, more cost-effective options, including managed service providers and co-location providers (colos), or even moving those systems to the old server room down the hall. This last group is returning to “owned platforms” largely for two reasons.

First, the cost of traditional compute and storage equipment has fallen a great deal in the past five years or so. If you’ve never used anything but cloud-based systems, let me explain. We used to go into rooms called data centers where we could physically touch our computing equipment—equipment that we had to purchase outright before we could use it. I’m only half kidding.
When it comes down to renting versus buying, many are finding that traditional approaches, including the burden of maintaining your own hardware and software, are actually much cheaper than the ever-increasing cloud bills.











 
 
 
Second, many are experiencing some latency with cloud. The slowdowns happen because most enterprises consume cloud-based systems over the open internet, and the multitenancy model means that you’re sharing processors and storage systems with many others at the same time. Occasional latency can translate into many thousands of dollars of lost revenue a year, depending on what you’re doing with your specific cloud-based AI/ML system in the cloud.
Many of the AI/ML systems that are available from cloud providers are also available on traditional systems. Migrating from a cloud provider to a local server is cheaper and faster, and more akin to a lift-and-shift process, if you’re not locked into an AI/ML system that only runs on a single cloud provider.
What’s the bottom line here? Cloud computing will continue to grow. Traditional computing systems whose hardware we own and maintain, not as much. This trend won’t slow down. However, some systems, especially AI/ML systems that use a large amount of data and processing and happen to be latency sensitive, won’t be as cost-effective in the cloud. This could also be the case for some larger analytical applications such as data lakes and data lake houses.











 
 
 
Some could save half the yearly cost of hosting on a public cloud provider by repatriating the AI/ML system back on-premises. That business case is just too compelling to ignore, and many won’t.
Cloud computing prices may lower to accommodate these workloads that are cost-prohibitive to run on public cloud providers. Indeed, many workloads may not be built there in the first place, which is what I suspect is happening now. It is no longer always a no-brainer to leverage cloud for AI/ML.

A brand-new area of computer science was initially referred to as “artificial intelligence” in 1955. Many daily jobs are being replaced by artificial intelligence, requiring less human involvement. But what precisely is this new AI technology? AI refers to the process of teaching a computer system to function and think like a human brain. This is often accomplished through reinforcement learning, in which the computer learns from past errors and observed patterns. For instance, a trained model defeated the world champion in the difficult-to-learn and won a game of AlphaGO by self-training itself many times and learning from its mistakes each time it lost a game.
Applications of AI technology are rapidly gaining ground in every aspect of our daily life, just as AI is quickly transforming several sectors. People may easily carry out tasks like phoning a buddy, determining the best route to their destinations, and turning on or off electrical equipment by giving voice instructions to their virtual assistant. AI technology is also finding applications in the automotive, e-commerce, AI farming, healthcare, and several other industries.
It won’t be long before artificial intelligence (AI) technology has advanced to the point where people rely on their virtual assistants to wake us up, driverless cars to get us to work, and perhaps AI-powered robots to assist us in making decisions at work by forecasting, analyzing, and providing valuable insights. It all seems somewhat fictional when we read this, don’t you think? Thoughts of video calling were commonplace, but today everyone has access to it through their cellphones.

Human language transcription and translation into useable forms is a common and quickly expanding phenomenon today. Speech recognition services are provided by businesses like NICE, Nuance Communications, OpenText, Verint Systems, and Siri on the iPhone.
Decision Management
Organizations currently employ decision management by integrating it into their applications to drive and carry out automated decisions to increase value to the business and profitability. AI systems may be equipped with logic by artificially intelligent computers, which can then be used to teach, maintain, and tune them. Several companies offer this service, including Informatica, Advanced Systems Concepts, Maana, Pegasystems, and UiPath.
Robotic Process Automation
Robotic process automation is the automated imitation of human work that allows business processes to run more efficiently. This procedure is the main emphasis of businesses like Pega Systems, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, UiPath, and WorkFusion. It’s crucial to remember that AI in this specific field is intended to help and complement human abilities rather than replace them.
Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The study of how human languages and computers interact is known as natural language processing. It is understandable why these phrases list the top 15 hottest artificial intelligence technology. Machine learning and text analytics examine phrase structure, meaning, and purpose. This technique is commonly used in security systems and fraud detection. NLP is used by several automated programs and helpers to extract unstructured data. Among the service providers are Basis Technology, Expert System, Coveo, Indico, Knime, Lexalytics, Linguamatics, Mindbreeze, Sinequa, Stratifyd, and Synapsify.
Cyber Defense
A computer defensive mechanism known as “cyber defense” tries to identify, stop, and neutralize assaults and threats to data and system infrastructure. Learning technologies that can be used to disclose questionable user behavior and identify cyber risks can be developed using machine learning methods and neural networks that can analyze sequences of inputs.
Content Creation
Although humans who work on films, advertising, blogs, and white papers create content, companies like Hearst, USA Today, and CBS use AI to generate content. Automated Insights’ well-known Wordsmith technology uses natural language processing (NLP) to construct news articles.
Emotion Recognition
This type of AI technology allows for the reading and interpreting of human emotions utilizing sophisticated picture or audio data processing. The use of technology by law enforcement during interrogations is every day. Beyond Verbal, nViso, and Affectiva are a few businesses that employ emotion recognition.
Marketing Automation
Teams and divisions in marketing and sales have embraced AI and reaped several rewards. Automated client segmentation, customer data integration, and AI campaign management techniques are standard. AdextAI has developed into an industry leader in the use of marketing automation.
Virtual agents
The use of virtual agents by instructional designers has increased significantly. A computer program that communicates with people is referred to as a virtual agent. Web and mobile applications use chatbots as customer care representatives to communicate with people and respond to their inquiries. Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant make planning meetings and shopping easier. A virtual assistant performs similar functions to a language assistant by taking cues from your preferences and choices. IBM Watson comprehends the common customer care inquiries posed in various ways. Virtual agents function similarly to software as a service.
Machine learning systems
Artificial intelligence’s field of machine learning allows computers to interpret large data sets without explicitly training. Business decision-making is aided by machine learning when data analytics are carried out utilizing statistical models and algorithms. To gain from machine learning’s use in various fields, businesses are investing extensively in this field. To evaluate patient data for illness prediction and efficient treatment, healthcare, and the medical profession need machine learning algorithms. Machine learning is necessary for the banking and financial industries to analyze client data, discover and recommend customer investments, and reduce risk and fraud. Retailers use machine learning to analyze customer data and forecast shifting consumer preferences and behavior.
Peer-to-peer network
Without a server, the peer-to-peer network enables connections between various computers and systems for data exchange. Peer-to-peer networks can handle even the most challenging challenges. The use of cryptocurrency involves this technology. Due to the connection of individual workstations and lack of installation of servers, the implementation is cost-effective.
Deep learning systems
Deep learning is another application of artificial intelligence that uses artificial neural networks. This approach encourages machines, including computers, to learn by doing, much like people do. Deep learning has gained traction in various industries, including aerospace and defense, to recognize things from satellites, worker safety by recognizing risk occurrences when a person comes in contact with a machine, cancer cell detection, and more. Because neural networks have hidden layers, the word “deep” was created. A neural network typically contains two to three hidden layers and up to 150 hidden layers. Deep learning is effective on large amounts of data when training a model with a graphics processing unit. To automate predictive analytics, a hierarchy of algorithms is used.
AI optimized hardware
There is a huge need for artificial intelligence software in the commercial world. The requirement for hardware supporting the program grew as the software received more attention.

Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive test that measures the oxygen saturation level in a patient’s blood, and it has become an important tool for monitoring many patients, including those with Covid-19. But new research links faulty readings from pulse oximeters with racial disparities in health outcomes, potentially leading to higher rates of death and complications such as organ dysfunction, in patients with darker skin.
It is well known that non-white intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive less-accurate readings of their oxygen levels using pulse oximeters — the common devices clamped on patients’ fingers. Now, a paper co-authored by MIT scientists reveals that inaccurate pulse oximeter readings can lead to critically ill patients of color receiving less supplemental oxygen during ICU stays.
The paper, “Assessment of Racial and Ethnic Differences in Oxygen Supplementation Among Patients in the Intensive Care Unit,” published in JAMA Internal Medicine, focused on the question of whether there were differences in supplemental oxygen administration among patients of different races and ethnicities that were associated with pulse oximeter performance discrepancies. 
The findings showed that inaccurate readings of Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients resulted in them receiving less supplemental oxygen than white patients. These results provide insight into how health technologies such as the pulse oximeter contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in care, according to the researchers.
The study's senior author, Leo Anthony Celi, clinical research director and principal research scientist at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology, and a principal research scientist at the MIT Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), says the challenge is that health care technology is routinely designed around the majority population.
“Medical devices are typically developed in rich countries with white, fit individuals as test subjects,” he explains. “Drugs are evaluated through clinical trials that disproportionately enroll white individuals. Genomics data overwhelmingly come from individuals of European descent.”
“It is therefore not surprising that we observe disparities in outcomes across demographics, with poorer outcomes among those who were not included in the design of health care,"" Celi adds.
While pulse oximeters are widely used due to ease of use, the most accurate way to measure blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) levels is by taking a sample of the patient’s arterial blood. False readings of normal pulse oximetry (SpO2) can lead to hidden hypoxemia. Elevated bilirubin in the bloodstream and the use of certain medications in the ICU called vasopressors can also throw off pulse oximetry readings.
More than 3,000 participants were included in the study, of whom 2,667 were white, 207 Black, 112 Hispanic, and 83 Asian — using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care version 4, or MIMIC-IV dataset. This dataset is comprised of more than 50,000 patients admitted to the ICU at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and includes both pulse oximeter readings and oxygen saturation levels detected in blood samples. MIMIC-IV also includes rates of administration of supplemental oxygen.
When the researchers compared SpO2 levels taken by pulse oximeter to oxygen saturation from blood samples, they found that Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients had higher SpO2 readings than white patients for a given blood oxygen saturation level measured in blood samples. The turnaround time of arterial blood gas analysis may take from several minutes up to an hour. As a result, clinicians typically make decisions based on pulse oximetry reading, unaware of its suboptimal performance in certain patient demographics.
Eric Gottlieb, the study’s lead author, a nephrologist, a lecturer at MIT, and a Harvard Medical School fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, called for more research to be done, in order to better understand “how pulse oximeter performance disparities lead to worse outcomes; possible differences in ventilation management, fluid resuscitation, triaging decisions, and other aspects of care should be explored. We then need to redesign these devices and properly evaluate them to ensure that they perform equally well for all patients.”
Celi emphasizes that understanding biases that exist within real-world data is crucial in order to better develop algorithms and artificial intelligence to assist clinicians with decision-making. “Before we invest more money on developing artificial intelligence for health care using electronic health records, we have to identify all the drivers of outcome disparities, including those that arise from the use of suboptimally designed technology,” he argues. “Otherwise, we risk perpetuating and magnifying health inequities with AI.”
Celi described the project and research as a testament to the value of data sharing that is the core of the MIMIC project. “No one team has the expertise and perspective to understand all the biases that exist in real-world data to prevent AI from perpetuating health inequities,” he says. “The database we analyzed for this project has more than 30,000 credentialed users consisting of teams that include data scientists, clinicians, and social scientists.”
The many researchers working on this topic together form a community that shares and performs quality checks on codes and queries, promotes reproducibility of the results, and crowdsources the curation of the data, Celi says. “There is harm when health data is not shared,” he says. “Limiting data access means limiting the perspectives with which data is analyzed and interpreted. We've seen numerous examples of model mis-specifications and flawed assumptions leading to models that ultimately harm patients.”

Press Mentions


Associated PressPrincipal research scientist Leo Anthony Celi speaks with Associated Press reporter Maddie Burakoff about how pulse oximeters can provide inaccurate readings in patients of color. Celi highlights how oxygen levels can also be measured by drawing blood out of an artery in the wrist, the “gold standard” for accuracy, but a method that is a a bit trickier and more painful.

ReutersPrincipal Research Scientist Leo Anthony Celi oversaw a study which found that people of color were given significantly less supplemental oxygen than white people because of inaccuracies in pulse oximeter readings, reports Nancy Lapid for Reuters. “Nurses and doctors make the wrong decisions and end up giving less oxygen to people of color because they are fooled [by incorrect readings from pulse oximeters],” says Celi.
