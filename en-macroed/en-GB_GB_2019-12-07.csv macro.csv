These companies are AI trailblazers and embrace AI to provide next-level products and services. Here are 10 of the best examples of how these companies are using artificial intelligence in practice.
The 10 Best Examples Of How Companies Use Artificial Intelligence In PracticeAdobe Stock

1.   Alibaba

Chinese company Alibaba is the world's largest e-commerce platform that sells more than Amazon and eBay combined. Artificial intelligence (AI) is integral in Alibaba’s daily operations and is used to predict what customers might want to buy. With natural language processing, the company automatically generates product descriptions for the site. Another way Alibaba uses artificial intelligence is in its City Brain project to create smart cities. The project uses AI algorithms to help reduce traffic jams by monitoring every vehicle in the city. Additionally, Alibaba, through its cloud computing division called Alibaba Cloud, is helping farmers monitor crops to improve yield and cuts costs with artificial intelligence.

2.   Alphabet – Google

Alphabet is Google’s parent company. Waymo, the company’s self-driving technology division, began as a project at Google. Today, Waymo wants to bring self-driving technology to the world to not only to move people around, but to reduce the number of crashes. Its autonomous vehicles are currently shuttling riders around California in self-driving taxis. Right now, the company can’t charge a fare and a human driver still sits behind the wheel during the pilot program. Google signaled its commitment to deep learning when it acquired DeepMind. Not only did the system learn how to play 49 different Atari games, the AlphaGo program was the first to beat a professional player at the game of Go. Another AI innovation from Google is Google Duplex. Using natural language processing, an AI voice interface can make phone calls and schedule appointments on your behalf. Learn even more about how Google is incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning into operations.

3.   Amazon
Not only is Amazon in the artificial intelligence game with its digital voice assistant, Alexa, but artificial intelligence is also part of many aspects of its business. Another innovative way Amazon uses artificial intelligence is to ship things to you before you even think about buying it. They collect a lot of data about each person’s buying habits and have such confidence in how the data they collect helps them recommend items to its customers and now predict what they need even before they need it by using predictive analytics. In a time when many brick-and-mortar stores are struggling to figure out how to stay relevant, America’s largest e-tailer offers a new convenience store concept called Amazon Go. Unlike other stores, there is no checkout required. The stores have artificial intelligence technology that tracks what items you pick up and then automatically charges you for those items through the Amazon Go app on your phone. Since there is no checkout, you bring your own bags to fill up with items, and there are cameras watching your every move to identify every item you put in your bag to ultimately charge you for it.

4.   Apple
Apple, one of the world’s largest technology companies, selling consumer electronics such as iPhones and Apple Watches, as well as computer software and online services. Apple uses artificial intelligence and machine learning in products like the iPhone, where it enables the FaceID feature, or in products like the AirPods, Apple Watch, or HomePod smart speakers, where it enables the smart assistant Siri. Apple is also growing its service offering and is using AI to recommend songs on Apple Music, help you find your photo in the iCloud, or navigate to your next meeting using Maps.

5.   Baidu
The Chinese equivalent of Google, Baidu, uses artificial intelligence in many ways. They have a tool called Deep Voice that uses artificial intelligence and deep learning that only needs 3.7 seconds of audio to clone a voice. They use this same technology to create a tool that reads books to you in the author’s voice—all automated with no recording studio necessary.

6.   Facebook
One of the primary ways Facebook uses artificial intelligence and deep learning is to add structure to its unstructured data. They use DeepText, a text understanding engine, to automatically understand and interpret the content and emotional sentiment of the thousands of posts (in multiple languages) that its users publish every second. With DeepFace, the social media giant can automatically identify you in a photo that is shared on their platform. In fact, this technology is so good, it’s better at facial recognition than humans. The company also uses artificial intelligence to automatically catch and remove images that are posted on its site as revenge porn.
7.   IBM
IBM has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence for years. It's been more than 20 years since IBM's Deep Blue computer became the first to conquer a human world chess champion. The company followed up that feat with other man vs. machine competitions, including its Watson computer winning the game show Jeopardy. The latest artificial intelligence accomplishment for IBM is Project Debater. This AI is a cognitive computing engine that competed against two professional debaters and formulated human-like arguments.
8.   JD.com
JD.com is the Chinese version of Amazon. Its founder Richard Liu expects and is driving toward having his company be 100% automated in the future. Right now, its warehouse is already fully automated, and they have been making drone deliveries of packages for the last four years. JD.com is driving business with artificial intelligence revolution, big data, and robotics while building the retail infrastructure for the 4th industrial revolution.
9.   Microsoft
Artificial intelligence is a term that appears on Microsoft's vision statement, which illustrates the company’s focus on having smart machines central to everything they do. They are incorporating intelligent capabilities to all its products and services, including Cortana, Skype, Bing, and Office 365, and are one of the world's biggest AI as a Service (AIaaS) vendors.
10. Tencent
Chinese social media company Tencent has incorporated artificial intelligence into its operations in its quest to become ""the most respected internet enterprise,"" Tencent relies on artificial intelligence. It has 1 billion users on its app WeChat, but has extended its reach to gaming, digital assistants, mobile payments, cloud storage, live streaming, sports, education, movies, and even self-driving cars. One of the company's slogans is ""AI in all."" Tencent acquires huge amounts of information and insights about its customers that it processes and leverages to the company’s advantage.

Hardly a week goes by without a report announcing the end of work as we know it.
In 2013, Oxford University academics Carl Frey and Michael Osborne were the first to capture this anxiety in a paper titled: “The Future of Employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?”.
They concluded 47% of US jobs were threatened by automation. Since then, Frey has taken multiple opportunities to repeat his predictions of major labour market disruptions due to automation. 
In the face of threats to employment, some progressive thinkers advocate jettisoning our work ethic and building a world without work. 
If machines can do our work, why not reduce the working week drastically? We should be mature enough to decide what truly matters to us, without tying our identity to a job, or measuring happiness in dollars and professional status. Right?
Not quite. 
The reality is that work is tied to our constitution as a species. And this fact is too often overlooked in discussions about the future of work.  
Work is a feature of the human species
Recent studies have raised alarms that advances in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will leave all sectors open to the threat of machines replacing human workers.
The power of AI will supposedly, according to these studies, even make high-skilled specialists redundant - threatening medical practitioners, bank associates, and legal professionals.

      The benefits of job automation are not likely to be shared equally




Predictions about the rise of the robots 
either take a pessimistic stance, focusing on disruptions to economic organisations, or view “undoing work” as an opportunity to move to a fairer social model.
However, these views disregard the central role work has played in humanity’s development.
Working on environments
Philosophers including Karl Marx, Henri Bergson, and John Dewey argued that working is a defining trait of humans.  
Findings over the past two decades have confirmed that features of modern Homo sapiens are directly tied to their tendency to work. 
Three basic ideas of the old philosophers are reaffirmed by contemporary research in archaeology, anthropology and genetics.
First, humans haven’t evolved to fit into their environments as seamlessly as other animals. Humans have had to compensate for a lack of fit. 
They did this by learning about the ecosystems around them, the plants and animals they could eat, and the natural processes they could use, or should avoid. This knowledge was applied to create instruments, tools and weapons.

      Resume robot wars: how employees could match employers' use of tech in job applications




Very early on, humans mobilised their knowledge and skills to shape their immediate surroundings and become the dominant animal. 
Knowledge of nature, technical skills and intervention in the environment are all characteristics of humans’ capacity to work. These allowed us to adapt to highly diverse geographies and climates.
Working on ourselves, and with others
Each new generation has to learn the skills and knowledge that will enable it to sustain its particular mode of survival. 
Australian philosopher Kim Sterelny has shown in detail how evolution selected genetic traits that sustain humans’ capacity to learn, specifically by enhancing social behaviour and tolerance towards the young. 
And as humans worked on nature, they also worked in ways that influenced their minds, and their bodies.
It has been demonstrated that cooperation in humans reaches a level unknown in other species. This cooperative capacity has its roots in each individual’s dependency on the knowledge, skills and efforts of others. 
No human is able to sustain themself on their own, and collaboration exceeds what each person can produce alone. Even the most brilliant astrophysicist calls the plumber to fix a broken toilet. 
Humans have to work to survive, and this entails working with, and for, others.
The future of work
Acknowledging the anthropological depth of work means admitting current scenarios advocating “the end of work” are not the right answer. They take an unrealistic view of who we are. 
We need to recognise work as a human need. As Marx said: 

… labour has become not only a means of life, but life’s prime want. 

The question should not be whether there’s room for human work in an automated future. The question should be: how will human work find its place next to machines and robots?
Even if automation becomes widespread, we’ll still apply our minds, bodies and hands to productive tasks. We’ll still experiment and learn from others.
If machines could truly do all human work, then they’d make humans redundant, as 2001: A Space Odyssey anticipated back in 1968. While this isn’t a pleasant scenario, it’s not a likely one either.  
Automation might bring major social and economic disruptions in the short-term, but it won’t get rid of the need for humans to work. 




      Read more:
      Don’t be alarmed: AI won’t leave half the world unemployed




Human needs are also infinitely complex. Nobody can foretell what new activities, techniques, and consequent modes of working will fulfil future needs.
Even if we reject the modern work ethic, we’ll still find ways to learn through action and emulate experts. 
Human intelligence is geared towards producing useful goods, so we’ll continue to look for purposeful activities, too. And we’ll seek collaboration with others for mutual benefit. 
This is the influence of work on us. We are heir to thousands of years of evolution, and it would be pretentious to assume evolution could stop with us.

We’ve been told that there is nothing to worry about artificial intelligence, robots and technology. New technologies will only replace mundane, repetitive jobs and free up workers to do more meaningful work, claims the media and top management consulting firms.


Last week, the House Financial Services Committee’s Task Force on Artificial Intelligence conducted a meeting with university academics and Wall Street financial services professionals to discuss the impact of AI on trading, robo-advisory, market surveillance and other activities within the financial services sector. To set the tone, the report by Wells Fargo predicting 200,000 banking jobs in the U.S. will be lost over the next decade—due to the introduction of new technologies—was cited by the chairman of the AI Task Force, Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill).

According to Marcos Lopez de Prado, the former head of machine learning at AQR Capital Management, algorithms in electronic markets have already automated the jobs once dominated by thousands of traders.

Look around any trading floor today and you’ll only hear a slight hum and see the flickering lights of the Bloomberg terminals and computer screens. Only a short while ago, you would have heard the the vibrant, rambunctious atmosphere of sales and traders crying out to customers and counterparts. When you see footage on cable news about the stock market, they’ll usually show a busy, open-outcry market on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. It's really a Potemkin village. The cameras shoot where there are some live traders and support staff herded into one small area. In reality, the New York Stock Exchange floor is devoid of humans and runs primarily on technology conducting the electronic trading activities. 

Lopez de Prado, who is now a Cornell University professor, testified in Washington on the adverse impact of artificial intelligence on capital markets and jobs. He spoke of the algorithms automating the jobs of traders and displacing thousands of people. Lopez de Prado told the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, “Financial machine learning creates a number of challenges for the 6.14 million people employed in the finance and insurance industry, many of whom will lose their jobs—not necessarily because they are replaced by machines, but because they are not trained to work alongside algorithms.""

Investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs, now seek people who have the math, technology, software, coding, data analytics and related skills to work along with electronic trading. The need for real-life traders are done and over with. It used to be a fantastic and well-paying job to be a trader—not any longer! There was a time when street kids from the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn could get an in on the trading floor from a father, family friend or relative. No college degrees were required. It was a rough and tumble place. If they had a knack for trading, the stomach for taking risks and a strong desire to make money, they could—and did—earn large incomes. The doors to that opportunity have now closed due to the ascension of algo-driven trading. The working-class traders are no longer welcome, but the door remains wide open for Ivy-League Ph.D.s who write the codes.

Compliance people run the risk of being replaced too. “As bad actors become more sophisticated, it is vital that financial regulators have the funding resources, technological capacity and access to AI and automated technologies to be a strong and effective cop on the beat,” said Martina Rejsjö, head of Nasdaq Surveillance North America Equities.

Nasdaq, a tech-driven trading platform, has an associated regulatory body that offers over 40 different algorithms, using 35,000 parameters, to spot possible market abuse and manipulation in real time. “The massive and, in many cases, exponential growth in market data is a significant challenge for surveillance professionals,"" Rejsjö said. “Market abuse attempts have become more sophisticated, putting more pressure on surveillance teams to find the proverbial needle in the data haystack."" In layman's terms, she believes that the future is in tech overseeing trading activities, as the human eye is unable to keep up with the rapid-fire, sophisticated global trading dominated by algorithms. 
When people say not to worry, that’s the precise time to worry. Companies—whether they are McDonald’s, introducing self-serve kiosks and firing hourly workers to cut costs, or top-tier investment banks that rely on software instead of traders to make million-dollar bets on the stock market—will continue to implement technology and downsize people in an effort to enhance profits and cut down on expenses. This trend will be hard to stop and have serious future consequences for the workers at all levels and salaries.

By now there’s no doubt we’re experiencing seismic shifts in the workplace that represent another industrial revolution. Technology has sparked quantum leaps before, but this one is different. This revolution is redefining the very nature of work, which means the professional skills required in a dynamic workplace are quickly changing, too. Meanwhile, only half of today’s chief human resources officers say they’ve built out a future workforce strategy.Dire circumstances? I don’t think so. As in any other time of great change, this presents us with a great opportunity. I believe the future of work will remain essentially human, with an (increasing) assist from technology. This isn’t a new idea. Technology has historically created more jobs than it destroyed, often helping people do their jobs better, not replacing them. In the healthcare sector, artificial intelligence isn’t taking jobs from doctors; it’s helping them better diagnose and care for their patients. Just as ATMs didn’t replace bank tellers; they freed up the tellers to do more personalized work with clients.    Today, some of the strongest cases for a machine-supported workplace involve customer service. Chatbots, for instance, can handle simple or recurring issues, curbing long hold times. Emerging technologies provide human agents more time for high-touch interactions, using exclusively human skills like communication, empathy and creativity that can not only turn a customer experience into a human experience but strengthen a business and brand. In other words, a win-win scenario.Companies are beginning to use artificial intelligence to personalize their responses to customers and talk to them where they’re most active. The result is real-time experiences that are contextualized and consistent across media, web, mobile, social and beyond.  Creatives are harnessing machine learning to make targeted content that serves the customer and the business better.  This kind of machine assistance is helping create a new model for creativity in the workplace where teams, supported by data, can create content at the speed of culture. Workflows are also changing to support this model, with insights being applied in new and agile ways. It’s still early days, and we constantly ponder what the right data is and what customers are feeling. But creatives are harnessing machine learning to make targeted content that serves the customer and the business better.    What’s more, collaboration isn’t limited to machines and people. In an ecosystem-based economy, partnering outside your organization with customers and strategic alliances can deliver big returns. Traditional boundaries between companies are disappearing, creating an unprecedented combination of new business models. Brands are transforming from being solo entities to becoming members of far-reaching ecosystems.This new world of collaborative creation is accelerating connectivity, integrating capabilities and evolving talent models to create new solutions to previously unsolved problems. Forward-looking marketers are building engagement tools that integrate cognitive capabilities to transform contextualized customer journeys across channels by actioning data insights. Growth marketers are facilitating true customer engagement and increasing lifetime value by leveraging sophisticated mar-tech stacks that unite data, insights and decisions with a focus on business impact. This modern mindset connects marketing to revenue, embeds ROI into the fabric of marketing and shares direct ownership to help organizations stay relevant to customers.What role can you play to help your workforce navigate these changes? A recent Gartner study found that only 20% of employees feel they have the skills needed for future—or even current—roles. But there’s a path forward. More than ever, professional development requires creativity, thoughtfulness and agency.    First, encourage your employees to embrace a work life of continuous learning. That is to say, one of continuous change and to seek opportunities to collaborate with peers and partners up, down and across the organization. Disruptive technologies won’t slow down or get less complex, so help them adopt an agile mindset, make time for that learning and prioritize it. Learning as they go and being adaptive to changing business needs will help them hone their skills.Next, help them understand that now more than ever they can expect to be assessed on their ability to make an impact on the business, including the ability to build strategic relationships and contribute to human-powered innovation. Then help them increase and maintain their technical fluency. Most future jobs will involve technology, so employees need to understand when and how future tech will affect the business.And finally, encourage them to embrace their creativity and humanity. Since everyone has access to raw knowledge now, IQ and content expertise are often less important than imagination, emotional intelligence, curiosity and reflection. These are exclusively human talents, and they’re often viewed as the most important assets we can bring to this new era of human and machine collaboration.    While the nature of work is changing, I believe it’s an opportunity to demonstrate how collaboration will drive inclusive growth. It’s time to take control of our own narratives and futures. Leaders can do so by designing a workplace that values and rewards creativity and discovery; workers can do it by engaging in lifelong learning, shaping their own career paths and leaning into their passions.We’re in a new industrial revolution, but look again. Treat it as your own learning revolution, and you can prepare yourself for the road ahead.

Artificial Intelligence threatens finance jobs on Wall Street

The rise of machine learning is set to reshape the workforce in the financial sector and could disrupt not only routine jobs, but also hit some of the highest paying ones.

The rise of machine learning is set to reshape the workforce in the financial sector and could disrupt not only routine jobs, but also hit some of the highest paying ones.
The warning was voiced by Dr. Marcos Lopez de Prado, professor at Cornell University’s School of Engineering, as he testified before the US House Committee on Financial Services on Friday, at a hearing to determine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on сapital markets.

https://twitter.com/AnnaAnthro/status/1203636202433327105
The professor said that, while tech firms started distributing data and crowdsourcing the jobs of data analysts through special tournaments, any investment challenge could be solved by an army of data scientists without financial background.
Thus “the highest paying jobs in finance” could be put at risk, he noted, adding that asset managers could crowdsource their entire research function, while insurance companies could do the same with their actuarial models.
“Financial ML [machine learning] creates a number of challenges for the 6.14 million people employed in the finance and insurance industry, many of whom will lose their jobs – not necessarily because they are replaced by machines, but because they are not trained to work alongside algorithms,” Lopez de Prado told the сommittee.Read more: Wall Street bigwig loses over a billion dollars after sexist comments
While some of other witnesses also voiced concerns on how automated markets are reshaping the workforce, other invited specialists in investment and finance believe that AI could unlock many opportunities. One thing is clear, while the sphere is going to change, the question is if people are ready for it.
Rebecca Fender, Senior Director of the Future of Finance at the CFA Institute, an association of investment professionals, told the members of the task force that 43 percent of CFA members and candidates expect significant change in their roles in the next 5-10 years.
The three roles “most likely to disappear” are sales agents, traders and performance analysts, she said, citing the result of a survey of more than 3,800 respondents.

Meanwhile, Kirsten Wegner, CEO of Modern Markets Initiative, said that policymakers are better to encourage the transformation to automatization, instead of impeding it, as it opens the door to many tech professionals.
“There are countless job opportunities popping up in coding, cybersecurity, data storage and management, quantitative reasoning and other technology verticals that Wall Street plans to prioritize,” she said, adding that employment opportunities could stem from blockchain, e-banking, robo-advising and new cryptocurrencies.

This transition may be due to the extensive demand for digital literacy across job roles as the demand for qualitative and quantitative proficiency has increased. Companies are hiring management interns with engineering background — especially in the computer science and electronics domain.With the advent of digitisation, management graduates from top b-schools — including Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) — are taking up technical job roles over management consulting and investment banking. “Technology is creating opportunities , making way for newer jobs — many of them still unknown to us. The convergence of Big Data with Artificial Intelligence has emerged as the single most important development that is shaping the future of how firms drive business value from their data and analytics capabilities,” Neeti Sharma, Senior Vice President, TeamLease Services told Business Insider.A study by talent solutions company Xpheno predicted that companies are expected to hire almost a third of management students for tech profiles. This transition may be due to the extensive demand for digital literacy across job roles as the demand for qualitative and quantitative proficiency has increased. In addition to this, consulting and i-banking multinationals banking on technologies like data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) offer higher remuneration for innovation skills. Nearly 68 management students were hired for IT and analytics profiles at Indian Institute of IIM Bangalore from companies like Ola, Oyo Rooms and United Health Group among others. The employer’s sideOn the employers front too, automation has restrained the demand for traditional i-banking roles. They are also looking for more diverse candidates. Companies are hiring management interns with engineering background — especially in the computer science and electronics domain. With automation making inroads in the Indian job market, humans are competing with machines to keep up. According to Microsoft, every business is going to be a Software business, build applications, use advanced analytics. Given that, companies are now looking at hiring employees that bring in AI and ML skills.“AI &amp; ML tools are being used across the life cycles of workflows &amp; projects across organizations. Many MBA students are Engineering graduates and hence it is natural that companies hiring from campus look for candidates who have a background of both technical as well as managerial skills which will enable them to perform better at their jobs,” Neeti added.Banks going digital With digitisation, techno-functional managers have become essential to companies.Public sector banks Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank also recently announced that they will hire 5,000 fresh graduates with cybersecurity, technical skills.According to Sukhjit Singh Pasricha, chief human resource officer at Kotak Mahindra Bank, the banking industry has witnessed a sudden demand for professionals skilled in technologies like artificial intelligence, digital banking and analytics. “Legacy job categories such as Banking or Transaction Processing may be heavily impacted by the automation that AI brings to the business — replacing jobs. The banking industry is anticipated to grow by incorporating AI systems, machine learning &amp; big data. This includes automation of customer service with chatbots, improving risk models, understanding customer behavior, credit decisions, risk and compliance, fraud detection and anti-money-laundering to name a few,” Anne Soumya, HR Director of The Adecco Group India told BI.
