When Alona Fyshe was growing up in Edmonton — the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta — and attending the University of Alberta, she never expected the city would turn into an epicenter of artificial intelligence work. However, that is exactly what it has become.
In 2018, after some time away, Fyshe was lured back to Edmonton for a job as a professor at her alma mater, and she’s thrilled to have settled in such a vibrant city that’s home to a thriving and collaborative network of artificial intelligence and machine learning researchers.



“It’s a remarkable place to be. We have young up-and-coming researchers, but we also have established researchers who are leaders in the field,” Fyshe said. “Everyone’s interested in each other’s ideas, and there are many opportunities for smart people to connect with each other.”
Fyshe is now an assistant professor in the Department of Computing Science and Department of Psychology, and uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to understand how the human brain processes language.
As Fyshe explained, “Computer models of language are exciting, and they’re becoming more and more accurate. I’m interested in using those computer models to understand how we comprehend language, but also how this can help further improve those models.”
Fyshe is not alone in her enthusiasm for the technology and Edmonton’s unique position as a leader in artificial intelligence research. Edmonton is gaining a worldwide reputation as a hub for businesses, and organizations from across the globe are flocking to the city to learn, collaborate, and advance their work in the field.
Future-Focused Ecosystem
An organization at the core of the region’s artificial intelligence innovation is the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), one of Canada’s preeminent centers of artificial intelligence. Amii plays a prominent role in building connections between researchers of different stripes in the tech community and, in doing so, developing a thriving artificial intelligence ecosystem in the province.
Amii also represents Edmonton as a member of the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy, the world’s first national strategy committed to building local and regional AI ecosystems, supporting talent and training in the field, fostering collaboration, and understanding the societal implications of the technology.
The region is also home to the Alberta Artificial Intelligence Association (AlbertataAI), a non-profit organization aimed at cultivating the Alberta AI ecosystem and collaborating with like-minded communities. The group organized the first annual Alberta AI conference in March 2019, which attracted 350 participants, including AI experts, IT professionals, university professors, computer science graduate students, and enthusiasts from various industries across the artificial intelligence field.
The University of Alberta: A Best-in-Class Research Institution
When Fyshe isn’t engaging in the ground-breaking research that drew her back to Edmonton, she is deeply engaged in teaching at The University of Alberta — or, as she puts it, “training the next generation of scholars to do machine learning in the real world.”
Located at the edge of Edmonton’s North Saskatchewan River valley, The University of Alberta is one of the top five AI research institutions globally, with a world-renowned robotics lab and brain imaging center that are helping push the field in new directions.
The use of artificial intelligence in language processing has progressed rapidly over the last decade, and the University of Alberta’s expertise in this area has played a pivotal role in this. The university continues to provide exciting opportunities to advance this innovation, further contributing to Edmonton’s position as a leader in artificial intelligence.
In addition, The Kule Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) at the University of Alberta is the official host of the International Center for Information Ethics (ICIE), a leader in the field of digital ethics, and publisher of the International Review of Information Ethics. When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron committed to creating an international study group on artificial intelligence in 2018, the institute set out to organize its first annual AI, Ethics and Society Conference in 2019 — an interdisciplinary gathering which explored the history, ethics, policy, business, and science of AI.
Also at the university, the AI4Society Reverse EXPO 2022 brings together the University of Alberta AI research community and representatives from industry, government, and civil society to learn about what students are doing to advance AI-related research and applications, as well as explore collaboration options.
Describing the university’s community, Fyshe said, “There really is an excellent set of people who are working and learning here.” The work of introducing new learners, both students and members of the larger community, to artificial intelligence and machine learning is a collaborative and inspiring effort. “There’s an exciting network of researchers fueling the energy in Edmonton.”
Sharing Knowledge, Driving Progress
Edmonton’s energy and expertise is attracting events and organizations from around the world, tapping into the city’s ecosystem of innovation.
There is ample opportunity to learn from and collaborate with Edmonton’s AI experts like Fyshe. Conference attendees can engage in meaningful tours of state-of-the art facilities, hear from outstanding keynote speakers, and connect with leading institutions in artificial intelligence — and it’s these collaborations that are driving innovation to help shape the future of this increasingly important industry.

Innovation often leads to new products, but new methods can be just as groundbreaking.





It was the chance to help develop those methods that drew chemical engineering doctoral student Soumil Joshi from his native Mumbai, India, to Virginia Tech in 2019.
""It's a great school, especially for the chemical engineering field, and it is really reputed for research on polymers, which I'm thankful to be doing here,"" Joshi said.
And in March, three years of work led to his name being listed as first author on a paper describing a new computational method for working with polymers that he and his advisor, Assistant Professor Sanket Deshmukh, hope will lead to significant biomedical advancements.
The paper, titled ""Coarse-grained molecular dynamics integrated with Convolutional Neural Network for comparing shapes of temperature sensitive bottlebrushes,"" details a method developed by the Deshmukh lab, including co-author and visiting scholar Samrendra Singh, that uses artificial intelligence to analyze the shape of important complex soft materials and predict their behaviors.
It was published in npj Computational Materials, an open-access journal from Nature, and not only holds promise for enabling new discoveries in biomaterials, but highlights the growing importance of big data, artificial intelligence, and computational science in chemical engineering.
These computer-assisted innovations are critical to making progress in a range of fields, Deshmukh said. ""There are long-standing scientific problems that can't be solved by existing methods, so solving problems and developing new methods go hand in hand.""






The researchers developed their ""deep-learning"" method to work with what are called ""soft materials.""
In deep learning, artificial intelligence systems are trained to recognize patterns, work on problems, and perform tasks—with or without human supervision. Soft materials can include liquids, polymers, glycomaterials, foams, gels, and most soft biological materials. They are used in a wide range of products and applications, from toothpaste, lubricants, and liquid crystal displays to drug delivery systems and tissue scaffolds. But traditional computational methods of analyzing and predicting their behaviors, especially polymers, have limited utility, hindering progress in their development.
To help break that logjam, the researchers worked with a type of branched, tree-like polymers called ""bottlebrushes."" Their inspiration came from biomolecules, whose different shapes determine their functions. Synthesizing them in the lab could lead to new medical treatments and other industry applications, Deshmukh said. But that can be difficult because the polymers change shape rapidly, depending on temperature and other factors. Without an efficient and accurate way to analyze and predict those changes, creating synthetic versions is difficult.
Their new process uses a well-known deep-learning system called Convolutional Neural Network, or CNN, to identify and predict similarities in shape and function in the polymers—something that can't be done without computer assistance.
Applying artificial intelligence to this polymer problem is ""groundbreaking because it shows the potential of deep learning methods in the field of soft materials,"" Deshmukh said. ""So, in principle, if we understand how the shapes are changing, then hopefully we can control them.""
To prove their method would work, Joshi ran 100 unique CNN models, teaching the system to identify bottlebrushes with similar shapes. The project was challenging, not just because it required painstaking work to teach the model what data and features to look for in the polymers, but also because the researchers didn't immediately know what features were relevant. They had to figure that out first.
Developing the models took more than a year, Deshmukh said. ""Singh and Joshi did a fantastic job in identifying the processing of the relevant data and then further refining it to make sure the CNN model gets the right information.""
""Most of the initial brainstorming on what features to use was carried out by Dr. Singh and Dr. Deshmukh, which helped eliminate plenty of unfavorable options,"" Joshi said. ""This helped us zero in on our current methodology, which I used to code and incorporate into our analysis algorithm.""
The results have been very promising, Joshi said, and the team hopes to expand use of the technique into the growing field of glycomaterials—carbohydrate-based soft materials produced by every living organism.






These soft materials contain chains of sugars, called glycans, that play critical roles in health and disease. Of the four building blocks of life—glycans, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids—glycans are the most complex and the most challenging to understand. But CNN could spur progress in this area.
""So, just like we created these bottlebrush structures for synthetic polymers, there are a lot of architectures that can be created using glycomaterials and polymers like these glycans,"" Deshmukh said.
""We plan to help our collaborators design new types of glycomaterials that can be used for biomedical applications,"" Deshmukh said. ""It's really exciting.""
This research also points to the growing importance of data science and machine learning in chemical engineering, department head Steven Wrenn said.
""It's important that our graduates know how to work with data scientists and use computer modeling in their own work,"" Wrenn said. ""This training will make our students much more attractive to employers and graduate programs.""
In fact, the department is working on a new computational and data science track of study, which, if approved, will train undergraduates to apply computer science to chemical engineering. Deshmukh is involved in developing the study track.
""Training a chemical engineer who is going to work in a chemical plant in data science and artificial intelligence makes them a real asset,"" Deshmukh said. ""Because they are going to help solve problems in the chemical industry that can't really be solved using traditional methods.""

Using AI to fly an airplane will be an enormous achievement; the ultimate reflection of AI’s ability to manage complexity. It will be a critical piece to implementing the changes that will be required in the next decade as A&D organisations reassess manufacturing automation in their factories. The recent pandemic, furloughs, bankruptcies and retirements are all impacting productivity and widening the talent gap, forcing the industry to adopt new technology such as AI to reimagine their business.
What is AI and machine learning?
AI, like so many technology buzzwords, can mean different things to different people. For us, an AI system is one that leverages software functions created through a machine learning process rather than through traditional programming. Data, rather than source code, is the critical element. The performance of an AI application is shaped by the data used to train the application.

Without going into detail on machine learning algorithms or approaches, which is beyond the scope of this paper, we can generalise that the power in AI comes from machine learning’s ability to model complex systems and environments far beyond what we can reasonably build in traditional software.

Imagine building a speech recognition system through traditional programming — having a function for every word or a case statement for every pronunciation or accent. It would take a staggering amount of time to cover even 10 percent of the English language. Machine learning models, on the other hand, have made short work of this task, to the point that robust and accurate systems can understand a full vocabulary from hundreds of languages and accents.
Analytical AI vs. operational AI
Today, two distinct classes of AI applications are emerging across industries. The first is analytical AI, as in the type of system that can predict when a machine is going to fail, detect credit card fraud or recommend the next book to buy on Amazon. Operational AI, the second class of AI applications, actually does something in the physical world. It can manage a factory process, fly a plane, drive a vehicle or act on predicted events. It’s artificial intelligence at work.




Underpinning automation, the industry also needs a strong digital foundation where both machine usage and labor can be tracked and optimized automatically.







Analytical AI is maturing
The development tools and environment for building analytical AI applications are rapidly maturing. Previously, data scientists wrote Python code to enable most algorithms and approaches to machine learning. They did a lot of heavy lifting, extracting from various sources and then transforming the data to ingest into AI algorithms.
We can now address some of the more complex challenges the industry is trying to solve. Where does the industry need to pivot, from a technology point of view, so it can thrive during moments of disruption? We can also see coming technology advancements such as the introduction of more drones and air taxis.
What the industry really needs to do is to scale up the building of complex operational AI systems. We need the self-driving car level of AI across the A&D industry. To do this, we need a different approach to developing AI systems. The scale of data needed to train these complex systems is many orders of magnitude larger than what has been done before. This data must be well-managed through a significantly more complex machine learning system, where AI software is often trained in stages, leveraging data that is synthetically generated at key points. We must also consider the testing and validation environment, since we are talking about building systems that operate complex machinery in the real world.
Operational AI in aerospace and defense: Three use cases
Unlike AI development for analytical use cases, the development of toolchains and methodologies for complex operational AI is only just emerging. We believe that success in any complex operational AI endeavor will be determined most critically by having access to a robust development ecosystem.
Factory automation. Many of the woes in A&D over the past 10 to 15 years have been caused by the inefficient supply chain, which has created cost overruns, delays and even bankruptcies. Many companies are struggling with major supply chain problems, from a lack of control — in both delivery and timeliness — to a lack of quality control. Across the industry, supply chain problems have cost companies tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary costs. In short, the supply chain in the A&D industry has been a major problem.




















Learn about DXC's expertise in the Automotive industry. 





The automotive industry is highly digitised and highly automated from a manufacturing standpoint, because there is a relatively stable and manageable supply chain of 10 or 15 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), along with cooperation and partnerships so everyone can invest in automation. By contrast, the global aerospace industry lacks this level of partnership and, critically, the necessary manufacturing volume to make similar investments. A&D companies depend on a very deep and unwieldy supply chain with almost no automation and very little planning control or quality control.




In terms of delays and quality issues, the root causes are poor manual processes and poor manual planning. Underpinning automation, the industry also needs a strong digital foundation where both machine usage and labor can be tracked and optimised automatically. Automation not only brings conformity and control, but it also brings an automatic improvement in quality that is sorely needed. The answer to automating in A&D lies in using general-purpose robotics, more specifically, cobots (collaborative robots), which are general-purpose humanoid robots that can work among a human population on both factory floors and typical A&D production lines. Cobots introduce automation at a much lower cost because retooling of manufacturing programs is not needed.




Underpinning automation, the industry also needs a strong digital foundation where both machine usage and labor can be tracked and optimised automatically.







These cobots still need to be programmed, and that’s where AI comes in. Programming traditional automation solutions is an expensive proposition, as each task needs to be custom programmed to fit a particular factory and production line. With AI, programming countless different tasks one by one is not needed. AI plus cobots enable the automation of that operational program and factory at high, low and no scale, and at a dramatically lower cost, so that implementing automation is achievable, given the constraints of the aerospace industry.

Air traffic management. AI is critical for managing the anticipated disruptions in this industry over the next 10 years. One such disruption being watched closely is the pending introduction of drones and air taxis, often known as urban air mobility systems. Thus, the second use case is building an AI air traffic controller. 




















Today, air traffic management is generally managed by people. Based on many projections of this growing industry, in 15 to 20 years there will be 30 times the volume of air traffic flying over a large city such as Los Angeles than there is now. Human beings would be hard-pressed to manage that huge amount of air traffic, and it may be impossible.
But this is not the type of problem where more humans can be added and each person given a smaller slice of the air traffic pie when we consider the amount and type of new air traffic expected to operate, especially at the 0 to 3,000-foot level. Given all this, there is wide consensus that the industry needs AI to manage this exponentially higher level of complexity.

How AI can make fully autonomous driving a reality

 





Fully autonomous vehicles. This third use case is obvious because we are inundated with news about the self-driving car every day. First, being autonomous is different from being unmanned. Drones flying today don’t have pilots sitting in them, but they are still overseen by a pilot from the ground. Such drones have a ground station that has aspects of a cockpit repurposed on a desk, with a human flying the drone remotely.

The future progression from this state is full autonomy, where an AI system is constantly evaluating and reacting to the airspace and making decisions to act in accordance with its mission. The impetus for fully autonomous flight is the same as it is on the ground. A new, generally accepted roadmap has now been published and with autonomy, not only can we imagine a more efficient world, but we can imagine a safer one as well.
Creating complex operational AI systems
To create complex operational AI systems in the A&D industry, very different needs must be met for data management and for algorithm creation and implementation. Very robust simulation is also needed in the testing phase. Above all, there is a strong need for a solution that enables complex operational AI DevOps.
When training an AI system, there are two datasets. First is the historical dataset for the predictive use case containing the instances of what is being predicted. Next comes a testing or validation dataset. In the complex operational world, organisations often investigate neural networks to handle the pattern recognition. Algorithms can be used to automatically build better and better neural networks, based on the performance of the best-performing neural networks from past iterations.
But given the much higher complexity of the environment in which pattern recognition and training are run, higher-level approaches must be considered. For complex operational AI, the various machine learning approaches demand data at a higher scale and management at a greater complexity.




Building a robust simulated environment that matches real life can be a key factor in acceptance, and where necessary, certification.







What is needed is a tiered approach to building different datasets. Start with a dataset that is focused on the physics of what you are trying to model; then build a dataset that accounts for the operating environment. After that, extrapolate the data to create a dataset that is orders of magnitude larger.
Algorithms then need to be constructed to create synthetic data to fill into that next-larger phase. Plus, building a robust simulated environment that matches real life can be a key factor in acceptance, and where necessary, certification. For example, certifying an airborne system is all about proving it is safe, and complex operational AI DevOps can play a crucial role in providing a robust simulation environment in the testing phase.
Operational AI is not easy, but it is possible
Building complex operational AI systems is no simple task. There are many challenges in managing the development environment and specific workflows. Data management over the full development life cycle is key, as is using the right technology to manipulate, extrapolate and scale data. It is essential to build a system that effectively manages and curates the data that represents the foundational dataset; then integrates, manages and curates the data from that environmental representation dataset; and ultimately provides the platform and simulation for the synthetic extrapolation of that merged dataset into a much, much larger dataset.
It is no easy feat to provide the data hosting, management and curation environment through these data stages that are each so massive in scope. Providing the simulation environment is enormous, because that is the “secret sauce” needed to be able to take that large dataset, combine it and then extrapolate it to ultimately produce a robust algorithm. 
The good news — not only for the A&D industry but for all industries — is that a solution does exist that provides the DevOps environment to make all this come together and work at scale. DXC Robotic Drive Cloud Services on AWS is the first solution that provides a soup-to-nuts development toolchain and management environment for building complex operational AI.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are already transforming the work of lawyers and law firms in many ways and there are enormous opportunities for the future. Let’s discuss how artificial intelligence and machine learning have gradually transformed law firms (both in positive and negative ways) and how they can continue to improve. 
Positive effects of AI and machine learning in law
First, let’s discuss the positive effects of machine learning and AI on the legal industry. 
Automatic reminders
Breaking down legal procedures or duties traditionally handled by legal practitioners and embedding some of those parts in technology is how legal automation is accomplished. The most popular legal automation is complex, high-volume labor and common and repetitive duties, and they’re most common in high-volume data collection, review, repeatable processes, and document generation.
Consider using mail merge technology to address typical form letters or an automated tickler or reminder system to keep track of court dates. However, legal automation’s uses have advanced sophistication, ranging from filtering giant document review sets during litigation to extracting crucial words from agreements in due diligence operations. Lawyers have recently begun automating the creation of legal contracts and key elements in the negotiation process and this is another area of law that can benefit from AI.
Suppose you always set the alarm, a phone call reminder, at 4:00 pm every Tuesday for about two to three months to do a similar thing. A machine-learning smartphone will recognize the pattern and send you reminders automatically. It can help avoid forgetting a weekly task and is an excellent help for lawyers. 
Contract review and analysis in less time
Lawyers have to analyze contracts in bulks and give comments and redlines to advise clients. Imagine a firm with thousands of reviewed contracts, and you need to keep a copy of their financial obligation, renewal, expiration dates, and more. In a law firm, AI can perform such tasks efficiently. 
The procedure for using AI-powered document evaluation is straightforward: The system identifies the required papers, analyses them, and identifies the requested terms and clauses, after which they are ready for review.
Managing the project while evaluating the uploaded documents is crucial for the new technology. This is a hybrid of technological and manual labor. AI-powered document review comprehends papers in various languages, file kinds, and practice areas, assisting in the practical evaluation and categorization of documents, allowing employees to spend more time on quality assurance and legal analysis.
Ease of legal research
Lawyers and legal firms now have unparalleled access to information about lawyers, judges, courts, and damages, to name a few. Data-driven knowledge has replaced anecdotes and personal experience as the primary source of information.advertisement
As a result of all of this, you’ll be able to create an even more effective plan. These AI-powered tools help you comprehend previously ambiguous aspects of your case, such as how frequently your judge grants summary judgment motions or which court is ideal for your client’s case.
Your clients want to know about legal expenses and the tenure of the case, and they want to know what their chances are of a positive outcome. You used to take full advantage of what you had, but now you have more. That same data, those same insights—everything that aids in developing a superior case strategy also aids in providing confidence to your clients. Keeping them informed entails more than simply providing answers; it also entails instilling trust in you and your client’s future.
Thomson Reuters’ legal research product, Westlaw Edge, provides broader coverage of all federal and state courts. Lawyers can compare verdicts by judges, courts, and lawyers to uncover interesting trends, predict case outcomes, analyze IP filings, and research competitors.
Elimination of time-consuming tasksadvertisement
Artificial intelligence and automation can take over up to 23% of a lawyer’s everyday tasks. Many of these activities are routine, paperwork-based duties that divert legal professionals’ attention away from the strategic demands of a case.
E-discovery is the most basic and widely used form of AI in law: checking digital information to collect non-privileged data on a case or claim. Lawyers can use e-discovery software to scan documents based on search terms or parameters like dates or geographic location. This extra time enables lawyers to gather more pertinent information. Like Kira Systems’, AI platforms enable lawyers to detect, retrieve, and evaluate data contained in huge volumes of contracts. This helps to generate contract summary charts for merger and acquisition due diligence.
LawGeex reviews contracts one at a time every day. It includes a list of contract clauses that must be rejected or accepted. When a document is uploaded into the software, the user only needs to select the clauses from the list, and the result tells us which clauses are existing or missing. Since June 2017, JPMorgan has used an AI-powered COIN program to decipher commercial loan agreements. Work that used to take 360,000 lawyer hours is now completed in seconds. The bank intends to use AI technology for other types of legal paperwork in the future.
Case Analysis Research Assistant, or CARA, is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool developed by Casetext that analyzes citations and lists specific suggested cases that are not explicitly cited in the document. Lawyers can use CARA to find relevant agencies in seconds and review cases that opposing counsel is likely to cite. CARA searches legal papers, statutory provisions, viewpoints, and editorials using a proprietary algorithm, allowing the average lawyer to investigate more proficiently without worrying about missing ideal cases.
High-quality work
Innovative software that isn’t tired or confused can produce error-free work. Specialized document software can improve document organization and maintain that organization, including all internal cross-references, throughout the document’s life. Contract comparison tools detect missing clauses, wrong terminology, or ambiguous terms through document comparison and automatic learning, both within a single file and across similar documents.
Automation of lower-level tasks
Automation of specific tasks helps lawyers have free time for client interaction and complex analysis of cases. It helps to increase the efficiency of law firms. Client interaction is an integral part of a lawyer’s profession. Automatic review of documents allows lawyers to discuss important matters with their clients, which helps get a favorable judgment. 
Law firms can use AI-based chatbots to handle their customers’ questions and concerns. These AI-powered chatbots can provide people with preliminary legal advice and assistance in bringing them on board. Chatbots can also buffer law firms and potential clients, collecting information before human engagement. If a client’s case requires legal assistance, these bots will refer them to a lawyer.
Accurate result prediction
Usually, lawyers have to predict the results for their clients to let them decide whether they want to pursue the case or opt for settlement out of court. 
AI developers are developing machine learning models to anticipate the outcomes of pending cases. Although such technologies are still in their infancy, they yield encouraging results. Some companies are developing a tax-law-focused AI-based legal prediction engine. They claim that their AI tool can accurately forecast the outcomes of ongoing cases with a 90% accuracy rate. These kinds of legal AI tools will change how law firms handle cases. Law firms will use such applications to develop litigation tactics, speed up settlement negotiations, and limit the number of cases that go to trial.
Accurate risk assessment
Technology-assisted review tools, such as predictive coding, can help examine data in real-time. This enables lawyers to find potential risks beforehand and prevent legal problems later. When a lawsuit is filed or even threatened, these intelligent solutions enable law firms to identify pertinent information and define the data and custodians that must be safeguarded. With AI, law firms can quickly determine outcomes, reducing costs and risks while defending their clients with more information.
Efficient and accurate background checking
A prominent part of a lawyer’s work is to perform exhaustive and extensive background checks for their clients or about them. These facts need to be evaluated for better decision-making and to support their cases. In law firms, AI can replace this tedious job to a large extent, and it can perform due diligence efficiently and accurately. 
For example, you wrote a memo or brief and then went over it again and again. It’s not the most efficient or cost-effective technique, and you’re unlikely to be able to charge your client for your perfectionism. However, you may now save time and money by reducing unbillable hours while improving your assurance that you haven’t forgotten anything. You can also use tools for studying legal documents powered by artificial intelligence to examine your papers in minute detail. This means you may rest assured that the memo or brief you’re submitting is flawless and that you haven’t overlooked anything.
You have credibility, and your sources and quotations have been checked. That assurance is unrivaled, but being able to verify your opponent’s work product with the same level of care is a close second. Did they misquote a case by accident (or otherwise)? Did they cite any claims that were later overturned? They may not have noticed, but you did. And it’s all because of AI, which has become the gold standard in law and legal research.
Reduced stress of legal professionals
Lawyers have to deal with multiple clients, review documents, do legal research, proofread, etc. It’s a pretty tedious job. The software helps to do the essential work so that lawyers can focus on creative analysis. It improves attorney work satisfaction. 
Tools help to complete tasks fast and accurately, and it also helps to save time and reduce the stress of lawyers. For example, accurate scheduling of major tasks is a huge help in completing them on time. If you’re the type of person who forgets things even when you write them down, you might benefit from using tools like email calendars. These calendars can send you notifications when events or deadlines are approaching. Furthermore, applications such as OneNote and Todoist can assist you in tracking your task completion progress.
Few things are more stressful or bewildering than forgetting a task until the last minute or missing a deadline. Thank heavens, there are apps to assist in dealing with it. RescueTime and Remember the Milk, for example, were created to remind users of important deadlines and motivate them to be more productive.
If technology continues to grow at the current rate, automation will quickly become a part of a lawyer’s daily routine. Although some may be concerned about this change, it provides a welcome relief from stress and fatigue. Apps like Case Text, for example, can help accelerate the legal research process. Billing is a time-consuming task, but apps like AllocateLegal, BillerAssist, and SmokeBall significantly reduce the time required to complete the process manually.
Remote work facility
Since the COVID-19 pandemic struck our lives, especially during the lockdown, almost every organization started working remotely. Law firms are no exception. The pandemic has forced the legal industry to change court practices and run fully digital, and AI has helped lawyers perform their jobs remotely. Today, the professionals in a firm can access documents from their homes and arrange a video meeting to analyze and decide on a case. 
According to the Legal Industry Report 2021: Lessons Learned from the pandemic, law firms have become more productive and efficient using new technology.  According to the survey, 82% of law firms reported that their businesses had fully reopened, and 77% of firms had no plans to reopen.
In terms of continued remote work, 53 percent of the participants said their firms would give the remote working option to lawyers and law firm staff once the offices reopened, and 70 percent said they would opt for the hybrid option once the offices reopened. As a direct result of the pandemic, nearly half (46 percent) of respondents said their companies invested in remote working software. This makes sense given that remote working tools were frequently the only way to get work done due to social distancing requirements.
Due to the pandemic, the most popular remote-working tools firms invested in were video conferencing tools, e-signature, law practice management software, time and billing software, and communication software. Law firms have used the following tools and strategies to get their job done. 
Virtual receptionists can answer client calls, but they can also do many other things:

Online client payments – make it simple for the customers to pay with a credit card. 
Practice management software – helps law firms use cloud computing with a multifaceted solution to manage and grow their firm!
Outsource time-consuming tasks – use the time and talent of freelance lawyers to collaborate virtually to complete more work.

In the future, artificial intelligence could be utilized in the following areas:
Mergers and acquisitions
Get a single platform for the entire due diligence process, including reporting and documentation. Find clauses in multiple documents and get project management and reporting assistance.
Legal procedures
In a matter of seconds, combine your search terms with artificial intelligence to receive a quick overview. Optimize your search by determining which groups of papers you should examine to locate the needle in the haystack.
Reorganization of the group
Locate contracts that need to be renegotiated and moved without needing to be renegotiated.
Real estate investments
Data should be extracted and compared across leases. Get a quick summary of the contracts’ deadlines and differences.
The benefits of AI-assisted document review

From the beginning, this process generates a quick and thorough overview of the data volume.
It saves time reviewing vast amounts of data and uses resources wisely throughout the process.
Provides a high-level perspective of the process.

Adverse effects in law firms of AI and machine learning
Artificial intelligence and machine learning do not always have positive effects. Law firms may also see the negative consequences of implementing AI discussed below. 
Professionals may experience unemployment 
One of the significant disadvantages of AI is replacing manual work. As a result, professionals associated with law firms can experience unemployment. According to Deloitte, about 100,000 legal-related jobs can be automated by 2036.  According to recent Deloitte Insight research, “technology has already led to a loss of 31,000 positions in the legal sector, but there has been an overall rise of around 80,000 jobs, the majority of which are higher qualified and better compensated,” in the legal field specifically.
At first appearance, “job loss” appears to be negative. However, it is an obvious advantage when the removed jobs cause a significant turnover and poor job satisfaction. This allows for the development of higher-skilled professions and increases employee value in ways that would be impossible to achieve without AI taking on some of the responsibilities.
Only big law firms can afford AI
Relatively smaller firms may not have the financial strength to adopt the new technology. Therefore, those law firms that can afford AI can become richer while others cannot. 
A solo law practitioner can purchase a digital or AI assistant for around $200 to manage work. A small firm will spend approximately $30,000 on software to manage time-consuming legal tasks such as workflow management and contract review. And if lawyers need a system that can handle 500 users, they are looking at $250,000, to begin with. There is then the cost of tech support after the initial setup.
Machines cannot be trustworthy
Minor damage to the machine or software can create a huge mess. Though AI could hypothetically be without error, there’s still no guarantee of a device or software being error-free. In the case of law firms, the potential damage could create havoc. The company has to bear the cost of installation in such a scenario. There are no rules or regulations to monitor AI tools. Plus, AI can’t listen, empathize, advocate, or understand politics. 
Vulnerable to cyber threats
Another cause for anxiety is privacy and cybersecurity, which is understandable. According to recent research conducted by a malpractice insurer, cyberattacks affected 22% of legal firms. The victims were more well-known figures in the industry than you might anticipate, but smaller businesses are not immune. According to the American Bar Association, this proportion was 35 percent among legal companies with 10 to 49 practitioners, implying that more than a third of small law businesses had been hacked.
Rather than being a liability, AI, according to CSO, adds to the fight against the continual threat of cyberattacks. AI technology incorporates self-learning algorithms that allow it to better recognize and foresee possible risks in ways that humans cannot.
What should law firms consider before using AI? 
Although legal automation has the potential to accomplish great things, it will take quite a bit of work to implement these technologies successfully: You’ll still need a “lawyer brain” to build different automation systems to execute particular things with automation. You may make several mistakes if the instructions at the time of configuration are incorrect. Waste goes in, and garbage goes out. Furthermore, as the law changes, some algorithms need to be changed. You can’t rely on a five-year-old legal opinion, and you certainly can’t rely on a five-year-old automated procedure.
As a result, you’ll need buy-in from those whose input you want to record through technology. This will necessitate knowledge and time. Most of the time, “translators” will be required between the legal brain and the legal technologists who integrate the software processes. Organizations must also have a firm grasp on their current procedures. If you automate a duplicative or defective process, you will be making multiple errors.
Perhaps most crucially, start with a change management strategy. What will be the method of presenting the technology to lawyers and clients? How will you motivate and encourage adoption both internally and externally? How will AI technology work with the existing systems and processes of the lawyer or law firm? What AIs will you use to track how the technology is being used?
To end this article, I would like to mention that more and more legal roles are being automated and replaced by artificial intelligence systems. Law firms have no choice but to accept this new technology. However, some people believe that manual reviewing is more accurate and better for lawyers. But, artificial intelligence systems can do work in much less time, and thus it is favorable when the main concern is performing a job in as little time as possible. Sound machines and software can perform a task accurately and fast. 
Through AI deployment, lawyers can have adequate time and patience to counsel their clients and improve their work. It can be said that deploying AI in law firms can provide positive momentum for the law firm, thus helping lawyers to work efficiently.

Employees are quitting jobs at record rates and companies are having a hard time luring them back. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that employees are now frequently working from home, making it harder for managers to identify employees who are unhappy. Plus, getting new hires up to speed is more challenging when they can’t attend in-person training sessions or shadow experienced employees.
To solve all these issues, companies are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence. But there’s a limit to how much AI can do.
Using AI to gauge employee sentiment
The “Great Resignation” has been no exaggeration. The number of people quitting their jobs has been unprecedented throughout the pandemic, hitting a record high of 48 million people in 2020, up from 42 million in 2019, which was the previous record high.
 
 
 













 
 

Unsustainable work performance expectations, a lack of career development and advancement potential, and a lack of meaningful work are among the top reasons motivating employees to move on, according to a March McKinsey survey, with inadequate compensation further down on the list, in sixth place. The No. 1 reason why people quit their jobs? Uncaring leaders.

The problem is that it can be hard to notice that employees are struggling when they’re suddenly all working remotely.
“I’m an old-school person and I do believe that there’s no substitute for managing by walking around,” says Bill Nowacki, decision science lead at KPMG. “I don’t think there’s a substitute for good managers knowing that your daughter had a soccer match last week.”
 
 
 













 
 

But employers big and small have had to adapt, he says, and some are finding that remote and hybrid work offers significant advantages.
“This work from home thing is pretty cool and they’re going to embrace it,” he says. “But we will, then, by definition, take away the ability to manage by working around. When I have a team scattered all over the world, I really can’t intimately understand their comings and goings or whether they’re tired or not.”
To fill this gap, some companies are turning to employee surveys aimed at gauging how workers are feeling. More recently, they’ve been exploring the use of interactive chatbots to check the pulse of employee sentiment at work.
 
 
 













 
 

KPMG, for example, built its first interactive chatbot in 2016. It saw some limited adoption at first, but interest waned quickly. “Then literally this week, I had four calls on this,” Nowacki says. “People are starting to wake to it.”

Nowacki says the technology has grown since then. There’s a lot of information that can be gathered about what employees are doing, such as when they log in to their work systems, when they make their phone calls, and how much time they have between meetings. “All this data is there,” he says.
To make it feel less like creepy micromanaging and more like helpful attention, Nowacki suggests allowing workers to opt into the system. Employees can then understand what the company is looking at. “We can spot you burning out before you notice you’re burning out. When you present it that way, that we’re looking out for your health, they opt in,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

KPMG calculates a score for an employee’s risk of attrition, tries to identify a reason for that, and then suggests a remediation. “With back-testing and cross-validation, we found that we’ve consistently been able to predict two-thirds of people about to resign, and save 10% to 20% of the ones we identified,” he says.
Not every company will be able to use AI to predict attrition, however.
“Like any AI application, the ability to predict turnover is entirely dependent on historic data,” says Jonathan Reilly, COO and co-founder at Akkio, a no-code AI company.
 
 
 













 
 

Typically, this means that only large organizations can use the technology. But eventually, it’s likely that this kind of technology will be core functionality in enterprise HR platforms, Reilly says. “Most business platforms will be run on AI in the next five years.”
Employing AI to tackle attrition
One company that’s been investing in AI-powered chatbots and other tools to help reduce attrition is global professional services firm Genpact, which has more than 100,000 employees. Its chatbot, called Amber, asks employees relevant questions at crucial milestones with the company.
“The results enable HR leaders and C-suite executives to proactively help employees who are unhappy,” says Sanjay Srivastava, Genpact’ chief digital officer.
 
 
 













 
 

Previously, Genpact used surveys, he says. But the AI tool can help measure employee moods. The positive mood score is now a key indicator, he says. “We take action when there’s a decline in positive mood.”
And by ensuring employees get additional support when they need it, he says,  overall positive mood scores have increased as a result.
“Amber was especially crucial during the pandemic, when the company shifted to more remote work,” Srivastava says. According to Genpact, 66% of their employees used the Amber chatbot in 2021, and of those who did, 84% reported a positive mood.
 
 
 













 
 

“Employees who do not engage in Amber chats leave at a rate of two times more than those that do,” Srivastava notes. “The results have been well beyond what you would expect.”

The company also uses AI to monitor employee messages for indicators that an employee is about to quit. By analyzing messaging metadata, “not the messages themselves,” he says, “we can now statistically prove that certain types of communication behavior directly correlate to business performance.”
The analysis can help identify rock star employees so that the company can take extra steps to keep them motivated, he says. And it can identify attrition risks, enabling leadership to discuss retention strategies, or put succession plans in place before the employees actually leave.
 
 
 













 
 

Onboarding new hires faster with AI
Genpact is also speeding up the onboarding process for new hires using AI, says Srivastava. The company has transformed its new hire experience by digitizing the entire onboarding experience, which provides personalized experiential journeys, accompanied by experience and emotions mapping at each touchpoint.
Other companies are using AI to help train new employees more effectively, which has been increasingly important with the transition to a work-from-home workforce. And by offering additional training opportunities, companies also help bolster employee retention, says Jonathan Parnell, senior consultant for cloud and data center transformation at technology consultancy Insight.
“People feel that you actually care, that they’re investing in your future,” he says. “A lot of the problems in the labor shortage are caused by the companies not investing in the current workforce.”
 
 
 













 
 

AI-powered training solutions provide the most business value when targeting roles in which employees work within very specific parameters — and where there is a lot of turnover. Customer call centers are a perfect example.
Andy Thurai, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research, has recently worked with a mid-to-large global retailer that found it hard to manage turnover in their call centers when the pandemic started.
Prior to the pandemic, new hires would read documentation, watch videos, and then sit in a classroom. “They were set up to hire and train people physically, locally in the call center area,” he says. “It required a physical presence, face-to-face, to come to one place to learn. When everything went virtual, they were hiring someone without seeing them, and trying to coach them virtually to come to speed.”
 
 
 













 
 

Typically, in a call center, managers are walking around the floor, watching how employees are doing, ready to step in and help if there are problems. “When you go virtual, that can’t happen,” Thurai says.
The company wound up building a solution based on pieces from several different vendors, including natural language processing, intelligent decision making, coaching systems, and conversational AIs. It took between six months to a year before it was working well enough to meet their needs, he says. “And they’re still building it. With AI systems, things are never perfect.”

The company started by using old customer cases for the training program, enabling employees to try to come up with their own solutions, and then evolved to simulating new support cases that hadn’t come up in the past.
 
 
 













 
 

There’s also the beginning of a system that would search a knowledge base of past cases to suggest possible solutions to new hires while they were on calls. “It’s not perfect yet,” says Thurai. “But it can point you to the location where you might want to look.”
Recently, the retailer added functionality to automatically listen to ongoing phone calls and flag them for supervisors if it sounds like things are going wrong.
Next, the company plans to improve the knowledge base so that it will automatically come up with solutions, and to offer one-button automations so that employees can click a button to have the system take over tasks they currently have to do manually, such as issuing refunds or sending letters.
 
 
 













 
 

Enter the era of augmented human resources
Using AI for training, as well as for retention, recruitment, and other HR tasks is what IDC calls “augmented human resources.”

Spending on augmented human resources grew at just over 30% last year to nearly $3 billion, and is expected to reach $6.3 billion in 2025.
And employees are increasingly warming to the idea. According to a 2021 survey by Workplace Intelligence and Oracle, 82% of more than 14,000 employees and managers from around the world said they believe robots can support their careers better than humans can.
Meanwhile, 85% said that they weren’t satisfied with the career support they were currently getting from their companies, and 87% said that companies should do more to listen to their needs.
 
 
 













 
 

In addition, 55% said they would be more likely to stay with a company that uses AI to support career growth. Some examples of this include identifying what skills they need to develop and recommending ways to learn new skills.
According to a report released by Eightfold AI last March, more than 50% of companies are already using some AI-related tools to improve HR, such as for evaluating potential job candidates and matching them to best roles, or using chatbots to answer common questions, map to employee career paths, or to upskill or reskill employees.
Moreover, 82% of HR managers queried for the survey said their companies will be increasing their use of AI tools for talent management over the next five years.
Some problems may be too big for AI to fix
According to research published in the Harvard Business Review, a toxic company culture is the single biggest predictor of attribution, followed by job security and reorganization.
An HR chatbot, no matter how intelligent, isn’t likely to do much to address these issues. In fact, AI is really a force multiplier. Using AI in a toxic workplace might make the toxicity even worse.
For example, if management’s solution to the turnover problem is to harangue employees into staying, then an AI system that monitors employee communications for signs of stress can put targets on these vulnerable populations, making them feel even more bullied and undervalued.
Similarly, some companies try to use AI as part of their onboarding process to make up for the lack of disciplined document structures, says Insight’s Parnell. “If your onboarding is that complicated then your business is not sound,” he says. “Why do you have to build all this crazy AI for onboarding? Don’t you know how your business runs? Why do you have to build an AI just to ask how someone is doing?”
There’s only so much that AI can do to fix fundamental business problems, he adds. “How much Febreeze can you buy so you never have to wash your clothes again? At some point, you just have to wash your clothes. You have to do the work. You have to organize an efficient business. AI doesn’t solve a problem all by itself. Yes, AI can help, but you still have to get things in place for the AI to be successful.”

DALL-E 2 features a higher-resolution and lower-latency version of the original system, which produces pictures depicting descriptions written by users.

It was a limited but fascinating test of AI’s ability to visually represent concepts, from mundane depictions of a mannequin in a flannel shirt to “a giraffe made of turtle” or an illustration of a radish walking a dog. At the time, OpenAI said it would continue to build on the system while examining potential dangers like bias in image generation or the production of misinformation. It’s attempting to address those issues using technical safeguards and a new content policy while also reducing its computing load and pushing forward the basic capabilities of the model.A DALL-E 2 result for “Shiba Inu dog wearing a beret and black turtleneck.”One of the new DALL-E 2 features, inpainting, applies DALL-E’s text-to-image capabilities on a more granular level. Users can start with an existing picture, select an area, and tell the model to edit it. You can block out a painting on a living room wall and replace it with a different picture, for instance, or add a vase of flowers on a coffee table. The model can fill (or remove) objects while accounting for details like the directions of shadows in a room. Another feature, variations, is sort of like an image search tool for pictures that don’t exist. Users can upload a starting image and then create a range of variations similar to it. They can also blend two images, generating pictures that have elements of both. The generated images are 1,024 x 1,024 pixels, a leap over the 256 x 256 pixels the original model delivered.DALL-E 2 builds on CLIP, a computer vision system that OpenAI also announced last year. “DALL-E 1 just took our GPT-3 approach from language and applied it to produce an image: we compressed images into a series of words and we just learned to predict what comes next,” says OpenAI research scientist Prafulla Dhariwal, referring to the GPT model used by many text AI apps. But the word-matching didn’t necessarily capture the qualities humans found most important, and the predictive process limited the realism of the images. CLIP was designed to look at images and summarize their contents the way a human would, and OpenAI iterated on this process to create “unCLIP” — an inverted version that starts with the description and works its way toward an image. DALL-E 2 generates the image using a process called diffusion, which Dhariwal describes as starting with a “bag of dots” and then filling in a pattern with greater and greater detail.An existing image of a room with a flamingo added in one corner.Interestingly, a draft paper on unCLIP says it’s partly resistant to a very funny weakness of CLIP: the fact that people can fool the model’s identification capabilities by labeling one object (like a Granny Smith apple) with a word indicating something else (like an iPod). The variations tool, the authors say, “still generates pictures of apples with high probability” even when using a mislabeled picture that CLIP can’t identify as a Granny Smith. Conversely, “the model never produces pictures of iPods, despite the very high relative predicted probability of this caption.”DALL-E’s full model was never released publicly, but other developers have honed their own tools that imitate some of its functions over the past year. One of the most popular mainstream applications is Wombo’s Dream mobile app, which generates pictures of whatever users describe in a variety of art styles. OpenAI isn’t releasing any new models today, but developers could use its technical findings to update their own work.A DALL-E 2 result for “a bowl of soup that looks like a monster, knitted out of wool.”OpenAI has implemented some built-in safeguards. The model was trained on data that had some objectionable material weeded out, ideally limiting its ability to produce objectionable content. There’s a watermark indicating the AI-generated nature of the work, although it could theoretically be cropped out. As a preemptive anti-abuse feature, the model also can’t generate any recognizable faces based on a name — even asking for something like the Mona Lisa would apparently return a variant on the actual face from the painting.DALL-E 2 will be testable by vetted partners with some caveats. Users are banned from uploading or generating images that are “not G-rated” and “could cause harm,” including anything involving hate symbols, nudity, obscene gestures, or “major conspiracies or events related to major ongoing geopolitical events.” They must also disclose the role of AI in generating the images, and they can’t serve generated images to other people through an app or website — so you won’t initially see a DALL-E-powered version of something like Dream. But OpenAI hopes to add it to the group’s API toolset later, allowing it to power third-party apps. “Our hope is to keep doing a staged process here, so we can keep evaluating from the feedback we get how to release this technology safely,” says Dhariwal.Additional reporting from James Vincent.Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeApple’s Vision Pro: five months later | The Vergecast

CHICAGO – The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) announces the publication of ""The Rise of AI: Implications and Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Academic Libraries,"" book number 78 in the Publications in Librarianship series, edited by Sandy Hervieux and Amanda Wheatley. This book collects projects, collaborations, and future uses from academic librarians who have begun to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) in their work.
Librarians are uniquely positioned to rise to the challenge that AI presents to the field. Libraries and their like have existed for millennia; they progress with society, altering and adapting their services to meet the information needs of their communities.
In three parts — User Services, Collections and Discovery, and Toward Future Applications — ""The Rise of AI"" explores: 

machine translation
creating incubation spaces
robotics
combining information literacy initiatives with AI literacy
fostering partnerships with other on-campus groups
integrating AI technology into collections to enhance discoverability
using AI to refine metadata for images, articles, and theses
machine learning 

Chapters introduce implications and applications of artificial intelligence in academic libraries and hopes to provoke conversations and inspire new ways of engaging with the technology. As the discussion surrounding ethics, bias, and privacy in AI continues to grow, librarians will be called to make informed decisions and position themselves as leaders in this discourse.
“The Rise of AI: Implications and Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Academic Libraries” is available for purchase in print and as an ebook through the ALA Online Store; in print through Amazon.com; and by telephone order at (866) 746-7252 in the U.S. or (770) 442-8633 for international customers.

Digital technologies, devices and the internet are producing huge amounts of data and greater capacity to store it, and those developments are likely to accelerate. For law enforcement, a critical capability lagging behind the pace of innovation is the ability and capacity to screen, analyse and render insights from the ever-increasing volume of data—and to do so in accordance with the constraints on access to and use of personal information within a democratic system.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are presenting valuable tools to the public and private sectors for screening big and live data. AI is also commonly considered and marketed as a solution that removes human bias, although AI algorithms and dataset creation can also perpetuate human bias and so aren’t value- or error-free.
In light of the many and varied solutions AI offers, the Australian government is building the necessary policy and regulatory frameworks to pursue the goal of positioning Australia as a ‘global leader in AI’. Recent initiatives include an AI action plan launched in 2021 as part of the digital economy strategy, the CSIRO’s 2019 AI roadmap, and the voluntary artificial intelligence ethics framework, which includes eight principles necessary for AI to be safe and democratically legitimate. In addition, more than $100 million in investment has been pledged to develop the expertise and capabilities of an Australian AI workforce and to establish private–public partnerships to develop AI solutions to national challenges.
AI is being broadly conceptualised by the federal government and many private companies as an exciting technological solution to ‘strengthen the economy and improve the quality of life of all Australians’ by inevitably ‘reshap[ing] virtually every industry, profession and life’. There’s some truth there, but how that reshaping occurs depends on choices, including, for policing, about how data and insights are used and how direct human judgements and relationships can be informed by those technologies, not discounted and disempowered.
In a new ASPI report, released today, I explore some of the limitations on the use of AI in policing and law enforcement scenarios, possible strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of AI data insights and decision-making in the justice system, and implications for regulation of AI use by police and law enforcement in Australia.
It is problematic, to say the least, that the ethics framework designed to ‘ensure AI is safe, secure and reliable’ is entirely voluntary for both the public and private sectors. And it is not supported by any actual laws specifically addressing the use of AI or other emerging technologies, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.
For policing agencies, AI is considered a force-multiplier not only because it can process more data than human brains can conceivably do within required time frames, but also because it can yield insights to complement the efforts of human teams to solve complex analytical problems.
There are many different types and purposes for AI currently under consideration, in trial or in use in various areas of policing globally. Examples include risk assessment of recidivism used to inform parole decisions or to prompt pre-emptive, deterrent police visits to offenders’ homes; public safety video and image analysis, using facial recognition to identify people of interest or to decipher low-quality images; and forensic DNA testing.
AI algorithms, or models, promise to enable processing of high volumes of data at speed while identifying patterns; supercharge knowledge management while (supposedly) removing human bias from the process (we now know that AI can in fact learn and act on human bias); and operate with ethical principles coded into their decision-making.
This promise, however, is not a guarantee.
Holding AI to the ‘safe, secure and reliable’ standard in the Australian ethics framework requires the ability and functionality to comprehensively know and understand how algorithms make decisions and how ethical decision frameworks are coded into an algorithm and its development and training on historical and live datasets.
In fact, there are significant barriers from both a technical and implementation standpoint (for example, the market disincentive of sharing the finer details of how a proprietary AI product works) to achieving these aims.
It’s broadly understood that human bias can compromise both police outcomes (reducing and preventing crime, the successful prosecution of perpetrators of crime, and justice for victims of crime) and the trust from communities that enables effective policing. This can make AI seem a solution; however, if it’s adopted without knowledge of its limitations and potential errors, it has the potential to create more and compounding problems for police.
While researchers are fond of analysing ‘human bias’ in systems, the humanity of individuals also really matters for how they do their work and engage with their communities. It’s a strength of the community policing function, not something to be edited out by technology, no matter how powerful and large the datasets may be. This insight can help shape how policing works with AI and other new technologies, and how human analysts can prevent coded human bias from running unchecked in AI systems.
We can be certain that AI is here to stay. Appropriate regulation of its use in law enforcement scenarios is imperative to mitigate the significant potential impacts on justice outcomes and civil liberties. If Australia wants to ensure AI is safe, secure and reliable, we need at the very least an ethics framework that is compulsory and legally enforceable.

The difficulty in identifying an object using satellite video was highlighted in 2020 when Chinese space authorities released a video clip captured by Jilin-1, a small satellite, from an altitude of over 500km (310 miles) while chasing a cruising fighter jet.

The stealth aircraft, which appeared to be an F-22 according to some military experts, was nearly 20 metres (65 feet) long. With a smaller object, the commercial satellite’s camera, offering about 1-metre resolution, would generate just a few pixels of the target.
With fewer details in the image, it is more difficult to identify an object. And because each frame of the satellite video covered more than 10 square kilometres, a small target such as a car could blend into the surrounding environment or be confused with other vehicles, making it nearly impossible to track its movement from orbit.
A Chinese team said its new AI technology had achieved 95 per cent precision in locating an object when the Jilin-1 satellite streamed video of various moving small targets, including planes in the air and cars on the street.

Its success rate was nearly seven times higher than existing technology, according to Lin Cunbao of the People’s Liberation Army’s Space Engineering University in Beijing and his research colleagues in a paper published late last month in Fire Control and Command Control, a domestic peer-reviewed journal run by China’s state-owned defence industry.
Jilin-1, launched in 2015, was China’s first Earth observation satellite for commercial use. Unlike traditional spy satellites which carry a large telescope, the Jilin-1 weighed less than 100kg (220 pounds).
It circles the Earth at a relatively low altitude, achieving higher resolution but is only able to stay over a region for a short period.
Since the first Jilin satellite was launched, nearly 40 more in the family have joined it to form a global surveillance network that can detect a wide spectrum of signals, from visible light to heat signatures occurring at almost any time, anywhere.
Lin said most commercial satellites could not chase a small moving target because of technical limits.


The resolution of a satellite video stream – which usually records about 15 frames per second – is considerably lower than a still photograph captured by the same camera. The high speed of the satellite means almost everything in the video, including buildings and their shadows, are on the move as well, making traditional software designed to detect motion against a fixed background less effective.
Added to the complexity, is the ability of vehicles on the ground to stop suddenly, make a sharp turn or go under a bridge or through a tunnel. Even a thoroughly trained AI machine could lose the target when part or all of an object vanishes, according to the researchers.

Traditionally, the AI assumed it had made a mistake after losing the target and feeding the negative information into the learning process that would quickly reduce its overall performance.
Lin’s team said they had built a more confident AI based on a traditional machine learning algorithm that, before the team’s enhancements, had achieved only about 14 per cent success in analysing satellite video.
In the new iteration, when the target was temporarily obscured, the machine would not immediately question its own judgment. Instead, it would estimate the target’s possible location based on past experience and continue tracking along a course it assumed the target was most likely to take.


In most circumstances, the AI could recapture the target as soon as it reappeared, according to Lin’s study.
“It has done the job very well,” the paper said, adding that the AI would work even better from space.
At present, video data from the satellite must be transmitted to a ground station or communication relay satellite nearby and processed by a computer with a powerful processor, creating a potentially significant time delay if the target is on the other side of the planet.
Some new Earth observation satellites launched by China in recent years have been equipped with processors that could be uploaded with the latest AI algorithm to automatically identify and track moving targets in real time without any ground assistance, according to researchers involved in these projects.
Chinese project aims to give smartphone users access to cameras in space
China’s space-based high speed communication network could stream the tracking video to an end user’s smartphone in minutes, or even seconds.
The service, currently available only in the war rooms of some of the most powerful countries, will be available to everyone in the near future, according to the Chinese researchers.

Chennai (Tamil Nadu) [India], April 7 (ANI/NewsVoir): Jobaskit.com, a tech startup offering smart recruitment solutions, is winning accolades for its disruptive Software as a Service solution that uses Collaborative Intelligence (CI), involving a combination of both human and artificial intelligence, to help organisations find recruitable candidates. The patent-pending CI-based screening and filtering solution creates databases with a 10x higher composition of recruitable talent, compared to that of traditional online job portals which rely only on automation.

The startup has won an award at the Internet 2.0 Conference (www.internet2conf.com), an international tech forum held at Dubai in March this year, under the category of Innovative Product. During the same month, Jobaskit has been recognized with the Business Leadership Award under the Promising Startup category from the Indian Achievers Forum (iafindia.com), and Excellence in Recruitment award from Enantra, south India’s biggest entrepreneurship festival, an initiative of Anna University’s Centre for Entrepreneurship Development.

Talking about this first-of-its-kind solution, Ashokk Remi John, Founder and CEO, Jobaskit, said, “There has been a higher rate of adoption of Artificial Intelligence in recruitment processes across the world. However, AI has its own limitations. It works based primarily on keywords. People can easily game the system and come across as eligible candidates for jobs posted online. However, CI is all about using both AI and human intelligence to identify right candidates. At Jobaskit, we go not only by the information supplied by the candidates but also process the endorsements and opinions of their past employers and teachers. This two-layer mechanism helps us provide organisations with a high-quality recruitable pool. Our services also eliminate the scope for job scams as the jobs are published by the companies are visible on their corporate websites through Jobaskit smart career page.” Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 25:43Loaded: 2.31%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -25:43 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

The company takes the responsibility of maintaining the career section of the official website of organisations with updated information, and of responding to applicants. The job applications, irrespective of their source, are processed using CI at the Jobaskit tech platform in the backend. 
Jobaskit’s is a recruiter-friendly platform, unlike that of traditional online portals that focus more on employees. The company also does not sell the database of job seekers to employees. It collects an annual subscription fee, after the completion of a limited trial period. Its core services of offering fool-proof filtering solutions targets organisations of all sizes. Jobaskit publishes jobs on its portal; powers career pages of corporate websites; connects hirers with academic campuses; conducts aptitude assessments online, and provides unlimited access to databases all at highly flexible and competitive rates. 
The company does not charge candidates for listing their resumes or processing their applications. It enables job seekers to get employer recommendations; know the strength of companies before applying; understand the profile match with the culture of organisations, and stand out in the job market by presenting the recommendations of past employers and teachers. They can also restrict the companies to invite for jobs. The company is planning to come up with exclusive solutions for students campus placements.

The patent-pending CI-based screening and filtering solution creates databases with a 10x higher composition of recruitable talent, compared to that of traditional online job portals which rely only on automation.The startup has won an award at the Internet 2.0 Conference (www.internet2conf.com), an international tech forum held at Dubai in March this year, under the category of Innovative Product. During the same month, Jobaskit has been recognized with the Business Leadership Award under the Promising Startup category from the Indian Achievers Forum (iafindia.com), and Excellence in Recruitment award from Enantra, south India's biggest entrepreneurship festival, an initiative of Anna University's Centre for Entrepreneurship Development.Talking about this first-of-its-kind solution, Ashokk Remi John, Founder and CEO, Jobaskit, said, ""There has been a higher rate of adoption of Artificial Intelligence in recruitment processes across the world. However, AI has its own limitations. It works based primarily on keywords. People can easily game the system and come across as eligible candidates for jobs posted online. However, CI is all about using both AI and human intelligence to identify right candidates. At Jobaskit, we go not only by the information supplied by the candidates but also process the endorsements and opinions of their past employers and teachers. This two-layer mechanism helps us provide organisations with a high-quality recruitable pool. Our services also eliminate the scope for job scams as the jobs are published by the companies are visible on their corporate websites through Jobaskit smart career page."" According to him, the other important differentiator of Jobaskit is that it lets candidates apply for jobs directly from the official website of hiring organisations and recruitment agencies, though they could do so from the Jobaskit portal. The company takes the responsibility of maintaining the career section of the official website of organisations with updated information, and of responding to applicants. The job applications, irrespective of their source, are processed using CI at the Jobaskit tech platform in the backend. Jobaskit's is a recruiter-friendly platform, unlike that of traditional online portals that focus more on employees. The company also does not sell the database of job seekers to employees. It collects an annual subscription fee, after the completion of a limited trial period. Its core services of offering fool-proof filtering solutions targets organisations of all sizes. Jobaskit publishes jobs on its portal; powers career pages of corporate websites; connects hirers with academic campuses; conducts aptitude assessments online, and provides unlimited access to databases all at highly flexible and competitive rates. The company does not charge candidates for listing their resumes or processing their applications. It enables job seekers to get employer recommendations; know the strength of companies before applying; understand the profile match with the culture of organisations, and stand out in the job market by presenting the recommendations of past employers and teachers. They can also restrict the companies to invite for jobs. The company is planning to come up with exclusive solutions for students campus placements. This story is provided by NewsVoir.
