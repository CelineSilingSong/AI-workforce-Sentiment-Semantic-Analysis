The panel warns that regulators could be caught out by the rapid pace of change, referring to the “potential disparity between the pace of technological progress and the pace of a regulatory response”.Other potential risks raised in the report include concerns around bias, reflected by the fact that widely used AI models are trained on data that “disproportionately represents western cultures”, as well as fears over losing control of AI systems.The report concludes that the near future around general purpose AI is “uncertain”, with “very positive” and “very negative” outcomes, and the decisions of societies and governments will play a key role in how the technology progresses.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Job lossesComputingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMichigan man kills himself after running over 80-year-old Trump supporterTrump files complaint against Harris for taking over Biden’s campaign fundsUkraine war briefing: ‘Occupiers’ ship severely damaged’ in Kavkas across from CrimeaNashville struggles to respond as neo-Nazi groups turn focus on to cityTrump team makes complaint about Harris campaign funds – as it happened",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the growth of career options exploding in the field of AI, interest is skyrocketing. To help marketers understand how to break into the field, I sought insight from Marc Cenedella, founder of Leet Resumes and The Ladders, and author of seven Amazon Careers #1 bestsellers. To address this complex issue, this is the second part of a two-part series (the first part is available here).


When asked how marketers can land a job in AI, Cenedella suggested that there are 4 things they can do.

Demonstrate Interest. “Marketers should demonstrate they are putting in the time and effort to become experts. This includes practicing daily with AI tools and proving to prospective employers that you have curiosity, capacity, and capability.”

Read. “Demonstrate that you’re reading newsletters in the field, keeping up with research on Large Language Models (like ChatGPT), and engaging in online forums.”

Update Resume and Cover Letter - Carefully. “Many people are attempting to use ChatGPT for this. That is a mistake. ChatGPT is a generic Large Language Model. Generic models produce generic results. Your resume is not the place to be average.”
PROMOTED
Use the Right Tools. “Standout AI resumes require specialized AI tools. A free AI-based resume writing service like Leet Resumes (leet.co) guides you through the process step-by-step (you don’t even have to try to figure out good resume writing prompts). It will create a resume and cover letter that sets you apart from other applicants so you can get that new job faster and easier than ever before.

In brief
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can help improve work processes, yet they also carry the risks of liability, penalties, and reputational damage. Companies deploying AI must understand their responsibilities and obligations under the current regulatory frameworks within the EU and the anticipated requirements of the EU AI Act. Particularly for the HR department, it is prudent for HR managers to implement the following basic principles regarding AI.

Introduction of standardized AI rules
Before implementing AI, companies need to carefully plan their AI strategy and introduce internal company guidelines on AI. These guidelines should be set out in a corporate-wide AI policy and should include, among others, the following rules:

The use of AI should only be permitted following the completion of AI introductory training. Employees should only be allowed to continue using AI after completing AI training courses as prescribed by the company.
Employees may only use AI systems approved by the company and only for business purposes.
AI may only be used for certain tasks, e.g., creating tables and texts, revising presentations, summarizing articles, and creating LinkedIn posts.
Employees should ensure that end products or work results produced by AI are clearly labeled as being generated by AI.
Employees should not input business secrets, confidential information and personal data into the AI system.
Employees must check AI-generated content for accuracy and compliance with applicable laws. If they are unclear about whether the content is compliant, employees must seek the opinion of the legal department.
Employees using AI are required to consult with the legal department before publishing AI-generated content to ensure compatibility with IP rights, personal rights, and trademark rights.

Compliance with data protection
AI should only be used in the workplace if the company implements a comprehensive data security strategy. To be compliant with data protection laws, companies must take the following steps before implementing AI systems:

The company must assess the types of data categories that AI can process and ensure that the processing is based on a specific legal basis. For non-sensitive data, processing can usually be justified on grounds of legitimate interest. However, when processing sensitive data (e.g., health data, data on trade union membership, information on the origin or sexual orientation, etc.), the processing must be based on a regulation provided by law or a collective agreement (e.g., on the basis of payroll obligations or to fulfill reporting obligations to authorities) or alternatively be based on a works council agreement.
Furthermore, data processing via AI must serve a specific and legitimate purpose (e.g., organizing working timetables and shift schedules, organizing employee absences) and may only take place if necessary to achieve that purpose.
The company must also inform employees about the data that is being processed, the purpose of the data processing, the means used for the data processing, and the legal basis for the processing.
Depending on the technical capabilities of the AI system, the company must also carry out a data protection impact assessment. This is particularly necessary if the impact of AI on the workforce is difficult to assess.
When transferring employee data to third parties (e.g., the AI software is not hosted on the company’s local servers or if the company allows group companies to access employee data), the company is also obliged to agree terms with third parties on protecting customer and employee-related data. There are further obligations to consider when transferring data to third countries.
If AI systems enable automated decision-making in HR management, the company must ensure that the automated decision-making process is only a preliminary process and that the final decision is made by a human being.

In addition, employees can submit requests to the company for information about their personal data being processed. If necessary, employees can escalate their concerns to the data protection authority.
Compliance with the co-determination rights of the workforce

A company must obtain the works council’s consent via a works council agreement before implementing AI models.
Where there is no competent works council, a company needs to obtain the individual contractual consent of the employees if the AI system is invasive.
Where there is a competent works council, companies must proactively inform the works council about the following before using AI for the first time: the data categories of the processed employee data,.the software used, the specific programs installed, any evaluation and processing procedures (e.g., the possibility of linking, duplicating, changing data), and any recipients of this data.
Furthermore, the works council has a right to be consulted and advised on the health effects of the AI system on the workforce. The works council can also request access to the AI system.

Risks of non-compliance
Penalties: Employees can initiate a complaint against their employer for breaches of data protection obligations. If the data protection authority confirms the existence of violations, this may trigger administrative fines of up to EUR 20 million or up to 4% of the annual global turnover, whichever is higher.
Damages and discrimination cases: Employees have the right to sue for damages if there are data protection violations and discriminatory AI results and to initiate discrimination proceedings before the authorities and courts.
Injunctions: In the event of non-compliance with co-determination rights, the works council can enforce the deactivation of the AI system via a court ruling, in some cases even via a preliminary injunction.
Reputational damage: Companies will not only be exposed to financial and legal risks. As proceedings before administrative authorities and courts are open to the public, it can also trigger reputational damage.
Recommendation
Several steps must be taken before implementing any AI systems to leverage their potential while ensuring HR compliance. These steps will also help organizations to prepare for their obligations under the EU AI Act. Not only is it necessary to introduce clear AI guidelines, but it is also vital to create awareness within the workforce regarding AI. This is the only way to prevent or at least reduce liability, penalties, and reputational damage. In addition, early engagement with the works council on the potential implementation of AI will help accelerate the implementation process of AI.

The journalism industry has been under immense economic pressure over the past two decades, so it makes sense that journalists have started experimenting with generative AI to boost their productivity.
An Associated Press survey published in April 2024 asked journalists about the use of generative artificial intelligence in their work. Nearly 70% of those who responded said they had used these tools to generate text, whether it was composing article drafts, crafting headlines or writing social media posts.
A May 2024 global survey conducted by the public relations firm Cision found the slice to be somewhat smaller – 47% of journalists said they’d used generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Bard in their work. 
But does the adoption of the technology pose any moral questions? After all, this is a business where professional ethics and public trust are especially important – so much so that there are fields of study devoted to it.
Over the past few years, my colleagues and I at UMass Boston’s Applied Ethics Center have been researching the ethics of AI. 
I think that if journalists are not careful about its deployment, the use of generative AI could undermine the integrity of their work.
How much time is really saved?
Let’s start with an obvious concern: AI tools are still unreliable. 
Using them to research background for a story will often result in confident-sounding nonsense. During a 2023 demo, Google’s chatbot, Bard, famously spit out the wrong answer to a question about new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope.
It’s easy to imagine a journalist using the technology for background, only to end up with false information.
Therefore, journalists who use these tools for research will need to fact-check the outputs. The time spent doing that may offset any purported gains in productivity.
But to me, the more interesting questions have to do with using the technology to generate content. A reporter may have a good sense of what they want to compose, so they will ask an AI model to produce a first draft. 
This may be efficient, but it also turns reporters from writers into editors, thus fundamentally altering the nature of what they do. 
Plus, there’s something to be said for struggling to write a first draft from scratch and figuring out, along the way, whether the original idea that inspired it has merit. That’s what I am doing right now as I write this piece. And I’m sad to report that I discarded quite a few of the original arguments I wanted to make, because as I tried to articulate them, I realized that they didn’t work.
In journalism, as in art, generative AI emphasizes – indeed fetishizes – the moment in which an idea is conceived. It focuses on the original creative thought and relegates the tedious process of turning that thought into a finished product – whether it’s through outlining, writing or drawing – to a machine. 
But the process of writing out a story is inseparable from the ideas that give rise to it. Ideas change and take shape as they are written out. They are not preexisting entities patiently floating around, perfectly formed, simply waiting to be translated into words and sentences.
AI’s undermining of a special relationship
To be fair, only a portion of the journalists in both surveys were using generative AI to compose drafts of articles. Instead, they were using these tools to accomplish other tasks, such as writing newsletters, translating text, coming up with headlines or crafting social media posts.
Once journalists see that the AI is quite talented at writing – and it is getting better and better at it – how many of them will resist the temptation?
The fundamental question here is whether journalism involves anything more than simply conveying information to the public. 
Does journalism also entail a kind of relationship between writers and their readers? 
I think it does. 
When a reader regularly follows the analysis of someone writing about the Middle East or about Silicon Valley, it is because they trust that writer, because they like that writer’s voice, because they have come to appreciate that writer’s thought process. 
Now if journalism involves that kind of relationship, does the use of AI undermine it? Would I want to read journalism created by what amounts to an anonymized aggregation of the internet any more than I would want to read a novel created by an AI or listen to music composed by one? 
Or, stated differently, if I read a piece of journalism or a novel or listened to a musical piece, which I thought was created by a human being, only to find out that it was largely generated by an AI, wouldn’t my appreciation or trust of the piece change?
If the practice of journalism is based on having this kind of relationship with the public, the increased use of AI may well undermine the integrity of the practice, particularly at a time when the industry is already dealing with trust issues.
Being a journalist is a noble calling that, at its best, helps sustain democratic institutions. I assume that this nobility still matters to journalists. But most readers probably would not trust AI to uphold the social role that journalism plays. 
AI does not care that “democracy dies in darkness”; it does not care about speaking truth to power.
Yes, those are cliches. But they are also widely held precepts that sustain the trade. Journalists neglect them at their peril.

Generative AI can be a skill leveller, even a force multiplier, and marketers need training to understand it. But what it can’t do is replicate core capabilities like creativity, curiosity and communication.
At Econsultancy’s second quarterly Marketing Capability Leaders Forum, senior marketers gathered to discuss the ongoing challenge and opportunity presented by generative AI.
In the event’s opening presentation, Econsultancy’s SVP Learning, Stefan Tornquist, drew attention to the gap between marketers’ use of generative AI in their day-to-day lives and the amount of training they are offered.
One survey of 1,100 US marketing professionals found that 56% of them use generative AI tools every day, while a Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) study found that 47% of European marketing teams and agencies are using AI on a regular basis.
However, according to Econsultancy’s 2024 Digital Trends research with Adobe, only 25% of marketing enterprises already have skill-building programs centred on AI (although an additional 44% say that this is a work in progress).
“This continuum is very interesting … we’ve got about twice as many people actively using ‘desktop AI’ than are getting learning around it,” Tornquist observed.
The use of generative AI by marketers (and business professionals more generally) has been shown to raise the ‘floor’ of marketing ability, giving marketers a higher baseline level of aptitude across the board. But how can enterprises succeed in raising the ‘ceiling’ – the highest quality of work that can be produced with the assistance of generative AI?
Stefan Tornquist, Econsultancy SVP Learning and Research
Generative AI as ‘force multiplier’
A landmark study conducted by Boston Consulting Group with support from Harvard Business School, MIT Sloan School of Management, The Wharton School and the University of Warwick, set out to quantify the impact of using generative AI (GPT-4) in knowledge work.
Of the 758 consultants involved in the study, 90% of participants improved their performance when generative AI assisted them with a creative product innovation task, performing on average 40% better than the control group who didn’t use generative AI.
Those knowledge workers with a higher level of aptitude benefited less, only seeing a 17% improvement in quality on average (compared with 43% for lower-level performers). This shows how generative AI can have a ‘skill levelling’ effect among professionals.
However, when using generative AI for a business problem-solving task – which is deemed to be outside generative AI’s “current frontier of competence” – participants performed 23% worse on average than those not using generative AI.
Tornquist summarised the role that can be played by generative AI along two axes: mastery of generative AI itself, and mastery of the discipline it’s being applied to.

When mastery of generative AI is high but mastery of the discipline is low, genAI can be a ‘skill leveller’.
When mastery of the discipline is high but mastery of generative AI is low, generative AI acts as an assistant. “It’s a compression algorithm for the mundane,” as Tornquist put it.
When both mastery of both generative AI and the discipline are high: that’s when generative AI becomes a ‘force multiplier’.
How can marketers be exceptional in a world of generative AI?
Beyond mastery of generative AI as a tool, what makes an exceptional marketer in an era where the ‘floor’ is raised for everyone?
Tornquist divided capability into three key areas:

Core capability: what are often deemed ‘soft skills’ – critical thinking, curiosity, creativity, mindset, communication
Knowledge: understanding context and the deeper underpinnings of the marketing discipline
Skills: everything from SEO to writing subject lines.

Skills is the area currently being eroded by generative AI: “the closer we get to the screen … that’s what AI is already able to do,” Tornquist summarised. Generative AI can save marketers time spent learning how to build pivot tables by simply building a pivot table.
What generative AI can’t replicate is the core skills – which is why Tornquist prefers to use this term over ‘soft skills’. “If you were going to build a marketer, you’d start here,” he said. “They have to have critical thinking – because things move so quickly [that] the more we have smart automation doing some of the job, the more important it is that we are critical thinkers [who] know what questions to ask.
“…What I think has already started to happen post-Covid … as a result of AI, and will accelerate, is an increasing focus on knowledge and core [capabilities],” said Tornquist.
How to build core capabilities that stick
Learning is now available to marketers in more forms than ever before, but how can organisations make sure that it has a lasting impact? Tornquist outlined three key steps to take:
Learn together, at the same time
While on-demand learning can be valuable when a marketer has a specific question, it’s less useful for building an underlying foundation for those core capabilities. Additionally, retention of that knowledge can be poor once the question is answered.
By making significant parts of the learning (such as the kick-off) time-dependent and synchronised – whether in person or virtual – organisations can make sure employees are making time for learning and engaging with it.
Build an emotional connection to the learning
This can be accomplished by creating a social dynamic around learning – again, through learning alongside colleagues – and also through incorporating an applied learning component, to set learning in context.
“It’s much more inspiring to see what might happen when it’s your own data and your own problems,” said Tornquist. “And it’s a way that we’re actually going to remember what we learn.”
Implement ‘appointment learning’
Whether it’s time set aside for a week-long training course or a virtual session lasting an hour, appointment learning gives marketers permission to learn.
“[It says] ‘This is really important to us, and it’s important to you – and we’re going to make the time for you’,” said Tornquist.

Econsultancy runs an AI for Marketing short course, as well as tailored learning academies for large marketing and ecommerce teams.

According to the 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report from Microsoft and LinkedIn, the use of generative AI has nearly doubled in the past six months with 75% of global knowledge workers now utilising the technology. As per the report, 92% of knowledge workers in India are also using generative AI at work. The report claims that the employees are also independently introducing AI tools into their workflows to grapple with the increasing pace and volume of work. 72% of Indian AI users are bringing their own AI (BYOAI) to work, the report adds. However, leaders have recognised AI as a business imperative and many feel their organisations lack a clear plan and vision to transition from individual benefits to leveraging AI for significant business impact. The pressure to demonstrate immediate ROI is causing hesitation among leaders, despite the undeniable inevitability of AI.How AI has turned out to be an integral part of the workforceAI is being integrated into the workplace at an unprecedented scale. Currently, 3 out of 4 knowledge workers globally use AI in their daily tasks, with 46% having adopted it in the past six months. The report claims90% of users reported that AI helps them save time.85% said it allows them to focus on their most important work.84% find it boosts their creativity.83% enjoy their work more as a result.For instance, the most active Teams users (the top 5%) used Copilot to summarize 8 hours of meetings in March alone, equating to an entire workday.BYOAI is the new workplace trendWithout top-level guidance, employees are discreetly bringing their own AI tools to work, with 78% of AI users engaging in this practice, especially at small and medium-sized companies (80%). The report also claims that this trend spans all generations. Over half of AI users (52%) are hesitant to disclose using AI for important tasks, fearing it makes them appear replaceable (53%). This hidden AI use means missing out on strategic benefits and risks to company data, with cybersecurity being a top concern. The report claims that workload pressures are driving this behaviour, as 68% struggle with the pace and volume of work, leading to burnout. Communication tasks dominate the workday, with 85% of emails read in under 15 seconds.What leaders think about using AI in the workplaceWhile most leaders have recognised AI as essential, the pressure for immediate return on investment (ROI) causes hesitation. 79% believe AI is crucial for competitiveness, but 59% are concerned about measuring its productivity gains. This uncertainty hinders strategic planning, with 60% fearing their leadership lacks a clear AI implementation vision. Leaders familiar with AI see its potential for transformation, expecting to redesign business processes and manage AI bots within five years. They also foresee ensuring ethical AI use as a key responsibility. As employees overwhelmed by digital workloads turn to AI for relief, leaders have the opportunity to harness this momentum into tangible ROI.For this report, Microsoft and surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries and identified the labour and hiring trends from LinkedIn.

But the inner workings of the AI models remain opaque, and efforts to peer inside them to check exactly what is happening haven’t progressed very far. Beneath the surface, neural networks—today’s most powerful type of AI—consist of billions of artificial “neurons” represented as decimal-point numbers. Nobody truly understands what they mean, or how they work.For those concerned about risks from AI, this fact looms large.

Researchers developed a technique for essentially scanning the “brain” of an AI model, allowing them to identify collections of neurons—called “features”—corresponding to different concepts. And for the first time, they successfully used this technique on a frontier large language model, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet, the lab’s second-most powerful system, .In one example, Anthropic researchers discovered a feature inside Claude representing the concept of “unsafe code.” By stimulating those neurons, they could get Claude to generate code containing a bug that could be exploited to create a security vulnerability. But by suppressing the neurons, the researchers found, Claude would generate harmless code.The findings could have big implications for the safety of both present and future AI systems. The researchers found millions of features inside Claude, including some representing bias, fraudulent activity, toxic speech, and manipulative behavior. And they discovered that by suppressing each of these collections of neurons, they could alter the model’s behavior.As well as helping to address current risks, the technique could also help with more speculative ones. For years, the primary method available to researchers trying to understand the capabilities and risks of new AI systems has simply been to chat with them. This approach, sometimes known as “red-teaming,” can help catch a model being toxic or dangerous, allowing researchers to build in safeguards before the model is released to the public. But it doesn’t help address one type of potential danger that some AI researchers are worried about: the risk of an AI system becoming smart enough to deceive its creators, hiding its capabilities from them until it can escape their control and potentially wreak havoc.“If we could really understand these systems—and this would require a lot of progress—we might be able to say when these models actually are safe, or whether they just appear safe,” Chris Olah, the head of Anthropic’s interpretability team who led the research, tells TIME.“The fact that we can do these interventions on the model suggests to me that we're starting to make progress on what you might call an X-ray, or an MRI [of an AI model],” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei adds. “Right now, the paradigm is: let's talk to the model, let's see what it does. But what we'd like to be able to do is look inside the model as an object—like scanning the brain instead of interviewing someone.”The research is still in its early stages, Anthropic said in a summary of the findings. But the lab struck an optimistic tone that the findings could soon benefit its AI safety work. “The ability to manipulate features may provide a promising avenue for directly impacting the safety of AI models,” Anthropic said. By suppressing certain features, it may be possible to prevent so-called “jailbreaks” of AI models, a type of vulnerability where safety guardrails can be disabled, the company added.Researchers in Anthropic’s “interpretability” team have been trying to peer into the brains of neural networks for years. But until recently, they had mostly been working on far smaller models than the giant language models currently being developed and released by tech companies.One of the reasons for this slow progress was that individual neurons inside AI models would fire even when the model was discussing completely different concepts. “This means that the same neuron might fire on concepts as disparate as the presence of semicolons in computer programming languages, references to burritos, or discussion of the Golden Gate Bridge, giving us little indication as to which specific concept was responsible for activating a given neuron,” Anthropic said in its summary of the research.To get around this problem, Olah’s team of Anthropic researchers zoomed out. Instead of studying individual neurons, they began to look for groups of neurons that would all fire in response to a specific concept. This technique worked—and allowed them to graduate from studying smaller “toy” models to larger models like Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet, which has billions of neurons. Although the researchers said they had identified millions of features inside Claude, they cautioned that this number was nowhere near the true number of features likely present inside the model. Identifying all the features, they said, would be prohibitively expensive using their current techniques, because doing so would require more computing power than it took to train Claude in the first place. (Costing somewhere in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.) The researchers also cautioned that although they had found some features they believed to be related to safety, more study would still be needed to determine whether those features could reliably be manipulated to improve a model’s safety.For Olah, the research is a breakthrough that proves the utility of his esoteric field, interpretability, to the broader world of AI safety research. “Historically, interpretability has been this thing on its own island, and there was this hope that someday it would connect with [AI] safety—but that seemed far off,” Olah says. “I think that’s no longer true.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patient representatives involved in a new report were favorable to AI in healthcare but insisted on transparency and the availability of alternatives.  (iStock / Getty Images Plus / zhuweiyi49)
While generative AI holds much promise in alleviating burdens in healthcare, concerns around transparency, bias and clinical deskilling remain, a new report says.The IHI Lucian Leape Institute, a think tank within the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, convened an expert panel to build out the report. The panel was made up of Big Tech players like Amazon, Google and Microsoft as well as leaders such as Harvard Medical School, The Leapfrog Group and Kaiser Permanente. Together, their goal was to identify the main areas where generative AI is likely to be used as well as its challenges and the potential ways to mitigate them.“There's a lot of conversation about AI in healthcare in general,” IHI President and CEO Kedar Mate, M.D., told Fierce Healthcare. Mate is also president of the Leape Institute. “Before that got fully underway, we wanted to be sure that concerns … were being thought about,” he said.Most generative AI promises detailed in the report came as no surprise: the ability to reduce clinician burnout, improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the costs of care. The risks the report identified included the depersonalization of care, inaccuracies and bias, challenges with integration and workforce deskilling.The 50-page report contained a multitude of specific recommendations for various stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem. It identified six best practices to guide the ongoing development of generative AI tools and their integration into clinical care delivery: Serve and safeguard the patientLearn with, engage and listen to cliniciansEvaluate and ensure AI efficacy and freedom from biasEstablish strict AI governance, oversight and guidance for health systems and the federal governmentBe intentional with the design, implementation and ongoing evaluation of AI toolsEngage in collaborative learning across health systems “Key groups must work together with intention and discipline to implement genAI in ways that enhance patient safety,” the report said. The report built its recommendations around three areas anticipated to be the primary use cases for generative AI in the near future: documentation support, clinical decision support and patient chatbots.Generative AI for documentation support is pretty widely used already, Mate noted, with patient chatbots not far behind. But clinical decision support tools will take longer to roll out, in part due to trust and validation concerns and also the need for a solid regulatory framework to approve algorithms.“That type of technology still needs to evolve,” Mate said. Administrative uses are already further along. “That doesn’t face the same kind of regulatory pressure because they’re not patient-facing,” per Mate.Documentation support GenAI tools can and are being used in an administrative setting, from developing patient history summaries to transcribing conversations to drafting responses to patient messages. These offerings, the report said, can reduce clinical documentation burden, resolve inaccuracies in the EHR, improve the accessibility of documentation and strengthen communication. But several risks and challenges exist for these use cases. There might be a lack of patient transparency or informed consent on the use of a tool. Clinicians may have to spend more time manually reviewing flagged inaccuracies. And, importantly, even if a tool frees up a clinician’s time, that free time might be replaced by new expectations, such as seeing a greater volume of patients. “If we take that newly freed up time … will that actually create more burnout in the end, is the concern,” Mate said. When it comes to who should or is likely to be responsible for ensuring that doesn’t happen, Mate believes it will fall to health systems’ AI governance committees as opposed to outside regulators. What’s more, the onus on these committees will be not only to be proactive about the thoughtful procurement of AI tools, but also the meaningful ongoing auditing of such tools, which are continuously learning.Additionally, deskilling was identified as a threat to generative AI in documentation support. There may be an over-reliance on tools that may then lead to unnoticed errors and inadequate oversight, the report said. To combat this, there should be exercises built into clinician workflows to help keep their memory active on how to manually perform certain automated tasks. One example identified in the report included TSA agents, who are periodically shown images of weapons in luggage to test their level of attention and to promote vigilance. Mate believes deskilling is a real concern, because, as the industry evolves, so, too, do approaches to teaching. For instance, to become a licensed doctor, Mate took a closed-book exam. But a decade later, when he re-certified, it was an open-book exam. “In just 10 years’ time … a very significant difference had emerged,” Mate reflected. Thus, it is inevitable that the way of thinking in medical schools will continue to evolve with the emergence of AI technologies. “I do think this risk, or benefit, of changing skills is very high,” Mate said.Clinical decision support Generative AI tools could offer diagnostic support and recommendations, provide early detection of changes to patient conditions or suggest treatment plans. These applications can potentially improve accuracy, save clinicians time and possibly reduce costs. But many risks related to generative AI clinical decision support remain, per the report.There is not a lot of evidence supporting their effectiveness. Rigorous evaluations of clinical decision support tools, mostly before the advent of generative AI, have yielded small improvements in clinician behaviors, the report highlighted. There are some successful AI-based clinical decision support examples, but they have involved supervised machine learning. One example is the use of AI-based computer aided detection in radiology, now routinely used in mammography. Additionally, any excitement about tools is tempered by evidence that they can contribute to alert fatigue and frustrations with EHRs. There are also concerns about clinical over-reliance, compliance and automation bias. At the same time, it’s unrealistic to expect clinicians to double-check the accuracy of every single generative AI recommendation, per Mate. There need to be new digital ways to audit algorithms.“The volume of these clinical decision supports that AI can offer... will become a new cognitive burden and load that clinicians will have to carry,” Mate cautioned. And these tools must be promoted as an aid to, not a replacement for, clinical decision-making.Chatbots supporting patients Generative AI as a patient-facing chatbot can help collect data and support patient triage, respond to basic patient questions and facilitate care navigation. These functions can expand access to care, democratize access to understandable information and offer more accurate and reliable data, the report said.But there are concerns about the ethics of technology that mimics a human as well as whether that is being properly disclosed to a user. There are also concerns about chatbots’ accuracy, the loss of human connection and information flow—that is, what can help guarantee a patient that is triaged to a high-risk category actually gets the care they need.The report offered several mitigation strategies, including embedding disclosures of a chatbot’s function for patients, designing chatbots with guardrails and ensuring escalation pathways for chatbot users. An example of a guardrail is having certain prompts that a chatbot cannot respond to. Maintaining human oversight of chatbots also remains crucial, the report said. That includes routine auditing of chatbot performance and clinical review of conversations to ensure that patients’ needs are being met.Patient representatives involved in the report were pretty favorable to AI being used in care, Mate said. They have hope in its ability to possibly remove the “chronic headaches” of patient safety and quality—things like human errors in drug interactions or handoffs. But they insist on transparency around AI use.“The patient community was very clear on the fact that at least for now… there would be a clear annotation to whatever work product is created that was aided and augmented by an AI technology,” Mate said.“So much around how this technology is going to be deployed in our environments is not worked out, and I hope this paper and the various audiences in it … will help,” Mate concluded.

The AI Safety Institute will work to establish artificial intelligence testing metrics and standards as detailed by a new guiding document.







































The U.S. Department of Commerce released a guiding document Tuesday for operations of its AI Safety Institute, run out of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The institute was created in November 2023 to support the mandates given to the Department of Commerce under President Joe Biden’s October 2023 executive order.The new Strategic Vision contains three focal goals: advance the science of AI safety; articulate, demonstrate and disseminate the practices of AI safety; and support institutions and entities coordinating AI safety protocols.“Safety breeds trust, trust provides confidence in adoption, and adoption accelerates innovation,” the Strategic Vision says.A key challenge the Strategic Vision aims to confront is the lack of global standards and testing metrics to effectively evaluate safety in AI systems. It also looks to bring more coordinated global effort to developing testing and validation metrics for AI systems, as well as asking for national laboratory and other federal agency participation.Conducting assessments, A/B testing and red teaming efforts in emerging systems to assess various security threats are among the methods the Strategic Visions champions to ensure AI systems are rights- and security-preserving prior to deployment.Three overarching words — “possible,” “actionable,” and “sustainable” — will also serve as guiding principles in AISI’s ongoing work to better evaluate the societal impact of advanced AI systems.The AISI will then work to further evangelize the methodologies and metric systems which arise from thoroughly testing fledgling AI technologies.. “AlSI’s projects may contribute to scientific reports, articles, guidance, and practices to help ensure that rigorous Al safety research, testing, and guidance inform major domestic Al safety legislation or policy,” the guidance reads.Just last month the AISI added several new members to its leadership team.

If you value articles like the one you're reading right now,  give today.(MONTAGE)CNN NEWS ANCHOR: Tonight we're taking a closer look at a new technology that's making waves in the world of AI.FOX NEWS ANCHOR: ChatGPT.BBC NEWS ANCHOR: ChatGPT.WALL STREET JOURNAL NEWS ANCHOR: ChatGPT. A state of the art conversational AI model developed by OpenAI.CHAKRABARTI: Well, since the public release of its demo in November 2022, OpenAI and ChatGPT completely changed the public perception of artificial intelligence in everyday life. And it put one question in the sharpest relief yet: Is generative AI a job killer?(MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFED PERSON ON TIKTOK: Here’s how ChatGPT is going to kill jobs.AL JAZEERA ANCHOR: Let’s talk about AI and whether it’s going to take your job.AdvertisementUNIDENTIFIED PERSON ON TIKTOK: I think it’s just the start of tech layoffs. Let’s break it down.CBS NEWS ANCHOR: Artificial intelligence could replace millions of jobs.UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE ON TIKTOK: Will AI take your job? / Yeah. / What do you do for work? / I work at an AI company. / Oh nice.CHAKRABARTI: Well, last March, economists at Goldman Sachs estimated that AI could automate as many as 300 million full time jobs globally by 2030. So at first glance, one might expect a labor economist like David Autor to share those concerns.He's a professor of economics at MIT and co-director of the Labor Studies Program at the National Bureau of Economic Research. And for years, his research has shown that major steps forward in technology and automation have historically hurt middle and low-income American workers. And as generative AI climbs up the income scale in terms of the work it can do, those job loss and income reducing dangers seem to be firmly moving into white collar jobs, too.But David Autor's latest research has revealed something completely unexpected. He says AI could offer benefits and even help restore ""the middle-skill, middle class heart of the U.S. labor market that has been hollowed out by automation and globalization."" He's written that in an essay on Noema magazine called AI Could Actually Help Rebuild the Middle Class.Professor Autor joins us now. Welcome back to On Point.DAVID AUTOR: Thank you, Meghna. It's a pleasure to be here.CHAKRABARTI: So I want to actually start by going back to several years of your prior research about the workplace — or American work and technology. How would you generalize what you've found as each wave of technology and automation, you know, settles into workplaces?AUTOR: Sure. Thanks for the question. So, it's often, the question is often asked, is this time different? And the answer is yes. Actually every time is different. And the era of computerization, which many would say sort of really began in earnest in the early 1980s when it really reached offices and so on had a kind of a polarizing effect.Computers were really ideally suited for carrying out tasks, jobs that could be described by a set of formal rules. So the rules that you would use for doing accounting or proofreading and typesetting, but also in repetitive production and operative environments where people are doing skilled work, but following a very well-defined set of procedures.Traditional computers, pre-AI, are really good at following rules and operating tools. So things that can be codified as a series of steps that a machine that doesn't solve problems, doesn't have novel ideas, doesn't have innovative insights, but that can do that work rapidly and inexpensively, that was very displacing for people in offices and for people in many assembly line jobs.Now, the effect of that was polarizing because on the one hand, if you were a college-educated worker doing professional or technical or managerial work, a lot of your work is decision making. It's deciding how do I treat a patient, or how do I redesign a building, or how do I architect a piece of software, or how do I rewire a house, or, you know, plumb a new building. That's decision making work. And computerization is really helpful for that, because it provides the information and, and calculation that, that helps support good decisions. It doesn't make the decisions for you, but it provides input. So it made people much more effective in that type of work. So, computerization was really great for college educated workers and for many high paid workers.However, if you were in the middle group — in the clerical, office, administrative support, production, operative work, that work started disappearing. And if you couldn't move up into these professions, many people found themselves instead in services — food service, cleaning, security, entertainment, recreation, some low-paid home health care. Now, that's socially valuable work. I don't mean to denigrate it at all. But it's poorly paid. And the reason it's poorly paid is because it doesn't require much training or certification or expertise. It kind of uses a relatively generic skill set so that many people of sound mind and body can do that work without a lot of preparation.CHAKRABARTI: Yeah.AUTOR: And that means that wages tend to be low. And this is true across the all industrialized economies. Some pay those jobs better, some worse, but they're always at the bottom end of the earnings distribution.CHAKRABARTI: So let me summarize at least part of your work this way. It wasn't all that long ago I think that you coauthored a paper in the Quarterly Journal of Economics called New Frontiers, right? The Origins and Content of New Work from 1940 to 2018. That was a very interesting paper, Professor Autor.AUTOR: Thank you.CHAKRABARTI: Just to sort of quote a couple of things here. One is that the study found that since 1980, that technology replaced more jobs than it generated, right? And that 60% of jobs in 2018 actually never even existed in 1940, which makes a lot of sense due to the changes that you talked about. So there was an overall replacement there that technology did of jobs that outpaced the augmentation, which is the other part of the picture that you talk about that. um, That that augmentation or the ability, I guess, to do more with technology did add some jobs to the economy, but it wasn't as many as that were lost. Is that a fair way to just sort of roughly summarize that paper?AUTOR: That's correct. But let me let me offer a qualification.CHAKRABARTI: Okay.AUTOR: We're not running out of jobs. And so the discussion of the number of jobs, I think, is a little bit — is very alarming to people. But in fact, we're in a  period of sustained labor market scarcity. Our population is growing very slowly. Immigration has been highly restricted. Fertility is really low. And the labor force, the number of adults of working age is basically going to be relatively flat. It's growing at the slowest time in American history. And in fact, in most of the industrialized world, working age populations are declining.Now you might say, well, why is that a problem? We have fewer people. We need fewer jobs. However, there's a growing share of the population that is past their working age and has earned a well deserved retirement. And those young people are going to have to support them. And that requires work, and that requires productivity. And with shrinking numbers of young people, able-bodied workers, and so on, that actually creates a period of great scarcity. In fact, we're seeing this now in the United States with the extremely tight labor market after the pandemic.So the question is not the number of jobs. That's not what we should be worried about. It's the quality of those jobs. Do those jobs require expertise like those professional workers? Or do those jobs tend to use generic skill sets, so like those food service, cleaning, security workers? Again, intrinsically valuable jobs, but poorly paid. And that's what we should be focused on, expertise.And let me give you a concrete example I like to give. Think of the job of air traffic controller and crossing guard. These are basically the same job, right? The job is to prevent things from crashing into one another: planes into planes, cars into children, et cetera. And yet air traffic controllers are paid more than four times what crossing guards are. And again, the reason isn't social value, right? We don't want our children to be run over on the way to school. And if we had to pay crossing guards a lot of money to prevent that from happening, we surely would do so. The difference, again, is expertise. In the U.S., almost any adult of sound mind and body can become a crossing guard with with no training or certification, but to become an air traffic controller requires several years of air traffic control college and then hundreds to thousands of hours of apprenticeship.So, a world in which everyone is a crossing guard, a world in which we don't have much expert work, is less good for labor than a world in which everyone is an air traffic controller or doing some of their professional activity. So that's what we should be concerned about. Whether jobs will use expert skills that reward knowledge and competency and specialization. Or jobs that require, you know, human labor to do menial stuff.  That's not as good as a scenario.CHAKRABARTI: Okay. But I'm just going to go down this automation versus augmentation rabbit hole with you a little bit more, because I have to say I'm emerging right now a little bit confused. And then we'll dig into the AI part of your research here. Because I thought, and maybe I was mistaken, but I was under the impression that your research over many years had shown that regarding automation specifically, that overall the effects on employment of automation were overall negative?AUTOR: The effects on wages.CHAKRABARTI: On wages, okay.AUTOR: Exactly. And, I should say, it's not just me. There's a large set of really distinguished researchers who've worked on this problem. I think it's widely agreed that this polarization has occurred as automation has kind of hollowed out the middle and that has put downward pressure on people without college degrees. Not by reducing the number of workers per se, but by pushing workers into non-expert work that's paid poorly. And that's the primary concern. And so it is — that automation, if automation just takes the work that you're good at and allows the machine to do it better, cheaper, and faster, that is good for productivity potentially, but it's not good for you. (LAUGHS) Right?AdvertisementCHAKRABARTI: Yeah.AUTOR: And that's the challenge. To give another useful concrete example, I think. Since 1865, London taxi drivers have been required to acquire what's called ""the knowledge.""CHAKRABARTI: ""The knowledge,"" yeah.AUTOR: That's right. And it takes almost three years. And it's a complete memorization of the streets and highways and byways and overpasses and underpasses of London. It's an incredible feat of memorization. Literally brain scans show the changes in people's physiology of their brains coming from this act of memorization. Once smartphone-based routing was introduced, that knowledge was completely economically irrelevant.CHAKRABARTI: Uh-huh.AUTOR: Not only does, you know, Waze know all those highways and byways and streets and underpasses, but it also knows how much traffic is on them at any given point, which is something you could never memorize. So, a friend of a friend of mine is a London taxi driver, and now considers himself to be an entertainer and tour guide, not a driver at all.CHAKRABARTI: So he's trying to find new ways to add value.AUTOR: Exactly.Part IICHAKRABARTI: Some people say AI helps them work smarter, not harder.ELISE AZARA: We have this kind of inside joke in the office where the boss is like, ""Hey, have you tried running this through AI?"" You know, like no matter what the task is. And it has worked and it has proven as a helpful tool in some aspects.CHAKRABARTI: So this is Elise Azara in Spokane, Washington. She's director of marketing for a company called Zero Emissions Northwest, which helps farmers get grant funding for using renewable energy sources.As you heard Elise say, her boss is pretty big on AI, or at least on testing it out. He hopes it'll make their team more efficient. And Elise says so far she has used it to help write things like press releases and blog articles. There's an AI tool built into their project management software.AZARA: If I upload a start or like a headline, it'll start to try to draft it based on that. Or for instance, we used a lot of AI prompts to write the website, you know, just to try to give us, ""Hey, what would be a better way to paraphrase this page?"" It's kind of like having like a friend there that's like, ""Hey, have you thought about doing this?"" I can bounce ideas off of it. I mean, not to like personify AI. (LAUGHS) But I don't necessarily think my first idea is the best. I always want to kind of see what else could be out there. So in that sense, yes, it's very helpful.CHAKRABARTI: Also in that sense, she's doing what she would have usually done with other human beings, but doing it with AI saves her a lot of time. That's time she can now use to work on other things or spend with her two young children. But the AI's writing is not perfect. Elise still has to edit it. And sometimes trying to incorporate AI has actually created more work for her. She says one time her boss wanted to pull data from a bunch of different utility bills, and he spent hours uploading the documents.AZARA: He's copying and pasting, you know, the utility bills, or he's trying to convert it from a PDF to a Word or whatever, so that way he can get the data in there. And then he's asking the AI, he's prompting it, saying, ""Hey, I need total kilowatt hour usage,"" and this and that. And like, it would pull from the wrong columns. Or it would pull — it didn't know exactly what it was looking at. We had to be really careful because we're like, we don't want to rely on that. It was just easier for us to manually go in and kind of like pull that data ourselves.CHAKRABARTI: But in general, Elise says she has been pleasantly surprised by AI. She was initially a skeptic. And she does still get a little nervous about it.AZARA: It kind of was this moment of, ""Oh my gosh, I just wrote a press release in five seconds. That's insane."" It's awesome because it means I can devote more time to other projects, but yeah, I'm like, oh gosh, this is just the beginning. Like, where is it going to go from here? You know, am I writing myself out of a job? I don't know. I hope not! Because I would hope that you would still have — everything still needs an editor. That's kind of where I see my job going is, okay, I can use it as a tool, but it's not going to like overtake what I do.CHAKRABARTI: That's Elise Azara, a marketing director at Zero Emissions Northwest in Spokane, Washington. Well, David Autor is with us. He's a professor of economics at MIT and a very well known labor economist in the United States. And he's recently written an article that appeared in Noema magazine called AI Could Actually Help Rebuild the Middle Class.So, Professor Autor, Elise is a really interesting example there. But use her to make your case that that you state in your essay that unlike automation or technological advances in the past, which we talked earlier generally has had a net negative effect on wages, that perhaps AI could rebuild or help rebuild the middle class. I'll be honest, professor, I'm very skeptical, but give it your best shot. (LAUGHS)AUTOR: (LAUGHS) Great. So, first of all, there was so much in what Alicia (sic) just said. I thought that was terrific. And let me try to draw it out a bit. But I want to just step back a bit. I don't think computerization has lowered wages on average. It's that it's raised wage inequality a lot. So it has raised some people's wages a lot and other people's wages have fallen. And that's not, and I think that's, you know, not a deal I want to take.CHAKRABARTI: Oh yeah, I would agree. And I think actually a lot of the ways that we talk about economic and labor changes due to technology is quite misleading as we keep pointing to those averages. But it's the rise in the extremes that's really problematic. But go ahead.AUTOR: Right. We would be less productive and less wealthy in general, if we didn't have computerization to make many more things more productive, but some people would be certainly be better off.But let's go back to Elisa (sic). What's really, you know, terrific about her example — and many things are terrific about her example — is she's talking about a use of AI for which there was no pre-AI substitute, right? Your word processor previously could check your spelling and look for grammatical errors, but it couldn't complete your thought and write a whole, you know, you take a headline and it produces a new paragraph and suggests different ways to write marketing copy, right?And that's what illustrates something that's really distinct about AI. Previous computer technology followed rules. It just carried out the well-defined steps. But writing isn't like that. It requires actually going beyond the material, beyond the rules and putting in additional ideas and thoughts. And we don't know the formal procedures for doing that. We don't have a script for writing, you know, compelling marketing prose and AI doesn't either. What it's done is it's gone through vast amounts of unstructured text and ferreted out kind of patterns and ways of doing things that it can then replicate back for us.And so it learns from unstructured information. And a lot of the work that we do is ultimately  in that way. It's informal. We do many things that we don't have formal rules for doing. And so, for example, you know, writing or telling a joke or coming up with a great idea or hypothesis or a new product, right? We don't have a program. We haven't historically had a program for that. So AI goes beyond what was previously feasible. You can think of traditional computing is like, you know, studio musicians reading from the sheets of music and AI is more like a jazz musician that can improvise and riff on the material that you give it.But notice that what Elisa (sic) did not say is, ""This does my job for me."" What she said instead is, ""It helps. It speeds things up, but I need to be there supervising it because it comes up with crazy stuff."" (LAUGHS) Right? And so it actually requires her expertise to do this work. She did not say, ""Anybody could take this machine and do my job."" She said, ""I need to be there to supervise."" And this is true of a lot of AI applications. AI, because it's like a coworker, as she said. When you collaborate with someone else, you have to filter their ideas and their suggestions and determine, you just don't take someone else's opinion as ground truth.And we see this with AI all the time. So, for example, some colleagues of mine, Nikhil Agarwal and Tobias Salz and their co-authors, ran an experiment with an an X-ray — an AI radiology tool. It's called CheXpert, Chest X-ray Expert. And what it does is it reads scans, and then makes diagnoses, you know, this might be pneumonia, edema, et cetera.And it turns out this tool is really quite good. Working just with scans, without any ancillary information, it's about as accurate as 60% of radiologists are reading scans. Which is really amazing. And you can see this a beautiful application for AI because there are no clear, bright red lines for reading X-rays. It's a matter of judgment. You've seen many of them, you see patterns and you begin to recognize what it looks like. So AI is perfect for that because you don't have to tell it the rules, you just give it examples and eventually it infers the kind of underlying decision process.So you might think that given that this tool is as good as 60% of radiologists, radiologists using the tool would be even more effective. But it turns out they do worse using this tool than they do on their own reading scans. And there's a reason, and the reason is what my colleagues call ""correlated uncertainty."" So when the doctor is uncertain what a scan shows, the software is also often frequently uncertain, and it will report its level of uncertainty. And when the doctor is certain, the software is also usually very quite confident, and it reports its confidence.What tends to happen is when they're both uncertain, the doctor will defer to the AI. And when they're both confident and yet they disagree, the doctor will tend to override the AI. And in general, neither of those appears to be the right decision. (LAUGHS)CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS) Huh!AUTOR: When they're both uncertain, the doctor probably ought to go with his or her gut because they have a lot more ancillary information. When they're both certain and yet they disagree, the doctor should at least ask, look, this tool has seen millions of scans, more than I will see in my career, and we have a different diagnosis. The doctor should at least ask why they differ. That doesn't mean that machine can't be wrong. It just means it requires consideration. So here's the point I'm making, this comes back to Alicia's (sic) example — I'm sorry, did you say Elise or Elisa?CHAKRABARTI: It was Elise.AUTOR: Yeah. Elise. I'm sorry. Come back to Elise's example. It takes judgment to use the tool. The radiologist needs to supply his or her own judgment because this machine is opaque. It's error prone, and the fact that it appears confident or unconfident doesn't mean it's necessarily correct. And so when it comes to writing the marketing material, the software will come up with some good ideas, but they may be wrong. And you need someone who has an understanding of the job to filter that. And so she can --CHAKRABARTI: Oh --AUTOR: Yep, go ahead.CHAKRABARTI: Oh, no, no. So let me, so just to cut to the chase here, what you're saying is that — I mean and this was, in fact, I think the meatiest part of your paper — which is that you're saying that AI is transforming what expertise actually is in the labor market and its value.AUTOR: Precisely.CHAKRABARTI: And it sounds like you're saying, well, expertise now is going to be replaced — well, the expertise in terms of the manipulation and synthesis of information, AI will be doing, but the new value add will be the judgment from human beings.AUTOR: That absolutely right. So the most valuable work in the economy is decision-making work, right? When you're a doctor, you say, well, how do I treat this cancer patient? Or you're an architect designing a building or developing piece of software, or even figuring out how to land a plane or how to, you know, rewire a house. And in all those cases, these are high stakes decisions. They're one-off decisions, right? You're not making a decision for thousands. You're making a decision about an individual house or individual, individual patient and so on.And that's where human judgment combines with information, knowledge, and formal training, but often, but usually it's a judgment call. And AI is helpful for supporting those decisions. It doesn't make them for you in most cases, but it's helpful to kind of give you guidance and guardrails. Guidance like had you considered this? Guardrails, as in don't do that, right? Don't prescribe these two drugs together, they're negative, they'll negatively interact.And the good scenario, the way to use AI well, is to enable more people to do valuable decision-making work with this tool. In other words, to open up that high value work to people who are not quite at the elite frontier of the profession in which they are engaged.CHAKRABARTI: Mm.AUTOR: So an example I give frequently — and I want to be clear, this is not about AI specifically — is the occupation of nurse practitioners. Nurse practitioners are registered nurses who have an additional master's degree in nursing as NPs, and then a lot of training. And they do tasks that used to be limited exclusively to MDs. They do diagnosis, they do prescribing, they do treatment. And this is a great use of talent, of expertise. It lowers costs. It makes the care more accessible. It creates great jobs. Nurse practitioners are well paid.And it didn't come about because of technology. It came about because of actually a social movement where nurses recognized they were underused and fought against the kicking and screaming of the American Medical Association to create this new credential. But at this point, they're very heavily supported by technology, right? They have electronic medical records, they have diagnostic software, they have prescription software that looks for drug interactions, and this enables them to do a greater variety of care tasks. And it's easy to imagine a future where nurse practitioners have a larger scope of practice, where they can do more valuable work.And AI is a tool that can enable more people with the right foundational training and judgment to do more valuable work. So, for example, most software development is done by people with a fair amount of training in computer science. In the future, software development will be open to more people because you won't have to have as much formal knowledge of the tools. You'll just have to know what you're aiming for. Or if you're a contractor remodeling a house, you'll have better tools to visualize and show the customer and consider the engineering side of this.And even in writing, just as in Elise's example, you will have tools that help produce text faster. But very likely, you will need your own judgment and expertise to decide what's suitable, what's valuable, and what should be discarded.CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so Professor Autor, let me say that I have respected your work for years and years and years, but you're not quite shaking me out of my skepticism here. Because, because I wonder if we — I do think it's a potent argument that you're making. And let me just read a little section of your essay that summarizes what you just said.You said that, ""AI can enable a larger set of workers equipped with the necessary foundational training to perform those higher-stakes decision-making tasks currently arrogated to elite experts."" You mention doctors, lawyers, software engineers, et cetera.AUTOR: Professors. (LAUGHS)CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS) ""That AI used well can assist with restoring,"" this is the key part, ""the middle skill, middle class heart of the U.S. labor market that has been hollowed out by automation and globalization."" Okay. I am a little concerned though, or my skepticism rises because are we not falling into the trap of privileging the present, right? That very persistent human bias of not being able to accurately project that far out into the future. Because people probably made similar arguments in the past for previous technological disruptions. And to the point that you're making, it wasn't the number of jobs necessarily that went down, but the value of the new jobs being created.And so I'm not sure I'm convinced that we will have a lot of high value new jobs being created in this AI future that you're describing. I mean, the other thing that Elise said is that she still has that nagging worry that she's training the AI out of her own job, right? Because what would stop her boss in the future from saying, ""Well, I actually now don't even need an Elise. The AI has gotten good enough that I can just say, 'Write the the press release,' and I'm pretty confident that it'll write exactly what I need?""AUTOR: Good. These are great questions So, let me see if I can respond effectively to a subset of them. So the the other thing I actually wanted to come back to on Elise is you might be concerned there's too much of a good thing, right? So if everybody can do it then it's not very valuable, right? Expertise by definition means something that some people can do and not everyone can do. And so one concern is that eventually it'll just displace expertise in some areas completely. And that will certainly happen. I gave you the example of Waze, right? In certain types of software development, the software develop will develop itself. And, uh, and this has happened many times in the past, right?So, you know, we've had incredible productivity growth in agriculture, and as a result, we have very few people working in farming anymore relative to what it used to be, and yet we produce so much food. So we can certainly automate ourselves out of a job. But what has been true for individual sectors of the economy has never been true for the economy as a whole, right? It's not that productivity growth has ever made us poorer or less able to — or let me put it differently. Whenever we see a lot of productivity growth, we see booming employment and booming consumption, not the opposite. But that doesn't mean it isn't really negative for a subset of people, right?CHAKRABARTI: Mm-hmm.AUTOR: And we've seen this in many technological transitions. So in the movement from the kind of artisanal era to the industrial era, you know, skilled artisans were wiped out, the so called Luddites, right? I their replace, we eventually got a huge industrialized workforce in factories and offices, but it took decades for that transition to occur.Part IIICHAKRABARTI: So, Professor Autor, let me get back to you because you were saying that in previous technological transformations, right, the impact really played out over the course of decades and you were headed in a particular direction. Go ahead.AUTOR: That's correct. So the Industrial Revolution, it took about 60 years before it benefited rank and file workers. We had a good century of it from about 1880 to 1980 and it was a very productive way to organize work. It was complementary to people with high school educations and it built the middle class of a lot of the industrialized world.However, the transition was ugly. It displaced a lot of artisans and it created hardship, and also capitalists used it to basically indenture children and unmarried women into dirty and dangerous work. And so it was, it was a rough start. And the era that we're in now also will have real pain.So when I hear people talk about AI, I tend to think they're simultaneously too pessimistic and too optimistic. So let me start with too optimistic. People who are excited about AI will tend to say, ""Oh, you know, no one will be displaced. Everyone will just be more productive and more efficient and they'll have more time for their children, et cetera."" That's not true. There are certainly types of work that are — like those London taxi drivers I talked about — where the expertise that people have developed will be stranded. And there are still people driving London taxis, but their skills are not as valuable. Because most people can drive, or at least most people think they can drive.And we will see that in some software development and some types of advertising writing. I'm very worried about content creators who do visual work and music because I think their intellectual property is being liberated without compensation by AI at present. And I think that's a regulatory issue. So we should be prepared for that. And not to, and I do not mean to dismiss that at all.Why do I think they're too — why people are not sufficiently optimistic? Because I think there's great potential that gets overlooked in the discussion of which jobs will be automated. The most fundamentally important uses of new technologies are not for automation. They're instead things that enable new human capabilities that were not previously feasible, right?So think about, you know, airplane and mechanical powered flight. Airplanes didn't automate the way we used to fly. We simply didn't fly before we had them. Or if you were to go back to ancient Greece and automate everything that the ancient Greeks were doing by hand at that time, you wouldn't have modern America, you'd have ancient Greece without horses. It wouldn't have flight. It wouldn't have electricity, wouldn't have penicillin. Wouldn't have telecommunications, right? Automation — or sorry, new technologies — have been fundamentally important not because they allow us to do the same things faster and cheaper, but because they allow us to do fundamentally new things.And that's why new work is so important in the paper you mentioned earlier. A lot of new work, which is the type of work many of us do, requires expertise that didn't exist prior to the technologies that supported it, right? Those air traffic controllers, if they didn't have a GPS and a radar and a two-way radio, they'd just be a person standing in a field staring at the sky. They wouldn't be able to do their work.Similarly, we wouldn't have pediatric oncologists without all the technology and tools and expertise that goes along with that. The same for all of these computer technologies we use, but even for many of the high-end services that we experience — in tourism, in travel and food. This is this is specialized work. It requires human expertise. That expertise is made valuable and it couldn't exist without the technology and tools that support it, as well as the higher incomes that come from it.CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So, okay. You've half sold me, Professor Autor. (LAUGHS) AUTOR: Oh! Okay.CHAKRABARTI: You're making progress here! (LAUGHS) But so let me refine it, because when you're talking about that new jobs created the nature of expertise and its value will shift, that makes perfect sense because it follows previous patterns as you talked about with each revolution in technology.But when we're talking about rebuilding the middle class, class is a very specific word because we're talking about incomes, really, and people's sense of security in their lives. And you had just said previously, that both you and many, many other economists out there have studied extensively on how even as technology has changed the workforce and required higher levels of education for that elite expertise income, that it has for working class Americans, as we know, for the past 50 years or so, wages have been flatlined. Or, you know, perhaps more accurately, have just gone down relative to the percent of the national wealth that capital gets versus labor. I don't think you're disagreeing with that, right?AUTOR: No, not at all.CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so in the case of AI, what I wonder is, is that — why wouldn't that problem get anything but worse, right? Because we're just, we're relying on the vicissitudes of capitalism, right? To make the social and political policy to help keep the middle class robust and strong? I mean, I don't think that that's going to happen. And my concern is that the AI transformation of the nature of work is going to be so rapid. We've already failed to protect the middle class over the past half century. There's no guarantee that in the next five years even that we'll have policy makers who will do what's needed to be done to help, you know, as you're saying, rebuild the middle class with these technological changes.AUTOR: Great. So first of all, there's no guarantee. Absolutely. And in fact, my article, it describes a good scenario, a way we could use it. It does not say it will happen that way. But let me say why I think it's useful for rebuilding middle skill jobs, a phrase I also prefer to ""the middle class."" And that is because we have displaced so much middle skill expertise from offices from factories and so on, pushed people into low paid services. And the opportunity is to use this tool to enable them to do more valuable work, right? To move into the health care services, to move it into software, to move into skilled repair and skilled construction and so on.Now, that doesn't mean anyone can just do it. It means giving the right training and education. So it doesn't mean anyone could just simply do that work. If it were true, it wouldn't be expert work. And why this tool is useful for that — it's really fundamentally different from traditional computing, right? This is the world's leading technology that, by the way, can't do math and can't keep facts straight. It's really opposite. And so it would actually be somewhat surprising if it had exactly the same effects as the technology we used before. Now, I also, I want to underscore another point that you made, which is it is not the technology itself that makes these decisions, right?CHAKRABARTI: Correct.AUTOR: It is the choices of people, the choices and the incentives of the market and the structure of policy. And we have a variety of choices to make, and we could certainly use it badly.For example, China uses AI very effectively to have the world's most comprehensive surveillance state, the world's best real time censorship system, and that's an amazing technological achievement, and it requires AI to do it. But that doesn't mean that's because that's what AI does. That's choice. You can use AI to make healthcare more affordable and accessible, to make education more immersive, more engaging, more like simulation. We can use it to help skilled repair people do a broader variety of tasks. We can use it to enable more people to do software development. So there's many, many ways to use it.And I agree that I'm concerned about the incentives as well. I don't think corporations have necessarily the right incentives. It's not that they're malevolent, but why should they be concerned about aggregate employment? It's not their job. So policy is necessary. And we could talk at greater length about that.I think we'll know we're being successful if we see more people without four year college degrees — which only a third of Americans have — doing high value work in education, in healthcare, in design, in repair, et cetera. And if AI is a threat to work, as we were discussing earlier, the people to whom it is actually most threatening are professionals.CHAKRABARTI: Yeah.AUTOR: Doctors and lawyers, software developers and engineers, right? It could make some of their work less expensive, more of it done automatically. Now, that's a mixed bag, but it's not altogether bad. First of all, professionals have seen a terrific last five decades, right? A lot of the growth of inequality is the rising wages of decision makers who are scarce, and yet made more valuable by computing.And if we have a period of declining inequality, which we are in right now, that's not altogether bad, especially if it means that those high-paid professionals see more competition from skilled people who aren't quite as elite. If doctors have more competition from nurse practitioners, I'm all in favor of that. If lawyers have more competition from other legal experts who don't have as much training, but still do a great job, I'm in favor of that. If PhDs in computer science face more competition from people who have an associate's degree and the right tools, that's a good thing.Not only is it good for the people who do those less highly paid jobs, it's also good for the rest of us who buy those services. We all pay for education. We all pay for health care. We all pay for software. I'll stop. (LAUGHS)CHAKRABARTI: No, no. So let me just jump in here because the scenario that you're laying out right now, I can begin to see what you're talking about in terms of the increasing competition for work that was previously sort of narrowly defined as high value for a few, relatively few number of people.But okay, we have another little thought experiment here about people who don't feel anywhere near as optimistic, okay? So some of those folks include British voice actor Mike Cooper.MIKE COOPER [Tape]: I received a marketing email from a company that produced voiceovers. So I clicked through to their website, went to listen to their voice samples that they had listed, selected a couple of parameters like male, English, UK, because obviously I have a British accent, to see who they had on their list, and pressed play, and heard a version of myself coming back to me.CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so again, this is Mike Cooper, who is a British voice actor, and last February he talked to Scott Tong on NPR's Here and Now.COOPER: It was obviously me, it's the sound and tone of my voice, but it doesn't quite sound like me in the same way because we have nuances in the way we speak which aren't fully replicated in the AI versions.CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so here's what he's talking about. We have a recording here that Cooper provided to the Washington Post last year, and that recording will then be followed by an AI replication of Cooper's voice produced by a voice generator called Resemble AI.COOPER: My work has been described as exceptional. My performance is spot on in the first take, and my delivery as having an effortless authority.AI REPLICATION OF COOPER'S VOICE: My work has been described as exceptional. My performance is spot on in the first take, and my delivery as having an effortless authority. CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so not a perfect replication, by any means. Cooper's real voice is crisper, warmer, audio quality far better, and it captures really the entire range of human nuance that can be in our voices. But, that was the AI voice clone a year ago, okay? So, in just 12 months, how far has it come?UNIDENTIFIED MALE VOICE: Okay, this is probably going to be too easy, but let's try it anyways. Tell me what you think. CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so Professor Autor, what we just heard now is the voice of one of our producers, On Point producer Jonathan Chang. Or, actually wait, is it his voice? I haven't heard these yet, Professor Autor, so we're gonna listen to a second clip, and then you and I are gonna try and guess which one is Jon's real voice. So here's the other clip.UNIDENTIFIED MALE VOICE: Okay, this is probably going to be too easy, but let's try it anyways. Tell me what you think. CHAKRABARTI: Okay, Jon's in the studio. It's the second one. Is that you, Jon?! Oh, he shakes his head yes! I got it! So Professor Autor, it's not like completely accurate yet, but it was pretty close. I mean, could you tell the difference?AUTOR: Not in the second, not in the second instance.CHAKRABARTI: Yeah, right. The only reason why I could, I think, is because I know Jon really well and I listen to him talk every day. So just one more thought here from, um, from Mike Cooper. Because that's just the advances that AI in terms of replicating the human voice has made in a year. Like, what's it going to be like in six months or another year? And here's what Mike Cooper says.COOPER: The idea now that you could take a minute of somebody from an audio book that they'd recorded or a minute of somebody giving a speech at a conference, create an AI model and then get Emma Watson to read Mein Kampf, in some ways it's like the the horse is out of the stable already. But as we've seen with things like ChatGPT and Dall-E, it's beginning to impact all kinds of creative people at this point, so we need to be careful.CHAKRABARTI: Okay, Professor Autor, I'm afraid we only have a minute left in this conversation today. There's so much more to talk about. But, you know, again, I just wanted to surface that as the concerns that people continue to have. So what's the last thought you'd leave folks with?AUTOR: Thanks. It's been a great conversation. So first I want to say Mike has a beautiful voice, Mike Cooper, it's fantastic to listen to. Second, as I think I said earlier, I think this is intellectual theft. I don't think — this is a misuse of the technology.  And it's a failure of our legal system that we don't have a framework for dealing with this. Think of music streaming in the days of Napster. Right? People were just recording their CDs and sharing them with everybody and no one was getting royalties for that. And we solved that problem with Spotify and with Apple Music. We need to solve that problem for AI.What is happening right now is not appropriate and it will wipe people out. And in my opinion, it's simply stealing. It can be fixed. There's — it's not a technologically hard problem. This is a question of assigning rights and setting up a system for compensation and for setting up a system of intellectual property ownership, just like we do with publishing novels or patents or movies. So it's very problematic, but that's fixable. It's not intrinsic.CHAKRABARTI: Right. Okay. So that's a great thought to leave us with, because again, it's fixable through human political decision making. (LAUGHS) And therein lies my persistent skepticism, not with what you're saying, Professor Autor, but with the ability for political decision making to be good.AUTOR: But think of what the actors and television writers just did to negotiate this problem for their industry.CHAKRABARTI: True, true. So maybe good positive change is possible. With that, I'm going to have to wrap up.This program aired on May 20, 2024.Thank you for choosing journalism from WBUR and On Point.

ChenKaren Weise reported from Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., and Brian X. Chen from San Francisco.May 20, 2024The race to put artificial intelligence everywhere is taking a detour through the good old laptop computer.Microsoft on Monday introduced a new kind of computer designed for artificial intelligence. The machines, Microsoft says, will run A.I. systems on chips and other gear inside the computers so they are faster, more personal and more private.The new computers, called Copilot+ PC, will allow people to use A.I. to make it easier to find documents and files they have worked on, emails they have read, or websites they have browsed. Their A.I. systems will also automate tasks like photo editing and language translation.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe new design will be included in Microsoft’s Surface laptops and high-end products that run on the Windows operating system offered by Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, some of the largest PC makers in the world.ImageMicrosoft’s new Surface notebooks, powered by artificial intelligence. Credit...Grant Hindsley for The New York TimesThe A.I. PC, industry analysts believe, could reverse a longtime decline in the importance of the personal computer. For the last two decades, the demand for the fastest laptops has diminished because so much software was moved into cloud computing centers. A strong internet connection and web browser was all most people needed.But A.I. stretches that long-distance relationship to its limits. ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools are run in data centers stuffed with expensive and sophisticated chips that can process the largest, most advanced systems. Even the most cutting-edge chatbots take time to receive a query, process it and send back a response. It is also extremely expensive to manage.Microsoft wants to run A.I. systems directly on a personal computer to eliminate that lag time and cut the price. Microsoft has been shrinking the size of A.I. systems, called models, to make them easier to run outside of data centers. It said more than 40 will run directly on the laptops. The smaller models are generally not as powerful or accurate as the most cutting-edge A.I. systems, but they are improving enough to be useful to the average consumer.“We are entering a new era where computers not only understand us, but can anticipate what we want and our intents,” said Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, at an event at its headquarters in Redmond, Wash.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAnalysts expect Apple to follow suit next month at its conference for software developers, where the company will announce an overhaul for Siri, its virtual assistant, and an overall strategy for integrating more A.I. capabilities into its laptops and iPhones.Whether the A.I. PC takes off depends on the companies’ ability to create compelling reasons for buyers to upgrade. The initial sales of these new computers, which cost more than $1,000, will be small, said Linn Huang, an analyst at IDC, which closely tracks the market. But by the end of the decade — assuming A.I. tools turn out to be useful — they will be “ubiquitous,” he predicted. “Everything will be an A.I. PC.”The computer industry is looking for a jolt. Consumers have been upgrading their own computers less frequently, as the music and photos they once stored on their machines now often live online, on Spotify, Netflix or iCloud. Computer purchases by companies, schools and other institutions have finally stabilized after booming — and then crashing — during the pandemic.Some high-end smartphones have already been integrating A.I. chips, but the sales have fallen short because the features “are still not sophisticated enough to catalyze a faster upgrade cycle,” Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group, wrote in a research note. It will be at least another year, he said, before enough meaningful breakthroughs will lead consumers to take note.At the event, Microsoft showed new laptops with what it likened to having a photographic memory. Users can ask Copilot, Microsoft’s chatbot, to use a feature called Recall to look up a file by typing a question using natural language, such as, “Can you find me a video call I had with Joe recently where he was holding an ‘I Love New York’ coffee mug?” The computer will then immediately be able to retrieve the file containing those details because the A.I. systems are constantly scanning what the user does on the laptop.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImageMicrosoft’s Surface notebook and tablets offer access to artificial intelligence tools.Credit...Grant Hindsley for The New York Times“It remembers things that I forget,” said Matt Barlow, Microsoft’s head of marketing for Surface computers, in an interview.Microsoft said the information used for this Recall function was stored directly on the laptop for privacy, and would not be sent back to the company’s servers or be used in training future A.I. systems. Pavan Davuluri, a Microsoft executive overseeing Windows, said that with the Recall system users would also be able to opt out of sharing certain types of information, such as visits to a specific website, but that some sensitive data, such as financial information and private browsing sessions, would not be monitored by default.Microsoft also demonstrated live transcripts that translate in real time, which it said would be available on any video that streams across a laptop’s screen.Microsoft last month released A.I. models small enough to run on a phone that it said performed almost as well as GPT-3.5, the much larger system that initially underpinned OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot when it debuted in late 2022.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)Chipmakers have also made advances, like adjusting a laptop’s battery life to allow for the enormous number of calculations that A.I. demands. The new computers have dedicated chips built by Qualcomm, the largest chip provider for smartphones.Though the type of chip inside the new A.I. computers, known as a neural processing unit, specializes in handling complex A.I. tasks, such as generating images and summarizing documents, the benefits may still be unnoticeable to consumers, said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor and researcher of artificial intelligence at Arizona State University.Most of the data processing for A.I. still has to be done on a company’s servers instead of directly on the devices, so it’s still important that people have a fast internet connection, he added.But the neural processing chips also speed up other tasks, such as video editing or the ability to use a virtual background inside a video call, said Brad Linder, the editor of Liliputing, a blog that has covered computers for nearly two decades. So, even if people don’t buy into the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, they may end up getting an A.I. computer for other reasons.Karen Weise writes about technology and is based in Seattle.

Generative AI has the potential to change the way professionals work in every industry. In healthcare, it is set to revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat diseases, research new medicines and therapies, and manage routine administrative tasks.


Of course, AI will never replace the experience, skills and human touch of doctors and nurses. Instead, it will let them augment their abilities and expertise with super-fast insights and analysis. It can also relieve them of many of the time-consuming and routine tasks that prevent them from spending time with patients and directly improving outcomes.

Healthcare jobs are changing, and whether you are involved in delivering frontline care, developing new treatments or managing resources and infrastructure, understanding the opportunities and challenges is essential.

PROMOTED
So, in this article, I will outline some of the exciting possibilities that generative AI brings to the table for healthcare professionals, as well as some of the challenges they will face as their roles evolve.

 Generative AI In Diagnosis And Treatment
Generative AI will assist doctors and other frontline medical staff in diagnosing patients, thanks to its ability to analyze complex and disparate datasets including medical images and patient notes. Image recognition algorithms can scan x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI and CT scans, with numerous studies now emerging that show they can be as accurate as human experts at doing this. Generative AI then translates the output into human language that can even be personalized for individual specialists involved in treating the patient.

Chatbots powered by generative AI will act as virtual medical assistants, providing triage and gathering patient data, as well as identifying the best human medical professionals to refer patients to. They will also provide specialist and personalized advice; for example, the OneRemission chatbot is programmed to help cancer patients through their recovery by offering diet and lifestyle advice, while Youper is designed to offer advice on mental health.

And it will help healthcare professionals to monitor the wellbeing of patients by providing a narrative around data streams generated by wearable devices and remote monitoring tools, either in hospital or home settings. This will provide early warning signs if a patient’s condition is deteriorating, or alert carers in the case of situations such as an elderly person suffering a fall.
Research And Development
Generative AI is already accelerating the process of discovering new drugs. For example, UK biotech firm Etcembly recently created the first immunotherapy drug for patients that was designed with the help of generative AI.
By generating hundreds of millions of genetic codes for T-cell receptors, scientists were able to complete research that would usually have taken many years in just a few weeks.
As well as generating data in the form of words and pictures, as with generative tools like ChatGPT and Dall-E, algorithms can create synthetic candidates for drug trials. It can create candidates for molecular structures that may have desired effects such as binding to specific receptors, or inhibiting enzyme production, and simulate tests to determine their likely real-world effects.
It can also suggest where drugs previously developed for other conditions might be repurposed to treat specific illnesses, as has been shown by this study into potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.
Generative AI algorithms are also being used to simulate human physiological responses to drugs, creating ethical alternatives to human or animal testing.
Overall, generative AI is already showing remarkable potential for helping researchers and chemists formulate and test new drugs, and we can expect to see it playing an increasingly important role in this field in the near future.
Ethical Implications
Although generative AI offers huge potential for improving patient outcomes and driving new frontiers of medical research, it also creates challenges around ethics and regulation.
Medical professionals, perhaps more so than any other professionals, will be required to understand issues around data, privacy and bias and how they might impact their roles.
Many of the use cases we’ve discussed here, particularly those involving personalization, will require access to highly sensitive and personal information. Healthcare professionals will need a comprehensive understanding of how this data can be securely and responsibly collected, processed and stored. They will also need to develop an awareness of when work can be delegated to AI and when a human touch is irreplaceable.
We can also expect that the use of AI, and particularly generative AI, in the healthcare sector will be subject to more stringent regulations than it might be elsewhere. Professionals will need to understand their own legal responsibilities and obligations. It will also be important to develop a thorough grounding in the principle of AI accountability and liability – after all, humans must always take ultimate responsibility for the provision of patient care. New, specialized roles are likely to emerge here, concerned with ensuring generative AI is only implemented in an ethical and accountable way.
AI And The Future Of Healthcare Jobs
Overall, as generative AI tools become more deeply embedded across the day-to-day responsibilities of caregivers, their responsibilities will evolve. Less time will be taken up with routine and administrative work, meaning more time can be spent consulting with patients as well as updating their own skills and knowledge.
We’re only in the early stages of this revolution but its impact is already starting to be felt, and by preparing for it now, doctors, nurses, paramedics, therapists, researchers and managers can ensure they play a pivotal role in ensuring it benefits as many patients as possible.

Matt Carbonara, head of enterprise tech investing, Vibhor Rastogi, head of AI investing, and Cagla Kaymaz, principal of Citi Ventures, highlight the importance of understanding customer needs, navigating competition, ensuring safety and compliance, and finding the right balance between automation and human involvement for GenAI entrepreneurs.
From both the top down and the bottom up, large enterprises are eager to implement generative AI (GenAI) solutions that can help them increase productivity and improve business outcomes. Many are still early in their adoption process and are working through such considerations as whether to build or buy the solutions they need and which vendors to partner with.

This is creating a rare greenfield opportunity for entrepreneurs looking to build enterprise-grade GenAI tools. But while the time to move on GenAI is now, selling a GenAI solution to a large enterprise is an especially complex undertaking given the field’s additional tech requirements, data privacy concerns, and fast-evolving regulatory landscape.
Having spent the last decade-plus investing in AI startups and the last couple of years following the GenAI revolution closelyOpens a new window , we know well what it takes to sell a GenAI product to a large and heavily regulated enterprise. Here are four best practices for doing just that.
1. Decide if GenAI Is the Best AI for the Job
AI tools built on large language models (LLMs) offer tremendous power and potential, but they’re not the right fit for every use case. Traditional machine learning (ML) models or even decision trees can still perform some tasks better than LLMs. For example, fraud detection, marketing and risk models that primarily work on structured data are still best served by ML, which is great at dealing with large statistical models, making predictions and recommending the next best action with high confidence.

So before you embark on building a GenAI product, make sure you’re doing so not to capture the hype cycle but because LLMs actually help you build a best-in-class solution to a key customer problem. Using LLMs over the models’ enterprises are more familiar with means both taking on significant compute or API costs and undergoing more intensive security scrutiny and onboarding processes — so if you don’t need them, it will be hard to justify the extra effort. 
Furthermore, you may lose credibility with stakeholders for trying to use a sports car when a sedan will do. No matter how cool and cutting-edge the technology is, in order for a large enterprise to spend resources on it, there must be a clear, high-priority business need.

2. Find a Way To Take on or Dodge the Incumbents
Unlike prior technological shifts that were largely led by startups, Big Tech incumbents like Microsoft and Amazon have been fast to adopt GenAI and are even driving key advancements in the space. To beat them at their own game, you’ll need to understand which use cases they’re going after and how they’re embedding GenAI into their product suites. That will help you find a unique value proposition that incumbents aren’t in a good position to offer in the near term and/or to execute well for reasons such as deficits in their employee talent profile or limitations in their core competency.
3. Make Safety and Security Your Top Priority
Large enterprises place immense value on data security and regulatory compliance, particularly when it comes to AI—so to get in the door with them, you’ll have to have strong guardrails for your product. In general, you should embrace the principles of responsible AI, implementing the right policies and standards or partnering with vendors that do so.
For example, many enterprises are worried about data leakage,  and will not let you use their data for model training; make sure they are able to opt out of that and still use your product effectively. It is also important to provide them with role-based access controls so only the people authorized to perform certain tasks or see certain documents are able to do so (this is particularly pertinent to retrieval-augmented generation systems). 
Enterprises tend to have a low-risk tolerance for hallucinations and bias as well, and depending on the use case might have zero tolerance. For example, while it might be okay for a GenAI product drafting marketing copy to hallucinate on occasion, it’s unacceptable when giving financial advice to customers.
Lastly, make sure you’re staying on top of the fast-evolving landscape of global AI regulation and articulate clearly the policies and standards you have in place to remain compliant over the long term.
4. Figure Out How Much You Want Humans To Be in the Loop
As excited as we are about GenAI’s potential to automate a wide range of human tasks, it still has a long way to go—the non-deterministic nature of LLMs makes it difficult to produce repeatable outputs, even when given the same input. Given many large enterprises’ low-risk appetite, we recommend creating a GenAI product that falls into one of the three categories below depending on the use case and the end-users error tolerance:

Copilot: So-called AI copilots are tools meant to foster collaboration between a human user and an AI system; the AI makes suggestions so the user can better perform their task (e.g., GitHub Copilot suggests code to developers as they type). Tolerance for error is high for AI copilots, as the human is still in full control.
Human-in-the-loop (HIL): In HIL tools, the AI does most of the work while the human oversees and makes final decisions—for example, an AI-based wealth management tool could draft a portfolio construction recommendation that the human wealth advisor would review and revise as needed before sending it to a client. Though there is some tolerance for error in HIL tools, the AI should be fairly reliable.
Autopilot: Here, the AI is fully autonomous and makes all the decisions, such as a customer service bot that converses with a user and can purchase products for them.

At this stage of the GenAI adoption curve, we expect AI copilots and HIL tools to be the most common types available and your best bet in ensuring enterprises will be comfortable using your technology. However, we suspect this will change in the next few years as better testing and monitoring systems make autopilots more viable.

As a result, the structure described below may be amended before the effective date and employers may want to monitor additional developments.",N/A,N/A,N/A,"

Quick Hits

With Governor Jared Polis’s signing into law SB 24-205, Colorado becomes the first U.S. state to enact comprehensive legislation regulating the use and development of AI systems.
The law addresses, among other things, the risk of algorithmic discrimination “arising from the intended and contracted uses of … high-risk artificial intelligence system[s].”
The Colorado AI Act will take effect on February 1, 2026.

Colorado’s AI Act, SB 24-205, is designed to regulate the use of “high-risk” AI systems, imposing compliance obligations on both “developers” (i.e., creators) and “deployers” (i.e., users) of AI systems. Structurally, the law is similar to the European Union’s recently adopted Artificial Intelligence Act. The Colorado AI Act will become part of Colorado’s Consumer Protection Act. While the Colorado AI Act does not appear to authorize private rights of action (providing the Colorado attorney general with exclusive enforcement authority), there is some ambiguity regarding enforcement, as the legislation also provides that a violation of the act will be a deceptive trade practice under Colorado’s Consumer Protection Act—which law does allow for private rights of action.
What Employers Need to Know
Colorado’s AI Act contains different requirements and rules depending on whether an entity is a developer or a deployer. Because the employer community will largely fall into the “deployer” definition, this article highlights aspects of the law that are most pertinent to deployers/employers using AI as part of their people practices.
Colorado Employers Using Certain AI Systems Will Be Subject to the Law
The Colorado AI Act is designed to cover the employment context. Specifically, it is intended to address the use by any persons or entities in Colorado of AI systems in employment decisions and to protect any “consumers,” defined as Colorado residents. The framework provides a narrow exemption for employers with fewer than fifty employees that do not use their own data to train or further improve their AI systems.
Colorado Has Developed Its Own “Algorithmic Discrimination” Definition
The Colorado AI Act defines “algorithmic discrimination” to mean any condition in which the use of an AI system “results in an unlawful differential treatment or impact that disfavors an individual or group of individuals on the basis of their actual or perceived age, color, disability, ethnicity, genetic information, limited proficiency in the English language, national origin, race, religion, reproductive health, sex, veteran status, or other classification protected under the laws of [Colorado] or federal law.”
High-Risk AI Systems Are in the Crosshairs
As AI laws continue to be proposed, developed, and implemented throughout the world, employers are continually facing evolving and different definitions of what qualifies as a covered AI system. Colorado’s AI Act is focused on “high-risk” AI systems, defined as any AI system that “makes, or is a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision.” (Emphasis added.) Importantly, a “consequential decision”—i.e., “a decision that has a material legal or similarly significant effect” on the provision or denial to Colorado residents of a broad array of essential services, opportunities, and entitlements—includes a decision related to “employment or an employment opportunity.” A “substantial factor” means one that (1) “assists in making a consequential decision”; (2) “is capable of altering the outcome of a consequential decision”; and (3) “is generated by an artificial intelligence system.” “‘Substantial factor’ includes any use of an artificial intelligence system to generate any content, decision, prediction, or recommendation concerning a consumer that is used as a basis to make a consequential decision concerning the consumer.” There are also certain enumerated exclusions from the definition of high-risk AI systems. The current definitions leave much room for ambiguity that will hopefully be the source of refinement in future guidance.
Various New Obligations Will Exist for Deployers/Employers
Under the Colorado AI Act, deployers/employers are required to use “reasonable care” to protect consumers from any “known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination.” The law creates a rebuttable presumption of reasonable care if certain compliance steps are taken, including:

Risk-management policies and programs. Deployers/employers must implement a risk management policy and program meeting certain defined criteria. This risk management policy and program must be an “iterative process” that is regularly and systematically reviewed and updated. Further, the risk management policy and program must be reasonable in consideration of various listed factors, including: risk management frameworks published by the Colorado attorney general or guidance and standards issued by various identified national or international risk management frameworks for AI (such as the “Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework” published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)); the size and complexity of the deployer/employer; and the nature and scope of the high-risk AI system used by the deployer/employer.


Impact assessments. Covered employers must also complete annual impact assessments for high-risk AI systems (or even more frequently if there is an intentional and substantial modification of the system). These impact assessments are similar to the annual bias audits required by New York City’s AI law. Among other things, an impact assessment must include:


a statement of the purpose, use cases, and benefits of the AI system;
an analysis of whether there are “known or reasonably foreseeable” risks of algorithmic discrimination, and, if so, the steps taken to mitigate the risks;
a description of the categories of data processed as inputs and the outputs of the AI system;if the system has been customized by the deployer/employer, “an overview of the categories of data … used to customize” the system;“metrics used to evaluate the performance and known limitations” of the AI system;a “description of any transparency measures taken concerning” the AI system, “including any measures taken” to notify Colorado consumers of the use of the system; and
“a description of the post-deployment monitoring and user safeguards provided” relating to the AI system.


Notices to consumers. Colorado employers are also required to provide various notices. Among other provisions in Colorado’s AI Act is one requiring consumers to be notified that a deployer/employer has deployed a covered AI system “to make, or be a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision before the decision is made.” (Emphasis added.) Under the law, deployers/employers must also provide consumers with a statement disclosing the purpose of the covered AI system, the nature of the consequential decision, and a description of the covered AI system. Additionally, for a consumer adversely affected by an AI system, further notifications must be provided, such as a statement disclosing the principal reason(s) for the consequential decision; “an opportunity to correct any incorrect personal data” used by the covered AI system; and “an opportunity to appeal an adverse consequential decision … which appeal must, if technically feasible, allow for human review.” An employer also must post in a “clear and readily available” manner a notice on its website containing various information regarding covered AI systems, such as the types that are currently used, how the employer manages risks of algorithmic discrimination, and “in detail, the nature, source, and extent” of data collected and used by the employer.


Notice to attorney general. Additionally, employers must disclose to Colorado’s attorney general the discovery of algorithmic discrimination—within ninety days after the date of the discovery—that the high-risk AI system has caused.

Colorado Has Provided Affirmative Defenses
Interestingly, the law provides for potential affirmative defenses in any enforcement action by the Colorado attorney general if a deployer/employer discovers and cures a violation as a result of (i) feedback, (ii) “adversarial testing or red teaming” (as those terms are defined by NIST), or (iii) an internal review process and the deployer/employer is otherwise in compliance with NIST’s Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework or another internationally recognized framework for artificial intelligence management.
What’s Next?
In addition to closely monitoring for guidance on or amendments to the Colorado AI Act, employers may want to consider the following:

Inventorying AI uses as part of human resources practices and weighing whether any or all of the uses fall within the current definition of covered high-risk AI systems for the purposes of the act.
Evaluating whether the organization has or should develop AI policies or frameworks to manage AI systems.
Commissioning a cross-disciplinary team to monitor AI systems used by the organization, as well as relevant legal developments.
Assessing whether the organization provides notices about AI systems used. The requirement of notices is a growing trend in AI laws and is also a “promising practice” recommended by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

Currently, many states are actively considering similar AI legislation and regulations. Ogletree Deakins’ Technology Practice Group will continue to monitor developments and will provide updates on the Cybersecurity and Privacy, State Developments, and Technology blogs as additional information becomes available.

Barnes, Jeffrey W. Brecher, Joseph J. Lynett & Katharine C. WeberThe U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) has published a Field Assistance Bulletin (FAB) on the application of federal labor standards to employers’ use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other automated systems in the workplace. Bulletins provide guidance to field staff on enforcing the federal statutes administered by the WHD.FAB No. 2024-1 emphasizes that statutory protections apply as usual, irrespective of the new tools and systems employers are using. However, the use of AI may pose some compliance challenges. “Regardless of the exact AI or other technologies used, the principles described here provide guidance for evaluating how to comply with the law,” the FAB states.In addition to addressing the potential implications of AI in properly tracking hours worked and calculating wages owed under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the FAB addresses the potential impact of AI on compliance with the FLSA’s protections for nursing employees. The FAB also provides detailed guidance on the challenges that may arise with the use of AI and compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).Tracking Hours Worked, Calculating Wages OwedThe takeaway for employers from the FAB is to “exercise responsible human oversight” when using AI and other automated systems to track employees’ working time or determine wage rates to ensure the tools count all compensable time under the FLSA and properly calculate wages owed.Tracking work time. Employers increasingly use automated monitoring tools to analyze whether employees are “active” or “idle.” Monitoring tools measure computer keystrokes, mouse clicks, and website browsing to analyze employee productivity. Facial recognition technologies track employee eye movements by webcam. However, the productivity metrics obtained by these tools do not determine whether an employee is performing “hours worked” for FLSA purposes. If the tools erroneously conclude an employee is not “working” and incorrectly categorize working time as noncompensable, the employer may violate the FLSA by undercounting compensable time and failing to pay wages for all hours worked.Auto-deduct break time. Some automated timekeeping systems or software that track employee breaks incorporate AI to predict and auto-populate break time entries based on past time entries, regular shift and break schedules, and other factors. Employers using “auto-deduct” tools still need to ensure that employees are completely relieved of duty during recorded breaks, that time records accurately reflect employee breaks actually taken, and that employees are properly compensated for breaks not taken.Waiting time. Waiting time is compensable if employees are expected to be fully available to work, must remain near the workstation, and do not have enough time between tasks for their own non-work pursuits. When employees are on duty but are waiting for their next assigned task, AI technologies that assign task routes and adjust schedules based on real time data must accurately account for those periods of compensable time during which employees are “engaged to wait.” For example, some hotels use automated systems to assign tasks to housekeeping staff. When a hotel guest checks out of their room, the system automatically delegates a cleaning assignment to a particular housekeeping employee based on their availability and reassigns tasks throughout the day based on current data. These tools allow managers to track employee activities in real time. The employees are still working if they are “engaged to wait” between the assignments, even as tasks are reassigned over the course of a shift. However, the use of AI tools to automate scheduling and assign work tasks may result in a FLSA violation if the tools do not accurately identify whether employees’ waiting time is compensable.Multiple locations. The location of work is not determinative of whether the employee has performed hours worked under the FLSA, and use of location monitoring to track employees and determine whether they are “working” may create compliance problems if the system fails to properly account for compensable time worked in different locales. Geolocation software that tracks an employee’s location relative to a job site, automatically clocking in and clocking out the employee when entering and leaving a job site, may fail to account the employee’s compensable time before arriving at the designated job site. The start of an employee’s workday may include picking up tools at the employer’s plant and the travel time to the job site. Likewise, the workday may continue after leaving a job site if the employee has to unload supplies or perform administrative or other tasks off-site. Such a system also must account for the compensable travel time between jobs at different job sites.Calculating wages owed. Some AI technologies can automatically recalculate and adjust an employee’s pay rate (including piece rates or rates paid on a per task basis) throughout the workday. The variable pay rates may mean significantly different regular rates from week to week. Employers that use these systems must make sure they accurately calculate the applicable minimum wage, regular rate of pay, and overtime premium. In addition to factoring multiple wage rates in a single workweek, AI systems must account for the many types of payments, including nondiscretionary bonuses, commissions, or other compensation, that go into an employee’s regular rate of pay.AI and FMLA ComplianceThe FAB also emphasizes “responsible human oversight” when using AI and other automated systems to administer FMLA leave.Processing leave requests. AI or other technologies are sometimes used to process leave requests, track time off, and integrate absence calendars. The WHD emphasizes, “[W]ithout responsible human oversight, relying on automated systems to process leave requests, including determining eligibility, calculating available leave entitlements, or evaluating whether leave is for a qualifying reason, can create potential compliance challenges.” For example, a timekeeping program that incorrectly determines the number of hours an employee has worked may lead to a failure to correctly determine the employee’s FMLA eligibility.Certifications. Use of AI to administer FMLA leave can create potential risk of violating the FMLA certification requirements if the AI system fails to comply with the FMLA’s limitations on the information that can be requested or notification or deadline requirements. For example, the WHD points out that an automated system that results in an employee being asked to disclose more medical information than the FMLA allows could violate the FMLA.Interference and retaliation. AI and other automated systems that track leave may not be used “to target FMLA leave users for retaliation or discourage” use of leave. If the use of AI or an automated system leads to adverse action against employees because of their use of FMLA leave, that may result in unlawful retaliation or interference. For example, employers are prohibited from using systems to count FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions such as hiring, promotions, or disciplinary actions or assigning negative attendance points.AI and Nursing Employee ProtectionEmployers must provide employees reasonable break time and space to express breast milk under the FLSA, as amended by the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers Act. The WHD cautions against the use of AI to limit the length, frequency, or timing of breaks for nursing employees. The WHD also advises that the use of productivity scoring and monitoring systems that penalize a worker for failing to meet productivity standards due to the worker having taken pump breaks would violate the FLSA. Such productivity monitoring would need to be adjusted so employees are not being required to meet production requirements during the time they are taking pump breaks.Other ProvisionsThe FAB notes that the use of AI to gauge an individual’s truthfulness may be subject to the restrictions on lie detector tests under the Employee Polygraph Protection Act. Finally, it cautions against the use of AI to take adverse actions against employees for engaging in activities protected under any of the federal statutes enforced by the WHD.The FAB, written by Wage and Hour Administrator Jessica Looman, was issued April 29, 2024. The guidance was prepared in response to President Joe Biden’s Executive Order 14110, which calls for a coordinated U.S. government approach to ensuring the responsible and safe development and use of AI.Contact your Jackson Lewis attorney if you have questions about compliance with federal and state employment laws when using AI tools in the workplace.©2024 Jackson Lewis P.C.

Felsberg, Joseph J. Lazzarotti & Michelle L. DuncanEnacting what is perhaps the first comprehensive regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) at the state level in the United States, Colorado’s governor signed the Artificial Intelligence Act, Senate Bill (SB) 24-205, on May 17, 2024.Colorado is not alone in advancing AI regulation. The new law joins the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s technical assistance documents, the Department of Labor’s recent pronouncement, the New York City automated employment decision tools law, Tennessee’s regulation of deepfakes, Illinois’ Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, Maryland’s facial recognition law, and the European Union’s AI Act, to name a few.SB 24-205 targets “developers” and “deployers,” categories that will very likely reach organizations in their capacities as employers. It requires both to use reasonable care to avoid algorithmic discrimination in high-risk artificial intelligence systems. In each case, satisfying specified provisions will establish a rebuttable presumption that reasonable care was used, creating a compliance roadmap for deployers and developers to consider.The statute takes effect on February 1, 2026.Definition of High-Risk AI SystemsUnder the statute, high-risk AI systems are defined as those that when used make or are a substantial factor in making “consequential” decisions. Consequential decisions could affect:Employment or employment opportunityEducation enrollment or opportunityFinancial or lending services Essential government services Healthcare services Housing InsuranceLegal servicesHigh-risk systems do not include AI that either (i) performs narrow procedural tasks or (ii) detects decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns and is not intended to replace or influence human assessment or review.The statute also excludes certain technologies, such as cybersecurity technologies and spam filtering, from high-risk AI systems when they are not making or a substantial factor in making consequential decisions.Developer ObligationsA developer as defined in the statute is a person doing business in Colorado who develops or intentionally and substantially modifies an AI system.Under the statute, developers of high-risk AI systems are required to use reasonable care to avoid algorithmic discrimination. The statute includes a rebuttable presumption that a developer used reasonable care if the developer complied with specific requirements, including:Making available to deployers of the AI system a statement disclosing specified information about the system  Providing deployers the information and documentation necessary to complete an impact assessment  Making a publicly available statement summarizing the types of high-risk systems that the developer has developed or intentionally and substantially modified and currently makes available to a deployer and how the developer manages any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination that may arise from the development  Disclosing to the state attorney general and known deployers any known or reasonably foreseeable risk of algorithmic discrimination within 90 days after discoveryDeployer ObligationsA deployer is a person doing business in Colorado who uses high-risk AI systems. Deployers such as employers using AI for certain purposes also have an obligation to use reasonable care to avoid algorithmic discrimination.As with developers, there is a rebuttable presumption that deployers used reasonable care if they comply with the following:Implement a risk management policy and program for high-risk AI systems  Complete an impact assessment of high-risk AI systems Notify consumers of specified items if the high-risk systems make decisions about a consumer  Make a publicly available statement summarizing the types of high-risk systems that the deployer currently deploys Disclose to the attorney general the discovery of algorithmic discrimination within 90 days of discoveryCertain deployers may be exempt from requirements such as notice to consumers if at the time of deployment and at all times while using high-risk AI systems:They employ fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees; Do not use their own data to train the AI system; The AI system is used for the intended uses disclosed by the developer; and Makes certain information related to impact assessment available to consumers.EnforcementSB 24-205 makes clear there is no private right of action under the law, leaving exclusive enforcement to the state attorney general’s office. The attorney general’s office also has discretion under the statute to implement further rulemaking.TakeawaysThere is no time like the present to consider risk management plans and disclosures for the use of AI, particularly in areas like employment and especially as the federal government sharpens its focus on the use of AI and other states consider similar requirements.If you have questions about compliance with the Colorado statute or similar AI regulation, contact a member of our Artificial Intelligence Group or the Jackson Lewis attorney with whom you regularly work.©2024 Jackson Lewis P.C.

Sectors more exposed to AI are experiencing almost fivefold greater labour productivity growth, new report states

 A new report has starkly illustrated the benefits that artificial intelligence (AI) can play in the workplace, despite concerns over widespread job losses.
Accountancy firm PwC announced on Tuesday a new report, the 2024 Global AI Jobs Barometer, which claimed that sectors more exposed to AI (i.e. AI can be readily used for some tasks) are experiencing almost fivefold (4.8x) greater labour productivity growth.
This will be welcome news for employers, but may be not assuage concerns from employees, concerned at their job security.
In March the left-of-centre thinktank, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), had warned that almost 8 million UK jobs could be lost to artificial intelligence in a “jobs apocalypse”.

AI jobs, skills
PwC in its 2024 Global AI Jobs Barometer report analysed over half a billion job ads from 15 countries, suggested that AI could allow many nations to break out of persistent low productivity growth, generating economic development, higher wages, and enhanced living standards.
The report found that for every job posting requiring AI specialist skills (i.e., machine learning) in 2012, there are now seven job postings.
PwC research also found that growth in jobs demanding AI skills has outpaced all jobs since 2016, with postings for jobs requiring AI skills growing 3.5x faster than for all jobs.
The findings also highlighted economic opportunity for labour forces: jobs that require AI skills carry up to a 25 percent average wage premium in some markets.
The report also found that skills sought by employers are changing much faster in occupations more exposed to AI, with old skills disappearing – and new skills appearing – in job ads at a 25 percent higher rate than in occupations less exposed to AI.

The report said that in order to stay relevant in these occupations, workers will need to demonstrate or acquire new skills.
Labour market impact
“AI is transforming the labour market globally and presents good news for a global economy hindered by deep economic challenges and concerns around long-term business viability,” noted Carol Stubbings, global markets and tax leader at PwC UK.
“For many economies experiencing labour shortages and low productivity growth, the findings highlight optimism around AI with the technology representing an opportunity for economic development, job-creation, and the creation of new industries entirely,” said Stubbings.
“However, the findings show that workers will need to build new skills and organisations will need to invest in their AI strategies and people if they are to turbocharge their development and ensure they are fit for the AI age.”
Job worries
The PwC report also found that AI penetration is accelerating, particularly in knowledge work sectors.
Despite the productivity increase, there remains deep concern at the prospect of widespread job losses from AI.
Last week Reuters noted that the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva had said AI was hitting the global labour market “like a tsunami” and was likely to have an impact on 60% of jobs in advanced economies in the next two years.
It comes after the IMF in January 2024, had warned that nearly 40 percent of jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, which could result in replacing jobs and worsening inequalities.

The uptick in productivity in sectors more exposed to AI – such as financial services, information technology, and professional services – was marginally higher in the UK than the global average.Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 there has been much debate about the employment implications of the new era of smart machines but PwC said AI had been having an impact on the jobs market for more than a decade. From a low base, postings for specialist AI jobs were seven times higher than in 2012, compared with a doubling for all other jobs.PwC’s 2024 global AI jobs barometer found that companies were currently using AI as a solution to a lack of available workers.“This could be good news for many nations facing shrinking working age populations and vast unmet needs for labour in many sectors,” it said. “AI can help to ensure that the labour supply is available for the economy to reach its full potential.”The report said the fact that employment in AI-exposed occupations was still growing suggested that the arrival of generative AI did not herald an era of job losses. One study, from the left-of-centre Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, has predicted that up to 8m posts could go in the UK in a jobs “apocalypse” within the next few years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In terms of the economic impact, we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg – currently, our findings suggest that the adoption of AI is concentrated in a few sectors of the economy, but once the technology improves and diffuses across other sectors of the economy, the future potential could be transformative.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Global economyProductivityPwCTechnology sectorEconomicsChatGPTnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMichigan man kills himself after running over 80-year-old Trump supporterTrump files complaint against Harris for taking over Biden’s campaign fundsUkraine war briefing: ‘Occupiers’ ship severely damaged’ in Kavkas across from CrimeaNashville struggles to respond as neo-Nazi groups turn focus on to cityTrump team makes complaint about Harris campaign funds – as it happened",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New research from Pearson shows how Generative AI could help UK workers to save 19 million hours a week by 2026

New research from Pearson (FTSE: PSON.L), the world’s leading learning company, shows the massive potential of Generative AI to boost workplace productivity by helping UK workers to save 19 million hours a week on the routine and repetitive tasks that often fill their day and lead to burnout.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240521519690/en/ New research from Pearson shows how Generative AI could help UK workers to save 19 million hours a week by 2026 (Photo: Business Wire)
The latest instalment of Pearson’s Skills Outlook series, ‘Reclaim the Clock: How Generative AI Can Power People at Work’ - looks ahead to 2026 and identifies the top 10 job tasks with the most time saved by using the technology, in five countries (Australia, Brazil, India, UK and US).


Pearson’s workforce planning platform, powered by generative AI, finds that the work Gen AI can most effectively support is focused on tasks related to maintaining records, data collection, or researching and compiling information for others.


The ten work tasks with most hours saved by Gen AI by 2026 in the UK are:



Maintain current knowledge in area of expertise (679,000 hours)



Develop educational programs, plans, or procedures (665,000 hours)



Create visual designs or displays (525,000 hours)



Maintain operational records (512,000 hours)



Prepare legal or regulatory documents (490,000 hours)



Maintain health or medical records (406,000 hours)



Prepare reports of operational or procedural activities (401,000 hours)



Advise others on products or services (387,000 hours)



Explain regulations, policies, or procedures (386,000 hours)



Monitor individual behaviour or performance (383,000 hours)



By augmenting basic tasks with generative AI, companies and their workers can reallocate time to focus on the high value work that humans do best: strategic thinking, collaboration, caring for others, decision making, innovation, problem solving, empathy, leadership.


At an individual level, even small amounts of time saved with Generative AI can help people feel more in control of their job and achieve a better work life balance.


Oliver Latham, VP of Strategy and Growth for Pearson Workforce Skills, said:


“In nearly every workplace, people spend their day on common, time-consuming tasks that eat away at productivity or their work-life balance. If those tasks could be augmented with generative AI, employers and their workers could reallocate time to the things that needs a more human touch and mean more to their customers. Employers should consider how to incorporate this new technology into their teams, and redesign roles to free people up to focus on more valuable, human tasks. They should also consider the need for training and support for employees, so they can use it effectively and responsibly.”

Methodology

At Pearson we believe that the future of work can be one where people and Gen AI can collaborate by using AI as a tool to enhance human potential. For this study, Pearson used census and other workforce datasets to create a single view of the current workforce in the US, UK, Australia, India and Brazil. Using Pearson’s proprietary occupations ontology of 5,600 jobs and 76,000 tasks, each job can be viewed as a collection of tasks. This allows our machine learning algorithms to calculate future technology impact at a task level.


Pearson looked at hours currently spent, countrywide, in the UK on work tasks each week, and then calculated what this would be in three years' time as Gen AI technology is adopted into the workplace. We then identified the tasks which would have the greatest hours reduced by the technology (specifically LLM Chatbots and AI Text-to-Visual Media Generators).

Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing HR by improving employee experiences and organization operations. Geoffrey Peterson, VP of data and analytics at Alight Solutions, discusses critical areas where AI can enhance HR practices and offers guidance to HR leaders on effectively leveraging its potential.
Artificial intelligence (AI) permeates many facets of the modern enterprise, transforming how businesses function and interact with their employees and customers. The Human Resources (HR) organization has not escaped this trend, where leaders are being pushed to demonstrate how AI is reshaping processes and enhancing employee experiences –all while coming up to speed on how to be AI intrapreneurs and how to ensure AI is being introduced responsibly. 
For example, GartnerOpens a new window  reports that “By 2025, 60% of enterprise organizations will adopt a responsible AI framework for their HR technology, and in turn, achieve a greater employee experience and trust in the organization.” 
However, amidst the promise of AI-driven efficiencies and innovations, there lies a complex interplay of both potential and peril that demands careful consideration and management. Though AI brings new and exciting capabilities to HR, it also inherits the risks and governance needs inherent to all software, as well as a few additional ones. 
For example, while AI might be alluring for HR functions like recruitment and performance management to automate resume or performance reviews, errors or bad outputs in these domains can have unacceptable real-world consequences. 
As HR executives navigate this landscape, it’s crucial to separate fact from fiction and understand how to leverage AI effectively to enhance the employee experience.
Dispelling 5 Myths About AI in HR
Before diving into the practical applications of AI in HR, it’s essential to debunk some common myths surrounding its implementation:
1. AI will replace HR professionals
Contrary to popular concerns, AI is not poised to replace HR professionals. Current AI technology isn’t autonomous intelligence, it is scaled intelligence. This means every process that is automated or augmented with AI still needs to have some number of humans who are in the loop to monitor its actions and insights for correctness and quality. 
Additionally, many HR tasks cannot be “AI-ed away,” including strategic planning, relationship management, and ensuring ethical HR practices. An HR professional’s ability to understand psychological factors, foster workplace diversity, maintain data security, provide clear communication, relate to employees on a human level, and monitor AI systems! cannot be fully replicated by AI.
2. AI decision-making is a Black Box
Some AI algorithms are opaque, but there are many (e.g., linear regressions, decision trees) whose decision-making can be more easily understood. By considering the surrounding business context of a proposed use case – including how explainable good/ bad decisions will need to be – the right AI algorithms can be chosen for an application that offers the right level of understandability.
3. Employee data security is at risk with AI
AI is, ultimately, just software. Companies with robust cybersecurity and third-party management programs already have the mechanisms needed to manage the risks related to employee data security.  
A specific scenario that seems to be causing recent concern is that of SaaS vendors training AI models using aggregated, anonymized employee data from across their client base. However, this is not a new risk – SaaS vendors have used aggregated employee data for a long time to understand the performance of their products and make improvements – and the recent focus on this happening with AI models is misplaced. 
4. It is possible for AI to be bias-free 
All AI produces bad output occasionally, and when those bad outputs concentrate in certain parts of the user population, that is called bias. All models have the bias of some form—if you think yours doesn’t, you just haven’t found it yet.  
It is important to understand what types of bias you are especially worried about and continuously check and monitor for those. You may not care if “bad outputs” concentrate on people whose first names start with “A,” but you may care if “bad outputs” concentrate only on older or younger users of the AI system.
5. HR teams need numerous complex AI use cases to be successful
Success in AI implementation does not hinge on the number of use cases but rather on their quality and alignment with organizational objectives. Any meaningful implementation of an AI system will be a large undertaking requiring significant investment (both to implement and to monitor on an ongoing basis). Achieving impact with two to three new use cases is ambitious and an enormous win for most organizations.

Understanding AI in HR

AI encompasses various techniques that enable machines to simulate human intelligence. In HR, AI manifests in different forms, from basic algorithms used in recruiting software to complex machine learning models that personalize the employee experience. It’s sometimes helpful to also include robotic process automation (RPA) under the AI umbrella since the objectives (automating repetitive tasks) are the same, and it’s often a precursor to AI-based automation.
There are several key areas where AI can drive substantial improvements in HR practices; these include:

Personalization: AI can tailor digital experiences to individual employee needs and preferences, whether through personalized onboarding experiences, benefits recommendations, nudges, or learning paths.
Assistance: AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots provide immediate support to employees, answering questions and directing them to resources.
Recommendations: AI analyzes data to offer guidance in complex circumstances, such as health plan options during enrollment or development courses based on career goals.
Insights: By analyzing data from various sources, AI provides insights into employee sentiment, experience hotspot areas that need improvement, and the effectiveness of HR initiatives.
Operations: AI automates repetitive tasks like document processing and scheduling, creating faster turn-around times for employees and allowing HR professionals to focus on more strategic initiatives.

As organizations embark on their AI journey in HR, it’s essential to manage expectations and adopt a measured approach. Success relies on the rigorous measurement of performance, error rates, biases, and business impact designed around humans-in-the-loop that can monitor and improve any AI solutions. This journey requires time, experimentation, robust controls and governance to ensure ethical and effective use of AI in enhancing the employee experience.

Under the law, AI systems used in areas such as law enforcement and employment will have to demonstrate that they are adequately transparent and accurate, fulfill cybersecurity standards and meet criteria regarding the quality of the data used to train them.
The vote by EU countries came two months after the European Parliament backed the AI legislation.
The bloc's law goes well beyond the voluntary compliance approach to AI in the US, for example, and could have a signal effect across the globe.
What is the law and how will it be implemented?
The law stipulates that systems meant for use in ""high-risk"" situations will have to obtain certification from approved bodies before they can be put on the EU market.
Such situations include those where use of AI could potentially harm health, safety, fundamental rights, the environment, democracy, elections and the rule of law.
Systems such as the social credit scoring used in China will be banned outright, as will biometric categorization systems based on people's religious or other worldviews, sexual orientation and race.AI's role in life & death decisions To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video04:07
The final law does generally ban real-time facial recognition in CCTV, but makes exceptions for law enforcement uses, such as finding missing persons or victims of kidnapping, preventing human trafficking, or finding suspects in serious criminal cases.
AI systems that are deemed to pose limited risks will have to meet much lighter transparency standards, among other things being obliged to disclose that their content is AI-generated to allow people to decide how much trust they have in it.  
A new ""AI Office"" within the European Commission is to be established to make sure the law is enforced at EU level.
The law must now be signed by the presidents of the EU legislature and then published in the EU's statute book. It then technically goes into force 20 days later, but most of its provisions won't take effect until two years after that.
Companies make safety commitments
In another sign of widespread concern surrounding the potential damage that could be caused by AI, more than a dozen of the world's leading AI firms made fresh safety commitments at a global summit in Seoul on Tuesday, according to the UK government.
These commitments ensure the world's leading AI companies will provide transparency and accountability on their plans to develop safe AI,"" UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement released by Britain's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.
The companies included Alphabet's Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI as well as others from China, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates.

Artificial Intelligence Trained to Draw Inspiration From Images, Not Copy Them


















Powerful new artificial intelligence models sometimes, quite famously, get things wrong — whether hallucinating false information or memorizing others’ work and offering it up as their own. To address the latter, researchers led by a team at The University of Texas at Austin have developed a framework to train AI models on images corrupted beyond recognition.
DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are among the text-to-image diffusion generative AI models that can turn arbitrary user text into highly realistic images. All three are now facing lawsuits from artists who allege generated samples replicate their work. Trained on billions of image-text pairs that are not publicly available, the models are capable of generating high-quality imagery from textual prompts but may draw on copyrighted images that they then replicate.
The newly proposed framework, called Ambient Diffusion, gets around this problem by training diffusion models through access only to corrupted image-based data. Early efforts suggest the framework is able to continue to generate high-quality samples without ever seeing anything that’s recognizable as the original source images.
Ambient Diffusion was originally presented at NeurIPS, a top machine-learning conference, in 2023 and has since been adapted and extended. The follow-up paper, “Consistent Diffusion Meets Tweedie,” was accepted to the 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning. In collaboration with Constantinos Daskalakis of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the team extended the framework to train diffusion models on data sets of images corrupted by other types of noise, rather than by simply masking pixels, and on larger data sets.
“The framework could prove useful for scientific and medical applications, too,” said Adam Klivans, a professor of computer science, who was involved in the work. “That would be true for basically any research where it is expensive or impossible to have a full set of uncorrupted data, from black hole imaging to certain types of MRI scans.”
Klivans; Alex Dimakis, a professor of electrical and computer engineering; and other collaborators in the multi-institution Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning directed by the two UT faculty members experimented first by training a diffusion model on a set of 3,000 images of celebrities, then using that model to generate new samples. In the experiment, the diffusion model trained on clean data blatantly copied the training examples. But when researchers corrupted the training data, randomly masking up to 90% of individual pixels in an image, and retrained the model with their new approach, the generated samples remained high quality but looked very different. The model can still generate human faces, but the generated ones are sufficiently different from the training images.
“Our framework allows for controlling the trade-off between memorization and performance,” said Giannis Daras, a computer science graduate student who led the work. “As the level of corruption encountered during training increases, the memorization of the training set decreases.”
The researchers said this points to a solution that, though it may change performance, will never output noise. The framework offers an example of how academic researchers are advancing artificial intelligence to meet societal needs, a key theme this year at The University of Texas at Austin, which has declared 2024 the “Year of AI.”
The research team included members from the University of California, Berkeley and MIT.
Funding for the research was provided by the National Science Foundation, Western Digital, Amazon, Cisco and a variety of sources of fellowship and endowment support for the authors.

Geographic location also influences compensation, with major consulting hubs offering higher salaries.

Expert Insights on AI Job Salaries and Careers
Insights from industry experts highlight the growing importance of AI expertise across industries, emphasizing the need for continuous learning and upskilling, and the potential impact of AI on job roles and compensation.
“The widening pay gap between tech and non-tech roles underscores the influence of AI across industries, suggesting salaries will increasingly revolve around AI expertise,” according to Young Pham, a project manager at BizReport. This showcases how AI skills command higher pay as organizations seek to take advantage of this transformative technology.
Sheila Jordan, SVP and Chief Digital Technology Officer for Honeywell, said her company is taking a proactive approach to AI.

This suggests that as AI automates tasks, the remaining human roles may become more specialized and valuable, leading to higher compensation for those with the skills necessary to work with AI.
How Do I Get Paid More as an AI Professional?
To increase your earning potential and get paid more as an AI professional, a number of strategies to boost your skills and marketability can be effective. Here are some of the more common ones:

Get an Advanced Degree: While not always necessary, having an advanced degree (such as a master’s or MBA) can enhance your earning potential, especially in certain fields like business, healthcare, or technology.
Build a Portfolio of Work: Showcase your skills and accomplishments through a strong portfolio. This could include projects you’ve worked on, case studies, articles, or designs. A compelling portfolio demonstrates your capabilities and can differentiate you from other candidates when negotiating higher compensation.
Network with Professionals: Attend industry events, join professional associations, and connect with peers and mentors in your field. Networking can lead to new job opportunities, referrals, and valuable insights into salary trends.
Negotiate a Higher AI Job Salary: Finally, if you’re offered an AI job, negotiate a higher salary. Research market rates and present your unique skills. Approach discussions confidently and professionally to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.

Bottom Line: The Future of AI Salaries is Bright
AI jobs can be highly lucrative, especially if you have the right skills, experience, and qualifications. Salaries for AI-related roles vary based on job title, location, industry, level of expertise, and labor market demand-supply dynamics—but in all cases, they’re some of the highest across the tech sector.

Adobe is adding an artificial-intelligence-powered Generative Remove feature to its Lightroom photo editor that makes it dead simple to zap out unwanted elements, like that annoying guy in the background. The new feature is in a public beta-testing phase, but it will work across the Lightroom ecosystem whether you're using the app on mobile, desktop, or web.Lightroom's Generative Remove uses Adobe's Firefly AI engine to smoothly replace unwanted elements. Simply paint over the area you want to remove and Lightroom will send that information to Adobe's Firefly servers, which then crunch the data and send it back. In demos WIRED saw, this process took no more than a few seconds, though performance will depend on your internet connection's speed.Unlike Adobe Photoshop's Reference Image feature, which launched less than a month ago and allows users to generate new images using Firefly, Lightroom's AI features are very much focused on a photographer's workflow.The highlighted area shows what will be removed.

Courtesy of AdobeOne of the more difficult things to do when editing images is to remove distracting elements. Typically this would be done using tools like Lightroom's Content Aware Remove, which hides elements by matching surrounding areas. This works well in small situations where backgrounds aren't too confusing for the software. For example, removing a telephone pole against a solid blue sky. But the larger the object to remove, and the more complex the background, the more difficult and time-consuming this becomes.Featured VideoKen Jeong Answers Medical Questions From TwitterThe Firefly-powered Generative Remove can do the same thing but for much larger objects against any background. Adobe has reduced what would have once taken hours and considerable technical know-how to the flick of a mouse and a few seconds of processing time. Everyone is now a Lightroom wizard. Also, unlike other retouching tools, which do the best match they can, Generative Remove generates three different versions and allows you to choose the one that looks best.As impressive and useful as Generative Remove is, it might sound a bit familiar, especially to anyone using Google Photos. These new features don't offer much that Google's Magic Eraser tool couldn't already do. Nor does it enable anything like Google's Magic Editor, which lets you alter the lighting of a scene or cut and paste subjects within the scene.AdvertisementAdobe's Generative Remove mirrors the company's previous uses of AI, like last year's AI-powered noise removal tool, which built on existing noise removal tools, making them better rather than breaking significant new ground. This, I suspect, is what working photographers actually want—better tools, rather than flashy new features. Adobe seems content to leave the more dramatic AI-powered tools, like rearranging a scene after the fact, to others.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterGadget LabThe latest news, expert guides, and in-depth reviews from WIRED's Gear team.

Adobe is adding an artificial-intelligence-powered Generative Remove feature to its Lightroom photo editor that makes it dead simple to zap out unwanted elements, like that annoying guy in the background. The new feature is in a public beta-testing phase, but it will work across the Lightroom ecosystem whether you're using the app on mobile, desktop, or web.
Lightroom's Generative Remove uses Adobe's Firefly AI engine to smoothly replace unwanted elements. Simply paint over the area you want to remove and Lightroom will send that information to Adobe's Firefly servers, which then crunch the data and send it back. In demos WIRED saw, this process took no more than a few seconds, though performance will depend on your internet connection's speed.
Unlike Adobe Photoshop's Reference Image feature, which launched less than a month ago and allows users to generate new images using Firefly, Lightroom's AI features are very much focused on a photographer's workflow.
One of the more difficult things to do when editing images is to remove distracting elements. Typically this would be done using tools like Lightroom's Content Aware Remove, which hides elements by matching surrounding areas. This works well in small situations where backgrounds aren't too confusing for the software. For example, removing a telephone pole against a solid blue sky. But the larger the object to remove, and the more complex the background, the more difficult and time-consuming this becomes.
The Firefly-powered Generative Remove can do the same thing but for much larger objects against any background. Adobe has reduced what would have once taken hours and considerable technical know-how to the flick of a mouse and a few seconds of processing time. Everyone is now a Lightroom wizard. Also, unlike other retouching tools, which do the best match they can, Generative Remove generates three different versions and allows you to choose the one that looks best.
As impressive and useful as Generative Remove is, it might sound a bit familiar, especially to anyone using Google Photos. These new features don't offer much that Google's Magic Eraser tool couldn't already do. Nor does it enable anything like Google's Magic Editor, which lets you alter the lighting of a scene or cut and paste subjects within the scene.
Adobe's Generative Remove mirrors the company's previous uses of AI, like last year's AI-powered noise removal tool, which built on existing noise removal tools, making them better rather than breaking significant new ground. This, I suspect, is what working photographers actually want—better tools, rather than flashy new features. Adobe seems content to leave the more dramatic AI-powered tools, like rearranging a scene after the fact, to others.",,"https://media.wired.com/photos/664c9bd1e8dc63065ac1c23d/2:3/w_1200,h_1800,c_limit/Lightroom-Generative-Remove-Gear-2JB4PAE.jpg",,,,,,"Taking a cue from Google's Magic Eraser, Adobe's new trick improves on existing tools with the help of generative AI.",,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'WIRED'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DOL issued guidance for businesses that create or deploy AI in the workplace.
The White House issued a separate fact sheet concerning “critical steps to protect workers from risks of artificial intelligence.” 
Both documents are non-binding but indicate the federal government is taking an increased interest in AI in employment.





On May 16, 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) released a document entitled, “Department of Labor’s Artificial Intelligence and Worker Well-being: Principles for Developers and Employers.” The document outlines several artificial intelligence principles (“AI Principles”) to provide employers and developers that create and deploy AI with guidance for designing and implementing these emerging technologies in ways that enhance job quality and protect workers’ rights. The DOL’s AI Principles emphasize ethical development; transparency and meaningful worker engagement in AI system design, use, governance, and oversight; protection of workers’ rights; and use of AI to enhance work. This document was issued in response to President Biden’s Executive Order on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence” (“AI Executive Order”), issued on October 30, 2023, which directed the DOL to develop best practices for employers, agencies, and federal contractors.
The document states that the DOL’s AI Principles apply during the entire lifecycle of AI, from development, testing and deployment of AI systems in the workplace, to oversight, use and auditing. The document further states that the AI Principles are applicable to all sectors and intended to be mutually reinforcing, though not all principles will apply to the same extent in every industry or workplace. Importantly, the DOL states that “[t]he Principles are not intended to be an exhaustive list but instead a guiding framework for businesses. AI developers and employers should review and customize the best practices based on their own context and with input from workers.” This statement underscores that the AI Principles are not prescriptive. The AI Principles include:

[North Star] Centering Worker Empowerment: The DOL’s document states that workers and their representatives, especially those from underserved communities, should be informed of and have genuine input in the design, development, testing, training, use, and oversight of AI systems for use in the workplace. This principle reflects a strong emphasis on empowering workers and their representatives, which is aligned with President Biden’s historically pro-union position. Employers should follow related developments at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which may rely on this principle as the basis for issuing unfair labor practice complaints alleging violations of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).


Ethically Developing AI: The document emphasizes that AI systems should be designed, developed, and trained in a way that protects workers. This echoes guidance from the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which provides that automated systems should be developed in consultation from experts and include pre-deployment testing, identification of risks, mitigating efforts, and ongoing monitoring.


Establishing AI Governance and Human Oversight: The DOL’s AI Principles also stress that organizations should have clear governance systems, procedures, human oversight, and evaluation processes for AI systems for use in the workplace.


Ensuring Transparency in AI Use: Employers should be transparent with workers and job seekers about the AI systems that are being used in the workplace. This principle is similar to guidance in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights regarding notice, explanation and, insofar as possible, the grant of agency to those affected, regarding the collection, use, access, transfer, and deletion of their data in automated systems. Technical guidance issued from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) also contains a similar provision regarding notice of use and function of AI tools in employment decisions. The EEOC also recommends providing alternatives unless this would cause undue hardship.


Protecting Labor and Employment Rights: AI systems should not violate or undermine workers’ right to organize, health and safety rights, wage and hour rights, and anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation protections.


Using AI to Enable Workers: AI systems should assist, complement, and enable workers, and improve job quality.


Supporting Workers Impacted by AI: Employers should support or upskill workers during job transitions related to AI. The DOL provides no details on how employers can support workers displaced by AI. In fact, the AI Executive Order directed the DOL to issue a report on how the government can support workers displaced by AI by the end of April of 2024, but the DOL has not yet issued the report.


Ensuring Responsible Use of Worker Data: Workers’ data collected, used, or created by AI systems should be limited in scope and location, used only to support legitimate business aims, and protected and handled responsibly. This is similar to the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights guidance that people should, to the maximum extent possible, have agency regarding the collection, use, access, transfer, and deletion of their data in automated systems.

The same day the DOL issued its AI Principles, the White House issued a fact sheet concerning “critical steps to protect workers from risks of artificial intelligence.”  In the fact sheet, the Biden administration outlined additional principles targeting the use of AI in the workplace, including not simply informing workers of the use of AI in the workplace, but also ensuring workers “have genuine input in the design, development, testing, training, use, and oversight” of such AI. Additionally, the principles include informing applicants of AI systems used by employers in hiring, ensuring AI systems do “not violate or undermine workers’ right to organize” and seeing that AI systems “improve job quality” and “support or upskill workers.” The Biden administration directed that employees’ data “should be limited” and used only “to support legitimate business aims.” These principles, like the DOL’s AI Principles, do not specify what may run afoul of the documents.
AI Principle Key Takeaways 
First, the Biden administration and the DOL’s AI Principles make clear that the federal government is taking a comprehensive approach to AI in the workplace, from hiring through leaves and accommodation, day-to-day performance tools, wage and hour policies, and worker organization under the NLRA. While the DOL has no jurisdiction to enforce the NLRA, we anticipate this “whole of government” approach will bring additional scrutiny from other applicable agencies, such as the EEOC and NLRB. Indeed, the EEOC has already issued its technical assistance document on “assessing impact in software, algorithms, and artificial intelligence” for issues that could arise under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Moreover, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo has stated her concern that “employers could use these technologies to interfere with the exercise of Section 7 rights under the National Labor Relations Act by significantly impairing or negating employees’ ability to engage in protected activity.”
Second, the AI Principles from the DOL are merely one of the latest in a string of guidance, statements, and other resources issued by federal agencies targeting AI. The DOL’s AI Principles underscore that much of this guidance is descriptive to protect against some of the potential harmful risks of AI, but not federally mandated or binding. Indeed, the DOL emphasizes that its AI Principles are not “intended to be an exhaustive list but instead a guiding framework for businesses.”
Third, the AI Principles state that the DOL developed the document “with input from workers, unions, researchers, academics, employers, and developers, among others, and through public listening sessions,” without acknowledging any input from employers or developers regarding AI in the workplace related to the AI Executive Order.
Fourth, while the document is newly issued, many of the DOL’s AI Principles recycle key principles from earlier federal guidance documents and are in some cases considerably weaker. For example, when compared to the Blueprint for the AI Bill of Rights the White House issued in October of 2022, the document’s use of the word “should” reiterates that these best practices are not prescriptive.
Fifth, DOL’s AI Principles track recent federal legislative developments related to AI. Most notably, on May 15, 2024, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators released their legislative plan for AI called, “Driving U.S. Innovation in Artificial Intelligence.” The plan calls for annual spending of $32 billion by 2026 for research and development of AI, creation of a federal data privacy law, and efforts to prevent deepfakes in elections. However, the plan did not offer more specific information, instead calling for Congress and federal agencies to regulate AI because, Senator Chuck Schumer stated, “It’s very hard to do regulations because A.I. is changing too quickly.” And while the Senate’s legislative plan is based on a belief that AI changes too quickly and should be addressed by regulation, such regulation would involve a notice and comment period, delaying implementation of any substantive regulatory guidance. The European Union (EU), on the other hand, was able to enact its AI Act, which sets forth specific requirements for any U.S. companies using AI systems in the EU market, including prohibitions on risks the AI Act deems unacceptable, such as systems that manipulate an individual’s behavior, systems that infer characteristics, such as religious beliefs or sexual orientation, and systems that are used in the workplace for emotion recognition. Employers with operations in the EU should pay particular attention to the EU’s AI Act and consult with counsel if they are currently using AI systems.
Conclusion
Ultimately, the DOL’s AI Principles show how the Department is attempting to regulate AI without new legislation from Congress. More AI guidance is expected in the future. The press release accompanying the DOL’s AI Principles notes that DOL “will soon provide employers and developers with best practices to consider as they implement the AI principles.” Ultimately, the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape requires that employers and their counsel pay close attention to current and developing legal authority concerning AI.

<p>Building on President Joseph Biden&rsquo;s October 30, 2023 Executive Order 14110 (Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence), the guidelines acknowledge both the promises and risks of applying AI in hiring, show an intent to treat and investigate AI models in a similar manner to other selection procedures, and emphasize that the burden is on employers to maintain adequate records and answer questions involving AI models. </p>
<p>In a potential nudge to large-scale industries, such as defense and utilities, the OFCCP presents an example of using AI as an initial filter when filling positions that draw thousands of applicants. </p>
<p>The guidance recognizes AI&rsquo;s usefulness but also stresses the need for guardrails and proactive monitoring, noting that &ldquo;AI has the potential to embed bias and discrimination into a range of employment decision-making processes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The guidance is broken into two major sections: (1) &ldquo;Common Questions About the Use of AI and EEO&rdquo; and (2) &ldquo;Promising Practices for the Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence in the EEO Context.&rdquo; Together, these sections provide employers with a roadmap for compliance with the agency&rsquo;s interpretation of contractor obligations relating to affirmative action and the prevention of unlawful discrimination. The guidance also reinforces the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&rsquo;s existing position that equal employment opportunity obligations apply fully to any use of AI in employment decision-making. </p>
<p>Although the guidelines only apply to federal contractors, private employers should take note of the ways in which AI can implicate anti-discrimination law. </p>
<h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
<p>The OFCCP provides insights on how the agency will treat AI models when evaluating federal contractor compliance, such as during audits. The OFCCP plans to treat AI models like other selection procedures, so federal contractors need to be able to articulate how their AI models operate and maintain records that substantiate these explanations. </p>
<p>Likewise, federal contractors also need to provide adequate justification for any adverse impacts on protected groups that result from the application of AI. Federal contractors cannot shield themselves from liability through the use of third-party tools or delegate these obligations to vendors. Consistent with the &ldquo;Promising Practices&rdquo; noted in the guidance, employers can design and proactively monitor their use of AI systems to comply with the agency&rsquo;s interpretation of their obligations. </p>
<p><strong>EEO Obligations Apply to Federal Contractors&rsquo; Use of AI in Employment Decisions</strong></p>
<p>The OFCCP states that federal contractors must comply with all equal employment opportunity (EEO) obligations in their use of AI systems for employment decisions.</p>
<p>The guidance takes an expansive view of AI, which it defines as a &ldquo;machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.&rdquo; Likewise, the OFCCP&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;employment decisions&rdquo; is broad and covers &ldquo;all aspects of the terms and conditions of employment&rdquo; including hiring or termination, pay or promotion decisions, workplace training programs, and workplace surveillance or management systems. </p>
<p>The guidance also states that federal contractors must</p>
<ul>
    <li>maintain records on AI models and ensure confidentiality consistent with OFCCP regulatory requirements; </li>
    <li>cooperate with the OFCCP by providing requested information on their AI systems; and</li>
    <li>make available reasonable accommodations for physical or mental limitations of otherwise qualified applicants or employees with a disability, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the contractor. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if a selection procedure that relies on AI has an adverse impact on members of any race, sex, or ethnic group, employers must validate the system consistent with nondiscrimination laws and the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. This includes articulating the business needs for the AI model, analyzing job-relatedness, engaging in bias audits and independent assessments, and exploring less discriminatory, alternative selection procedures. </p>
<p><strong>Obligations and Liability Remain on the Employer</strong></p>
<p>The guidance also emphasizes that federal contractors cannot shield themselves from EEO obligations and potential liability with the use of third-party products. Even where an employer obtains an AI system from a third-party vendor, the employer remains responsible for meeting its nondiscrimination and affirmative action obligations under the laws enforced by the OFCCP. These laws do not impose separate obligations on vendors so federal contractors cannot escape liability by deferring to a third party. </p>
<p>Relatedly, federal contractor employers should ensure that any third-party AI models they use are transparent, substantiated with adequate documentation, and subject to regular independent bias audits. </p>
<p><strong>Federal Contractors Should Proactively Mitigate Risks Associated with the Use of AI</strong></p>
<p>Finally, the OFCCP&rsquo;s &ldquo;Promising Practices&rdquo; for the use of AI provides a framework for federal contractors to consider when designing or utilizing an AI system in making employment decisions. The Promising Practices address four core areas: (1) notice to applicants; (2) using an AI system; (3) obtaining a vendor-created AI system; and (4) ensuring adequate accessibility and disability inclusion. </p>
<p>Before adopting an AI system, federal contractors should provide advance notice to applicants or employees that it intends to use AI, provide information on how employees or applicants can request an accommodation, explain what data will be captured and whether it can be reviewed/corrected, and safeguard the privacy of jobseekers and employees. </p>
<p>Once the AI model goes live, the employer should engage with applicants/employees, follow standard processes for accommodation requests, routinely monitor any adverse impacts, verify that documentation is easily accessible, and ensure that there is sufficient human oversight from trained individuals and broader oversight from governance structures. </p>
<p>The guidance also provides additional recommendations when contracting with a third-party vendor for an AI system. Employers should ensure that vendor contracts include specific provisions on maintaining easily accessible records and strong data privacy guardrails consistent with OFCCP regulatory requirements. </p>
<p>Federal contractors should also confirm that, beyond making accommodations available, the AI system is accessible and incorporates inclusive design elements. Employers should perform ongoing testing and monitoring of the accessibility for the system. </p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Federal contractor employers now have a roadmap for OFCCP compliance in the AI space. While other developments may provide additional details for this roadmap, at a minimum, federal contractor employers should understand that equal employment opportunity obligations apply fully to any use of AI in employment decision-making. Private employers should also take note of the ways in which AI can implicate anti-discrimination law.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The US Department of Labor&rsquo;s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) recently issued guidance for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by federal contractors in employment decisions.,,

SAN FRANCISCO—Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero today launched a new judicial branch task force to evaluate generative artificial intelligence (AI) for its potential benefits to courts and court users while mitigating risks to safeguard the public.
“Generative AI brings great promise, but our guiding principle should be safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process,” said Chief Justice Guerrero. “That means it will be essential for the branch to assess what protections are necessary as we begin to use this technology.”
Members of the task force will include Administrative Presiding Justice Brad Hill (chair), Justice Carin Fujisaki, Judge Kyle Brodie, Administrative Presiding Justice Mary Greenwood, Judge Arturo Castro, and council members David Yamasaki and Gretchen Nelson.
Earlier this year, Chief Justice Guerrero asked Justice Greenwood and Judge Castro to help identify the foundational questions the California court system must consider regarding the appropriate uses of AI.
In response to their report and recommendations presented today, Chief Justice Guerrero announced the following next steps for the judicial branch:
Create an AI task force to oversee the consideration and development of branch actions that address generative AI, such as rules of court, technology policies, educational programs, and legislative proposals
	 
Work with Supreme Court ethics committees to develop guidance on how judicial officers should navigate ethical issues associated with generative AI
	 
Provide education for judicial officers, court professionals, and council staff that focuses on the uses, benefits, and risks of generative AI 
AI Issues to Be Considered
During their presentation to the council, Justice Greenwood and Judge Castro recommended the judicial branch should use generative AI, but with limitations and safeguards, as avoiding this easily accessible technology may deprive the branch of significant benefits. They identified some potential uses of AI, which include improving court administration and management, and enhancing research and analysis. 
“Generative AI could also increase access to justice for the public,” said Judge Castro. “I think about the potential for AI to help walk self-represented litigants through the process, forms, and procedures they will encounter at the courthouse.”
In addition to the potential benefits of AI, the presenters emphasized the need for litigants to interact with the court and its judicial officers to feel that they’ve been heard. “It’s important to note that generative AI is only a tool,” said Justice Greenwood. “It’s not an end, and it’s not a substitute for judicial decision making and due process.” Watch(link is external)
Other Items on the Council Meeting Agenda:
Presiding Remotely in Civil Cases: The council approved a new rule of court(link is external) on when a judicial officer may preside remotely over a civil proceeding from a location other than a courtroom. With approval from the presiding judge, the rule allows for presiding remotely in limited circumstances when doing so is in the interest of justice, such as when safety is an issue, no courtrooms are available, or to prevent a significant delay that would substantially prejudice the litigants.

Changes to CARE Act Rules and Forms: The council approved revisions to rules of court and forms(link is external) related to the sealing of records, communications between the CARE Act court and the juvenile court, notification of respondent’s attorney in certain parallel or related legal proceedings, and limits on authorized communication.
Report on Pretrial Programs: The council received a report on court programs and practices(link is external) that promote the safe, efficient, fair, and timely pretrial release of individuals booked into jail. Data collected from the pretrial program showed pretrial release rates increased for both felonies and misdemeanors while rearrest/rebooking rates decreased.
Increasing Numbers of Court Interpreters: The council approved a proposal on how to allocate money(link is external) provided in the 2023-24 state budget for a five-year pilot program to increase the number of court interpreter employees. Funding will go toward reimbursing potential interpreters for costs associated with their training, coursework, and examination fees.
Trial Court Financial Policies and Procedures Manual: The council approved updates to the Trial Court Financial Policies and Procedures Manual(link is external), which provides a system of fundamental internal controls that helps trial courts monitor their use of public funds, provide consistent and comparable financial statements, and demonstrate accountability. Watch(link is external)
Appointment to Board of State and Community Corrections: The council approved the reappointment of Judge Janet Gaard (ret.)(link is external) to the Board of State and Community Corrections, an independent statutory agency that provides leadership to the adult and juvenile criminal justice systems and expertise on public safety realignment issues.

In the process of building one of the largest AI-ready workforces in the world, TCS saw its average learning hours per employee increase to 87.1 hours in FY24 from 82.4 hours in FY23. Not just juniors and mid-level employees, but even senior employees saw their average learning hours increase in FY24, the Indian IT giant disclosed in its annual report for FY24.TCS employees reportedly have clocked 51 million learning hours and acquired 5 million competencies in FY24. This focus on learning aligns with TCS's recent expansion in generative AI projects, with their pipeline doubling to a staggering $900 million. While junior male employees at TCS clocked an average of 126 learning hours last fiscal, female junior employees clocked an average of 115 learning hours in the same period. In the case of middle level employees, male and female spent 57 and 51 hours, respectively. And in the senior level, male employees and female employees clocked 49 and 54 learning hours, respectively.TCS' Gen-AI deal pipeline sees big jumpTCS' generative AI pipeline has doubled to $900 million, the IT bellwether said during its earnings announcement. The Mumbai-headquartered firm said it had signed new deals totalling $13.2 billion in the quarter - the highest ever for the company even as it signalled a cautious turnaround for the industry saying that the pain may be bottoming out and FY25 will be better than FY24.Beyond new hires, TCS prioritizes internal talent development. They achieved 33% of job placements by upskilling and cross-skilling existing employees, fostering growth opportunities within the company.While the number of employees over 50 saw a slight increase, there's a trend of decreasing younger employees in India. The percentage of those under 30 dropped from 59% in FY22 to 50.3% in FY24.

Surveying 11,900 individuals in Asia Pacific, the report positions India as a frontrunner among 13 countries for GenAI use and adoption. Emphasizing the need for employers and policymakers to adapt to this rapidly evolving technology.According to the survey, the robust adoption of GenAI has been driven by tech-savvy, young employees, known as “Generation AI,” who are driving GenAI adoption, presenting new challenges and opportunities for employers as they adapt to these changes. Per the report, “Generation AI” is leading the way in saving work hours, creating new skill development opportunities, creating more sustainable workloads and increasing productivity.The dynamic business impact of GenAI adoption, coupled with a projected 182 percent increase in daily usage over the next five years, reflects a dynamic trajectory towards deeper integration. Such optimism is echoed in the belief of 75 percent of Indians regarding GenAI’s potential to elevate Asia Pacific’s role in the global economy, with 83 percent expressing confidence in its ability to enhance social outcomes.Key findings from the reportGeneration AI leads the way: Students and employees lead the GenAI revolution across Asia Pacific, but only 50 percent believe their managers know they are using it.Significant impact: GenAI could significantly affect 17 percent of working hours across Asia Pacific, amounting to almost 1.1 billion work hours annually.Traditional technology hierarchy: This may be disrupted with the rapid adoption of GenAI in developing countries at 30 percent, which is higher compared with developed economies across Asia Pacific.Talent benefits: GenAI users across Asia Pacific save ~6.3 hours per week, with Indian users saving 7.85 hours per week, enabling employees to acquire new skills.Saves time: GenAI can support more sustainable workloads and productivity, with 41 percent of time savers believing this has improved their work-life balance.Managing risks: Three-quarters of businesses are falling behind on GenAI adoption, according to their own employees.Commenting on the report, Chris Lewin, Deloitte Asia Pacific’s AI & Data Capability Leader, said, “One of the most exciting aspects of working with GenAI is that across the globe, it is happening to everything, everywhere, all at once. What we have experienced in the last 12 months is that the challenges faced by our clients in Indonesia or India are almost immediately relevant to teams in Italy and Ireland. One key lesson is that the rapid adoption of AI will not directly eliminate jobs, but the impact will be felt by businesses that fail to adapt. Their employees, and in particular, talent new to the workforce, will be drawn to rival businesses offering AI applications that can redraw the future of modern work.”Anjani Kumar, Partner, Consulting, Deloitte India, added, “GenAI has revolutionised the approach and future of work. Unlocking newer possibilities can help us do things faster, better and in a more creative way leading to more meaningful experiences for talent. To fully use this transformative technology, it is crucial to address implementation challenges and deepen our understanding of its capabilities. Despite its clear benefits, obstacles such as implementation complexities, risk aversion and knowledge gaps impede widespread adoption.” “Leaders should use these technologies not only for efficiency gains but also to fundamentally reshape business models and processes. Overcoming implementation hurdles requires proactive engagement and a comprehensive understanding of AI’s capabilities among stakeholders” he added.GenAI holds enormous potential to reshape our work and innovation landscape. With its promise of improved efficiency, enhanced quality and amplified creativity, businesses and universities stand to unlock unprecedented growth opportunities. Notably, 86 percent of Indian users report faster task completion, 85 percent note improved output quality and 83 percent emphasize enhanced ideation capabilities. A big bang, short fuse scenarioTo further unpack GenAI’s impact on the Asia Pacific region, Deloitte Access Economics mapped 18 industries in terms of the extent of GenAI’s impact—the “bang”—and how soon those industries will be affected—the length of the “fuse.” It is estimated that USD5 trillion of economic activity within industries will face a big bang, short fuse scenario.Finance, ICT and media, professional services and education are the four industries affected, which account for an average of one-fifth of the economies of each market in Asia Pacific. This share is expected to increase as some markets shift towards service industries such as professional services, finance and ICT that face higher impact. These industries are also where over 40 percent of students who are using GenAI to start their careers, further accelerating the pace of transformation. Three key actions for businesses to adopt The rise of GenAI means that business leaders and employees need to think strategically and act proactively to respond to the rapidly changing environment. Based on the analysis of the report’s findings, businesses should take the following high-impact actions:Develop and implement a GenAI strategy that brings your employees on the journey.Empower employees to own their AI journey.Develop data infrastructure iteratively as needed to embrace GenAI.

						Navigating a New Era: Department of Labor’s Guidance on AI Compliance with FLSA and FMLA

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in personnel management has ushered in a new era of efficiency and productivity, but it also raises important questions about compliance with labor laws. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) recently issued guidance regarding the employment law impact of certain AI features used in performance management, wages and hours, timekeeping, leave management, and other human resources technology systems.
While acknowledging that “AI and other automated systems can provide ways to streamline tasks for employers, improve workplace efficiency and safety, and enhance workforce accountability,” the DOL cautioned that, “without responsible human oversight, the use of such technologies may pose potential compliance challenges with respect to federal labor standards.” The new guidance specifically addresses compliance with leave management under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and minimum wage and overtime compliance under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
As a refresher, the FLSA governs fair labor practices such as minimum wage, overtime pay, and recordkeeping. The FMLA guarantees eligible employees unpaid leave for specified family and medical reasons. These laws were crafted long before the advent of AI, presenting challenges in their application to modern workplaces infused with automation and machine learning.
New AI technology leverages employee monitoring, measuring and analyzing metrics of worker productivity or activity in real time, such as computer keystrokes, mouse clicks, website browsing, web camera monitoring, and other data to determine whether and when an employee is active or idle. Employers can use these tools to more accurately determine hours worked and thus increase efficiency in payroll management. While these are helpful tools, employer reliance on such technology without regular, consistent human oversight may create FLSA compliance challenges when employees are actually performing “work” (as defined by the FLSA), but the AI system docks pay because it perceives that an employee is not working. 
Addressing this concern, the DOL noted “an AI program that incorrectly categorizes time as noncompensable work hours based on its analysis of worker activity, productivity, or performance could result in a failure to pay wages for all hours worked.” Employee start times, end times, break times, and waiting time are particular risk areas if timekeeping errors occur.  As we have previously advised, employers utilizing these tools should therefore conduct regular audits and provide for active human monitoring to ensure accuracy in timekeeping. Similarly, employers using AI for payroll management purposes should develop clear and consistent policy guidance, including avenues of recourse for employees who believe they may be underpaid.
Developing a policy with reporting and appeal mechanisms — and clearly communicating these procedures to employees — is crucially important to ensuring fairness and accuracy in employee compensation. In all cases, employers must exercise diligence to ensure that AI-driven recordkeeping complies with FLSA requirements to prevent disputes and potentially costly liability over unpaid wages or overtime.
For purposes of FMLA compliance, the DOL cautions that AI presents unique challenges regarding leave eligibility and accommodation, emphasizing that AI systems must appropriately handle requests for FMLA leave, accommodate eligible employees, and avoid discriminatory practices. For example, an AI system that manages FMLA leave certification which requires employees to disclose excess medical or other personal information could violate the FMLA or the Americans with Disabilities Act’s (ADA) limitations on requesting certain information. Further, an AI system’s failure to consider extenuating circumstances in determining whether employees have complied with their obligations for FMLA certification (or the interactive process for ADA accommodations) could violate either the FMLA, the ADA, or both, implicating an interference or discrimination claim.
Thus, as with wage and hour management, employers should establish clear communication channels for employees to seek FMLA-related information or ADA accommodations as well as reporting/appeal procedures to ensure that AI systems do not hinder access to essential benefits. The DOL’s guidance underscores the need for ongoing vigilance and adaptation. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too must compliance strategies. Employers should prioritize regular audits and assessments of AI systems to identify and address any potential compliance gaps or biases. Furthermore, fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and inclusivity within the organization is crucial for ensuring equitable outcomes in AI-driven decision-making. As we venture further into the age of AI, the commitment to upholding the principles of fairness, equality, and equity remains paramount.

Some 52% of people who use AI at work are reluctant to admit to using it for their most important tasks. — AFP Relaxnews





The coming years may hold many challenges as artificial intelligence is deployed in the workplace. While some workers see this technology as a tremendous opportunity to boost productivity, others have more mixed feelings. They fear that these new tools could be detrimental to their careers. Such are the findings of the latest edition of the “Work Trend Index” report from Microsoft and LinkedIn. Over 30,000 workers in 31 countries were polled for this major annual survey. It turns out that 52% of them are reluctant to let their colleagues know that they are using artificial intelligence tools to carry out complex professional tasks. The reason? They're afraid that it will harm their career development. Indeed, 53% of those surveyed fear that their superiors might be tempted to replace them with AI if they learned that they were using software incorporating this technology to carry out important tasks. Whether it's a real or an imagined fear, no one really knows. Experts and economists can't agree on the number or type of jobs potentially threatened by the arrival of AI. American investment bank Goldman Sachs has estimated that 300 million full-time jobs in Europe and the USA could be threatened by the technology. But it's difficult to predict with any certainty the impact that generative artificial intelligence systems will have on the world of work in the next few years.


 In any case, the employees surveyed by Microsoft and LinkedIn are convinced of the need to master artificial intelligence tools in order to shine professionally. Three quarters believe that AI skills will help them stand out on the job market, while 69% are convinced that these skills will help them get promoted faster. Eight in ten respondents believe they will be able to broaden their professional horizons thanks to this technology. Indeed, employers are looking to surround themselves with people who are able to work effectively with generative AI tools. Two-thirds of business leaders surveyed for the ""Work Trend Index"" report say they would not hire a worker without AI skills. Seventy-one percent even said they'd rather recruit a junior with strong AI skills than a more experienced candidate who doesn't know how to handle ChatGPT, for example. Many professionals have understood this and now clearly state on their LinkedIn profile that they have mastered popular AI tools, in the hope that this will attract the attention of recruiters. In this context, workers seem to have no choice but to jump on the AI bandwagon. Those who refuse to do so risk being overtaken, not by the technology itself, but rather by those who know how to use it. – AFP Relaxnews

Q&A with chief technologist
NEW YORK (AP) – Knowledge advantage can save lives, win wars and avert disaster. At the Central Intelligence Agency, basic artificial intelligence – machine learning and algorithms – has long served that mission. Now, generative AI is joining the effort.
CIA Director William Burns says AI tech will augment humans, not replace them. The agency’s first chief technology officer, Nand Mulchandani, is marshalling the tools. There’s considerable urgency: Adversaries are already spreading AI-generated deepfakes aimed at undermining US interests.
A former Silicon Valley CEO who helmed successful startups, Mulchandani was named to the job in 2022 after a stint at the Pentagon’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre.
Among agency projects: A ChatGPT-like generative AI application that draws on open-source data (meaning unclassified, public or commercially available). Thousands of analysts across the 18-agency US intelligence community use it. Other CIA projects that use large-language models are, unsurprisingly, secret.
This Associated Press interview with Mulchandani has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: You recently said generative AI should be treated like a “crazy, drunk friend.” Can you elaborate?
A: When these generative AI systems “hallucinate,” they can sometimes behave like your drunk friend at a bar who can say something that pushes you outside your normal conceptual boundary and sparks out-of-the box thinking. Remember that these AI-based systems are probabilistic in nature, so they are not precise (They are prone to fabrication). So for creative tasks like art, poetry, and painting these systems are excellent. But I wouldn’t yet use these systems for doing precise math or designing an airplane or skyscraper – in those activities “close enough” doesn’t work. They can also be biased and narrowly focused, which I call the “rabbit hole” problem.
Q: The only current use of a large-language model at enterprise scale I’m aware of at CIA is the open-source AI, called Osiris, that it created for the entire intelligence community. Is that correct?
A: That’s the only one we have disclosed publicly. It’s been an absolute home run for us. We should broaden the discussion beyond just LLMs though — as an example, we process huge amounts of foreign language content in multiple media types including video, and use other AI algorithms and tools to process that.
Q: The Special Competitive Studies Project, a high-powered advisory group focused on AI in national security, is out with a report saying US intelligence services must rapidly integrate generative AI — given its disruptive potential. It sets a two-year timeline for getting beyond experimentation and limited pilot projects and “deploying Gen AI tools at scale.” Do you agree?
A: CIA is all in 100 per cent on utilising these technologies and scaling them. We are taking this as seriously as we’re taking probably any technology issue. We think we’ve beaten the initial timeline by a big margin, as we’re already using Gen AI tools in production. The deeper answer is that we’re on the early side of a huge number of additional changes, and a large part of the work is to integrate the technology more widely into our applications and systems. These are early days.
Q: Can you name your large-language model partners?
A: I’m not sure naming the vendors is interesting right now. There is an explosion of LLMs available on the market now. As a smart customer, we are not tying our boat to a specific set of LLMs or a specific set of vendors. We are evaluating and using practically all the high-runner LLMs out there, both commercial-grade and open source. We are not viewing the LLM market as a singular one where a single lab is better than the others. As you’re noting in the market, models are leapfrogging one another with each new release.
Q: What are the most important use cases at CIA for large-language models?
A: Primary is summarisation. It’s impossible for an open-source analyst at CIA to digest the firehouse of media and other information we collect every day. So this has been a game-changer for insights into sentiment and global trends. Analysts then dig into specifics. They must be able — with full certainty — to annotate and explain data they cite and how they reach conclusions. Our tradecraft has not changed. The additional pieces give analysts much broader perspective – both the classified and open-source pieces we gather.
Q: What are the biggest challenges of adapting generative AI at the agency?
A: There isn’t a lot of cultural resistance internally. Our employees deal with AI on a daily basis competitively. Obviously, the whole world is on fire with these new technologies and the amazing productivity gains. The trick is grappling with constraints we have on information compartmentalisation and how systems are built. In many cases, the separation of data is not for security but legal reasons. How do we efficiently connect systems to get the benefits of AI while keeping all that intact? Some really interesting technologies are emerging to help us think this through – and combine data in ways that maintain encryption and privacy controls.
Q: Generative AI is currently about as sophisticated as an elementary school student. Intelligence work, by contrast, is for grown-ups. It’s all about trying to pierce an adversary’s deception. How does Gen AI fit into that work?
A: First, let’s emphasise that the human analyst has primacy. We have the world’s leading experts in their domains. And in many cases of incoming information, a huge amount of human judgment is involved to weigh its importance and significance – including of the individuals who may be providing it. We don’t have machines replicate any of that. And we’re not looking for computers to do the jobs of domain experts.
What we are looking at is the co-pilot model. We think Gen AI can have a huge impact in brainstorming, coming up with new ideas. And in boosting productivity – and insight. We have to be very deterministic about how we do it because, wielded properly, these algorithms are a force for good. But wielded incorrectly, they can really hurt you. – FRANK BAJAK
