It has been heralded by experts as a major breakthrough in the fight against the growing problem of drug resistance. A powerful algorithm was used to analyse more than one hundred million chemical compounds in a matter of days. The newly discovered compound was able to kill 35 types of potentially deadly bacteria, said researchers. Antibiotic-resistant infections have risen in recent years - up 9% in England between 2017 and 2018, to nearly 61,000.If antibiotics are taken inappropriately, harmful bacteria living inside the body can become resistant to them, which means the medicines may not work when really needed.Artificial intelligence apps, Parkinson's and meNHS to set up national artificial intelligence labThe World Health Organization (WHO) has called the phenomenon ""one of the biggest threats to global health security and development today"".'A new age'""In terms of antibiotic discovery, this is absolutely a first,"" said Regina Barzilay, a senior researcher on the project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).The discovery was made using an algorithm inspired by the architecture of the human brain. Scientists trained it to analyse the structure of 2,500 drugs and other compounds to find those with the most anti-bacterial qualities that could kill E. coli. They then selected around 100 candidates for physical testing before discovering halicin. ""I think this is one of the more powerful antibiotics that has been discovered to date,"" said James Collins, a bioengineer on the team at MIT. ""We wanted to develop a platform that would allow us to harness the power of artificial intelligence to usher in a new age of antibiotic drug discovery.""Dr Peter Bannister, chairman of the Institution of Engineering and Technology healthcare panel, said the method used was already ""well established"" within medical research. ""The same approach has gained popularity in the development of new therapeutics, such as pharmaceuticals and, in the case of this research, antibiotics where pattern recognition including deep learning can help sort through the vast numbers of molecules,"" he told the BBC. ""This paper goes beyond theoretical simulation and presents pre-clinical results, which are essential along with subsequent clinical trials to clearly demonstrate the efficacy and safety of these new 'AI discovered' drugs.""Since 2014, the UK has cut the number of antibiotics it uses by more than 7%, but the number of drug-resistant bloodstream infections increased by 35% from 2013 to 2017.Researchers added that the use of the machine to accelerate drug discovery could help bring down the cost of generating more antibiotics in future.

Artificial intelligence makes a splash in efforts to protect Alaska’s ice seals and beluga whales

When Erin Moreland set out to become a research zoologist, she envisioned days spent sitting on cliffs, drawing seals and other animals to record their lives for efforts to understand their activities and protect their habitats.
Instead, Moreland found herself stuck in front of a computer screen, clicking through thousands of aerial photographs of sea ice as she scanned for signs of life in Alaskan waters. It took her team so long to sort through each survey — akin to looking for lone grains of rice on vast mounds of sand — that the information was outdated by the time it was published.
“There’s got to be a better way to do this,” she recalls thinking. “Scientists should be freed up to contribute more to the study of animals and better understand what challenges they might be facing. Having to do something this time-consuming holds them back from what they could be accomplishing.”

That better way is now here — an idea that began, unusually enough, with the view from Moreland’s Seattle office window and her fortuitous summons to jury duty. She and her fellow National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists now will use artificial intelligence this spring to help monitor endangered beluga whales, threatened ice seals, polar bears and more, shaving years off the time it takes to get data into the right hands to protect the animals.
The teams are training AI tools to distinguish a seal from a rock and a whale’s whistle from a dredging machine’s squeak as they seek to understand the marine mammals’ behavior and help them survive amid melting ice and increasing human activity.
Moreland’s project combines AI technology with improved cameras on a NOAA turboprop airplane that will fly over the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska this April and May, scanning and classifying the imagery to produce a population count of ice seals and polar bears that will be ready in hours instead of months. Her colleague Manuel Castellote, a NOAA affiliate scientist, will apply a similar algorithm to the recordings he’ll pick up from equipment scattered across the bottom of Alaska’s Cook Inlet, helping him quickly decipher how the shrinking population of endangered belugas spent its winter.
The data will be confirmed by scientists, analyzed by statisticians and then reported to people such as Jon Kurland, NOAA’s assistant regional administrator for protected resources in Alaska.

Then they bring it onboard to download the data before guiding the equipment back down to the ocean floor, where it will listen for another six months.

Kurland’s office in Juneau is charged with overseeing conservation and recovery programs for marine mammals around the state and its waters and helping guide all the federal agencies that issue permits or carry out actions that could affect those that are threatened or endangered.
Of the four types of ice seals in the Bering Sea — bearded, ringed, spotted and ribbon — the first two are classified as threatened, meaning they are likely to become in danger of extinction within the foreseeable future. The Cook Inlet beluga whales are already endangered, having steadily declined to a population of only 279 in last year’s survey, from an estimate of about a thousand 30 years ago.
Individual groups of beluga whales are isolated and don’t breed with others or leave their home, “so if this population goes extinct, no one else will come in; they’re gone forever,” says Castellote. “Other belugas wouldn’t survive there because they don’t know the environment. So you’d lose that biodiversity forever.”
Yet recommendations by Kurland’s office to help mitigate the impact of human activities such as construction and transportation, in part by avoiding prime breeding and feeding periods and places, are hampered by a lack of timely data.
“There’s basic information that we just don’t have now, so getting it will give us a much clearer picture of the types of responses that may be needed to protect these populations,” Kurland says. “In both cases, for the whales and seals, this kind of data analysis is cutting-edge science, filling in gaps we don’t have another way to fill.”

The AI project was born years ago, when Moreland would sit at her computer in NOAA’s Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle and look across Lake Washington toward Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. She felt sure there was a technological solution to her frustration, but she didn’t know anyone with the right skills to figure it out. 
She hit the jackpot one week while serving on a jury in 2018. She overheard two fellow jurors discussing AI during a break in the trial, so she began talking with them about her work. One of them connected her with Dan Morris from Microsoft’s AI for Earth program, who suggested they pitch the problem as a challenge that summer at the company’s Hackathon, a week-long competition when software developers, programmers, engineers and others collaborate on projects. Fourteen Microsoft engineers signed up to work on the problem.
“Across the wildlife conservation universe, there are tons of scientists doing boring things, reviewing images and audio,” Morris says. “Remote equipment lets us collect all kinds of data, but scientists have to figure out how to use that data. Spending a year annotating images is not only a bad use of their time, but the questions get answered way later than they should.”
Moreland’s idea wasn’t as simple as it may sound, though. While there are plenty of models to recognize people in images, there were none — until now — that could find seals, especially real-time in aerial photography. But the hundreds of thousands of examples NOAA scientists had classified in previous surveys helped technologists, who are using them to train the AI models to recognize which photographs and recordings contained mammals and which didn’t.
“Part of the challenge was that there were 20 terabytes of data of pictures of ice, and working on your laptop with that much data isn’t practical,” says Morris. “We had daily handovers of hard drives between Seattle and Redmond to get this done. But the cloud makes it possible to work with all that data and train AI models, so that’s how we’re able to do this work, with Azure.”
Can you spot the seals in this aerial photograph (left)? Look at the thermal image (right), and then back at the photo — can you even see them now? This is what AI will help NOAA scientists sort through. (Photo provided by NOAA, from a survey of Alaska’s Kotzebue Sound, where the ice had melted, forcing the seals closer together than normal.)
Moreland’s first ice seal survey was in 2007, flying in a helicopter based on an icebreaker. Scientists collected 90,000 images and spent months scanning them but only found 200 seals. It was a tedious, imprecise process.
Ice seals live largely solitary lives, making them harder to spot than animals that live in groups. Surveys are also complicated because the aircraft have to fly high enough to keep seals from getting scared and diving, but low enough to get high-resolution photos that enable scientists to differentiate a ring seal from a spotted seal, for example. The weather in Alaska — often rainy and cloudy — further complicates efforts.
Subsequent surveys improved by pairing thermal and color cameras and using modified planes that had a greater range to study more area and could fly higher up to be quieter. Even so, thermal interference from dirty ice and reflections off jumbled ice made it difficult to determine what was an animal and what wasn’t.
And then there was the problem of manpower to go along with all the new data. The 2016 survey produced a million pairs of thermal and color images, which a previous software system narrowed down to 316,000 hot spots that the scientists had to manually sort through and classify. It took three people six months.

When Moreland told colleagues about the AI project, she discovered that Castellote faced a similar obstacle.
Castellote and his team spend months every year classifying logs of the sound files they’ve collected to determine whether a noise is perhaps ice shifting, a ship passing, an airplane overhead, or a whale calling — and if the latter, if it’s a beluga, humpback or killer whale. (Photo by Daniela Huson with Ocean Conservation Research)
Each spring and fall, Castellote flies from Seattle to Anchorage, takes a boat out, retrieves microphones from 15 spots around the bottom of Cook Inlet, downloads the data and puts the equipment back. He and his team spend the rest of the year trying to classify each sound from the previous six months, determining which whistles and calls are from beluga, humpback or killer whales, which roars are from a plane or a ship, and which thumps are from construction or cracking ice. 
That doesn’t leave him with much time for analysis, such as trying to interpret how the whales are communicating.
Whales operate on sound, using echo location to get around, especially in Cook Inlet, where sediment from melting glaciers makes the water murky and where it’s too dark most of the year for eyes to be useful. That means noise — which is amplified under water — can disorient the mammals, leaving them unable to find the ocean floor or surface, follow their pod, catch prey or be alerted to the presence of a predator such as a killer whale.
If calves can’t hear their mothers’ clicks and whistles, for example, they can get separated and die.
“Human noise could be masking key signals the whales use to find food and each other, which could affect reproduction, and if you can’t eat, mate or reproduce, then you can’t increase the population,” says Castellote. “So we think noise is a big issue, and we’re focusing on that.”
The problem is that Anchorage is an important hub for cargo ships and for military and commercial flights. The port is expanding, which requires piles to be driven down for new docks. There are 17 oil rigs with accompanying pipelines in Cook Inlet, he says, and the deposits from glaciers require continual dredging to keep shipping channels open. Each of those activities creates noise that drowns out the whales’ whistles and calls. So Castellote aims to give Kurland’s group data on how the whales’ habitat use overlaps with human noise, helping guide mitigation measures to make human activity less detrimental to the endangered animals. The agency might work to minimize vessel activity near prime feeding areas or to reduce construction noise in certain spots during breeding season, for example.
Working with Microsoft, Castellote had a robust set of algorithms by last fall that showed a 99 percent match to the logs his team had previously classified manually. And the group is developing new technology that will make the process even more efficient.
As climate change allows human activity to move further north, Castellote’s work will help guide protective measures for other populations of whales that could be introduced to the same types of noise in the next decade or two, he says.
“The Cook Inlet belugas are a very small population that’s concentrated near the biggest human population in Alaska, so that development-related activity can be a threat,” Kurland says. “The seals are more broadly distributed over a larger area with less human activity, and are mainly threatened by climate change,” which is harder to mitigate.

The seals being surveyed rely on ice floes to breed, nurse their pups and go through their annual molt, a process that replaces their coats each spring. Ribbon seals rarely ever go ashore — when the ice melts each summer, they just swim around in the Arctic Ocean until the floes form again in the fall. So there’s nowhere that global warming is having a more pronounced impact than the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, Morris says.
Studying the population data and distribution of the seals over time will provide a first step in understanding how they’re coping with a changing environment and what they need, Moreland says.

“We’re living in a changing time, and we need all the players we can get to protect our resources,” says Tom Gray, a tribal representative who hunts Eastern Bering Sea belugas with nets and has used his knowledge to help Castellote’s team catch the endangered Cook Inlet whales briefly to attach sensors with suction cups.
When Gray was growing up in Nome, Alaska, “there were no ships going past us toward the Northwest Passage. Now there are hundreds a year and it’s projected that before long there will be a thousand,” he says.
“Alaska has beluga whales, moose, caribou, all these unique animals, and it’s like a mystique, something we talk about and love, and we’re right in the middle of it,” he says.
But amid the increased development and the whales’ persistent struggles, and despite scientists’ efforts over the past few decades, “I don’t think our people have the tools to keep these populations healthy. We’re losing the battle, and once they’re gone, it’s over. We need scientists and innovators to protect these animals so we don’t lose them.”

Creating an AI-Savvy Workforce for a Strong Future




Feb 21, 2020


Defense & Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence


To strengthen America's up-and-coming workforce and future economy, MITRE is working to integrate lessons on artificial intelligence (AI) into college courses across a broad range of fields—from the sciences to the arts.









""China and other countries are investing heavily in developing artificial intelligence [AI] expertise,"" says MITRE's Michael Balazs. ""The United States has to do likewise to stay competitive in the international arena.""
To keep the nation competitive in this increasingly influential arena, MITRE's working to create an AI-savvy workforce—starting at the college level—through an initiative known as Generation AI Nexus(link is external) (Gen AI). Our Gen AI instructional design team works with professors to integrate lessons on AI into their courses.
The Gen AI team recently worked with professors at Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, to introduce AI-inspired lessons in two very different disciplines—healthcare and fashion merchandising.
Balazs leads the Gen AI initiative. The idea, he says, is to expose every student—regardless of their field of study—to AI multiple times in their academic journey. ""We're not only trying to create a talent pool around AI, we're also working to ensure that everyone in the workforce has an awareness of AI and how it might be applied in their field.""
Computer systems now perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. They permeate our daily existence. Companies use AI to track and predict our preferences and then create targeted advertising. Apple's Siri uses machine learning (a subset of AI) to improve the software's ability to respond to our questions. And driver-assistance systems like automatic braking are showing up in newer-model cars.
""The premise is that if we really want to shift the entire economy—not just an industry—we need to educate everyone who's going to be part of that economy,"" Balazs says.
Given a McKinsey & Company prediction that there will be a shortfall of up to 250,000 data scientists in the United States in a decade, the need for these scientists is clear.
Getting a Look at AI's Analytical Powers
MITRE launched Gen AI in May 2018. Since then, we've partnered with colleges and universities nationwide to incorporate AI lessons(link is external) into their courses. We then make those lessons available to other schools wishing to use them.
Our partnership with Marymount University demonstrates how we work with professors to create lessons that meet their objectives. 
Uma Kelekar, professor of healthcare management, wanted a lesson that would help nursing and business students learn how AI could be used to test hypotheses and evaluate relationships between different data factors. Kelekar chose to focus on patient visits to the Emergency Department (ED) and the factors that may lead to the prescription of opioids.
Since pain is one of the major conditions ED patients exhibit, researchers have begun exploring how the prescription of pain-relieving drugs to these patients may be contributing to the nation's opioid epidemic, an issue MITRE is also researching and working to address.
The lesson-planning process was a collaborative effort among Kelekar and Gen AI team members Joe Garner(link is external), an instructional designer, and Ali Zaidi(link is external), a data scientist.
""We work together to decide what the students need to learn, how it will be taught, and how learning will be measured,"" Garner explains. ""It's known as 'backward design,' because you design instruction with the end in mind. Once we identify the desired outcome, we decide where the lesson best fits into the curriculum, help the instructor engage students, and determine if the learning occurred.""
Among the hypotheses Kelekar wanted to test: Did prescription patterns vary with the level of pain the patient reported? Did they vary by gender? Were private-pay patients more likely to receive medication prescriptions than publicly funded ones?
Zaidi ran analyses to test those hypotheses and created graphic depictions of the results.
""The visualizations were very helpful,"" Kelekar says. ""They made it easier for the students to see relationships among the variables—such as how opioid prescription correlated with reported pain levels, gender, ethnicity, or the number of chronic conditions the patient is dealing with.""
Applying AI to Fashion Merchandising Strategies
Across campus, fashion merchandising professor Jennifer Yang and data science professor Nathan Green combined their expertise to incorporate lessons on AI into Yang's fashion research and forecasting course.
Yang needed lessons that would help her students understand that fashion merchandising is not merely a subjective exercise. ""I wanted them to see that there's a data-driven way to conduct product research, and that AI can be very helpful in informing any decisions or recommendations they might make. They may never have to actually crunch the numbers, but they do have to be able to interpret them.""
She and Green explored factors that may correlate to higher sales or ratings of women's shoes. Using his own data science expertise, Green captured and organized data on 500 shoes from a popular online merchandiser's site. Zaidi then prepared the data for analysis, programmed machine-learning models to perform that analysis, and created visualizations of the model's outputs for the students to use.
""We basically said, 'These are the outputs of the data analysis. What conclusions would you draw from this information?'"" Green adds. ""By engaging in that process, I think the students developed basic data analysis skills.""
""I love this project because it demonstrates the value of AI for students who are in non-data science disciplines,"" Zaidi says. ""If they can become familiar with how AI works now, they'll be much better equipped to do their jobs—and more competitive in their field.""
""I think everyone wants to do cross-discipline work, but getting it started can be difficult,"" Green says.  ""MITRE's curriculum development expertise helps bridge the gap between technical and non-technical fields.""
Spreading the Learning Through Gen AI
As an organization that works in the public interest, one of our goals is to make the Gen AI lessons broadly available.
""We're compiling the lesson plans, the code, the data sets, the visualizations, the machine-learning models we developed—everything—so that professors from participating schools wishing to use or adapt the lessons will have what they need to teach them in their own classrooms,"" Zaidi explains.
""As Gen AI spreads and grows in the coming years, we're hoping these lessons will become a resource for students and teachers across the country.

Data Snapshot: Men Far More Confident About Benefits of Artificial Intelligence Than Women
















Artificial Intelligence has crept from the pages of mid-century sci-fi stories into the very mainstream of American culture – especially in the workplace. For decades now, workers have speculated about how (and when) AI will affect their own job futures: Will automation replace the need for humans, or will the AI be used in ways that will actually aid humans in their jobs, increasing efficiency all around? We asked employees, “Do you think the benefits of Artificial Intelligence will outweigh the potential risks?”
The info comes from the latest reading of an ongoing study by Comparably. Over 1,000 employees responded to the question.
Men are considerably more confident that the benefits of AI will outweigh any potential risks than women are. The gulf between genders on this question, at 16%, is notable. Speculation here would be largely reckless, but it may be that men are generally more encouraged towards futurist notions than women in our society. Men, in charge of much of the nation’s industry, may be more interested in researching the eventual positive benefits of AI on their processes.

Among ethnicities, Asian/Pacific Islanders are the most assured that AI will bring about good things for society. That segment was nearly as positive as overall male scores above. Caucasians, Hispanic/Latinos, and respondents from the “other” designation were generally more positive than overall women – but African-Americans, who may feel disenfranchised in a overall fashion similar to females – are less convinced.


Workers in Engineering are the most optimistic about AI’s effects on their jobs and the future. This makes some sense, as employees in that department may have some level of hands-on experience with AI. IT also voted with confidence for AI. On the other end, workers in the Legal department were much less sure about AI’s benefits than nearly any other group queried. Other departments that depend on human interaction, like Sales and Customer Support, also seemed unsure about what benefits the technology would bring. They may also fear AI encroaching on their jobs.

There isn’t much notable variety among different age groups in terms of responses to this question about Artificial Intelligence. There is a notable spike in positivity about AI for the 46-50 age group – that segment may have been coming of age in the workplace just as AI was becoming a reality.

With education, fears about AI decrease. Those with Master’s Degrees are far more confident that AI will benefit society than those with just a high school degree. Again, this may amount to those holding more advanced degrees having a more assured sense that their jobs are not eventually going to be threatened by automation.
While men overall are more secure about the future of AI than women, in certain departments the opposite is true. In Business Development and Communications, women are more positive about AI’s influence.

While we spend our days innovating our designs, our tools are being innovated beyond what we ever imagined. With the drive for practical artificial intelligence embedded in our workflows, how we work may look quite different even just a few years from now.
While many professionals are wary of AI as it may steal their job, a report from the University of Oxford places Engineering and Science professions as the least threatened industries by AI. In fact, most studies point to engineers experiencing great benefits from the rise of AI tools. Bionic hands and laser rust removal, the best of IE this week

AI and machine learning will replace jobs that we know about today, but because it brings new capabilities, it will open up new industries and new jobs that aren’t even on the modern engineer’s radar. Low value and meaningless jobs currently in place will get automated away. It will allow you to spend more time on better decisions.
RELATED: 13 FREE SITES TO GET AN INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING
No matter whether you have adopted machine learning technologies and in the grander picture, artificial intelligence, most engineers recognize that a change is coming. It would seem a natural fit to incorporate artificial intelligence into CAD, into our workflows, into our engineering. This not only facilitates our forward growth as engineers, but it gives us the ability to design with complexities never before possible.
Remaining at the top of our engineering game is no easy task when the game is constantly innovating with new technologies. To remain relevant as engineers, we must understand – even predict – how machine learning and AI will change the game and adapt before we are left in the dust.
The rise of advanced engineering
AI is the next platform. The world’s top minds affirm it. Engineering innovation directs it. Now it’s the time to get on board. All of this can be scary to face as an engineer. How we engineer has shifted over the years as CAD evolved from 2D into 3D and now into a 3D design hub. In essence, CAD has shifted from a supplementary tool to engineers into now a fundamental tool of how we work. If we examine the trend of AI close enough, we can begin to see how the solidification of CAD into our daily workflow isn’t too different from what might happen with AI implementation.
Much like additive manufacturing in the past, AI implementation has been surrounded by a decent amount of hype. As engineers, we’re naturally skeptical when one innovation or technology is broadcasted as the “cure-all” to the future. Even with the hype around AI in the past, current trends place practical AI and machine learning tools right in the laps of engineers and technology leaders.

Generative design, simulation improvements, sensors, and big data design optimization – all of these areas of engineering are at the forefront of being significantly impacted by AI technologies. All of these advanced engineering technologies have the ability to impact us as engineers and our profession as a whole in 3 main ways.
Job Evolution – Every innovation in the past has created a new sector of work and research. Our modern model of technological and often, digital innovation has AI at the leading edge. This means that as engineers, the way we do our jobs and even the areas we work in may shift as the needs of the industry adapt to coming tools. Our workflows will evolve in a micro-perspective as artificial intelligence infiltrates how we design. In the macro-perspective, new industries will be created that existing engineers will need to flow into.
Capability Improvement – AI and machine learning tools bring drastic capabilities to the engineer relative to what we are capable of on our own. Through organic latticing tools, we have weight-saving capabilities like never before possible. With generative design, we can explore design options that never would have been an option. As these tools slowly are implemented into our CAD tools and engineering system, our capabilities as engineers will only be expanded.
Design and Data Management – Perhaps the most impactful aspect of AI innovation in engineering is just how it will affect our workflow management. AI extends far beyond the design process and stretches into data management. In the bigger picture, we arrive at the Internet of Things. AI will surely help us manage our designs and improve interoperability, but it will also break down barriers between departments – between tasks. 
Through AI programs managing big data, we will be able to seamlessly integrate manufacturing and design with cloud computing, smart machines, and real-time monitoring. AI can and will take on much of the supervisory side of engineering, allowing us to perform our jobs better. We can understand this idea as a whole by realizing that low-value tasks of today will now be automated, allowing us as engineers to focus our energy into higher-value areas.
Artificial intelligence will help us manage our engineering data efficiently, effectively ushering in Industry 4.0. It solves the problem of big data and makes other engineering advancements more manageable. Advanced engineering, the future of making things, in large part hinges on the implementation of AI into engineering. 
How do we adapt?
All of this advancement sounds great in the grand scheme of things, but adapting to these changing workflows is easier said than done. The beginning of the adaption and adoption process for these new technologies begins with refining how each directly impacts our lives and jobs as engineers.
Machine learning is a big player in engineering innovation right now, simply because it presents the greatest opportunity for further innovation. Machine learning surely brings job evolution. If computers and systems have the ability to learn over time, then they can optimize and conduct many tasks that we execute on a daily basis. Machine learning inherently improves our capabilities as it leverages computer learning on our own.
RELATED: MACHINE LEARNING HELPS OUT CITIZEN SCIENTISTS
Lastly, machine learning greatly impacts how we manage designs and product creation. Our entire workflow from job definition to job application can be or is already being impacted by machine learning tools. To adapt, we must embrace the changes that are already here and predict the changes that will come. For machine learning specifically, we can start getting comfortable with altering our workflows alongside computers. By doing so, we place ourselves far ahead of our competition. 
Industry 4.0 and the rise of connectivity is another poignant AI trend that is making strides in the engineering profession. It evolves our jobs by eliminating the need for constant oversight during production and creates new industries for data application. The Internet of Things improves our capability to collect and manage data through a web of AI tools and physical sensors. 
These new tools that allow us to gather data result in a significant increase in the knowledge available to us. AI and Industry 4.0 as a whole seek to help manage and apply these new tools. All of this data collection and smart management done automatically through computers finally makes the management of our designs and production thereafter, an effortless task. 
Adapting to the next generation of the industry will surely be hard for nearly every engineering profession, but the steps we can take today are clear. Embracing the cloud in engineering presents the most consequential impact. By trusting big data and cloud management of our engineering, we can become experts in the core technologies Industry 4.0 builds on.
Generative design is the last significant innovation in current AI that impacts engineers. In many senses, we have already had first-hand glimpses of this technology in our simulation and CAD tools. It evolves how we perform our jobs by allowing us to simulate and design better, which twofold improves our capabilities. 
The influence of generative design on our design management is seen in how we will begin the design process and handle the design revision process. Of all the technologies we’ve discussed, Generative design tools are perhaps the most real to you and me as engineers. To prepare for the further growth of this capability, we must accept and experiment with the tools already out there. In doing so, we become more prepared than the significant portion of engineers who haven’t used generative design before.

Adopting and adapting to innovations in artificial intelligence within engineering positions you to perform at the top of your game. Innovation will continue whether we are on board or not, and now is the time to board the train early.RECOMMENDED ARTICLES

But registrations for the gathering this week topped 1,100, and now there's now a waiting list. The city's largest employers, including UPS, Humana, GE Appliances and Norton Healthcare, are sending information technology directors, software developers, data scientists and analysts to the fifth annual summit. Several college and K-12 educators, as well as workforce and nonprofit leaders from Louisville, Lexington and Southern Indiana, have reserved spots, said Sarah Ehresman, the agency's director of labor market intelligence.Related:Free Code Louisville classes get reboot after program scores new fundingThere's no question why AI and automation are huge now, said Aaron Peabody, lead data scientist at Untitled Firm, a Louisville startup. ""The implications of this technology are massive because it will eventually be the technology, and it is not going away,"" Peabody said. With co-workers, he will demonstrate the firm's work at a tech showcase during the event at the downtown Kentucky International Convention Center.Local experts delving into AI say the technology is evolving quickly, but most of it involves crunching huge chunks of data — for instance, health care metrics on fragile patients who are released from hospitals.It's used to make predictions about problems a patient will encounter and to help doctors and providers identify more proactive ways to get an ill person back to better health.At Norton Healthcare, AI is used to help detect patients at risk for developing potentially deadly sepsis infections and for evaluating patients at higher risk for opioid addiction, among other uses, according to Dr. Steven T. Hester, system chief medical officer.""A lot of what gets lumped under AI is not AI,"" said Ben Reno-Weber, director of the local Microsoft Future of Work Initiative. Many companies do advanced data analytics, he said, but the next step, programming a machine to ""think"" in new and novel ways to complete tasks, is the holy grail in AI.ICYMI:Beshear signs bill requiring school resource officers to carry gunsAt the summit, two keynote addresses will feature Microsoft's Jacky Wright, chief digital officer and corporate vice president; and IBM's Jonathan Arneault, North America software as a service director, with University of Louisville President Neeli Bendapudi.Several panel discussions will focus on the kinds of workplaces and jobs likely to be most impacted by AI, how to use AI to solve business challenges and how AI and other technologies will reshape work in the future.  Reno-Weber said Louisville is building a robust data community, with more professionals handling predictive analytics. U of L, for instance, will soon have 68 graduates in its Master of Business Administration in business analytics.Other colleges, he added, are considering adding undergraduate degrees in the field.The interest this year from educators has increased significantly because they're searching for ""how to build a workforce whose skills are aligned with industry,"" Reno-Weber said.For details on the conference, see eventbrite.com/e/tomorrows-talent-ai-the-future-of-work-tickets-76803522403.See also:Louisville's historic Seelbach Hotel plans 11-story tower, big redoGrace Schneider: 502-582-4082; gschneider@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @gesinfk.

We’re focusing on Generation Z, which is facing challenges from changing curriculums and new technology to financial aid gaps and homelessness.MANCHESTER, N.H. — Cruising to class in her driverless car, a student crams from notes projected on the inside of the windshield while she gestures with her hands to shape a 3-D holographic model of her architecture project.It looks like science fiction, an impression reinforced by the fact that it is being demonstrated in virtual reality in an ultramodern space with overstuffed pillows for seats. But this scenario is based on technology already in development.The setting is the Sandbox ColLABorative, the innovation arm of Southern New Hampshire University, on the fifth floor of a downtown building with panoramic views of the sprawling red brick mills that date from this city’s 19th-century industrial heyday.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt is one of a small but growing number of places where experts are testing new ideas that will shape the future of a college education, using everything from blockchain networks to computer simulations to artificial intelligence, or A.I.Theirs is not a future of falling enrollment, financial challenges and closing campuses. It’s a brighter world in which students subscribe to rather than enroll in college, learn languages in virtual reality foreign streetscapes with avatars for conversation partners, have their questions answered day or night by A.I. teaching assistants and control their own digital transcripts that record every life achievement.The possibilities for advances such as these are vast. The structure of higher education as it is still largely practiced in America is as old as those Manchester mills, based on a calendar that dates from a time when students had to go home to help with the harvest, and divided into academic disciplines on physical campuses for 18- to 24-year-olds.ImageA meeting in the kitchen area of the Sandbox CoLABorative at Southern New Hampshire University, “One of the most important things we do here is disprove and dismantle ideas,” said William Zemp, the university’s chief strategy and innovation officer.Credit...SNHUUniversities may be at the cutting edge of research into almost every other field, said Gordon Jones, founding dean of the Boise State University College of Innovation and Design. But when it comes to reconsidering the structure of their own, he said, “they’ve been very risk-averse.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTNow, however, squeezed by the demands of employers and students — especially the up and coming Generation Z — and the need to attract new customers, some schools, such as Boise State and Southern New Hampshire University, are starting labs to come up with improvements to help people learn more effectively, match their skills with jobs and lower their costs.More than 200 have added senior executives whose titles include the words “digital” or “innovation,” the consulting firm Entangled Solutions found; many were recruited from the corporate and tech sectors. M.I.T. has set up a multimillion-dollar fund to pay for faculty to experiment with teaching innovations.Some colleges and universities are collaborating on such ideas in groups including the University Innovation Alliance and the Marvel Universe-worthy HAIL Storm — it stands for Harvesting Academic Innovation for Learners — a coalition of academic innovation labs.If history is a guide, the flashiest notions being developed in workshops in these places won’t get far. University campuses are like archaeological digs of innovations that didn’t fulfill their promises. Even though the biggest leap forward of the last few decades, for example — delivering courses online — appears to have lowered costs, the graduation rates of online higher education remain much lower than those of programs taught in person.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“One of the most important things we do here is disprove and dismantle ideas,” said William Zemp, chief strategy and innovation officer at Southern New Hampshire University.“There’s so much white noise out there, you have to be sort of a myth buster.”But some ambitious concepts are already being tested.College by SubscriptionOne of these would transform the way students pay for higher education. Instead of enrolling, for example, they might subscribe to college; for a monthly fee, they could take whatever courses they want, when they want, with long-term access to advising and career help.The Georgia Institute of Technology is one of the places mulling a subscription model, said Richard DeMillo, director of its Center for 21st Century Universities. It would include access to a worldwide network of mentors and advisers and “whatever someone needs to do to improve their professional situation or acquire a new skill or get feedback on how things are going.”Boise State is already piloting this concept. Its Passport to Education costs $425 a month for six credit hours or $525 for nine in either of two online bachelor’s degree programs. That’s 30 percent cheaper than the in-state, in-person tuition.Paying by the month encourages students to move faster through their educations, and most are projected to graduate in 18 months, Mr. Jones said. The subscription model has attracted 47 students so far, he said, with another 94 in the application process.However they pay for it, future students could find other drastic changes in the way their educations are delivered.ImageDakota Kimble, a student in Boise State University's Games, Interactive Media and Mobile Technology program, demonstrating a virtual reality tool developed for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game to teach hunters how to field-dress big game.Credit...Alex Hecht for The New York TimesYour Teacher Is a RobotGeorgia Tech has been experimenting with a virtual teaching assistant named Jill Watson, built on the Jeopardy-winning IBM Watson supercomputer platform. This A.I. answers questions in a discussion forum alongside human teaching assistants; students often can’t distinguish among them, their professor says. More Jill Watsons could help students get over hurdles they encounter in large or online courses. The university is working next on developing virtual tutors, which it says could be viable in two to five years.S.N.H.U., in a collaboration with the education company Pearson, is testing A.I. grading. Barnes & Noble Education already has an A.I. writing tool called bartleby write, named for the clerk in the Herman Melville short story, that corrects grammar, punctuation and spelling, searches for plagiarism and helps create citations.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt Arizona State University, A.I. is being used to watch for signs that A.S.U. Online students might be struggling, and to alert their academic advisers.“If we could catch early signals, we could go to them much earlier and say, ‘Hey you’re still in the window’ ” to pass, said Donna Kidwell, chief technology officer of the university’s digital teaching and learning lab, EdPlus.Another harbinger of things to come sits on a hillside near the Hudson River in upstate New York, where an immersion lab with 15-foot walls and a 360-degree projection system transports Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute language students to China, virtually.The students learn Mandarin Chinese by conversing with A.I. avatars that can recognize not only what they say but their gestures and expressions, all against a computer-generated backdrop of Chinese street markets, restaurants and other scenes.Julian Wong, a mechanical engineering major in the first group of students to go through the program, “thought it would be cheesy.” In fact, he said, “It’s definitely more engaging, because you’re actively involved with what’s going on.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStudents in the immersion lab mastered Mandarin about twice as fast as their counterparts in conventional classrooms, said Shirley Ann Jackson, the president of Rensselaer.Dr. Jackson, a physicist, was not surprised. The students enrolling in college now “grew up in a digital environment,” she said. “Why not use that to actually engage them?”Slightly less sophisticated simulations are being used in schools of education, where trainee teachers practice coping with simulated schoolchildren. Engineering students at the University of Michigan use an augmented-reality track to test autonomous vehicles in simulated traffic.A Transcript for LifeThe way these kinds of learning get documented is also about to change. A race is underway to create a lifelong transcript.Most academic transcripts omit work or military histories, internships, apprenticeships and other relevant experience. And course names such as Biology 301 or Business 102 reveal little about what students have actually learned.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The learner, the learning provider and the employer all are speaking different languages that don’t interconnect,” said Michelle Weise, chief innovation officer at the Strada Institute for the Future of Work.A proposed solution: the “interoperable learning record,” or I.L.R. (proof that, even in the future, higher education will be rife with acronyms and jargon).The I.L.R. would list the specific skills that people have learned — customer service, say, or project management — as opposed to which courses they passed and majors they declared. And it would include other life experiences they accumulated.This “digital trail” would remain in the learner’s control to share with prospective employers and make it easier for a student to transfer academic credits earned at one institution to another.American universities, colleges and work force training programs are now awarding at least 738,428 unique credentials, according to a September analysis by a nonprofit organization called Credential Engine, which has taken on the task of translating these into a standardized registry of skills.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTUnlike transcripts, I.L.R.s could work in two directions. Not only could prospective employees use them to look for jobs requiring the skills they have; employers could comb through them to find prospective hires with the skills they need. “We’re trying to live inside this whole preindustrial design and figure out how we interface with technology to take it further,” said Dr. Kidwell of Arizona State. “Everybody is wrangling with trying to figure out which of these experiments are really going to work.”This story was produced in collaboration with The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.A version of this article appears in print on Feb. 23, 2020, Section L, Page 4 of the New York edition with the headline: Glimpses Into Education’s Future.

Dr. Arisa Ema is a Project Assistant Professor at the University of Tokyo and a Visiting Researcher at RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project in Japan. She is an academic in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) ethics and governance. She leads and participates in various initiatives in Japan and abroad, working to ensure responsible use of AI that is inclusive and beneficial for all. Dr. Ema will visit APF Canada on February 28, 2020 to talk about her work. She posts regular updates on her blog. 
Q1. Could you tell us a bit about yourself?
As an academic, my area is Science and Technology Studies (STS), with an interest in how we can organize an inclusive and diverse community through technology, which has naturally led to my academic and public engagement with the topic of artificial intelligence (AI).

Besides my academic work, I am involved in various AI ethics and policy initiatives. I am a board member of the Japan Deep Learning Association (JDLA), chairing the JDLA Public Affairs Committee, and also a member of the Ethics Committee of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence (JSAI), which released the JSAI Ethical Guidelines in 2017. The ethics committee was established after JSAI’s journal cover design evoked controversy on gender issues in 2014. Prompted by this incident, my colleagues and I established an interdisciplinary group called Acceptable Intelligence with Responsibility (AIR) to discuss emerging issues on AI and society. As an international group, AIR wrote a technology assessment report for the National Diet (Japan’s Parliament) Library, providing research on AI for legislative affairs. Currently, I’m organizing a medical AI seminar with my colleagues and promoting international collaborations on AI governance and ethics. And there are many other initiatives in which I am participating. Also, my recent book introduces how various stakeholders talk about AI in their own words.

Q2. AI and Society in Japan: What is happening in this space today? 
Japan started a discussion on AI governance and ethics quite early. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) organized a committee, of which I was a member, to develop the AI R&D Guidelines that were released in 2017. Culminating from inter-governmental and multi-stakeholder discussions, the Social Principles of Human-Centric AI was later released by the Cabinet Secretariat in February 2019.
While industries also began discussions on AI governance and ethics, two incidents in 2019 caught the public attention. First, there was a scandal in August involving a recruitment management company selling users’ and students’ data to client companies. The second incident occurred in November, where the Project Associate Professor at the University of Tokyo (a director of an AI company) tweeted racist opinions regarding the company’s recruitment policy and claimed his discriminatory comments were created by machine learning. These incidents raised social concerns about machine learning. In response, three machine learning academic communities released the Statement on Machine Learning and Fairness in December, declaring that (1) machine learning is nothing more than a tool to assist human decision making, and (2) machine learning researchers are committed to improving fairness in society by studying the possible uses of machine learning. As such, we have recently seen increased interest and activities on AI and society in Japan.
Q3. What is unique about Japan’s attitude towards AI? 
Japan’s AI research community developed in the 1980s during the second AI boom – when academics engaged not only real life applications but also with more philosophical questions about human nature and intelligence rather than real life applications. Therefore, except for the new members who joined this research field in mid-to-late 2010s, the academic community’s researchers are more interested in scientific and philosophical investigation on human intelligence. In addition, Japan is rich in animation and comic contents that consider AI/robots as part of society, which have generated unique discussions on AI as well.
Currently, there is a controversy over an AI system that reproduces new performances of a singer, Hibari Misora – who passed away 30 years ago. Also, a new AI project has been launched to create a new story and characters of the late Osamu Tezuka, the creator of Astro Boy. Calling back the deceased and adding new features raises not only legal, but also ethical and social issues. We are witnessing similar discussions around the world, and the ethics committee of JSAI will organize asymposium on this issue by inviting relevant people behind AI Hibari Misora and AI Osamu Tezuka in June 2020.
Q4. You travel around the world for your work. What excites and worries you the most about what is happening in Japan compared to the world? 
I am currently on a liaison committee on organizing the 2nd Japanese-German-French Symposium on Artificial Intelligence in November 2020. Compared to the Western countries, I feel the social interest on topics related to AI is more focused on economic innovation in Japan, and focus on inclusion and sustainability is still weak, although inclusion and sustainability are considered as ‘Basic Philosophy’ in Social Principles of Human-Centric AI.
For example, as I wrote in a recent essay, only 13.8 per cent of the members that created the ‘Social Principles of Human-Centric AI’ in Japan were women, while its European counterpart that created the ‘Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI’ was  43.1 per cent female. Many Japanese claim the importance of Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) and social awareness are rising, but there is much more work to be done. Further, these (unconscious) biases are not AI-specific issues, but rather social issues that Japan has to tackle. For instance, Japan ranked the lowest among the G7 countries on the Global Gender Gap Report 2020.
Q5. How could Canada and Japan work together on AI? What kind of collaboration would you like to see in the near future?
Canada is one of the leading countries of not only AI technologies, but also AI ethics and governance. I am particularly interested in the intersection between AI and democracy – and this is an area that Canada and Japan could collaborate more closely with each other. Technologies implemented in critical decision-making sectors could raise serious problems, and facial recognition and deep fakes have also posed unprecedented challenges for democratic systems – a topic that will be discussed in the AI and Justice symposium that we are organizing in Tokyo this March. AI and democracy will increasingly become more important and sharing experiences of good practices would be beneficial for both Canada and Japan.

It challenges each participant to go the distance and put a diamond ring where their mouth is. They talk through a wall, unencumbered by big bad wolves like social media and physical appearances. Only when they're engaged do they get a chance to see each other. Then, they move onto the honeymoon in Mexico, meet each other's families, and have their wedding day in the finale. Participants join the experiment in search of some ideal pure love that doesn't take into consideration things like race, creed, or class but conveniently, does take gender and geographical location into account.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTIt's easy to have faith in ""the pods"" when you end up engaged to a well-off engineer with the body of a former fireman, which is exactly what contestant Lauren Speed gets when she lays eyes on her new fiance Cameron Hamilton. Yes, he is majorly clingy and yes, he holds his body in a state of permanent flex. But it looks like that just might be Lauren's speed (I had to).Like Chandler Bing from Friends, some people have super-specialized and uniquely vague job descriptions that just don't stick to your brain, even after they've introduced themselves multiple times. And it would seem  Cameron Hamilton has one of those jobs. (Thankfully, he's not a rapper.) Much to any suitor's delight, he is a fireman-turned-scientist working in the ultra-lucrative field of artificial intelligence. But what exactly does that mean?Cameron Hamilton works as a data science consultant for Weill Cornell Medicine. According to his LinkedIn page, he's been working for WCM for almost two years. He has two master's degrees: one in artificial intelligence from the University of Georgia which covers machine learning, robotics, algorithms, and a host of other specialties. And another in Neurophilosophy (the intersection of science and philosophy). Our boy is brains and brawn.You're probably wondering how much he makes, considering the mega-house he walked Lauren through their first time back from Mexico. Well, according to Glassdoor, data scientists earn an average of $113,109 a year. And while he was once a fireman, the gaggle of gaunt nerdy friends he brought to his bachelor party shows that he is mostly brains now. Suddenly, meeting your partner while sealed off from them in a pod doesn't sound so weird, does it?Related Content:

Professor John Brownstein says his team takes precautions to protect privacy.(Supplied)""The system has done really well but we're constantly retraining it, especially when you move into new languages and geographies,"" Professor Brownstein said.As technology permeates deeper into our lives, Professor Brownstein's team are finding themselves with more data today than when they began the project 15 years ago.""There's more people interacting with symptom checker chatbots, so that's a whole new source of data,"" he said.""There are people that are utilising connected devices, like a connected thermometer — that's a very useful dataset that we're getting access to.""Voice technologies become one that we spent a lot of time on, working with Amazon, as an example, and the Alexa platform.""While access to internet-connected thermometers and smart speakers might spark privacy concerns, Professor Brownstein said his team were careful with data they used.""We have to think about patient privacy and anonymising datasets, that's a big part of what we do,"" he said. Tracking the spread of coronavirus has become important for health agencies fighting the outbreak.(AP: Kin Cheung)""The good thing is, we work with a lot of public datasets, like open social media sites like Twitter which are already quite open and then we're also doing a lot of work in crowdsourcing.""[Crowdsourcing] is in our view the holy grail because we're building platforms where people can engage, put their symptoms in, but be directly involved in public health.""The artificial intelligence born from SARSProfessor Brownstein's HealthMap was born in the shadows of the SARS outbreak in 2003, which killed almost 800 people and sparked panic across the globe.COVID-19, SARS and the fluWeeks after the novel coronavirus was first discovered, experts say incomplete data from China is limiting their ability to understand it — but they are seeing some differences between it and other infectious diseases.Read moreAt the time, Google Maps and social media platforms were just taking shape and his team believed there was an opportunity to collate the information into a single model.""This idea of a mash-up that organised all the world's information about disease events,"" he said.When the teams switched on HealthMap, it started to find virus and disease outbreaks all over the world.""[We] trained it in a way to produce a living, breathing, real-time map of disease events that was sort of never seen before,"" Professor Brownstein said.""At the time, this seemed to be sort of almost looked down upon as a source of information that wouldn't be as reliable as what government agencies were putting out.""Soon the team realised the map was more useful than that and that it could actually be a tool for policymakers.""Something flipped and that data actually became a huge driver of what government agencies used to understand what's happening both within countries and in neighbouring countries and internationally,"" Professor Brownstein said. South Korea has recently reported a surge in cases of coronavirus.(AP: Kim Jun-beom via Yonhap)He said the real value of the technology, at least in the early stages, came from being able to identify outbreaks in countries that did not have a record of open transparency.""In some ways [this AI could] apply this newfound pressure for government agencies to be more transparent because the information was going to come out one way or the other.""More technology tracking the outbreakAs well as HealthMap, there are also other tools using algorithms to crunch huge amounts of data in an attempt to track coronavirus.Ricardo Soares Magales, an associate professor in population health and biosecurity at the University of Queensland, told The Signal that digital epidemiologists were able to work out where the virus could pop up by combing everything from mobile phone locations to airport departures.""These models are being updated pretty much every day as information comes in,"" he said.""Some of these models integrate movement of individuals between cities and between countries so that you have an understanding of how far the infection can go.""""If we know that a particular location has a number of cases popping up and it's highly connected to another location, we can inform services to target the surveillance and case ascertainment, the containment and isolation, in the receiving location."" Doctors have been working around the clock in Wuhan to treat patients who have contracted the virus.(AP: Chinatopix)As well as tracking the spread, researchers are also trying to identify the source of the outbreak.One theory has been that bat products sold from a Wuhan market were the origin of this outbreak, and Dr Magales said researchers were trying to get access to apps that people could have used to sell and trade wild animal products.""Using that information to understand where the sale has been happening and who has been purchasing [the products] — not from an individual point of view, but an aggregate, [to see] which locations seem to be more active in the purchase of these products,"" he said.""Now authorities from the animal side are sieving through datastreams which could point to where these bat products have been and if they've been purchased online, which locations have been more exposed to this material.""Professor Brownstein has been surprised by the number of people who have made the fight against the coronavirus a priority over other work.""I think people have put their academic aspirations on hold while they're actually trying to figure out and work together to get this thing right,"" he said.""[It] is very unique compared to other events we've seen.""Posted 22 Feb 202022 Feb 2020Sat 22 Feb 2020 at 3:04pm, updated 22 Feb 202022 Feb 2020Sat 22 Feb 2020 at 4:58pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesChristian sect reported as hotbed of 'super-spreading' coronavirus event in South KoreaWhy China is 'laundering' cash and printing new banknotesCoronavirus cases confirmed among Australian Diamond Princess evacuees in DarwinMore on:BrisbaneChinaEpidemics and PandemicsEpidemiologyInformation Technology IndustryInternetSocial MediaUnited StatesTop StoriesSally McManus issues multiple denials over whether she knew of alleged criminality in CFMEUSuspected army spy's Instagram page reveals visit to sensitive Woomera military training areaHow Trump's bandaged ear stole the show on day one of the Republican conventionAnalysis by Kathryn DissTrump's near-assassination is part of long history of violence in the US.
