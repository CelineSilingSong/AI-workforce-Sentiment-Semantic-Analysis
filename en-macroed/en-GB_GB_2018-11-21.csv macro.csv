 Eight Essential Interview Questions CEOs Swear By

Artificial intelligence has had some justifiably bad press recently. Some of the worst stories have been about systems that exhibit racial or gender bias in facial recognition applications or in evaluating people for jobs, loans, or other considerations.1 One program was routinely recommending longer prison sentences for blacks than for whites on the basis of the flawed use of recidivism data.2
But what if instead of perpetuating harmful biases, AI helped us overcome them and make fairer decisions? That could eventually result in a more diverse and inclusive world. What if, for instance, intelligent machines could help organizations recognize all worthy job candidates by avoiding the usual hidden prejudices that derail applicants who don’t look or sound like those in power or who don’t have the “right” institutions listed on their résumés? What if software programs were able to account for the inequities that have limited the access of minorities to mortgages and other loans? In other words, what if our systems were taught to ignore data about race, gender, sexual orientation, and other characteristics that aren’t relevant to the decisions at hand?
AI can do all of this — with guidance from the human experts who create, train, and refine its systems. Specifically, the people working with the technology must do a much better job of building inclusion and diversity into AI design by using the right data to train AI systems to be inclusive and thinking about gender roles and diversity when developing bots and other applications that engage with the public.

Design for Inclusion
Software development remains the province of males — only about one-quarter of computer scientists in the United States are women3 — and minority racial groups, including blacks and Hispanics, are underrepresented in tech work, too.4 Groups like Girls Who Code and AI4ALL have been founded to help close those gaps. Girls Who Code has reached almost 90,000 girls from various backgrounds in all 50 states,5 and AI4ALL specifically targets girls in minority communities.

The healthcare industry should be using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to a far greater degree than at present, but progress has been painfully slow. The same factors that make the healthcare system so attractive to AI developers - fragmented or non-existent data repositories, outdated computer systems and doctor shortages - are the same things that have stopped AI from providing the gains that should be created.

The healthcare sector also presents unique obstacles for AI: data must flow freely through AI systems to achieve real results, but extracting data from handwritten patient files or PDFs is cumbersome for us, and difficult for AI. Despite technical and operational challenges, new research suggests that the arrival of the tech giants into the industry may provide the data and the capital required to digitize this fairly untapped market.
Where AI can help now
Severe fragmentation between different branches of healthcare, and life-threatening miscommunication within institutions (in 2016, ~10% of all US deaths were caused by medical errors), presents an opportunity for AI to ease the burden on doctors in more creative, less intrusive ways. Mabu is a humanoid robot developed by Catalia Health and works with the American Heart Association to help patients keep on top of at-home treatment for congestive heart failure. Acting as a personal health assistant, Mabu asks patients how they are feeling, makes activity suggestions and provides medication reminders. ‘There are key points we make sure Mabu covers,’ says Catalia Health founder Cory Kidd, ‘but the conversation is adaptive to what is going on with that patient at that moment,’ much like a home nurse’s visits might be scripted to a certain degree while relying on some human intuition.
PROMOTED
Mabu is a promising step towards integrating AI into the healthcare system without disturbing doctors within facilities - the data Mabu gathers can be fed into Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) via email or text, and ‘daily conversations’ with the device mean that Catalia Health can collect patient information consensually ‘without depending on access to their medical data.’ The implementation of AI throughout healthcare institutions or an entire country will remain a huge task even for data-rich multi-nationals, but solutions like this may help to improve outpatient care and reduce readmission rates for long-term conditions without setting foot in a hospital.

The grand scheme
The move towards integrating AI with hospitals and healthcare centers is gaining pace. The UK government has announced its intentions to put the UK ‘at the forefront of the use of AI and data in early diagnosis, innovation, prevention and treatment’ by 2030. While this may be ambitious given the current status of technological advancement in the NHS, hospitals are working with a wide range of companies to tackle immediate problems on the ground. Chatbots, DeepMind, and voice biometrics are all being used to alleviate unique problems in the sector, and some companies are taking a different approach to ensure that AI is used to its full extent.
Dr. Shafi Ahmed is a cancer specialist in practice for more than 20 years, and as such is in high demand from people who need his expertise. In a conversation with Steve Dann, who at the time was working in visual effects, Dr. Ahmed related that of the 300 students under his care he was only able to directly train two at a time because the operating theatre could not fit any more people. Dann suggested he filmed an operation using 360° cameras, which enabled Dr. Ahmed to show students exactly what to do without having 300 people breathing down his neck.

This led Steve Dann to found Medical Realities, and use his skills in CGI and virtual reality to train medical students without making more work for doctors. Following the success of the 360° operation, Dann created a virtual Dr. Ahmed to answer questions for him, which is now used in conjunction with teleconferencing to help Dr. Ahmed’s cancer patients feel more comfortable in follow-up appointments. Using this combination of AI, virtual reality and CGI, Dann is working with Leeds and Queen Mary University hospitals to create virtual surgeons that can train new doctors or assist in surgeries where one or more doctors cannot be physically present.
Bit by bit transformation
Bringing about an artificially intelligent healthcare landscape will be a significant challenge, due to the sheer amount of mission-critical work on doctors’ shoulders, outdated systems and handwritten records, and fragmentation between care facilities. But Rome wasn’t built in a day, and there is already significant progress being made that does not disrupt the daily work of doctors and nurses on the ground, while still offering improved care to patients.
The AI healthcare sector is ripe for development and investment, but while the data giants figure out how to transform the system as a whole, smaller-scale projects are making real changes. Piece by piece, patient by patient, AI is on its way to fixing healthcare once and for all.Follow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Charles Towers-ClarkFollowingFollowI research and write about organizational structures, proactiveness and culture (especially in relevance to AI) in organisations and other human skills.... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",http://schema.org,BreadcrumbList,https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestowersclark/2018/11/22/using-artificial-intelligence-to-fix-healthcare/,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/charlestowersclark/files/2018/11/Medical-Realities-360-surgery-1200x675.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', 'width': 542.79, 'height': 304.6}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Charles Towers-Clark', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestowersclark/', 'description': 'I research and write about organizational structures, proactiveness and culture (especially in relevance to AI) in organisations and other human skills.

AmbitionsShare full article17Read in appWorkers at the headquarters of Ruijin Technology Company in Jiaxian, in central China’s Henan Province. They identify objects in images to help artificial intelligence make sense of the world.Credit...Yan Cong for The New York TimesBy Li YuanNov. 25, 2018阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版Some of the most critical work in advancing China’s technology goals takes place in a former cement factory in the middle of the country’s heartland, far from the aspiring Silicon Valleys of Beijing and Shenzhen. An idled concrete mixer still stands in the middle of the courtyard. Boxes of melamine dinnerware are stacked in a warehouse next door.Inside, Hou Xiameng runs a company that helps artificial intelligence make sense of the world. Two dozen young people go through photos and videos, labeling just about everything they see. That’s a car. That’s a traffic light. That’s bread, that’s milk, that’s chocolate. That’s what it looks like when a person walks.“I used to think the machines are geniuses,” Ms. Hou, 24, said. “Now I know we’re the reason for their genius.”In China, long the world’s factory floor, a new generation of low-wage workers is assembling the foundations of the future. Start-ups in smaller, cheaper cities have sprung up to apply labels to China’s huge trove of images and surveillance footage. If China is the Saudi Arabia of data, as one expert says, these businesses are the refineries, turning raw data into the fuel that can power China’s A.I. ambitions.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTConventional wisdom says that China and the United States are competing for A.I. supremacy and that China has certain advantages. The Chinese government broadly supports A.I. companies, financially and politically. Chinese start-ups made up one third of the global computer vision market in 2017, surpassing the United States. Chinese academic papers are cited more often in research papers. In a key policy announcement last year, the China government said that it expected the country to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030.Most importantly, this thinking goes, the Chinese government and companies enjoy access to mountains of data, thanks to weak privacy laws and enforcement. Beyond what Facebook, Google and Amazon have amassed, Chinese internet companies can get more because people there so heavily use their mobile phones to shop, pay for meals and buy movie tickets.ImageHou Xiameng runs a data factory out of her in-laws’ former cement factory in the Hebei city of Nangongshi.Credit...Yan Cong for The New York TimesStill, many of those claims are iffy. Chinese papers and patents can be suspect. Government money may go to waste. It isn’t clear that the A.I. race is a zero sum game, in which the winner gets the spoils. Data is useless unless somebody can parse and catalog it.But the ability to tag that data may be China’s true A.I. strength, the only one that the United States may not be able to match. In China, this new industry offers a glimpse of a future that the government has long promised: an economy built on technology rather than manufacturing.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We’re the construction workers in the digital world. Our job is to lay one brick after another,” said Yi Yake, co-founder of a data labeling factory in Jiaxian, a city in central Henan province. “But we play an important role in A.I. Without us, they can’t build the skyscrapers.”While A.I. engines are superfast learners and good at tackling complex calculations, they lack cognitive abilities that even the average 5-year-old possesses. Small children know that a furry brown cocker spaniel and a black Great Dane are both dogs. They can tell a Ford pickup from a Volkswagen Beetle, and yet they know both are cars.A.I. has to be taught. It must digest vast amounts of tagged photos and videos before it realizes that a black cat and a white cat are both cats. This is where the data factories and their workers come in.Taggers helped AInnovation, a Beijing-based A.I. company, fix its automated cashier system for a Chinese bakery chain. Users could put their pastry under a scanner and pay for it without help from a human. But nearly one-third of the time, the system had trouble telling muffins from doughnuts or pork buns thanks to store lighting and human movement, which made images more complex. Working with photos from the store’s interior, the taggers got the accuracy up to 99 percent, said Liang Rui, an AInnovation project manager.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“All the artificial intelligence is built on human labor,” Mr. Liang said.AInnovation has fewer than 30 taggers, but a surge in labeling start-ups has made it easy to farm out the work. Once, Mr. Liang needed to get about 20,000 photos in a supermarket labeled in three days. Colleagues got it done with the help of data factories for only a couple thousand dollars.“We’re the assembly lines 10 years ago,” said Mr. Yi, the co-founder of the data factory in Henan.The data factories are popping up in areas far from the biggest cities, often in relatively remote areas where both labor and office space are cheap. Many of the data factory workers are the kinds of people who once worked on assembly lines and construction sites in those big cities. But work is drying up, wage growth has slowed and many Chinese people prefer to live closer to home.Mr. Yi, 36, was out of a job and trying to get other ventures going with elementary school classmates when someone mentioned A.I. tagging. After online searches, he decided it wasn’t super technical but needed cheap labor, something Henan has in abundance.In March, Mr. Yi and his friends set up Ruijin Technology, which rents offices the size of two professional basketball courts in an industrial park for $21,000 a year. It was previously the park’s Communist Party committee’s event space, so the ceiling lights are covered with red hammers and sickles.Ruijin, which means smart gold, now employs 300 workers but plans to expand to 1,000 after the Chinese New Year holiday, when many migrant workers come home.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTUnlike workers and business around the world, Mr. Yi isn’t worried that A.I. will take his job.“The machines aren’t smart enough to teach themselves yet,” he said.Hiring is a bigger worry.Ruijin’s pay of $400 to $500 a month is higher than average in Jiaxian. Some potential job candidates worry that they don’t know anything about A.I. Others find the work boring.Jin Weixiang, 19, said he would quit Ruijin after the Chinese New Year and go to sell furniture in a physical store in southern city Guangzhou.Image“We’re the construction workers in the digital world. Our job is to lay one brick after another,” said Yi Yake, co-founder of Ruijin Technology.Credit...Yan Cong for The New York Times“I’m a people’s person,” said Mr. Jin. “I’m doing labeling for the money.”But for some former migrant workers, the job is better than working on assembly lines.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It was the same work, same movement, day after day,” said Yi Zhenzhen, a 28-year-old Ruijin employee who once worked at an electronic component company. “Now I have to use my brain a little bit.”Most of the time, customers don’t tell these data factories what the task is for. Some are obvious. Labeling traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians are usually for autonomous driving. Labeling many types of camellia flowers could be for search engines.Once Ruijin was given the task of labeling the images of millions of human mouths. Mr. Yi said he wasn’t sure what it was for. Maybe facial recognition?Roughly 300 miles to the north, in the Hebei city of Nangongshi, Hou Xiameng runs her data factory out of her in-laws’ former cement factory. Her first job out of college was labeling faces for Megvii, the Chinese facial recognition company with a $2 billion valuation that’s most famous for its technology platform called Face++. To this day, some facial recognition systems recognize her before they do her friends because, she says, “my face is in the original database.”But life in Beijing was too tough and expensive. She and her then-fiancé, Zhao Yacheng, decided to move back to their hometown and start a data factory. Ms. Hou’s parents would pay for computers and desks. They are renovating the warehouse next door to hire 80 more people.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLike Mr. Yi, Ms. Hou doesn’t spend time thinking about the implications of her work. Are they contributing to a surveillance state and a dystopian future that machines will control human?“Cameras make me feel safe,” she said. “We’re in control of the machines for now.”Follow Li Yuan on Twitter:@LiYuan6.

A year later, a user of Google Photos discovered that the program was labeling his black friends as gorillas. And in 2018 it emerged that an algorithm that analyzed the risk of recidivism by a million US defendants made as many mistakes as any human being with no training in criminal justice.Decisions that were once made by human beings are now being made by AI systems. Some programs deal with hiring, others with loan approvals, medical diagnoses and even court rulings. But there is a risk involved, because the data used to “train” the algorithms is itself conditioned by our own knowledge and prejudices.The data is a reflection of reality. If reality is prejudiced, so is the dataRichard Benjamins, Telefónica“The data is a reflection of reality. If reality is prejudiced, so is the data,” explains Richard Benjamins, the Big Data and AI ambassador at Telefónica, a global telco and tech company, in a telephone conversation with EL PAÍS. To prevent an algorithm from discriminating against certain groups, he says, it is necessary to check that the training data does not contain a bias, and to analyze the false positive and negative ratios. “It is much more serious to have an algorithm that discriminates in an undesired way in the fields of law, loans or school admissions than in the fields of movie recommendations or advertising.”Isabel Fernández, a managing director of applied intelligence at consulting firm Accenture, brings up the example of automatic loan grants. “Imagine that in the past, most of the applicants were men, and the few women who were approved for a loan had to overcome such stringent criteria that they all repaid their debt. If we used this data and nothing else, the system would conclude that women are better at paying back than men, which is merely a reflection of a past prejudice.”Yet on many occasions it is women who are harmed by this kind of bias. “Algorithms are generally developed because a group of mostly white men between the ages of 25 and 50 have decided so at a meeting. With this kind of starting point, it is difficult to include the opinion or perception of minority groups or of the other 50% of the population, which is made up of women,” says Nerea Luis Mingueza, a robotics and AI researcher at Carlos III University who holds that underrepresented groups will always be affected to a greater degree by technological products. “For instance, the voices of women and children fail more often in voice recognition systems.”Today's society generates huge amounts of data, but using it correctly still poses a challenge.GettyMinorities are more likely to feel the effects of this bias for statistical reasons, says José María Lucia, who heads the AI and data analysis center at EY Wavespace: “The number of available cases for training is going to be lower,” he notes. “And any groups who have suffered discrimination of any type in the past are open to this, because by using historical data we could be unwittingly including this bias in the training.”This is the case with the African-American population in the United States, according to Juan Alonso, a senior manager at Accenture. “It’s been proven that if caught over the same kind of misdemeanor, such as smoking a joint in public or possessing small amounts of marijuana, a white person will not get arrested but a black person will.” This means that there is a higher percentage of black people on the database, and an algorithm that is trained with this information will incorporate a racist bias.Sources at Google explain that it is essential to “be very careful” about giving decision-making power to a machine-learning system. “Artificial intelligence produces answers based on existing data, and so humans must recognize that they won’t necessarily provide impeccable results.”Algorithms are generally developed because a group of mostly white men between the ages of 25 and 50 have so decided at a meetingNerea Luis Mingueza, Carlos III UniversityMachines often end up being a black box filled with secrets that are undecipherable even to their own developers, who are unable to figure out what path the model followed to reach a certain conclusion. Alonso holds that “normally, when you are tried, you get an explanation for the decision in a ruling. But the problem is that this type of algorithm is opaque. It’s like being in the presence of an oracle who is going to hand down a verdict.”“Imagine you are going to an open-air festival and when you reach the front row, the security team kicks you out without any kind of explanation. You would be incensed. But if you are told that the first row is reserved for people in wheelchairs, you would not be angry about moving back. It’s the same with these algorithms: if we don’t know what’s going on, it can generate a feeling of dissatisfaction,” explains Alonso.To end this dilemma, researchers working on machine learning advocate greater transparency and providing explanations for training models. Major tech companies like Microsoft defend a set of principles for a responsible use of AI, and they are sponsoring initiatives to try to crack open the black box of algorithms and explain why decisions get made the way they are.Telefonica is organizing a Challenge for a Responsible Use of AI at its Big Data business unit, LUCA, with the aim of creating new tools to detect undesired bias. Accenture has developed AI Fairness and IBM has also come up with its own bias-detection tool. For Francesca Rossi, director of ethics and AI at IBM, the key lies in making AI systems transparent and trustworthy. “People have the right to ask how an intelligent system suggests certain decisions over others, and companies have a duty to help people understand the decision-making process.”English version by Susana Urra.More informationA woman’s place is in the home – at least according to AI...Javier SalasBeyond Trump: the hidden threat robots pose to the Mexican economyIgnacio Fariza | Mexico CityArchived InSpanish Way Of LifeAdheres toMore informationIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact ventacontenidos@prisamedia.com",https://schema.org/,"['NewsArticle', 'Article']",,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': ['https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/4LHWPSE5GDYLRKRCVZ6XUYT4WY.jpg?auth=92a9071a86354ce080fa612ed46d2486208aae495ed5ab60a9fd3dc86af1c97c&width=1960&height=1103&smart=true', 'https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/4LHWPSE5GDYLRKRCVZ6XUYT4WY.jpg?auth=92a9071a86354ce080fa612ed46d2486208aae495ed5ab60a9fd3dc86af1c97c&width=1960&height=1470&smart=true', 'https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/4LHWPSE5GDYLRKRCVZ6XUYT4WY.jpg?auth=92a9071a86354ce080fa612ed46d2486208aae495ed5ab60a9fd3dc86af1c97c&width=980&height=980&smart=true']}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Isabel Rubio', 'url': 'https://english.elpais.com/author/isabel-rubio-arroyo/'}]","{'@type': ['NewsMediaOrganization', 'Organization'], 'sameAs': ['https://twitter.com/elpaisinenglish', 'https://www.facebook.com/elpaisinenglish', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/elpaiscom', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Pa%C3%ADs'], 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.elpais.com/dist/resources/images/logos/amp/default.png', 'height': 60, 'width': 262}, 'name': 'Ediciones EL PAÍS S.L.', 'actionableFeedbackPolicy': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/#contacto', 'correctionsPolicy': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/#cambios', 'diversityPolicy': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/#diversidad', 'diversityStaffingReport': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/#diversidad', 'ethicsPolicy': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/#principios', 'foundingDate': '1976-05-04', 'masthead': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/#estructura', 'missionCoveragePrioritiesPolicy': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/#mision', 'noBylinesPolicy': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/', 'ownershipFundingInfo': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/#estructura', 'unnamedSourcesPolicy': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/#fuentes', 'verificationFactCheckingPolicy': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/#verificacion'}",The dangers of letting algorithms make decisions for you,2018-11-23T18:34:49+01:00,2018-11-23T18:34:49+01:00,Life,,True,,"{'@type': ['WebPage', 'ItemPage'], '@id': 'https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/11/23/inenglish/1542976796_159932.html', 'name': 'The dangers of letting algorithms make decisions for you'}",,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/FNUMMOXNCFWYLCJ344NDX4MULM.jpg?auth=4e6c824b548b8592ee61f7e1432a48f105edad56cdb805b236172fca43645cb9&width=1960', 'caption': 'Todays society generates huge amounts of data, but using it correctly still poses a challenge.', 'height': 720, 'width': 1960, 'copyrightHolder': [{'name': 'Getty', '@type': ['NewsMediaOrganization', 'Organization']}]}]",,,,,2024.0,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Ediciones EL PAÍS S.L.', 'productID': 'english.elpais.com:basic'}",,,,,,,,"In 2014, Amazon developed an artificial intelligence (AI) recruitment tool that began to discriminate against female job applicants.

IU & AI: Law, Speech, and the World of Work

Experts employed and trained by IU are exploring the many aspects and influences of artificial intelligence. There’s the alum and legal scholar talking about AI systems as they relate to privacy, safety, and liability; the IU professor working to teach speech-recognition systems the nuances of human language; and, finally, a pair of IU experts—a computer historian and a radiologist—giving their views of AI’s impact on human employment.
For those in the legal field, artificial intelligence systems bring with them a host of new legal issues that will no doubt be explored through the courts in years to come, says Drew Simshaw, JD’12, a legal method/communication fellow at Elon University School of Law. For Simshaw, who coauthored a chapter on “Cybersecurity and the Legal Profession” for the National Cybersecurity Institute’s Cybersecurity in Our Digital Lives, legal issues surrounding new technologies are a specialty.
The legal issues stemming from artificial intelligence largely fall into three buckets: privacy, safety, and liability. Questions of privacy might stem from the healthcare field, where medical information gathered by technology systems would not be covered by existing privacy petitions, whereas questions of apportioning blame will likely arise when something goes wrong with a new technology, such as an autonomous vehicle or robotic surgical procedure.
“There’s an increasingly large ecosystem with new players and new entities working together to makes these technologies a reality, and it is hard to allocate risk when we don’t know what the risks are,” he says.
Right now, there are few clear answers to questions of liability when it comes to artificially intelligent systems, Simshaw says. This is a major reason we are seeing a “slow rollout” of some new forms of technology, he says.
“As recently as a few years ago, it was predicted we’d see driverless cars become ubiquitous very, very quickly, and we are of course seeing that’s not the case. Even with things like robotic surgery and driverless cars, you are seeing humans not being taken far out of the loop, which makes it easier for humans to intervene when those machines don’t behave the way we think they will.”
Artificial Intelligence and Language
Damir Cavar, associate professor of computational linguistics at IU, is at work on a group of projects that develops data sets and algorithms aimed at teaching speech-recognition systems the nuances of human language. Right now, most industrial speech recognition systems are trained to take a series of audio signals and simply identify the words being used. Such systems can’t understand the significance of the way something is said—yet.
“Imagine, I see my dog chewing a shoe and ask, ‘What did you do’ with a non-interrogative intonation, rather the intonation of ‘Bad dog, I see what you did, this is not good,’” Cavar says. “We build the data sets for such speech properties and train algorithms to detect this, to identify irony, sentiment, and sarcasm using spoken language signal, intonation, specific accent, or stress patterns.”
Artificial Intelligence and Employment
The rise of AI also triggers perhaps one of the oldest fears about any new technology, the potential displacement of workers.
“Computers in some way have always been about replacing human workers, and so always, whether you are talking about computers in a conventional sense or artificial intelligence, there is always a concern of, ‘What human labor will this replace?’” says Nathan Ensmenger, chair of IU’s School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering and a longtime researcher of the history of computing.
In the United States, for instance, automation has been a major cause of the reduction in manufacturing jobs once available.
In another field—radiology—many have feared that automation could mean a reduced need for trained radiologists; one leader in the field, Geoffrey Hinton, has even argued that medical schools should stop training people as radiologists. However, Dr. Himanshu Shah, chair of the Department of Radiology and Imaging Science at the Indiana University School of Medicine, strongly disagrees.
Shah believes that artificial intelligence will play an important role in radiology in the years to come, but not to replace humans. Rather, he believes such systems will help radiologists—who he describes as being “maxed out”—cope with the enormous amounts of data now available to them. As imaging technology has improved, radiologists now have many hundreds, even thousands, of images to review from each individual patient, when in the past they would have had perhaps 100.
“There are a lot of applications that are getting increasing hype,” Shah says of artificial intelligence systems in radiology. “Not how to replace the radiologists, but how to make the radiologists more productive; [how to] provide a second set of eyes or elevate the performance of generalists to get them closer to specialists levels.”
While there can be no dispute that some jobs have been lost to automation, Ensmenger believes that job losses on a massive scale in the future are less likely than people think. More likely, facets of jobs will be shifted to computers, but humans will retain the roles for which they are better suited.
“This idea that in 10 years we’ll all have nothing to do and our big problem will be figuring out what to do with our spare time is as absurd now as it was when people were predicting that in the 1950s, which was as absurd as when John Maynard Keynes was predicting that in the 1920s,” Shah says. “It’s a fantasy.”

Doosan Bobcat North America is betting on artificial intelligence (AI) for its future construction equipment as the heavy machinery maker seeks to boost efficiency on the job site.
The U.S. and Canadian unit of Doosan Bobcat Inc., has partnered with SafeAI – a Silicon Valley startup – to explore how AI technologies can be amalgamated into Bobcat equipment.
Through this partnership, SafeAI will demonstrate how its AI technologies, Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be used to perceive environments around construction equipment and provide auto-control.






“Through our partnership with SafeAI, we hope to work toward our ultimate goal of enabling our customers to work more efficiently on the job site,” Joel Honeyman, VP of global innovation Doosan Bobcat North America said in a press statement.
Maximise productivity
The partnership is part of Doosan Bobcat North America’s initiative to identify forward-looking solutions to help construction equipment operators to maximise their productivity.
Bibhrajit Halder, chief executive and co-founder of SafeAI said his company is “building a safe, AI-enabled autonomous platform for the equipment industry.”
RELATED: Caterpillar Foresees Major AI Disruption in Construction
The partnership comes at a time when the construction industry is increasingly turning to AI as a means to make job sites safer and more efficient.
Secure construction sites
Japanese equipment giant Komatsu recently signed a deal with California-based Nvidia and two others to deploy an Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing platform in the heavy machinery industry in a bid to improve efficiency and make construction sites safer.






The partnership also involves OPTiM, a management software firm, which will provide an app to identify individuals and machinery collected from surveillance cameras, and SkyCatch, which will provide drones to gather and map 3D images for visualizing the terrain at the edge.
RELATED: Japan’s Komatsu Adds AI to Its Machinery
According to the deal, Komatsu will integrate Nvidia’s AI platform – a credit card-sized device designed to drive robots and drones – which will serve as the brain of heavy machinery, thereby improving efficiency and worker safety on site.
Movement of workers
SkyCatch’s drone views and pictures captured through cameras mounted on Komatsu’s heavy equipment will be processed with Nvidia’s deep learning-based AI, enabling the firm to track the movement of workers and equipment, thus minimising the chances of fatal accidents.






Through robotics, construction managers can utilise intelligent machines that can perform tedious tasks that were once completed by humans, such as bricklaying.
On the other hand, AI systems can gather and organise information for engineers to use within project planning and design implementation.
