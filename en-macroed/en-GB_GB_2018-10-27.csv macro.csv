Ministers of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have rolled out and tested AI to automate claims processing and fight fraud within their department. Over the last year, the department unleashed artificial intelligence algorithms to track down large-scale corruption of the benefit and welfare program to stop criminal gangs who are responsible for extremely large losses. Ultimately, this effort protects taxpayers’ money and gets the benefits to those who they are intended for.

AI Identifies Large-Scale Abuse of the Benefits System
Benefit fraud at the hands of criminal gangs cost the Department of Work and Pensions nearly £2.1 billion in 2016, a rise of £200 million in just one year. The losses to fraud equate to the entire budget of the Foreign Office, which is £1.1 billion annually. To combat this crime, ministers have launched Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect fraudulent claims. The algorithms look for patterns in claims such as the same phone number or applications written in the same style. Once a claim is flagged as suspicious, a human investigator takes over to determine if the claim is in fact fraudulent.
AI identifies possible issues faster than human investigators who in the past would have to assess every claim. Therefore, until recently, the department was focused on stopping individual benefit fraud and investigated people who were flagged as being suspicious at job centers. However, it’s the large-scale efforts by criminal gangs that contributes the bulk of the issue. By deploying AI, billions of items of data can be quickly reviewed, fake identity cloning techniques commonly used by fraudsters are detected and the claim payments can be stopped.
PROMOTED
Artificial intelligence algorithms are also used to scour social media accounts to uncover inconsistencies in the stories people tell on social media and the claims they are making for benefits. Lavish holiday parties are a red flag if you’re claiming unemployment benefits. Going on a cross-country race is not congruent with someone who receives disability benefits. If you claim single status and you post pictures of your wedding or spouse, it’s suspicious to the AI algorithms.
The DWP tested the algorithms extensively and the algorithms can even scan across the benefit system including Universal Credit, Jobseeker’s Allowance and Personal Independent Systems making it even more robust.
The UK’s Commitment to Artificial Intelligence and Data Technologies
It’s clear from the Industrial Strategy the UK government, that it’s not just one department that is committed to expanding its technology prowess, it’s a priority for the UK government in its entirety. The strategy said the UK government is committed to investments in innovation to make “the country the world’s most innovative nation by 2030.” Prime Minister Theresa May said the strategy will help businesses seize the big opportunities of our day, “such as artificial intelligence and big data.” Artificial Intelligence is one of the four grand challenges outlined in the strategy to “put the UK at the forefront of the artificial intelligence and data revolution.”

AI Can Bring Major Social and Economic Impacts to UK
In a report about the artificial intelligence industry in the UK, the government sees a bright future ahead and possibilities for major social and economic benefits from the technology. By 2035, it’s estimated that AI could add an additional £630 billion to the UK economy.
This future will be realized, according to the report, only if AI continues to be developed and applied. This review recommends increased access to data in a wider range of sectors, to develop a larger workforce with deep AI expertise as well as continued UK commitment to AI research. In addition, the growth of AI directly relates to an increased understanding of what AI can do and where it could be applied.
While the prevention and recovery of unlawful benefits payouts is showing promise in the Department of Work and Pensions, there are many other AI applications in the works including the automatic processing of 42% of documentation submitted with benefits claims. As other departments and businesses integrate AI into existing processes and begin to realize the massive efficiencies, boost to performance and better decision-making due to more accurate information, AI adoption will continue to increase.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,

WASHINGTON, Oct. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Job seekers question businesses' use of artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate resumes and cover letters, according to a new survey from Clutch, a B2B ratings and reviews firm.The survey found that 32% of job seekers doubt companies used AI to review their resumes or cover letters during their most recent job search, compared to 32% who believe companies used AI but remain unsure.

More than 60% of job seekers are unsure whether AI helps the recruitment process, new Clutch data reveals.








Job seekers are most likely to communicate with companies via phone, email, or text message, new survey from Clutch finds.








This uncertainty translates to job seekers' mixed feelings about AI, the survey finds. More than half of recent job seekers (51%) believe AI currently isn't advanced enough to assist with recruitment – including nearly 20% who doubt AI will ever be useful. 
Does AI Improve Recruitment? AI's level of usefulness depends on how companies choose to apply it.Only 11% of job seekers believe AI improves recruitment. Experts warn that AI can reinforce existing biases when it's used to evaluate resumes and cover letters. For example, AI can replicate a company's tendency to hire candidates of a certain gender or educational background. Experts, however, believe AI can be beneficial if companies use AI for skill-based testing instead of screening candidates' race, gender, or backgrounds.""As long as your test isn't easier for someone who went to MIT than it is for someone who went to community college, AI can be tremendously helpful,"" said Harj Haggar, CEO and co-founder of Triplebyte, a company that uses background-blind testing to match candidates with tech companies. AI can also supplement communication between companies and candidates. Currently, only 3% of applicants communicate with companies via AI-supported chatbots, but experts see potential for growth.Nearly One-Quarter of Job Seekers Text Companies During RecruitmentNearly 25% of job seekers have texted a company representative during the interview process. Courteney Kovacs, a senior professional in HR at Hudson Insurance Group, views texting as a valuable tool for communicating with potential employees, especially in a competitive hiring landscape. ""Everybody is texting,"" Kovacs said. ""If you can find a way to incorporate it into recruitment, why not?"" Candidates who text potential employers should use the same etiquette as writing a professional email, experts advise.Nearly 20% of Job Seekers Use Social Media to Contact CompaniesNearly 1 in 5 job seekers (16%) connect with companies on social media. Emily Rowe is the owner and CEO of Social Sensei, a Florida-based creative agency. She initially connected with three members of her core staff on Instagram before hiring them.""If a business is on social media, they should expect to use it as a mode of communication,"" Rowe said.Traditional Communication Methods Remain PopularPhone calls and email still remain essential to hiring.Nearly three-quarters of recent hires connected with companies via phone calls (74%) and email (73%) during recruitment.Clutch's 2018 Recruiting Survey included 507 full-time employees who were hired in the past 6 months.Read the full report here: https://clutch.co/hr/recruiting/resources/how-companies-use-technology-communicate-recruitmentFor questions or comments about the survey, or an introduction to the experts included in the report, contact Michelle Delgado at 204145@email4pr.com.About ClutchA B2B research, ratings, and reviews firm in the heart of Washington, DC, Clutch connects small and medium businesses with the best-fit agencies, software, or consultants they need to tackle business challenges together and with confidence.

Their model contains thousands of agents representing different ethnicities, races and religions.Norway and Slovakia are trialling the tech to tackle tensions that can arise when Muslim immigrants settle in historically Christian countries.  The Oxford University researchers hope their system can be used to help governments respond to incidents, such as the recent London terror attacks. However, one independent expert said that the tool needed more work before it could be used in real-life situations.""This could be an extremely useful research project when it reaches maturity as a thought tool for analysing factors involved in religious conflict,"" said Prof Noel Sharkey.Core beliefsThe research, published in the Journal for Artificial Societies and Social Stimulation, indicates people are a peaceful species by nature.Even in times of crisis, such as natural disasters, the simulated humans came together peacefully. But in some situations the program indicated people were willing to endorse violence. Examples included occasions when other groups of people challenged the core beliefs that defined their identity.AFP/GETTYResearchers studied the Troubles in Northern Ireland before creating their modelThe research team drew on the Northern Ireland Troubles to programme conditions that saw what the researchers call ""xenophobic social anxiety"" escalate into extreme physical violence.  The conflict - which involved political and cultural factors in addition to religion - spanned three decades and claimed the lives of approximately 3,500 people.Primal fearsThe computer model also used scenarios based on the 2002 Gujarat riots in India. Two thousand people died during three days of inter-communal violence between Hindus and Muslims.Research author Justin Lane said: ""To use AI to study religion or culture, we have to look at modelling human psychology because our psychology is the foundation for religion and culture.""The root causes of things like religious violence rest in how our minds process the information that our world presents.""The results suggest the risk of religious conflict escalates when a group's core beliefs or sacred values are challenged so frequently that they overwhelm people's ability to deal with them. But even then, anxiety only spills over into violence in about 20% of the scenarios modelled.  ""Religious violence is not our default behaviour - in fact it is pretty rare in our history,"" said Mr Lane. ""It is only when people's core belief systems are challenged, or they feel that their commitment to their own beliefs is questioned that anxiety and agitations occur.""We might be able to trick our psychology into accepting others as part of our group when we'd otherwise be triggered toward more primal fears,"" he added. 'Out-group members'The researchers believe one answer to reducing the risk of religious violence and terrorism is to create situations that stop people seeing outsiders as a threat.  The most risky situations are when the difference in the size of two different religious groups is similar and people encounter ""out-group members"" more regularly, perceiving them as dangerous.The encounters need not be face-to-face. It could be that the threat is brought to someone's attention through conventional and social media.  ""We appear to live somewhat in our own information bubbles, but we still receive a lot of information about out-group members and that information appears to trigger our psychology even if there isn't actually a real person there,"" Mr Lane warned. ""Just the idea of a threat can be as powerful as a real threat to elicit a reaction.""AI must be 'for common good'Tech Tent: What next for artificial intelligence?Is artificial intelligence racist?",https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46035542,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/182D6/production/_104103099_mediaitem104103097.jpg,,,,

Artificial intelligence is hammering on the doors of the Radiology Department. Should we let it enter?





Photo: Jørgen Alexander Kamfjord
The dream of constructing artificial people was well described in Greek mythology, where Pandora (1) may well be the best known representation of a 'robot'. Most people are probably not giving it much thought, but the robots have already arrived – a long time ago – and they are generally benevolent. They do things I cannot be bothered doing myself, and the quality of their work is excellent. The dishwasher and the vacuum cleaner are the cornerstones of my happy marriage, because they effectively remove a source of problems associated with living together: clutter. They allow me to spend quality time with my family, and I am genuinely fond of my robots.
Lately, the robots have been taking on increasingly complex tasks, and many of them make use of technology that is covered by the umbrella term of artificial intelligence. Super-smart machines are everywhere: the search engine of my computer understands what I need to know (and buy), some sort of Babel fish on Skype enables me to talk to people from all over the world, and robotic cars are rushing around in the streets. It is almost as if the future has already arrived.
Intelligence is a concept which is difficult to define. It normally includes an ability to understand complex causal connections, learn from experience and make use of learnt information to solve problems. Artificial intelligence is computers with these qualities. The concept includes computer programs that are based on a wide range of symbolic and statistical approaches to learning and reasoning, and that are able to change their own architecture in order to solve tasks in an increasingly better way. In combination with increasing access to computational power and enormous health data sets, one methodology in particular – so-called deep learning (2) – will enable artificial intelligence to find its natural place in every part of the health services.
Radiology is the discipline that lends itself most easily to deep learning. The exceptionally fast technological development in medical imaging generates insane heaps of work for a group of professionals who will soon find it impossible to keep pace. Radiologists are increasingly tied to their computer screens to visually assess a growing flow of diagnostic images. The complexity and number of imaging methods available are growing, but multimodal image data are well suited for automated processing by systems that are based on deep learning and high performance computing. Artificial intelligence will be able to ease virtually every part of the radiology work-flow, from the reading of referrals from general practitioners to the compilation of structured reports, and everything that happens in between.
Witnessing image analysis conducted by well-trained algorithms is like witnessing pure magic. Many, however, suspect that this is black magic. Leading voices suggest that the lid of Pandora's box (1) is now ajar (3, 4), and that we should be considerably more cautious. Like all other technology, artificial intelligence can be used for good as well as evil. Just as quantum physics provided the seed for both the nuclear bomb and MR imaging, it is easy to envisage that artificial intelligence may lead to trouble. Therefore, the health service should – to a much larger degree than is currently the case – take a firm grip on developments to ensure that the robots know who is the boss, and that they are well trained for doing their job: to declutter.
When artificial intelligence is let into the Radiology Department, this will bring dramatic change, but it may well be that the department will be grateful for the robots' assistance. Artificial intelligence is the future, but may also enable us to turn back time to an era when radiologists were not only analytic machines, but were allowed to spend quality time with their patients.
The future appears to be closer than ever.

No one at the Defense Department wants weapons that make their own decisions, said former Deputy Secretary Bob Work. 






                  Artificial Intelligence
                









                  Defense
                












































The term “artificial intelligence” gets thrown around a lot today, especially in government circles, where leaders are eager to get ahead of the technological curve. But the military, at least, doesn’t really want true AI, according to a former deputy defense secretary.“We are not talking about Skynets and we’re not talking about Terminators. Those are what you would call an artificial general intelligence-type weapon,” Bob Work, who served as deputy defense secretary under Presidents Obama and Trump, said Tuesday during a speech at the annual SAP NS2 Solutions Summit. “We’re looking for narrow AI systems that can compose courses of action to accomplish the tasks that the machine is given and it can choose among the courses of action.”Work made a hard distinction between general AI and more narrow forms—what he preferred to call machine intelligence and algorithmic warfare.“Improved autonomy is going to be the natural result of machine intelligence. We always use artificial intelligence, but I think machine intelligence is more accurate,” he said. “It’s the programmed ability to process information and, this is key, to make decisions as well as or better than human beings, and faster.”He offered an example of a smart missile that is able to assess a situation, choose the best target based on preset parameters. In the example, the missile spots an enemy tank formation, determines which is the command tank and picks the most lethal form of attack to incapacitate the enemy.“That is a good thing. It’s a totally autonomous weapon and it will do what it’s asked to do,” Work said. “It won’t say, ‘Hey, I woke up this morning and I decided I want to shoot down an airplane.’ A general AI system sets its own goals and can change them. No one in the Department of Defense is saying we ought to go toward those type of weapons.”Work referenced the department’s Project Maven, a high-profile Pentagon program that made headlines when Google employees petitioned their company to remove itself from the project for ethical reasons. The former deputy secretary noted the true name inside the Pentagon is the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, with a focus on merging human and machine intelligence in a way that improves human decision-making.“Human-machine collaboration is using machines to make better human decisions,” he said. “The human is always in front in terms of DOD thinking.”

World’s First Painting Produced By Artificial Intelligence Fetches Huge Sum

The first “painting” to be produced by artificial intelligence fetched nearly half a million dollars after an auction held by Christie’s in late October 2018.
The portrait of “Edmond De Belamy” sold for $432,500, or 43.5 times the estimated price, Christie’s said in a statement. It is the first piece of Artificial Intelligence art sold at a major auction house.
The new owner is an anonymous phone bidder, who won it after “a battle between three phone bidders, an online participant in France and one gentleman in the room,” the statement continued.ADVERTISEMENT
A genuine Picasso print in the same auction sold for about the same price as the AI painting.
 
 







A section work of art created by an algorithm by French collective named OBVIOUS which produces art using artificial intelligence, is titled ‘Portrait of Edmond de Belamy’ (estimate: $7,000-10,000) at Christies in New York on October 22, 2018. Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images
The AI portrait is of a gentleman dressed in black and framed in gold, resembling a work from the 18th or 19th century. But up close the face is fuzzy and the picture looks unfinished. Instead of an artist’s signature, it has the stamp of a mathematical formula on the bottom right of the painting.
“The art was created by a French collective of artists and artificial intelligence researchers called Obvious with code mostly borrowed from a 19-year-old AI artist and programmer named Robbie Barrat,” according to Adweek. “The group fed a system called a Generative Adversarial Network with a data set of 15,000 pieces painted between the 14th and 20th centuries.
One component of the network would then paint its own work based on what it saw and try to fool another algorithm, which was programmed to tell the difference between real and algorithmically generated art.”

After the sale, Obvious released a statement: “We would like to thank the A.I. community, especially to those who have been pioneering the use of this new technology, including Ian Goodfellow, the creator of the GAN algorithm, who inspired the name of the Famille de Belamy series, and artist Robbie Barrat.”
Collective member Pierre Fautrel said to ABC News, “We are really fascinated by the power of algorithms. We begin to discuss, if you create art like this, is this art?”
The subject of the painting, Edmond Belamy, is a member of a fictional family of 11 of the collective’s machine-created portraits that resemble the type of aristocrats you might see in classical European portraiture, said Adweek. “While the complexities of facial features typically make portraits tougher for computers to mimic than other forms, the collective felt it was the best way to show off their algorithm’s proficiency, according to Hugo Caselles-Dupré of Obvious.”

Richard Lloyd, International Head of Prints and Multiples at Christie’s, persuaded the collective to put the print up for sale in order to advance the debate about artificial intelligence in art. “I know it’s a debate that’s going on quite widely, I thought that in a way this marked a watershed — or slightly a tipping point,” he told AFP.
Christie’s had an interesting analysis of the painting: “The portrait in its gilt frame depicts a portly gentleman, possibly French and — to judge by his dark frockcoat and plain white collar — a man of the church. The work appears unfinished: the facial features are somewhat indistinct and there are blank areas of canvas. Oddly, the whole composition is displaced slightly to the north-west.”

The sale of the painting has some people talking about the Singularity, the theory that one day an artificial intelligence will emerge and completely change humanity and the world itself. This idea reached popular culture in the film The Terminator.
But as Christie’s writer pointed out, this painting highlights the genuine limitations of the AI program in art.

“It departs from a human idea of an 18th-century portrait. There is something weirdly contemporary about him: he looks unnervingly like one of Glenn Brown’s art-historical appropriations.”

Experts concluded that portrait painting is an extremely tough genre for AI to excel at, since humans are highly attuned to the curves and complexities of a face in a way that a machine cannot be, said Christie’s.

If you were to squint, it might be passable as one of the Old Masters.But of course, all of art is subjective.Obvious, a collective of artists and artificial intelligence researchers based in Paris, created the work by feeding their system 15,000 portraits spanning from the 14th to 20th centuries.Hugo Caselles-Dupré, a member of Obvious, explained the origins of the painting, noting the two parts of an algorithm, the generator and the discriminator.“The Generator makes a new image based on the set, then the Discriminator tries to spot the difference between a human-made image and one created by the Generator,” he said. “The aim is to fool the Discriminator into thinking that the new images are real-life portraits. Then we have a result.”Keeping with tradition, the bottom of the work is signed ""min G max D Ex [log (D(x))] + Ez [log(1 - D (G(z)))]"" — a piece of code from the algorithm used to create the work.The debate over whether machines can make art — and whether the Old Masters would be rolling in their graves — is just scratching the surface.The sale is also raising questions about ethics when it comes to the marriage of artificial intelligence and art.RecommendedEconomyEconomyLower capital gains tax, cuts to food benefits: What Project 2025 could mean for your walletMarketsMarketsStock market shrugs off Trump assassination attempt, bucking historical norms""Edmond Belamy"" was created using code that Robbie Barrat — a Stanford University researcher who had gained notoriety for teaching a computer to write rap lyrics, based on the work of Kanye West — wrote when he was 17.Barrat shared the free code on GitHub at the time, a common practice among coders.However, after he saw the images for sale in April, Barrat followed up and asked for credit, saying he was under the impression this was an open source project.“Here's the code to the network they copied. If any of you guys want to make a quick $10,000 from my work, now is the perfect time,” Barrat tweeted, referring to the starting price Christie's had set for the portrait.Obvious countered by posting a screenshot of a conversation the collective said it had with Barrat in April, in which he apparently wrote: “You don’t owe me any credit or anything.”Obvious has since tweeted that it has credited Barrat and talked about his contribution in interviews. Barrat and Obvious did not immediately respond to a request for comment by NBC News.Either way, the Stanford researcher clearly isn't impressed.“It’s horrible art, from an aesthetic standpoint,” he told the Washington Post. “You have to put some work into it to call it art. It’s something that everybody can do. You can clone this from GitHub, start your computer and start doing it. I don’t know that that’s what art is about.""Alyssa NewcombAlyssa Newcomb is an NBC News contributor who writes about business and technology.",,,,,,

“Portrait of Edmond Belamy” (2018) created by GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) and sold for $432,500 on October 25 at Christie’s in New York (image courtesy Christie’s/ © Obvious)
Artificial intelligence (AI) has finally arrived on the auction block, smashing sales expectations by over 40-fold. The computer-generated portrait, which was sold by Christie’s on behalf of a trio of French techies who call themselves Obvious, surpassed original estimates ranging between $7,000–$10,000 to earn an astonishing $432,500 price tag.
Days before the hammer fell, however, reports slowly trickled in that Obvious may have cribbed its code from 19-year-old artist and high school graduate Robbie Barrat.
Within the programming world, Barrat has built a reputation for his exceptional generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithms that train two discriminant networks to effectively act as “artist” and “judge.” The artist builds a system of patterns while the judge checks the result against an original sample; from there, the artist revises his work and the system repeats itself until the GAN has created a passable work of art.
 
 

Here are some AI generated nude portraits I’ve been working on🍑Usually the machine just paints people as blobs of flesh with tendrils and limbs randomly growing out – I think it’s really surreal. I wonder if that’s how machines see us… pic.twitter.com/tYgzCHGfse— Robbie Barrat (@videodrome) March 27, 2018

Pictures created using AI GANs have a distinct aesthetic that’s somewhere in-between Surrealism and melted candle wax: borders between distinct objects often get blurred or ultra-shiny. Many of the preexisting AI GAN artworks also derive from Romantic landscape paintings or portraiture, which contributes to the spookiness of the style.

Members of Obvious readily admit that they borrowed elements of Barrat’s code, but says they tweaked the algorithm to produce different results. “If you’re just talking about the code, then there is not a big percentage that has been modified,” says Hugo Caselles-Dupré, the tech lead for Obvious and a machine learning PhD in Paris. “But if you talk about working on the computer, making it work, there is a lot of effort there.”
This exchange is preserved on one of GitHub’s discussion boards where Caselles-Dupré simply goes by the name, “Caselles.” There, he asks Barrat for a version of the code with enhanced resolution capabilities and questions the original programmer about his pre-trained models on the website.

Am I crazy for thinking that they really just used my network and are selling the results? pic.twitter.com/wAdSOe7gwz— Robbie Barrat (@DrBeef_) October 25, 2018

One day before the Christie’s auction of Obvious’s AI-generated artwork, Barrat publicly questioned precisely how much the French group changed his original code on Twitter. The teenage programmer even posted side-by-side comparisons of Obvious’s “Portrait of Edmond Belamy” (2018) and nine of his own works, which show an uncanny resemblance.
Obvious responded on the Twitter thread showing a video demonstrating their AI’s training process as separate from Barrat’s GAN algorithm. The group also shared an April correspondence with Barret, in which they asked the teenage programmer for his blessing to use his code for an undescribed project.
 
 

“We do not want you to think that we stole your work or anything like that. We were inspired by your work to create our collection,” Obvious writes.
“Yeah — I’m 100% okay with it; sounds like interesting work and I’m glad that you found some of my code useful. You don’t owe me any credit or anything,” responded Barrat, back in April.
However, Barrat has now voiced concerns that Obvious misrepresented their moneymaking intentions as an open source project of democratization. Because of that, he takes issue with the lack of recognition he’s received as an instrumental component to the “Portrait of Edmond Belamy’s” existence.
Responding to comments on Twitter, Barrat also clarified that he actually did retract his permission to Obvious once he realized that they weren’t doing an open source project, but were instead selling the outputs of its algorithm.
In a statement by Obvious provided to Hyperallergic through Christie’s, the collective said:
We would like to thank the A.I. community, especially to those who have been pioneering the use of this new technology, including Ian Goodfellow, the creator of the GAN algorithm, who inspired the name of the Famille de Belamy series, and artist Robbie Barrat, who has been a great influence for us. It is an exciting moment and our hope is that the spotlight on this sale will bring forward the amazing work that our predecessors and colleagues have been producing. We are grateful to Christie’s for opening up this dialogue in the art community and honored to have been a part of this global conversation about the impact of this new technology in the creation of art.
A Christie’s spokesperson also noted that the collective has given Barrat credit in their Medium post about the project, during a panel with Bloomberg, and in the lot’s cataloging.
Here’s the code to the network they copied. If any of you guys want to make a quick $10,000 from my work, now is the perfect time. https://t.co/V7iCHvL1Dt— Robbie Barrat (@DrBeef_) October 25, 2018

 
 

Code-sharing is a very common practice in the programming community because it’s seen as a democratic way to expedite the development of technology. Unlike appropriation in the art world, such practices rarely attract controversy. The “Belamy” case is an exception because it raises the difficult question of how much code Obvious should have altered for their program to become sufficiently different from Barrat’s original. And if AI-generated art is going to accrue hundreds of thousands of dollars, then what compensation — if any — is owed to the primary coder?

Data Analytics & Artificial Intelligence








The emergence of artificial intelligence is altering the way we study, work and communicate — a rapid shift described as the fourth industrial revolution. To prepare the engineering leaders of tomorrow to excel in this environment, U of T Engineering is launching a new minor and certificate in artificial intelligence (AI) engineering in January 2019.
“Machine learning (ML) and AI have exploded in importance in recent years,” said Professor Jason Anderson (ECE), director of the new AI minor. “Demand for ML/AI talent in industry and academia are extremely high. Moreover, as the scope of applications broadens, it is believed that demand will exceed supply in this field for years to come.”
To complete the minor, engineering students will need to take six half-year courses (or equivalent) that explore ML and AI concepts, including a new course in AI fundamentals. Courses also delve into topics such as data mining, neural networks and deep learning. The certificate requires three half-year courses.
The new minor and certificate adds to a growing list of AI-focused initiatives and experiential learning opportunities at U of T Engineering, in anticipation of the complex challenges that lie ahead as AI enables new ways of living and working.
“Applications of artificial intelligence transcend traditional disciplines,” said Cristina Amon, dean of the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering. “With this new minor and certificate, our undergraduate students have the opportunity to enrich their experience and explore this important and evolving area alongside world-leading researchers.”
This fall, the Faculty introduced a machine intelligence major in Engineering Science, the first undergraduate engineering program of its kind in Canada. Offered to professional-stream graduate students is the Master of Engineering in Analytics. In addition, U of T Engineering is providing pathways for undergraduates to gain valuable experience in AI through the Professional Experience Co-op Program (PEY Co-op).
“I’m delighted that U of T Engineering is launching these initiatives. The new certificate and minor in AI demonstrate our desire and our agility to continually adapt our undergraduate curricular offerings to incorporate forward-looking technologies crucial to engineering’s future,” said Anderson.
Upon completion of the minor or certificate, Anderson says that students will have the expertise to integrate their knowledge more broadly in other courses in their engineering disciplines. The programs will also prepare students to become leaders in the field, well positioned to pursue lucrative careers in AI when they graduate.
“Students will be well-poised to apply their AI knowledge within Ontario’s, and more broadly, Canada’s high-tech industry. Canada has long stood at the forefront of AI research, and has recently drawn multinationals such as Facebook, Uber and Samsung to establish Canadian labs with an AI focus,” said Anderson. “Many startups and larger enterprises in Toronto apply AI techniques for myriad purposes, making graduates of the minor and certificate highly-sought after.”
Enrolment will begin in January. The program is open to U of T Engineering undergraduate students in all disciplines and all years.
