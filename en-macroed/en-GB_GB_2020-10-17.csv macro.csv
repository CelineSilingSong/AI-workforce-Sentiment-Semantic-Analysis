Can Artificial Intelligence Help Students Work Better Together? According to Research, the Answer is Yes.
WPI computer scientist looks at better collaboration between AI and humans in today’s classrooms.







October 19, 2020



WPI assistant professor of computer science Jacob Whitehill is collaborating with colleagues at the University of Colorado Boulder to explore how artificially intelligent (AI) teaching agents might help encourage more meaningful collaboration among students in school classrooms.

As part of a five-year, $20 million grant awarded by the National Science Foundation to CU Boulder, Whitehilll and colleagues at nine other institutions will study how to build AI agents that interact with students in small-group collaborative problem-solving settings and thereby foster more enriching learning experiences for students.
“There is so much evidence that students learn best when they learn actively and collaborate with each other in real time,” says Whitehill, who specializes in AI and machine learning. “But that’s not always easy for teachers to achieve, whether the collaboration is happening in a physical classroom or during remote learning.”
Under the grant, of which WPI will receive almost $612,000, Whitehill and his colleagues will work with two public school districts in Colorado, building and testing different forms of “AI Partners” in the classroom—ranging from a simple iPad with a camera and microphone, to animated interactive avatars that perceive and understand students’ language, gestures, facial expressions. The role of the AI Partner will vary depending on the situation: In some settings, the Partner might play the role of another “student” who is learning the curriculum alongside the human students. In other settings, the Partner might be a coach who keeps the students on-topic and makes sure everyone is contributing meaningfully to the conversation.
“The AI Partner might, for example, ask a particular student to share their ideas, particularly if they had been quiet for most of the time,” Whitehill says.
The role of Whitehill’s team will be to use multi-modal machine learning to develop social signal processing algorithms to determine who is talking when, and to estimate the emotion of each person.










WPI professor Jacob Whitehill’s research with CU Boulder stems from his earlier work toward building an Automatic Classroom Observation Recognition neural Network (ACORN) , which analyzes videos of school classrooms and estimates the level of “emotional support” exhibited by students and teachers. ACORN can provide researchers and teachers with a new “lens” with which to observe classrooms objectively, potentially lowering the costs of teacher training.
Many WPI graduate and undergraduate students have helped advance this research since its early stages, Whitehill says, particularly through machine learning research in the areas of emotion recognition, speaker identification, and human behavior recognition.












Once the AI Partners are integrated in these classrooms, Whitehill and his team will be able to collect data on how students interact with them, and then iteratively make them more intelligent and effective. Initially, the AI Partner might be controlled by a human teacher in a backroom (“Wizard of Oz”-style interaction), but over time, it can learn from its human controller what to do when and thereby become more autonomous. Whitehill and his team anticipate that the particular form that the Partner takes is likely also important.
“Students might find an embodied robot creepy, but they might like interacting with an animated avatar on a touchscreen,” he says.
This project represents a shift in how researchers envision AI in the classroom. While earlier work in this field sought to fully automate the teaching process, which Whitehill considers to be infeasible, this project is about human-AI teaming, and how humans and teachers possess complementary abilities. AI Partners can help to magnify teachers’ existing strengths by increasing the number of students in the classroom who receive the real-time feedback they need for optimal learning.
Whitehill also says that this research will be greatly informative even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many school districts across the country are participating in remote learning. In fact, he says testing agent-student interactions over platforms like Zoom have certain advantages over in-person interactions.
“With Zoom, each student and teacher in the classroom is cleanly separated from each other, and all their audiovisual inputs are channeled through a common software interface. This makes it much easier to analyze their speech, gestures, language, and interactions with each other,” Whitehill says. “In contrast, in normal, in-person classrooms, the interactions are much messier,” since students often sit in all kinds of different positions, might be touching their faces, and work in a noisy environment, which makes it more challenging for the Partner to observe and analyze.
By the end of this research, Whitehill says he hopes to find practical teaching and coaching strategies that AI Partners can execute that work well with students. “It’s not clear at all that the way humans teach would work well for a computer, robot, or avatar,” he says.
While the computational challenges of the project—signal processing in extremely noisy and cluttered settings, real-time control in an uncertain environment, and human-computer interaction for a novel setting—are formidable, Whitehill says the potential rewards make it worth the effort.
“The exciting thing about this project is that we get to completely rethink the role of AI in the classroom,” he says. “My hope is that, through next-generation educational AI, we will be able to stimulate deeper critical thinking and collaboration among students to help them learn better and achieve more.”

If you think that the Sahara is covered only by golden dunes and scorched rocks, you aren't alone. Perhaps it's time to shelve that notion. In an area of West Africa 30 times larger than Denmark, an international team, led by University of Copenhagen and NASA researchers, has counted over 1.8 billion trees and shrubs. The 1.3 million km2 area covers the western-most portion of the Sahara Desert, the Sahel and what are known as sub-humid zones of West Africa. 
""We were very surprised to see that quite a few trees actually grow in the Sahara Desert, because up until now, most people thought that virtually none existed. We counted hundreds of millions of trees in the desert alone. Doing so wouldn't have been possible without this technology. Indeed, I think it marks the beginning of a new scientific era,"" asserts Assistant Professor Martin Brandt of the University of Copenhagen's Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, lead author of the study's scientific article, now published in Nature.
The work was achieved through a combination of detailed satellite imagery provided by NASA, and deep learning -- an advanced artificial intelligence method. Normal satellite imagery is unable to identify individual trees, they remain literally invisible. Moreover,  a limited interest in counting trees outside of forested areas led to the prevailing view that there were almost no trees in this particular region. This is the first time that trees across a large dryland region have been counted. 
The role of trees in the global carbon budget
 New knowledge about trees in dryland areas like this is important for several reasons, according to Martin Brandt. For example, they represent an unknown factor when it comes to the global carbon budget: 
""Trees outside of forested areas are usually not included in climate models, and we know very little about their carbon stocks. They are basically a white spot on maps and an unknown component in the global carbon cycle,"" explains Martin Brandt.
Furthermore, the new study can contribute to better understanding the importance of trees for biodiversity and ecosystems and for the people living in these areas. In particular, enhanced knowledge about trees is also important for developing programmes that promote agroforestry, which plays a major environmental and socio-economic role in arid regions.       
""Thus, we are also interested in using satellites to determine tree species, as tree types are significant in relation to their value to local populations who use wood resources as part of their livelihoods. Trees and their fruit are consumed by both livestock and humans, and when preserved in the fields, trees have a positive effect on crop yields because they improve the balance of water and nutrients,"" explains Professor Rasmus Fensholt of the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management.
Technology with a high potential
 The research was conducted in collaboration with the University of Copenhagen's Department of Computer Science, where researchers developed the deep learning algorithm that made the counting of trees over such a large area possible.
The researchers show the deep learning model what a tree looks like: They do so by feeding it thousands of images of various trees. Based upon the recognition of tree shapes, the model can then automatically identify and map trees over large areas and thousands of images. The model needs only hours what would take thousands of humans several years to achieve. 
""This technology has enormous potential when it comes to documenting changes on a global scale and ultimately, in contributing towards global climate goals. We are motivated to develop this type of beneficial artificial intelligence,"" says professor and co-author Christian Igel of the Department of Computer Science.
The next step is to expand the count to a much larger area in Africa. And in the longer term, the aim is to create a global database of all trees growing outside forest areas. ###
FACTS:
 The researchers counted 1.8 billion trees and shrubs with crowns larger than 3 m2. Thus, the actual number of trees in the area is even higher.
  Deep learning can be characterized as an advanced artificial intelligence method where an algorithm is trained to recognize specific patterns in large amounts of data. The algorithm used in this research was trained using nearly 90,000 images of different trees across a variety of landscapes. 
  The scientific article for this study is published in the renowned journal Nature. 
  The research was carried out by researchers from the University of Copenhagen; NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, USA; HCI Group, University of Bremen, Germany; Université Paul Sabatier, France; Pastoralisme Conseil, France; Centre de Suivi Ecologique, Senegal; Geosciences Environnement Toulouse (GET), France; Ecole Normale Supérieure, France; Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium.

Currently, Southern has over 452 thousand subscribers on YouTube and “Lovesick” a song from the album was listened and viewed by more than 45,000 viewers. But since then, the application of AI in this field has both got more sophisticated and branched out further. Open AI has created MuseNet, as the company explains, “a deep neural network that can generate 4-minute musical compositions with 10 different instruments and can combine styles from country to Mozart to the Beatles. MuseNet was not explicitly programmed with our understanding of music, but instead discovered patterns of harmony, rhythm, and style by learning to predict the next token in hundreds of thousands of MIDI files. MuseNet uses the same general-purpose unsupervised technology as GPT-2, a large-scale transformer model trained to predict the next token in a sequence, whether audio or text.”On the other hand, as GeekWire, among others, reports, Dr. Mick Grierson, computer scientist and musician from Goldsmiths, University of London was recently commissioned by the Italian car manufacturer Fiat to produce a list of 50 most iconic pop songs using algorithms. His analytical software was used to “determine what makes the songs noteworthy, including key, the number of beats per minute, chord variety, lyrical content, timbral variety, and sonic variance.”According to his results, the song that had the best cocktail of the set parameters was Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” ahead of U2’s “One” and John Lennon’s “Imagine”. Nirvana’s song was then used by FIAT to promote its new FIAT 500 model. Grierson explained that the algorithms showed that, ‘the sounds these songs use and the way they are combined is highly unique in each case.’Another application was prepared by musicnn library, which as explained, uses deep convolutional neural networks to automatically tag songs. The models “that are included achieve the best scores in public evaluation benchmarks.” music (as in musician) and its best models have been released as an open-source library. The project has been developed by the Music Technology Group of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, located in Barcelona, Spain.In his analysis of the application, Jordi Pons used musicnn to analyze and tag another iconic song, Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.” He noticed that the singing voice of Freddie Mercury was tagged as a female voice, while its other predictions were quite accurate. Making musicnn available as open-source makes it possible to further refine the tagging process.

Expanding AI’s Impact With Organizational Learning









October 20, 2020


by: Sam Ransbotham, Shervin Khodabandeh, David Kiron, François Candelon, Michael Chu, and Burt LaFountain


Most companies developing AI capabilities have yet to gain significant financial benefits from their efforts. Only when organizations add the ability to learn with AI do significant benefits become likely.















Only 10% of companies obtain significant financial benefits from artificial intelligence technologies. Why so few?
Our research shows that these companies intentionally change processes, broadly and deeply, to facilitate organizational learning with AI. Better organizational learning enables them to act precisely when sensing opportunity and to adapt quickly when conditions change. Their strategic focus is organizational learning, not just machine learning.
Organizational learning with AI is demanding. It requires humans and machines to not only work together but also learn from each other — over time, in the right way, and in the appropriate contexts. This cycle of mutual learning makes humans and machines smarter, more relevant, and more effective. Mutual learning between human and machine is essential to success with AI. But it’s difficult to achieve at scale.

The research and analysis for this report was conducted under the direction of the authors as part of an MIT Sloan Management Review research initiative in collaboration with and sponsored by Boston Consulting Group.

Our research — based on a global survey of more than 3,000 managers, as well as interviews with executives and scholars — confirms that a majority of companies are developing AI capabilities but have yet to gain significant financial benefits from their efforts. More than half of all respondents affirm that their companies are piloting or deploying AI (57%), have an AI strategy (59%), and understand how AI can generate business value (70%). These numbers reflect statistically significant increases in adoption, strategy development, and understanding from four years ago. What’s more, a growing number of companies recognize a business imperative to improve their AI competencies. Despite these trends, just 1 in 10 companies generates significant financial benefits with AI.
We analyzed responses to over 100 survey questions to better understand what really enables companies to generate significant financial benefits with AI. We found that getting the basics right — like having the right data, technology, and talent, organized around a corporate strategy — is far from sufficient. Only 20% of companies achieve significant financial benefits with these fundamentals alone. Getting the basics right and building AI solutions that the business wants and can use improve the odds of obtaining significant financial benefits, but to just 39%.
Our key finding: Only when organizations add the ability to learn with AI do significant benefits become likely.

Our survey results indicate that smaller businesses — in contrast with larger organizations — capture most of their AI-related benefits from learning with the most autonomous mode (AI decides and implements). One reason may be that smaller companies typically have less organizational complexity, which can make it easier to realize significant financial benefits from automation than at larger companies.

Only 11% of companies surveyed say they get any financial benefits from AI implementation. What’s holding the others back? 
When the pandemic accelerated organizations’ digital transformation, the first technology that gained higher acceptance was artificial intelligence (AI). Companies rushed to understand how it works and what aspects of their business and people processes can be adapted to include AI. The overall belief is that it will raise productivity and performance as well.
A new studyOpens a new window  by MIT Sloan and BCG titled Expanding AI’s Impact With Organizational Learning shares a crucial finding. Only 11% of companies are getting significant ROI from AI technologies. The big difference between these companies and those who don’t get financial returns is that the former focus on organizational learning, not just machine learning. They are open to changing their processes to enable higher levels of learning.
Responses of 3,000 executives to 100 survey questions were analyzed to find that identifying, investing in, and implementing AI is not enough to make it a valuable game-changer in organizational performance. Employees and leaders need to learn how to learn from AI and transfer their own learning back to AI. The cycle of learning must be continuous and collective for it to make a significant difference.
When AI Use Results in Financial Benefits
As per the study, some organizations can double their opportunities to have high financial benefits from AI with one step – allowing humans and AI to learn from each other mutually.
The roles of machines and humans are not defined. They are fluid and change based on the situation. Strategy is also rooted in digital data as well as human experience as per the report.
Leaders follow five models of AI implementation, based on the report findings, with two models being most successful:

AI recommends and humans implement
AI generates insights and humans use them in the decision-making process

While companies are at the threshold of adapting to AI’s role, a structured process must be established for humans to learn how AI works and when human intervention is required to add value. This understanding of how human and machine learning can be facilitated will drive the success of any AI solution.

Bringing Human and Machine Learning Together
The lines between human learning and machine learning are blurring. But therein lies the reason for its importance. Each model has its pros and cons, but it is crucial to understand the two models in which leaders have seen more success.
AI the recommender: AI recommends, human decides
It is evident that machines are equipped with enough data and past insights for it to offer recommendations. This indicates that it can integrate multiple facets needed for problem-solving. But when companies use this approach, the final decision-making is left to humans. Human beings can gauge the steps that AI took to arrive at the recommendation and add their own assumptions or business context to evaluate whether that recommendation is implementable.
AI the illuminator: AI generates insights, humans base decisions on them
In this model, the AI does the entire thinking through in terms of data and what it is pointing toward. It does not make recommendations, but it does give insights from the data that can enable humans to arrive at a logical solution. The insights form the basis of further decision-making, which can result in multiple options for problem-solving as against weighing the pros and cons of a specific recommendation.

Companies are in the nascent stages of their understanding of AI and its application. Some believe that it will result in job loss. But when applied in the right context, AI can result in job elevation, evolution, and redesign.

AI conferences have a flawed review process

AI conferences are highly biased in favor of top-tier academic institutions, reputable researchers, and male contributors
This article is part of our reviews of AI research papers, a series of posts that explore the latest findings in artificial intelligence.
With the past decade seeing renewed interest in artificial intelligence, research and publication in the field has grown immensely. And while publishing an AI paper online is not very difficult, it is acceptance and presentation at conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, and ICML that give needed credit and exposure to the work done by researchers.
Organizers of AI conferences face the mounting challenge of having many more submissions than they have space for. As a result, a small percentage of submitted papers make it to mainstream AI conferences.
The question is, are AI conferences choosing the best research for presentation? A new paper published on OpenReview and submitted to ICLR 2021 investigates the quality of the AI conference review process. Titled “An Open Review of OpenReview,” the document reveals some of the flaws of the review process for machine learning conferences, including inconsistent scoring, institutional bias, and lower acceptance rates for female researchers.

The AI conference review process
The paper focuses on the ICLR review process, though other conferences use similar methodologies. Each AI paper submitted to the conference goes through several steps before being accepted or rejected. The process involves, reviewers, area chairs, and program chairs.
Area chairs are experts that have experience in specific domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing. They do not review individual papers but control the process. They guide reviewers, moderate discussions, and make recommendations based on the feedback they get from authors and reviewers.
Reviewers are the people who work on individual papers. Each paper is assigned to several reviewers, who read it in full and verify the code and data that comes with the paper to make sure the findings are valid and reproducible. They correspond with the author and the area chairs to clarify questions that need to be answered, and finally, they give their final recommendations on whether a paper should be accepted or rejected.
Program chairs are senior scientists and experts that make high-level decisions, including the final decision on which papers get rejected or accepted. They can also intervene in the review process if needed.
The ICLR review process (source: ICRL website)
Experts can apply to become reviewers and area chairs at ICLR, but most are invited by the organizers.
The entire process is registered on the OpenReview platform, where everyone can see the feedback given by reviewers, authors, area chairs, and program chairs. OpenReview also accepts public comments from people who are not involved in the review process.
Example of paper rejected on OpenReview
Investigating the AI research paper review process
The authors of the paper, who remain anonymous as of this writing, were keen on answering the question: Do conference reviews consistently identify high-quality work? Or has review degenerated into censorship?
To make an informed decision, they used public information registered in OpenReview, including titles, abstracts, authors lists, emails, scores, and reviews for more than 5,000 papers submitted to ICLR conferences from 2017 to 2020. The authors obtained additional information about withdrawn papers after communicating with the administrators of OpenReview.
The researchers used different methods to find additional information, such as the impact of papers and authors on other AI research work. They also analyzed the paper data to determine the topic of each paper.
Is the review process reproducible?
The first question the researchers answered was whether there was any amount of randomness involved in the acceptance or rejection of AI research papers. This means that, for instance, if an accepted paper went through the review process again, would it be accepted again?
To perform this test, the researchers created a regression model from paper scores and the final decision made by the area chairs. Then they simulated the process by generating scores the fit the threshold and checked to see how many times the model reproduced the same decision on the paper. They ran the simulation separately for the papers submitted to each year, and the results were disappointing.
“We observe a downward trend in reproducibility, with scores decreasing from 75% in 2017, to 70% in 2018 and 2019, to 66% in 2020,” the authors write.
Even when they increased the number of reviewers in their simulation, the gains were not significant. “While reproducibility scores increase with more reviewers, gains are marginal; increasing the number of reviewers from 2 to 5 boosts reproducibility by just 3%,” the authors write. “As more reviewers are added, the high level of disagreement among area chairs remains constant, while the standard error in mean scores falls slowly. The result is paltry gains in reproducibility.”
Adding to the number of reviewers of AI research papers does not result in significant gains.
To improve the process, the authors recommend to use a small number of reviewers and ad ad-hoc reviewers where first-round reviews are uninformative.
What is the impact of accepted AI research?
Papers accepted at major AI conferences should help advance future artificial intelligence research. In their work, the authors of the OpenReview paper analyzed the impact of both accepted and rejected AI research papers. “We measure impact using citation rate, calculated by dividing citation count by the number of days since the paper was first published online,” they write.
In other words, impactful papers should receive more citations from other AI researchers. Naturally, papers accepted and presented at AI conferences gain more exposure and by extension more citations than rejected work. But when comparing accepted papers among themselves, the researchers found a very small correlation between citation and review scores.
Scatterplot shows citation and impact of papers are very marginally correlated.
“Our dataset shows that reproducibility scores, correlations with impact, and reviewer agreement have all gone down over the years,” the authors write.
Institution and reputation bias in the AI review process
The authors of the paper were also interested in knowing whether there was a preference for AI research done at prestigious academic institutions or tech companies. “We found that 85% of papers across all years (87% in 2020) had at least one academic author,” the authors write, adding that this finding per se does not imply bias toward and can fairly be related to the quality of research done at these institutions.
To further investigate, they “controlled for paper score,” which means they verified whether area chairs showed any bias when deciding on papers that had similar scores.
“We found that, even after controlling for reviewer scores, being a top ten institution leads to a boost in the likelihood of getting accepted,” the authors write. This bias remained even when the researcher only considered the affiliation of the last author of the AI papers (last authors are usually the senior person who oversees the research or heads the lab where the research takes place).
There was a significant preference for Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and Cornell universities, the authors found. Another interesting point that confirms this finding is that author identity visibility improves its review score. The authors of an AI paper submitted to OpenReview remain anonymous to reviewers while it is going through the review process. But at the same time, the researchers can publish their paper in other mediums, such as the arXiv preprint server. The researchers found that AI papers appearing on arXiv before the review process tended to do better, especially if the researchers were associated with CMU, MIT, or Cornell.
Reviewers of AI conferences prefer to accept papers submitted from researchers associated with top-tier universities
The authors of the OpenReview analysis also found that, all things equal, area chairs generally preferred submissions authored by highly reputed individuals.
Interestingly, their research did not find a significant bias toward large tech companies such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, which house reputable AI researchers. At first glance, this is a positive finding, because big tech already has a vast influence over commercial AI and, by extension, on AI research.
But as other authors have pointed out, the same academic institutions that are very well represented at AI conferences serve as talent pools for big tech companies and receive much of their funding from those same organizations. So this just creates a feedback loop of a narrow group of people promoting each other’s work and hiring each other at the expense of others.
Also concerning is the under-representation of women in AI conferences. The gender gap is a well-known problem in the AI community (and the tech community in general), and it carries over to the paper review process. “We observe a gender gap in the review process, with women first authors achieving a lower acceptance rate than men (23.5% vs 27.1%),” the authors of the OpenReview analysis observe in their paper.
The researchers add that while in 2019, women made up 23.2 percent of all computer science PhD students, only 10.6 percent of publications at ICLR 2020 had a female first author (the first author is the lead contributor of the AI research). Meanwhile, women constitute 22.6 percent of computer science faculty in the U.S. but only 9.7 percent of senior authors at ICLR.
“We observe a gender gap in the review process, with women first authors achieving a lower acceptance rate than men (23.5% vs 27.1%),” the authors of the analysis add.
Why is this important?

“When the number of papers with merit is greater than the number of papers that will be accepted, it is inevitable that decisions become highly subjective and that biases towards certain kinds of papers, topics, institution, and authors become endemic,” the authors conclude in their paper.
As artificial intelligence continues to gain prominence in different areas of life, it is important that it becomes inclusive and represents all different demographics. AI conferences serve as hubs to draw attention to influential work that can have a great impact on future applications and research. When the review process favors one group of people, the effects can ripple to other areas that benefit from AI research, including health care, finance, hiring, and the justice system.
AI conference organizers should certainly reconsider the review process and take measures to ensure all researchers get a fair shot at having their work presented at prestigious venues. The work also has a message for the rest of us, the people who are following and covering AI research. We should all be aware that while AI conferences are a good criterion for where the community is headed, there is plenty of good research that never find their way into the spotlight. I’ve had some great experience unearthing some of these gems while perusing the machine learning subreddit, the AI and deep learning Facebook group, and creating my own list of AI researchers and computer scientists to follow on Twitter. I’m proud to have been able to give some of these researchers the exposure their work deserves. I’m sure others can do even better than me.

 There's a big brain at work in Baldur's Gate 3, and I'm not talking about the monster. It's actually an artificial intelligence that's tirelessly pushing the game's boundaries, pressing different combinations of buttons and input commands faster than a human could ever hope for, and it's letting Larian Studios develop their game faster and more efficiently than ever before. 






 In the before times, all this work had to be done by QA testers--basically humans whose sole job was to try and break the game. While this might seem like just playing video games all day long, it's actually tedious, monotonous work. You're not so much playing the game as you are running into walls and pressing weird input combinations to see what happens. 

 Larian still has QA testers in their employ, but a lot of the grunt work has been taken over by an artificial intelligence that Larian calls World Tester. In an interview with Polygon, the developer explains that World Tester is a sort of ""super gamer,"" going through combat, dialog options, and menus in search of bugs at ""lightning speed."" 

 With every new build of Baldur's Gate 3, World Tester gets first crack at it, and only after it reports the build to be safe does an actual human start poking around.

 “In the early years, it was just teleporting an NPC across regions, testing performance markers and looking for basic crashes,” Larian said, referring to their time developing Divinity: Original Sin. Since that game's 2014 release, World Tester has been evolving to perform more complex tasks, but Larian says it's not going to fully replace humans. At least, not yet. 

 via screenshot   

 “Our QA teams across the world are extremely important, and the world-tester is really not as smart as it thinks it is."" 

 AI is great and all, but it'll never figure out how to kill all the goblins at Selûne's temple without ever casting a single spell. 





 Baldur’s Gate 3 has already exceeded one million units sold, but players should keep in mind that their Early Access save files won’t transfer over to the final product when it eventually releases.

Hackathon is open to the public and will take place November 6-8, 2020
Cambridge, Mass., October 19, 2020—In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person health care switched to telemedicine and digital health, businesses quickly had to adapt to remote work, and supply chain disruptions affected manufacturing and necessitated challenging resource allocation decisions. The nature of work had been changing for decades. COVID-19 accelerated that trajectory.

Umbereen S. Nehal, MD, MPH, a current MIT Sloan Fellow, lead organizer of Hack4theFuture, and former Chief Medical Officer
In anticipation of the complex business and healthcare operations this winter and the virtual solutions that will need to be extended well into 2021, MIT Sloan is hosting Hack4theFuture. Hack4theFuture is a 48-hour virtual event that will focus on this accelerated transition and on humanizing artificial intelligence for the future of work and systems in the age of COVID-19. The hackathon is part of the MIT COVID-19 Challenge series with Hack4theFuture taking place November 6-8, 2020.
Many of the challenges that the hackathon will address were predicted in discussions of what the Future of Work would entail—namely the increasing use of artificial intelligence, automation and robotics and their potential to displace workers or encode biases. Now, some of those feared Future of Work solutions are helping to keep us safe while maintaining vital business operations. With the right people at the table, AI-enabled solutions can continue to advance technology while serving humanism and equity goals.
Hack4theFuture will be the first of the series focused on the Future of Work. Open to the public, this female-led hackathon aims at capturing all those interested in applying an entrepreneurial mindset to move forward into a future of anti-fragile systems while bringing everyone along. All are welcome to apply by 11:59 p.m. ET on Friday, October 30.

Michael Akinyele, former founding Chief Innovation Officer of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
The kickoff on November 6 will feature keynote speaker Michael Akinyele, former founding Chief Innovation Officer of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Akinyele says, “While the impact of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Health on the U.S. healthcare system remains nascent, to scale, solutions must improve health outcomes and eliminate unnecessary spend.""
On November 6, participants will gather and form teams to solve key problems within three themes: AI and the Future of Work and Teams; AI and the Future of Healthcare; and AI and the Future of Systems. Over the following 48 hours, teams will iterate on these ideas with the assistance of mentors and collaborating organizations.
On November 8, participants will reconvene to present their final pitches to judging panels, and winning teams will be selected per track. After the weekend, the best ideas and teams will enjoy an ecosystem of mentorship to co-develop and implement their solution. Through ongoing collaboration with companies and institutions, Hack4theFuture will create an accelerated pipeline for adoption into enterprise. This ensures that the best ideas help to optimize systems needed for the immediate future.
“COVID-19 disrupted many previously change-resistant industries like healthcare and the public sector,” says Umbereen S. Nehal, MD, MPH, a current MIT Sloan Fellow, lead organizer of Hack4theFuture, and former Chief Medical Officer. “With reports of cases rising again, we need sustained creativity in crisis and anti-fragile systems. This is especially important for effective COVID-19 vaccine distribution which experts consider the most important way to end the pandemic.”
Jagjit Dhaliwal, MIT Sloan Executive MBA student, part of the Hack4theFuture leadership team, and current Deputy CIO of Los Angeles County, asks “What does the work look like in a post-COVID world? We need to reimagine business processes and operations while re-inventing the customer experience. While the future of work brings a new era of digital experience, it will pose new challenges of the digital divide, inclusivity, cyber-security, work-life balance. Artificial Intelligence adaption will grow significantly to activate new opportunities in data, analytics, and automation areas.”
Hack4theFuture is sponsored by the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, MIT Innovation Initiative, MIT Hacking Medicine. The event is co-sponsored by the MIT Sloan Entrepreneurship Club.
This virtual event follows on the heels of the India Turning the Tide Challenge held August 28-30, 2020. Earlier hackathons in the MIT COVID-19 Challenge included the MIT COVID-19 IDEAthon, Beat the Pandemic I, Africa Takes On COVID-19, MIT COVID-19 Datathon, Beat the Pandemic Hackathon II, and Latin America vs. COVID-19.

He is one of only 20 students nationwide to be recognized as a scholarship winner, said a news release from the Davidson Institute.""I started this project the summer before my junior year just as something to do over the summer, something I was interested in,"" Yasonik said in a phone interview. ""Now to see it blow up kind of like this — now that its two years later, and I'm still working with this stuff and people are still noticing it — it means the world. I didn't even know what the Davidson Fellows(hip) was two years ago, and now here I am.""The scholarship comes from the Davidson Institute's Fellows Scholarship Program, which offers $50,000, $25,000 and $10,000 college scholarships to students 18 or younger who have completed significant projects that have the potential to benefit society in the fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, literature and music. It is a program of the Davidson Institute for Talent Development, a national nonprofit organization headquarters in Reno, Nevada, that supports profoundly gifted youth.Yasonik and the other 2020 Davidson Fellows were honored during a digital reception Sept. 30.""They pulled together an entire video special for us. They brought us all together to actually meet over Zoom, so we were still able to talk with each other to meet each other. They put a highlight reel together of all our projects and what we've done, which is really special to see,"" Yasonik said.Yasonik's projectAccording to his biography page on the Davidson Institute's website, Yasonik's artificial intelligence-based project generates drug-like molecules from scratch and can uniquely optimize many molecular properties at once.Traditional approaches to drug development are rooted in trial and error and struggle to account for many molecular properties collectively. This results in long timelines (10-15 years), excessive costs ($160 million to $2.6 billion) and extremely high failure rates (87% to 97%), just to develop a single new drug.Yasonik's project could improve the process for creating new pharmaceutical drugs by using a generative approach to reduce reliance on trial and error and premade molecular databases.His project's ability to optimize many molecular characteristics at once ""could result in far better success rates further along the pharmaceutical pipeline,"" his biography page said.""Before, traditionally what happens is we have this molecule, and then we test for which properties does this molecule have.""The newer approach with artificial intelligence is we know which properties we want. Now let's find the molecule that meets these properties. It's kind of the reverse that way,"" Yasonik explained.Yasonik worked on the project first and then submitted a paper about his project along with a video. He did a literature review of papers involving artificial intelligence in medicine and pharmaceuticals before his junior year of high school, in summer 2018. Yasonik then did all the programming and testing during his junior year in 2018-19, which extended into his senior year of high school in 2019-20.Current and future plansYasonki is currently attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is taking classes virtually this semester from home and then plans to attend in-person classes in the spring. He is continuing his education in artificial intelligence and its application in medicine, which inspired his recent work in computational biology, the Davidson Institute's news release said.Yasonik said he hopes to work at an artificial intelligence research lab or start his own biotech company. ""I keep hearing 'make sure you're in the right place, right time.' So looking at coronavirus, looking at what's going on right now, I feel like this is the right place, right time for biotech and for biotech research. That's why I've been really getting interested in startups and things like that,"" he said.Contact Alec Johnson at (262) 875-9469 or alec.johnson@jrn.com.
