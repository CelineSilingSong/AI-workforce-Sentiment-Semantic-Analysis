Artificial intelligence is a transformative tool in the workplace — except when it isn’t.
For top managers, state-of-the art AI tools are a no-brainer: in theory, they increase revenues, decrease costs, and improve the quality of products and services. But in the wild, it’s often just the opposite for frontline employees who actually need to integrate these tools into their daily work. Not only can AI tools yield few benefits, but they can also introduce additional work and decrease autonomy.advertisement

Our research on the introduction of 15 AI clinical decision support tools over the past five years at Duke Health has shown that the key to successfully integrating them is recognizing that increasing the value for frontline employees is as important as making sure the tools work in the first place. The tactics we identified are useful not only in biopharma, medicine, and health care, but across a range of other industries as well.

How AI And Machine Learning Will Impact The Future Of HealthcareAdobe Stock

Some experts are predicting that the healthcare industry is the sector that could be the most affected by the enormous changes of the fourth industrial revolution.

I recently spoke with Tom Lawry, National Director of AI for Health & Life Sciences at Microsoft, about the future of healthcare. Here are some of his biggest insights and predictions:

Current Challenges in Healthcare
PROMOTED
The U.S. currently spends more money on healthcare than any other country in the world, but its individual health outcomes are lower than most other developed nations.
Additionally, clinician burnout is a huge problem, particularly since the pandemic.
Individuals in different generations also want healthcare that is personalized to their needs. Tom says:
“Millennials want to be able to have their healthcare consult from the same place they order their dinner — which is their couch. Meanwhile, you have groups like baby boomers who have a very different approach. They're much more inclined to want to focus on a primary care provider…so we have the ability to go from that one-size-fits-all in care delivery with these systems to using data and AI to truly personalize it, starting with care that's generational. Then even within each generation — millennials, Gen Z, etc. — we have the ability to allow them to access and manage care on their own terms.”

The good news is that most large healthcare organizations are beginning to make use of some form of AI. However, we’re still early in the journey of learning how we can apply artificial intelligence to make healthcare better.

One of the primary use cases is using machine learning and AI to make predictions. Organizations are using AI to predict everything from emergency department volumes (to get a better handle on staffing and triage) to predicting which treatments might be most effective for women who develop breast cancer.
Healthcare teams are also using natural language processing to improve the interpretation of patient scans by augmenting the work of human radiologists. Tom says:
“When a radiologist looks at a scan, they’re typically looking for one thing, which is the reason you have that image done. But many times in the background, there's something else that can be seen. So as radiologists are dictating, natural language processes are being used to call out these secondary issues for follow-up, where previously those things might go unnoticed…so it's a preventive way of trying to get out ahead of a future health problem.”
The biggest promise of AI in healthcare comes from changing clinical workflows. AI can add value by either automating or augmenting the work of clinicians and staff. Many repetitive tasks will become fully automated, and we can also use AI as a tool to help health professionals perform better at their jobs and improve outcomes for patients.
The healthcare organizations that will be the most successful are the ones that will be able to fundamentally rethink and reimagine their workflows and processes and use machine learning and AI to create a truly intelligent health system.

Why We Haven’t Fulfilled the Promise of AI in Healthcare Yet
When I asked Tom why we’re not yet using AI effectively across our entire healthcare system, he said:
“It’s really about leaders understanding the capabilities of AI today, and then looking at how to apply it to add value. The value of AI doesn't come from the technology; it comes from changing clinical workflows and operational processes. AI adds value in only one or two ways: It adds value by automating the way work is done or augmenting the way work is done. Automation means highly repetitive work done by humans today is going to be done by a smart machine today or in the future. But the biggest part of healthcare today is augmentation…the idea of augmentation is, ‘How do we bring AI in behind the humans to make them better at something they care about?’”
According to Tom, senior leaders in the healthcare space don’t necessarily need to understand how AI works — they just need to grasp the power of AI and how it can help them provide personalized care for people more efficiently and compassionately.
For example, the government of Singapore is currently making use of machine learning and deep algorithms to help manage the health of people who are pre-diabetic. The government has mined the data of approximately five million citizens to identify people who are pre-diabetic, and then recruited people to volunteer to be part of a program where they receive personalized daily nudges about what they can do to take charge of their health and lower their blood sugar. This highly personalized advice has been highly successful at slowing participants’ progression from pre-diabetic to diabetic.

Healthcare Workers Have No Reason to Fear AI
AI will impact the work of many people in the healthcare industry, but there’s no need to fear: Machines won’t be replacing healthcare providers anytime soon.
“What artificial intelligence is good at is things like pattern recognition,” Tom says. “It's great at sifting through massive amounts of data to find something that humans either aren't capable of finding or would take years humans to find. On the other hand, humans are great at wisdom, common sense, empathy, and creativity, all of which are vitally important when you think about the care process.”
To be able to adapt to future trends and the integration of AI into the healthcare system, clinicians simply need to become aware of the power of this new technology and understand that the world is changing. Instead of taking over jobs, building an intelligent health system will make clinicians better at what they do, while improving patient experiences.
It’s clearly a win-win all around.

The office subsumed multiple other defense digital authorities, including the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center and the Defense Digital Services, and reached full operational capability on June 1.While much of the talk about the CDAO has focused on its role as the Pentagon’s leading AI authority, Martell said more attention and energy needs to be paid to data, which he said serves as the basis of the office’s “hierarchy of needs.”In order to address the challenge of AI, the Pentagon needs to focus less on top-down AI decrees, he said, adding that while data decrees are still necessary, top-down AI restrictions hinder progress.Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer Craig Martell speaks at a Department of Defense virtual conference June 7, 2022. (Screenshot/Provided/DoD) By focusing more on controlling data, the Pentagon can build a support structure that allows for heterogeneity among the different actors and companies working on AI projects, he said.“It shouldn’t be centralized,” he said. “If we centralize it, we’re losing what I think is the biggest strength of the American industrial academic base.”After building out data, Martell said the CDAO should focus on metrics, noting that outcome-based measurement, and not just effort-based measures, ought to be the standard. From metrics should come analytics, with AI coming in only once the needed infrastructure is in place.“We have a very large AI challenge ahead of us but in order to do this, we have to get the data right,” he said.About  Catherine BuchaniecCatherine Buchaniec is a reporter at C4ISRNET, where she covers artificial intelligence, cyber warfare and uncrewed technologies.

Explore three ways AI already impacts the design and engineering fields, from generative design to advanced robotics.

This article is based on a Raconteur report about the democratization of product design. You can download your copy of the full report here.
Recent advancements in computational power, cloud connectivity, and neural network complexity have ushered in a new era called “The Augmented Age.” Artificial intelligence (AI) tools already augment many aspects of our daily routines. In the next five years, a vast majority of product design companies also anticipate relying on them heavily. Maurice Conti, who coined the phrase, describes a world in which AI augments the human ability to design, build, and employ products at every step of the design process. 
This article explores three ways AI already impacts the design and engineering fields.
Is generative design AI?
Generative design harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate design iterations based on constraints identified by the designer or engineer. Typically, generative design is used to reduce weight, reduce manufacturing costs, and optimize part performance. Generative design uses AI to some extent, but it is just one step in the process. Humans are required at the beginning of the process to define constraints and at the end of the process as the final decision-maker. After all, someone needs to sift through the list of design iterations generative design creates! 
Generative design for ideation
Ideation is the first and most striking stage of AI-enhanced product development. Even agile design teams typically iterate less than a hundred concepts and prototypes throughout a project. 
Today, using generative design offers the ability to explore thousands of possible solutions across the entire design space. “Rather than starting with a drawing, the designer starts with the parameters required for the end product,” Peter Champneys, a research engineer at Autodesk describes. “The system then generates thousands of potential solutions in just a few hours and identifies the top few options that best fit the requirements.” 

Not every AI-generated design is a viable solution, however. AI design results can be impressive, yielding lighter, stronger, and more manufacturable products than ever before. “The human contribution is to then evaluate the outputs and determine the best performing, most cost effective and visually attractive solution.”
AI & advanced robotics for development
An often overlooked application of AI in the product design cycle is using robotics for prototyping and building. Additive manufacturing, CNC machining, automated welding, and many other tools rely heavily on AI to achieve functionality and precision beyond human capability. Advanced robotics can do much more than mundane, repetitive tasks. Robots can even utilize sensory inputs like vision, touch, temperature, and sound. 
The Hive Project
An excellent example of the synergy between humans and artificially intelligent robots is the Hive Project. This was a collaboration between Autodesk and The Institute for Computational Design (ICD) at the University of Stuttgart. The goal was to construct a specialized three-dimensional surface using bamboo and string. 
Machines and robots using AI were employed as high-level construction managers, precision machinists, and string assembly technicians. In contrast, humans selected and manipulated the highly irregular bamboo pieces. Together, they created a structure that couldn’t have been built without human and AI collaboration.  
Closed-loop engineering
The final piece of the puzzle bringing us into the augmented age is the closing of the design loop. This means feeding product lifecycle data back into the iteration process. Closing the loop can happen in two ways. The first is the aggregation and analysis of sensor data from within the product. And the second is customer feedback from interacting with and using the product. Between the widespread adoption of wireless sensor nodes and cloud-based computation and storage — that’s a lot of aggregated data. In fact, it’s often too much for humans to interpret.   
Here, AI can be relied upon to extract meaningful data trends and inflection points in how a product performs in real-world applications. This data can then be fed back into the generative design process with the help of a human designer to update parameters and optimize future changes in the product. 
CityBot by EDAG Group



One example of a closed-loop, generative design is CityBot. Citybot is a modular, configurable, multi-functional mobility platform from EDAG engineering. It’s an adaptable mobility robot that can reconfigure into different form factors depending on the application — a forklift in a warehouse to a trash collector in a public park. Customer requirement specifications and usage data from CityBots are fed into a generative design loop to realize an optimized product. 
As Sebastian Flügel, Project Leader at EDAG Group describes it: “The big change [from the old process] is that generative design creates the geometry automatically, and with Fusion 360, we can automatically recalculate these products, and we can create new solutions based on the changed conditions.”
“With all the sensors embedded in our parts, we know precisely if the part is stressed, which parts need to be improved, lighter or stronger for each function,” Johannes Barckmann, Global Design Manager at EDAG Engineering, explains.
This automated and continuous optimization type has never been seen in traditional manufacturing environments. The result is unprecedented flexibility and customer satisfaction.
The reality of AI adoption
The widespread adoption of generative design, advanced robotics, and closed-loop engineering will require more than just technological advancement. A widespread cultural shift will need to occur. Engineers and designers must leverage the value of AI in their day-to-day thinking to realize the full potential of the augmented age.

Losing to China in AI, Emerging Tech Will Cost U.S. Trillions, Threaten Security, Says Panel

A grim future awaits the United States if it loses the competition with China on developing key technologies like artificial intelligence in the near future, the authors of a special government-backed study told reporters on Monday.
If China wins the technological competition, it can use its advancements in artificial intelligence and biological technology to enhance its own country’s economy, military and society to the determent of others, said Robert Work, former deputy defense secretary and co-chair of the Special Competitive Studies Project, which examined international artificial intelligence and technological competition. Work is the chair of the U.S. Naval Institute Board of Directors.
Losing, in Work’s opinion, means that U.S. security will be threatened as China is able to establish global surveillance, companies will lose trillions of dollars and America will be reliant on China or other countries under Chinese influence for core technologies.
“If that world happens, it’s going to be very bleak for democracy … China’s sphere of influence will grow as its technological platforms proliferate throughout the world, and they will be able to establish surveillance on a global scale,” he said. “So that’s what losing looks like.”
The U.S. needs to address the technological competition now because there is only one budget cycle before 2025, the year that China set as a target for global dominance in technology manufacturing, said SCSP CEO Yll Bajraktari. By 2030, Beijing wants to be the AI global leader, he noted.
“The 2025-2030 timeframe is a really important period for our country and the global geopolitical security,” he said.
The technological competition goes beyond conflict or a military focus, said Eric Schmidt, co-chair of the Special Competitive Studies Project and former Google CEO. His idea of winning looks at platforms.
One of the most popular social media sites is TikTok, which is Chinese-owned and operated out of Shanghai, Schmidt noted.
The U.S. also banned Huawei, a Chinese technology corporation, which outpaced American technology when it came to 5G.
“You can imagine the the issues with having platforms dominated by non-western firms, which we rely on,” Schmidt said.
The competition boils down to three battlegrounds, laid out in the Special Competitive Studies Project report, Bajraktari said. Those three spaces are AI, chips and 5G.
https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22337215-scsp-mid-decade-challenges-to-national-competitiveness?responsive=1&title=1
“And the importance to get these three battlegrounds right is really critical because as I’ve said, this is not just about military competition,” Bajraktari said. “This is about all the benefits that all these three battlegrounds will bring to our economy and our society. And ultimately, you know, our military can use it too.”
When it comes to 5G, the U.S. does not yet have a good plan to compete with China, he said, pointing to Huawei as an example. Beijing also controls about 70 percent of African 4G, he said.
China has also invested billions of dollars toward chip production, going all in, Bajraktari said. And for AI, the country claims it wants to be the global leader.
Winning the competition does not mean the U.S. needs to control the production of critical technology, but it does need to be able to compete in the arena, Work said. The U.S. needs to have a dominant position in technological platforms and control global digital infrastructure, he said.
“And we definitely want to be able to harness biotech for the safety and livelihood of our citizens and new energy,” Work said.
If the U.S. cannot plan to excel in the three battlegrounds, advancements in biotech and computer power and next-generation inventions will happen in countries like China instead of democracies, Bajraktari said.
“And so the stakes of these competitions are beyond just the military competition,” Bajraktari said. ”It’s about who’s going to enjoy the benefits for all the inventions that will come from this.”

AI or Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly ruling the current digital workspace, and according to PwC’s Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. The overwhelming narrative that AI and Automation will take over human jobs, it may or may not be true, but these technologies are undoubtedly changing the nature of roles currently on offer. However, certain aspects of the roles now performed by humans continue to be beyond AI - tasks that are personal, creative, management, and those that deal with human emotions. Jobs involving these tasks will require Human-AI collaboration where humans will manage, monitor, and even teach these machines. Hence being smart and thinking ahead to acquire expertise in these skills can add tremendous value to an individual’s current role. 
This blog explores the job roles that will be benefited by the introduction of AI and Automation, as they directly complement and enhance these roles.
Here's the bright chance to create your dream career! Enroll in the Post Graduate Program in AI and Machine Learning with Purdue University collaborated with IBM today, and take the first step towards your dream career.
Problem Solvers
Problems solvers are those who like managing people, events, and jobs to deliver positive outcomes. While some people have this as an inherent skill, others need to work on building ingenuity and problem-solving skills. Today, these skills are highly in demand and require skilled professionals who can utilize information and knowledge to resolve issues and engineer solutions. Jobs that require in-depth problem-solving skills are computer system analysts, air traffic controllers, actuaries, and hospitalists.
AI and machine learning can do wonders in calculating figures at an astonishing rate. They can provide the right solution to a problem in no time. However, human intelligence is required to complement this AI feature. For example, training a machine to recognize the shape of a cat or a dog needs to feed multiple images to their memory. Even then, the most advanced AI-enabled machines get confused when asked to pick between the pictures of a dog-shaped tree and the real dog.
Computer Engineers (Hardware)
With the ever-growing field of AI and automation, the growth in the demand for qualified hardware engineers is foreseeable. A McKinsey report predicts that the need for skilled engineers, including computer scientists, engineers, IT administrators, IT workers, and tech consulters, will increase by 20 million to 50 million globally by 2030. AI and automation need engineers to build, run, and maintain them.
Mechanical Engineers 
The core job of mechanical engineers is to build machines that perform specific tasks. And the machine needs men.  An AI-enabled machine can produce a desired amount of torque and provide you a complete set of gears, but it can not build a fully automated car without human intervention. While robots can prove to be a great assistance, but they need humans as the master at creating any sophisticated system. 
Healthcare Professionals
Artificial Intelligence is already being used to diagnose and treat diseases. For instance, IDx-DR is the first-ever autonomous AI system that instantly detects the condition. With the backing of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide diagnostic support, it detects signs of diabetic retinopathy in visual images and then uses an algorithm to create a binary diagnosis in minutes. AI can also be extensively used in treating cardiovascular diseases, as well. The presence of AI will help medical professionals in diagnosing diseases quicker and, utilizing the data gathered from AI algorithms, work on finding better solutions. Hence, it becomes essential for healthcare providers/radiologists/pathologists to grasp and implement these technologies. 
Creative Jobs(Art, Writing)
Computers have been used for artistic purposes ever since it was invented. Everyone knows about Google DeepDream- a visualization tool and how funny and trippy images it can create. However, art in any form requires a high level of creativity. It needs ideas, engagement, style, and beauty. While robots can assist you in writing social media posts, suggest headlines, book titles, or imitate writing styles, the best art- books, paintings, films, and plays will ultimately be created by humans, at least in the immediate future.

AI Research and Engineering 
With the growth of AI and automation, there will naturally be a rise in the demand for skilled AI professionals. Also, some entry-level AI positions can get automated in the future as technology progresses. Thus, AI professionals will be required to upskill with the current advancements in AI. Similarly, software engineers will have to upskill with assembly language, high-level language, object-oriented programming, mobile programming, and now AI programming.
With new opportunities and industry growth paths, new and unique job positions are being created in every area of business operations. Here are some of the most sought-after AI roles:


AI/Machine Learning Researcher 
Responsible for improving machine learning algorithms 

AI Software Development, Program Management, and Testing
Developing systems and infrastructure that can use machine learning to derive critical business insights

Data Mining and Analysis
Performing deep investigation of enormous data sources, often creating and training systems to recognize patterns that will be crucial to business decisions

Machine Learning Applications 
Responsible for applying machine learning or AI framework to a varied range of business problems, like ad analysis, fraud detection and gesture recognition
