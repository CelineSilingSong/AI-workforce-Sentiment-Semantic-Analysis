We’ve often heard it said that generative AI will affect many of the jobs people do today. But they won’t all be affected equally.

We are increasingly seeing that certain occupations will be changed more than others.


Recent research carried out by Indeed’s economic research team, Hiring Lab, found that some of the most commonly-posted jobs – including nurses, care workers and chefs – are among the 35 percent of roles that will be least affected.

However, if your job is something that can be done remotely or involves software development, there’s a much higher chance you’ll use AI to augment your work. Or, in a worst-case scenario, make you redundant.

PROMOTED
So, what does this mean for the future of work? On the one hand, those in the 20 percent of jobs that are highly likely to be transformed by generative AI are in a position of privilege. The ability to adopt generative AI into their workflow will make them more efficient, productive and valuable.
On the other, as many of these roles – which include doctors, lawyers, and software engineers – command salaries at the higher end of the scale, this could be seen as leading toward growing inequality in society.

A job description is generally presented as a selection of necessary skills. This was used as a jumping-in point to start analyzing the potential impact of generative AI across workforce roles.

The aim was to answer a question that’s been on everyone’s mind but certainly isn’t unique to this latest wave of technological disruption.
Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, tells me, ""Frankly, it's a very old question of whether technology will help or hurt jobs. That question goes back a couple of hundred years to when the Luddites first smashed looms in the UK because they thought those jobs were going away.”
It’s easier to assess the impact of generative AI on individual skills than on entire jobs. For certain skills, including driving vehicles, construction skills and veterinary skills, It’s fairly useless. For others, like accounting skills, legal tasks and software development, it’s great.
When broken down like this, however, it seems likely that just about every job will be affected in some way, as nearly all involve skills to some extent that can be enhanced with generative AI.
Educators, researchers, project managers, healthcare professionals, content creators and clerical workers all use these skills, too.
“We think that AI is going to transform almost every job, how they’re done, not necessarily eliminate those jobs, but they will transform,” Hyams says.

New Jobs
As well as changing existing jobs, new jobs are likely to emerge to enable businesses and governments to benefit from the emergence of generative AI – hopefully in a safe and ethical way!
AI scholar and Google Brain co-founder Andrew NG was among the first to offer a balanced evaluation of how this will happen.
He believes that transforming the way we do existing jobs will lead to the creation of many new jobs as well. And we’re already starting to see this happen, with openings appearing for positions like AI prompt engineer or AI auditors.
But it’s widely acknowledged – by Ng and others – that it could also lead to job losses. Again, this will largely affect roles where many of the skills can be augmented or automated. However, it seems likely that a disproportionate impact could be on jobs paying lower salaries. This might include customer service advisors, translators, assistants and back-office clerical staff.

The Evolution Of Skills
Rather than needing to develop new skills (or change profession entirely), I think this shows that skills are evolving.
Remember, when the pocket calculator was invented in the 20th century, many thought that it would lead to a decline in our ability to do basic mathematics. What actually happened was that lots of people – school children in particular – became capable of solving more complicated math problems more quickly.
But as well as enhancing our technical skills, delegating routine elements of work – scheduling, drafting reports – to machines means we have more time to focus on the human aspect of our work.
For lawyers and doctors, this means spending more face time with patients and less time reading charts and reports. Teachers will spend less time grading papers and more time one-on-one with pupils. Real estate agents will use generative AI to create property listings or sales reports while they focus on understanding buyers' unique needs.
It’s also important to point out that employers have a responsibility to help out with this evolution. It's in the interest of their employees, who will benefit from the personal development. But it's also in the interest of their businesses that will grow thanks to the advances in efficiency and innovation driven by the adoption of generative AI.

The Ethical Impact 
As with any discussion on the impact of AI, there are ethical considerations that can’t be ignored.
The changing nature of work, the income disparity between roles that can be augmented and those that can’t, and the intrinsic need for human-centric services in many professions all need to be addressed.
Cooks, cleaners, and laborers will have fewer chances to use generative AI to increase their value, while for financial analysts, lawyers, and software engineers, the opportunities are significant.
This has the potential to exacerbate existing inequalities, and this can only be addressed by continued focus on improving opportunities. This means ensuring that the chance to move into positions that can benefit are available regardless of economic, social, class, racial or gender grouping that has traditionally created barriers.
It’s also vital to make sure that aspects of human behavior that are critical to day-to-day well-being are not augmented out of society. A doctor’s ability to alleviate anxiety with their bedside manner is an important part of the healing process, for example. This could be lost if elements of the work that seem routine – like communicating non-urgent updates on how a patient is recovering – are delegated to AI.
What is becoming clear is that the impact of generative AI on jobs is only going to grow, and over the coming year or two, we’ll start to get a better picture of how this will impact our lives and society as we face up to these important challenges.
Right now, from an individual perspective, the most important thing to do is develop an understanding of how our own roles – or the roles we hope we will have in the future – can benefit from this hugely transformative opportunity.

by Francis BignellJanuary 5, 2024January 18, 2024LinkedInTwitterFacebookWhatsAppTelegramCopy LinkShareParticularly since the release of OpenAI‘s ChatGPT at the back-end of 2022, the world has sat up and taken notice of the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to disrupt all industries in countless ways. To kick off 2024, The Fintech Times is exploring how the world of AI may continue to impact the fintech industry and beyond throughout the coming year.In 2023, Salesforce published research revealing some of the biggest generative AI trends of the year. It found that 75 per cent of generative AI users are looking to automate tasks at work and use generative AI for work communications. Furthermore, 38 per cent of generative AI users use the tech for fun/messing around. Meanwhile, 34 per cent use it for learning about topics that interest them.Seventy-three per cent of the Indian population 49 per cent of the Australian population, 45 per cent of the US population and 29 per cent of the UK population surveyed were all using generative AI last year. With adoption trends suggesting that these numbers will only increase throughout 2024, it begs the question, how will the technology evolve over the year?AI-driven by key playersDavid Sewell, CTO, SynechronFor emerging technologies to succeed, they must be adopted by figureheads of an industry, and the financial sector is no different.David Sewell, CTO, Synechron, the financial services digital transformation consulting firm explains: “Advanced AI will continue to offer businesses new ways to innovate and grow. ’Graph databases’, which store complex data structures (most commonly used for social networks), and which are very powerful when combined with generative AI (GenAI), will come to the fore.“Likewise, ‘vector databases’ which store, manage and index massive quantities of high-dimensional vector data efficiently, are garnering significant interest for their potential to create additional value for GenAI use cases and applications.“According to Gartner, by 2026, more than 30 per cent of enterprises will have adopted vector databases to ground their foundation models with relevant business data.“Breakthroughs in GenAI and transfer learning from top universities and big tech are driving the next wave of innovation around AI. Key players like Google are building significant capabilities while still considering risks and monetisation.“The biggest benefits for businesses will likely come from mass adoption of simple tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft copilot-like assistants that work alongside popular Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams, to provide real-time intelligent assistance, enabling users to enhance their creativity, productivity and skills.“But, as the use of AI proliferates, so too do fears about data safety, privacy and bias. For businesses seeking to allay these fears and develop safe, accountable AI solutions, effective governance is essential.”Developing new techniques Malcom deMayo, VP of financial services at NVIDIAMalcom deMayo, VP of financial services at NVIDIA, the multinational software company, explores the next big technique which will see AI further develop.“Financial services firms are ramping up investment in AI, promoting its status within their organisations from AI associate to chief AI officer.“In order to fine-tune a model to generate the insights that will best answer customer inquiries, minimise investment risk, or process documents for loan applications, underwriting, regulatory compliance and more, firms will need to train them on their proprietary, industry-specific data. That’s why firms will leverage new AI training techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to shift from off-the-shelf generative AI solutions to custom models that more accurately serve internal and external stakeholders.Tip of the icebergDave Colwell, VP of AI and ML at TricentisDave Colwell, VP of AI and ML at Tricentis, automation software company, discusses how AI won’t just be a technology which requires a singular expert in a company. Rather, it will need an entire team – so much so, independent organisations will be called in to test the technology.“We’re at the tip of the iceberg for the potential of generative AI.Alongside increased adoption, we can expect significant regulatory progress. Steps have already been made following the 2023 AI Safety Summit, with a “landmark” cross-governmental agreement to test future AI models of some of the world’s biggest tech firms prior to release.AI presents an almost unprecedented opportunity to improve the lives of everyday people, but also a potential disruption to many parts of society, including education, workforces, and our interpersonal interactions.“This will likely mean independent organisations responsible for testing the safety of new AI models to confirm validity and accuracy, as well as a greater governmental role in defining how AI should be used to benefit, not harm, the people it governs. We can also expect major updates to compliance frameworks with responsible and acceptable AI use policies becoming commonplace.”An added benefit, not a human replacementDr Henry Balani, global head of industry and regulatory affairs for Encompass CorporationThere have been many fears surrounding AI and the potential threats it could have on human jobs. Dr Henry Balani, global head of industry and regulatory affairs for Encompass Corporation, the KYC process automation firm, explains that this will not be the case in 2024.“Generative AI represents an evolving concept that offers potentially exciting benefits to financial institutions.“However, the overriding message is that generative AI will not replace KYC analysts now, or in the foreseeable future. It will instead accelerate existing processes and augment the work of analysts, empowering them to detect financial crime risk faster and more comprehensively.“Maximum value will only be derived from generative AI if banks have already established robust digital and automated processes to optimise the quality of data collated and deliver deeper customer insights. By focusing on laying this groundwork now, banks will be well positioned to take full advantage of this new technology as it continues to evolve and mature.”Complying with fintech regulationsNima Montazeri, CPO of LiberisNima Montazeri, CPO of Liberis, an embedded finance platform, dives into how AI will navigate the minefield which is fintech regulations over the coming year: “Gen AI is poised to revolutionise the fintech industry through its widespread adoption, bringing about significant transformations across various sectors.“One area that will experience a remarkable impact is customer service, where the integration of generative AI algorithms will serve to enhance the capabilities of human agents.“By augmenting their abilities, gen AI will boost productivity levels and expedite the learning process. In fact, studies highlighted that with the assistance of gen AI, newly recruited call centre employees were able to acquire the equivalent of six months’ worth of experience in just two months on the job, showcasing the immense potential for accelerated skill development.“Furthermore, compliance within the fintech sector will witness a new era of oversight facilitated by gen AI algorithms. Continuous audits of customer interactions, encompassing phone calls, emails, and other forms of communication, will be seamlessly conducted to ensure strict adherence to regulatory frameworks and industry standards. The utilisation of gen AI in this context will enable real-time.”AI will spread its wings in 2024Steve Morgan, global banking principal at PegasystemsSteve Morgan, global banking principal at Pegasystems, the low-code platform to adopt change, does not agree that AI will seen its ‘winter’ this year, rather it will be given room to grow providing it is done so in a safe way.“Even though some are predicting an ‘AI winter’, or a slowdown in interest of generative AI, 2024 will actually be the year generative AI will be let out of its cage to spread its wings and show its true potential. Generative AI-driven agents can be relied on to do the heavy lifting, by creating and executing plans from start to finish.“Even with generative AI evolving, a human will still need to be in the loop and be in control of the AI to ensure that it is working ethically and set clearly defined parameters for what the tool can and cannot do. Generative AI will be freer and be able to evolve, but there will still be controls on it to ensure that it is working in a safe way.”More realistic and accurate outputsDanny Butvinik, chief data scientist at NICE ActimizeDanny Butvinik, chief data scientist at NICE Actimize, the financial crime and compliance solution company, believes ethical guidelines will be an absolute necessity for generative AI to succeed in 2024.“Generative AI models are expected to produce even more realistic and accurate outputs, whether in text, image, or other forms. This includes better context understanding and fewer errors. We expect advancements in allowing users more control and customisation options when generating content, leading to more tailored outputs.

Yet this time, workers are ready.Now that generative AI has been on employees' radars for more than a year, they're not only better positioned to understand its place in the contemporary work landscape, but also equipped to embrace the changes and possibility that comes with it.It's time to put that advantage to use. To get ahead, workers should know what's coming in the AI space, including these five trends that are poised to impact the year.1. AI will encourage widespread inclusivityArtificial intelligence is likely to become a powerful tool for workers with disabilities – and those advances could drive change for all people.   First, many machine-learning tools developed to benefit disabled workers could become increasingly available, believes Victor Santiago Pineda, director of the Inclusive Cities Lab at UC Berkeley, US. Think, for instance, algorithm-based speech-to-text and text-to-speech tools that provide additional information to visually- and hearing-impaired users, respectively. ""AI-powered assistive technologies have the potential to break down barriers and empower individuals with disabilities, fostering a sense of independence and inclusion,"" he says.He believes the mainstream adoption of tools meant to assist disabled people can also benefit everyone. For example, as large language models continue to refine real-time, multilingual closed captioning, all people will have access to a wider and more diverse range of information.2. AI will make hiring – and layoff – processes more equitableHuman-resource professionals are already prepared to use artificial intelligence in the hiring process to create a more equitable hiring landscape, but the current technology is far from perfect. In response, academics and industry experts are working to reduce algorithmic bias on electronic hiring platforms and other HR tools through AI. Some experts are already prioritising these goals. The Hire Aspirations Institute, led by Cynthia Dwork, professor of computer science at the Harvard John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, is focused on identifying bias in screening tools and the professionals who use them.AlamyTools to help workers with disabilities may proliferate, and these advances stand to help all workers (Credit: Alamy)Beyond the hiring process, some companies, including the global consultancy firm Deloitte, are using artificial intelligence technology to retain talent. The firm is currently experimenting with using AI data to more effectively reallocate budgets, move workers to more in-demand positions and, in turn, stave off layoffs. This could particularly help marginalised groups, who are often the targets of corporate cuts.However, many experts and HR professionals agree that although AI development will be helpful in creating a more diverse candidate funnel, it may not be able to solve all issues, including human bias in hiring. However, a heightened awareness of hiring inequity may help HR professionals understand their own implicit judgements and how to move past them.3. Workplaces will use AI to centre diversity in hiring and training Beyond levelling the playing field for applications, evolving AI tools may also help to ensure traditionally marginalised people are not starting a new job on the back foot.To begin, the development of AI may push regulators to increasingly focus on funding worker inclusion practices in the public and private sectors. In its recent Strategic Enforcement Plan (SEP), the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission prioritised overcoming workplace discrimination in an increasingly AI assisted world. In the EU, the newly passed AI act requires that HR data and processes at firms must meet established standards for workers' rights, or face corporate fines.Investment in inclusive technology such as language-learning models designed by diverse teams, for instance, stands to help employers create personalised educational programs tailored to a wide set of employee experiences. This has the potential to help workers from all backgrounds get the same start.Importantly, these kinds of changes stand to impact how hiring platforms are designed. Addressing bias in the development of algorithms can head off exclusionary practices from the start of the hiring process, instead of working to make up for mistakes and blind spots after they show themselves. Experts say this could make a real difference, as they point to the importance of creating inclusive teams at the development stage of AI technology to help all workers have an equal chance to advance.4. Employees want to work with AI, and employers will invest in upskillingWhile some experts say concerns about AI replacing some roles are valid, they also have simultaneously predicted that it won't eliminate all human jobs. Instead, workers will evolve to co-exist with this emerging technology, and the employees who are willing to learn and adapt to AI will see the greatest benefits.AlamyGetting diverse groups into the development of AI from the outset can head off exclusionary practices (Credit: Alamy)For many, this will require re-training in specific areas and employer-sponsored learning opportunities. A 2023 survey conducted by Jobs for the Future's Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work (JFF) showed the majority of respondents believe they will need new skills to compete in an AI-driven workforce. Younger workers are particularly feeling the pressure: 66% of Gen Z and millennial respondents said they felt the need to hone and update their skillsets to maintain a competitive edge.Companies may increasingly rise to the occasion, offering better resources for upskilling, through programmes such as in-office workshops, partnerships with academic institutions, mentoring schemes and trials that expose workers to multiple parts of the business. Experts at the JFF report that companies that invest stand to drive employee success and also have a business edge in the wider competitive landscape. 5. AI regulation will continue to struggle to keep pace with the technology AI will come with benefits, but implementation of these advancements won't necessarily be smooth sailing.As AI has come into mainstream usage, some technology leaders are calling for a push to define its boundaries. Regulators are tasked with expanding the technology, while also protecting the rights – and occupations – of a diverse human workforce. In the meantime, as AI becomes commonplace in many industries, experts say that a successful framework for regulation will require global collaboration from corporations, governments and academic researchers.As the rapid advances in AI technology threaten to outpace efforts to create a flexible and comprehensive framework for its use, workers may be left concerned about job protections, privacy in the workplace and industry shifts. These concerns have real-life consequences – according to the American Psychological Association's 2023 Workplace in America survey, respondents who were worried about AI affecting their jobs reported greater amounts of stress, anxiety and professional burnout, than those who embraced the technology.   The biggest takeaway: AI in the workplace is here to stay. Across nearly all facets of the workplace, employees will see a rapid evolution in how the tech affects their professional lives in the year to come, and businesses will have to adapt as swiftly as their workers.Work cultureFuture of businessFeaturesHow we workArtificial intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While AI brings tremendous potential benefits — from diagnosing illness to predicting earthquakes — the possible disruption from the AI revolution could also be significant. As the rate of AI adoption increases, humans are essential to guiding the technology’s implementation and usage of these technologies.Before we can fully embrace this revolution, we have an obligation to reskill our talent to use these technologies effectively, equipping them to succeed in today’s environment. Executives estimate that up to 40% of their workforce may need to reskill as a result of implementing AI or automation over the next three years. This is largely because humans need diverse skills — from technical proficiency to human understanding and adaptability in their thinking — to work most effectively alongside AI. While this percentage seems daunting, the demands on today’s workforce present a unique and exciting opportunity to empower a new group of people to enter desired, skills-oriented jobs in the digital economy. We need to rethink our approach to reskilling to achieve this goal while ensuring the skills of our workforce match the pace of technological advancement.Have you read?AI is helping to identify skills gaps and future jobs. An expert explains howHow to leverage your skills in the post-knowledge AI economyDavos 2024: Who's coming and what to expectInvest in human capital First, we must stop fixating on whether AI will impact our lives and start managing the elements within our control. While the ubiquity of AI has caused fear of these technologies overtaking human ability, this is not yet the case — and may never be. Human capital is a much more important asset than ever before. As Dr. Chris Mason, director of the WorldQuant Initiative for Quantitative Prediction, and I discuss in our book, The Age of Prediction, humans and machines will continue to have a symbiotic relationship. Prediction is an innovative tool for advancement but requires human collaboration to enhance its outcomes. As we move into the future of technology, we should increasingly focus on the value of what we are doing: bringing opportunity to talent and using technology to strengthen our workforces.Integrate reskilling as a change management initiativeResearch shows that few companies to date have taken the call to action for reskilling seriously. Companies have become so preoccupied with filling immediate vacancies that they focus less on internally developing talent for future roles.While CEOs say hiring is the most important thing they do, many companies are entirely disengaged from the process and feel it is their biggest challenge. With constantly evolving demands on jobs and skills, we cannot solely rely on hiring. The only way to fully prepare our organizations for the future is through upskilling and reskilling. Leaders need to start viewing reskilling as an organizational change management initiative — preparing workforces for lasting change and offering them the skills required to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market. This transformation goes beyond just training employees. It underscores the importance of creating an organizational context — across leadership, managers and employees alike — in which reskilling will be embraced to maximize success. Doing so might create new opportunities for better-paying and more skilled roles.Leverage new technology to support education We are entering a new era for education, made possible by the commoditization of AI. The growth of information and data available to us means there is an ever-increasing opportunity to learn more and to facilitate learning opportunities. Online learning platforms are expected to grow 19% over the next four years. We need to lean into this trend. With AI breaking down barriers to quality education, simplifying interfaces and providing varied learning pathways, organizations should embrace the accessibility of reskilling programs. Let’s use the widening availability of education platforms to our advantage by building from within, partnering with an academic institution or establishing public-private partnerships. Embedding these kinds of reskilling programs will help ensure a seamless transition toward a more agile, tech-savvy and future-ready workforce.Online learning platforms can help organizations worldwide close the AI skills gap. Image: Statista Market InsightsClosing the AI skills gapOrganizations that recognize the value of human capital while embracing advanced technologies will be most prepared for the future of work. Empowering employees with opportunities to reskill will help them better leverage AI tools, helping to drive business value, improve efficiency and shape the future of success. Implementing a cultural shift around reskilling will help organizations accelerate this change. Only then will we be able to more fully understand and harness the potential of AI.

Like it or not, artificial intelligence is coming for your job. Seemingly overnight, the software has crept into the workplace, and once highly-paid workers are already seeing salaries slip and vacancies dry up.But the dawn of AI has also birthed hitherto unthought-of job titles. On LinkedIn, “head of AI” job roles have tripled globally in the last five years, while job posts mentioning AI have more than doubled in Britain in the last two. Nearly a third of British business leaders expect the software will lead to new roles, and roughly half of British workers believe AI will impact their jobs in some way in the next five years, according to a study by PwC. Earlier this year, BT announced it would cut 55,000 jobs, and replace a fifth of its workers with AI.Investment bank Goldman Sachs predicts AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs globally in the coming years.In the near future, customer service phone lines could be answered by a robot, while graphic designers, computer programmers, writers and teachers may well find their roles consumed, at least in part, by software. Some companies have married AI with hologram technology, replacing in-person customer service with digital avatars.At a summit last year, Elon Musk told Rishi Sunak that artificial intelligence could one day eradicate the need for jobs altogether. The owner of X, formally Twitter, told The Prime Minister AI would be “the most disruptive force in the industry for jobs”, claiming that “there will come a point where no job is needed – you can have a job if you want to for personal satisfaction”.Mr Sunak likewise urged industry figureheads and politicians “not to be alarmist” about the rapid rise of AI, while denying the technology would be a threat to jobs. “I know this is an anxiety people have,” he said. “We should look at AI more as a co-pilot than something that is necessarily going to replace someone’s job.”Nonetheless, trade unions are worried. Andrew Pakes, Deputy General Secretary of Prospect, which has over 150,000 members, said the Government’s attempts to regulate AI were being outpaced by the technology’s rapid development. “AI brings with it opportunities for better work but it also threatens jobs and has the potential to exacerbate prejudices in recruitment and disciplinary processes,” he said.Which careers are safest from AI?Though some previously lucrative careers are already feeling the rapid encroachment of smart software, some careers may be safe.Using studies published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the University of Pennsylvania, and research by Goldmann Sachs, data analysts at job search engine Adzuna identified several job roles where pay had been resilient to the advent of AI – and ranked them by how high their advertised salaries were in December 2023.Specialist medical professionals ranked among the highest-paid roles best insulated from the march of technology, according to advertised salaries on Adzuna.The average salary for orthodontists was £113,576 a year in December, compared to £102,842 last year – an increase of 10.4pc.Oncologists, pediatricians, surgeons, and midwives also ranked highly, with advertised salaries ranging from £55,000 to £100,000.








However, the average pay for some roles has dipped year-on-year. Pay across listed vacancies for oncologists had dropped by 8.4pc, from £219,755 to £201,243, Adzuna said. Meanwhile, pay for midwives dipped by 10.8pc – from £58,864 to £52,490. Advertised salaries had skyrocketed over the summer as hospitals desperately tried to fill the gaps left by an exodus of midwives during the pandemic.Jobs requiring subjective reasoning, including judges and politicians, were similarly deemed safe from the AI revolution.MPs are paid £86,584 a year, and while judge vacancies are not advertised on jobsites, they can expect to earn salaries far in excess of £100,000. Adzuna listed 546 vacancies for chief executive positions in December – and average pay had risen by 15.1pc year-on-year – from £78,916 to £90,868.Elsewhere, the jobsite said society would be reluctant to accept jobs involving “human stories or motivation”, such as influencers, therapists, or life coaches, being performed by AI. Pay rose fractionally in all three cases, and the number of listed vacancies for the latter jumped from just five to 63.Perhaps unsurprisingly, manual labour was also deemed safe from automation. Blue-collar jobs including oil rigging, and pipelaying (average salary £44,448), mechanics (£42,862) and plumbers (£39,039) dominated the list. Roofers, crane drivers, and carpenters also ranked highly.Even as companies embracing AI futures replace swathes of their workforce, the presence of the software is expected to generate jobs specifically geared around monitoring its use. Prompt engineers, AI ethics officers, and AI auditors are expected to be common job roles in the near future, Adzuna said in June. By December, a number of such roles had already started cropping up on job boards. These roles included “machine manager”, “AI trainer”, and “prompt engineer”, for which the advertised salary was £192,000.In the US, the AI job market is booming: a study by marketing publication Biz Report found that AI-related jobs offered 77pc higher salaries than other occupations, while the pay gap between tech jobs and other occupations had widened by 36pc due to AI. At the tail end of 2023, almost a third of all tech jobs were AI-related, the study found.Workers are already steeling themselves for a word of work alongside artificial intelligence. LinkedIn has seen an 80pc increase in members watching AI-related learning courses over the last three months, and a 60pc increase in generative AI skills – such as Chat GPT and prompt crafting – being added to users’ profiles every month since January 2023.

But building an AI business strategy and incorporating AI into daily operations is not always an easy step to take. Learn how to start, as Gartner analyst Whit Andrews guides you through ways to start implementing AI in your business and how to make an AI business strategy.

According to research from Gartner, artificial intelligence implementation in businesses grew 270% in the last four years, but over half of businesses are still struggling with how to apply AI technology. Leveraging AI in business is what allows companies to innovate, grow and compete globally. 

Andrews lays out three steps to start thinking about AI implementations in a business. First ask, “What do I have to do that will make me a hero in my organization?” Second, identify which of those things have a whole lot of data associate with them. And third, narrow down where that data also have outcomes associated with it.

Every day, businesses are finding new ways to use AI to save themselves time and money, with the latest AI statistics reflecting the technology’s meteoric rise.Over the last twelve months, the AI market has grown exponentially. Google launched its own Chatbot, Bard, in March 2023, while companies like monday.com and Wix have incorporated similar technology into their existing product infrastructures.In this article, you’ll find 29 must-know statistics relating to the growth of AI, how it’s being used in the workplace, and the future of AI in the business world. Below are the top AI statistics you should know for 2024:  The Top AI Statistics for 2024 In August 2023, OpenAI’s ChatGPT registered more than 180 million unique visitors (Reuters)47% of business leaders will consider using AI to carry out tasks over hiring new staff (Tech.co)The artificial intelligence market is estimated to be worth over $638 billion by 2024 (Precedence Research)ChatGPT costs around $700,00 per day to keep running, covered by Microsoft’s investment (The Information)77% of consumers now use an AI-powered device, but only 33% think that they do (Pega)        In the rest of this guide, we cover:What Is AI?AI Job Replacement StatisticsArtificial Intelligence Growth StatisticsAI in the Workplace StatisticsAI Ethics StatisticsThe Future of AI in Business What Is AI?AI – which stands for artificial intelligence – refers to the wide range of “intelligent” behaviors and functions exhibited by machines, computers, or other technology – many of which are skills typically associated with human intelligence.Importantly, many artificial intelligence systems can “learn” or adapt to novel scenarios without following explicit instructions. This is called machine learning. ChatGPT and Bard have machine-learning capabilities.Machines or systems with artificial intelligence capabilities are usually built to solve problems, answer questions, help with planning, leverage data more efficiently, and complete complicated and time-consuming tasks at a quicker pace than humans can. AI Job Replacement Statistics1. Artificial intelligence is expected to create 133 million new jobs by 2030 (McKinsey)Let’s start off with the good news. Although there’s a lot of talk about the negative impact AI may have on jobs, some sources, such as McKinsey, predict that millions of new roles will be created as they’re gradually incorporated into existing business infrastructures. But this isn’t the only study about AI replacing jobs that’s been released recently.2. Almost 25% of jobs are expected to be “disrupted” by AI over the next five years (World Economic Forum)The World Economic Forum predicts that a quarter of all jobs will be disrupted by the rapid adoption of AI over the next half-decade. The organization says that there will be 14 million fewer overall jobs in 2028, with 83 million roles vanishing yet only 69 million being created.3. Artificial intelligence could already replace the equivalent of 300 million jobs (Goldman Sachs)This much-written-about figure made the headlines back in March, around the same time that Google’s AI chatbot, Bard, was released.Goldman Sachs says that the rapid changes to our economy spurred on by AI development and adoption could drive “a 7% (or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period.” The multinational bank also says that around two-thirds of US jobs are currently “exposed” to automation.4. 78% of legal occupations are now influenced by AI, more than any other occupation (Forrester)As you can see from the graph below, the legal world has been influenced by AI more than any other field, with life, physical, and social occupations in a distant second. Office and administrative occupations – which many people believe to be the most at-risk category of job roles – came in third.      Source: Forrester 2023 Generatvie AI Impact Forecast5. Low-paid workers are fourteen times more likely to be replaced by AI than high-paid workers (McKinsey)McKinsey’s “Generative AI and the Future of Work in America” report reveals that workers on low wages are around 14 times more likely to be forced to make career changes due to the development of AI-powered tools and systems.As Tech.co’s Conor Cawley wrote in a recent article discussing the findings, “these won’t be lateral moves. Given that lower-wage jobs will likely be automated out of existence, these employees will need to be reskilled in a major way, requiring substantial investment from organizations and businesses to address the labor needs of the new world.” Artificial Intelligence Growth Statistics1. The AI market is expected to experience an annual growth rate of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030 (Grand View Research)Grand View Research explains that the “essential fact” that’s seeing the AI market grow rapidly is the datasets accessible to companies building LLMs. “Technology has always been an essential element for these industries,” the research organization explains, “but artificial intelligence (AI) has brought technology to the center of organizations.”2. By 2030, the artificial intelligence market is projected to be worth over $1.3 trillion (Markets and Markets)AI really is here to stay – and companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have not found it difficult to secure various rounds of seed funding to continue their research and improve their large language models. With AI set to play an increasingly pivotal role in business operations, it’s not surprising that the market is set to grow exponentially over the next next seven years.3. More than 1 in every 4 dollars invested in US-based startups during 2023 went to AI companies (Crunchbase)Crunchbase has revealed that the share of overall investment making its way into the bank accounts of AI startups in 2023 is 25%. This is a huge uptick from the 12% they received on average during the four years (2018-2022) prior, another sign that AI is going to dominate the tech industry during the next decade.      Source: Crunchbase4. AI will give China a 26% boost to GDP by 2030, while North America will receive a 14.5% boost (PwC)According to consulting and auditing firm PwC, it is China that will economically benefit the most in the foreseeable future from AI. Overall however, AI could add $15.7 trillion to GDP by 2030 – which is higher than the GDP of India and China combined. AI in the Workplace Statistics1. 82% of business leaders think it’s okay to use AI to write responses to colleagues (Tech. co)Only a very small percentage of business leaders think that it’s wrong if staff members start to use AI to write responses to colleagues. While 8.8% said it was a bad practice outright, another 8.8% said that it depended entirely on the type of message being sent.2. Generative AI such as ChatGPT in business operations improves workers’ performance by 66%, averaged across 3 case studies (NN Group)Three different case studies – focusing on customer service agents, business professionals in report-heavy roles, and programmers coding software – all found that AI tools like ChatGPT improve workers’ performance.The NN Group says that support agents using AI handled 13.8% more customer inquiries every hour, while business professionals who used AI could write 59% more documents every hour. Programmers, on the other hand, benefitted the most, coding 126% more projects per week thanks to AI.3. 56% of businesses cite “inaccuracy” as the greatest risk AI poses to their organization (McKinsey)Out of all the risks posed by AI, businesses are most worried about inaccuracies – or “hallucinations” – generated by AI tools. However, cybersecurity and intellectual property theft rank highly too. Concerningly, the number of companies working to mitigate these risks is a lot lower than the number of companies that identify them as so.      Source: McKinsey’s State of Generative AI in 2023 report.4. 22% of companies have adopted AI primarily to address labor shortages (IBM)The same IBM report details that 20% of respondents said they were adopting AI due to environmental pressures, while 31% referenced competitive pressure.5. 65% of companies are using AI internally, while 74% are testing it (Deloitte)The vast majority of companies have officially jumped on the AI bandwagon. A huge proportion of companies are using AI internally and an even larger percentage claiming to be “testing” the technology. So, there’s a very small percentage who are yet to explore what AI can do for them. AI Ethics Statistics1. 68% of business leaders think it’s unethical for employees to use AI tools without the permission of a manager (Tech.co)According to a recent Tech.co survey, the vast majority of business leaders think their employees should be checking in with their employer, manager, or supervisor before they use AI tools in the workplace. However, 12.3% of respondents said they expect their employees to use AI tools, and they don’t need permission to do so.2. Training one AI large language emits as much carbon as five cars will during their lifetimes (MIT)Unfortunately, all the computing power needed to train an AI model creates quite a lot of carbon. Some estimates show that ChatGPT – one of the world’s largest language models – produces the equivalent of the greenhouse gas emissions produced by 1,369 gasoline-powered cars over a year.      Source: MIT Technology Review.3. 76% of consumers are concerned about misinformation generated by AI-powered technology (Forbes Advisor)Misinformation spread across the internet via social media platforms quickly enough without the help of powerful AI tools like ChatGPT. Worryingly, the same survey found that only 54% of respondents thought they could distinguish between human and machine-generated content.4. 56% of employees “don’t know or are unsure if their organizations have ethical standards” guiding its use (Deloitte)This is a worrying AI statistic. Unchecked usage of AI tools can cause reputational damage for companies, especially if they’re used to assist with work that’s being created for customers, clients, or public consumption. Companies that aren’t communicating internal standards for governing employees’ usage of such tools open themselves up to a wide range of risks.5. 68% of technology innovators, policy leaders, and decision-makers believe that “ethical principles focused primarily on the public good will not be employed in most AI systems by 2030” (Pew Research)If you thought the previous stat was pretty bleak, another recent AI ethics survey found that experts are not optimistic at all about the chances of AI systems being focused on creating a positive impact in society. What else these systems might be based on – good or bad – is not specified. The Future of AI in BusinessAI is going to be at the heart of many business’s operations going forward. The vast majority are already using it, while many others are getting to grips with exactly how it can help them through testing and experimentation.With business leaders apparently already keen to explore artificial intelligence as an alternative to employing new members of staff, it’s really anyone’s guess as to how the business landscape will actually change. However, businesses should be careful when incorporating generative AI tools like ChatGPT into their existing infrastructure without proper guidelines for its usage.A lack of guidelines can lead to confusion, wasted time, and even reputational damage if content created by an AI tool is released to the public without being properly checked. While AI tools and machines present a myriad of exciting opportunities for businesses, time must be taken to fully understand the range and limitations of their capabilities.

It's also one of the least automated. Step one is I've picked a space step 50 is I have now built the space, there's a million moving parts. So we started leveraging robotics and A I in order to automate some of the things that have previously been done by people. You know what we've come from in the industry in terms of how things get built and how fast things get built and how complicated things are. Now, everything is a lot more interactive. Everyone's being tasked with building more with less. The challenge for construction is actually to make construction more efficient by adopting more technology and automation. Typically today, what you'd see is big plans being printed on big sheets of paper uh handed off to someone in the field, he gets down on his hands and knees and uses measuring tape and string to mark out the locations of where all of those things are going to get built inside the building. It used to be an architect, put a piece of paper together actual hard piece of paper, an engineer got it. Drew on top of it, that then went back to a contractor who built it. And if they had questions, they picked up the phone or they mailed you something that came to you three days later. So today buildings are designed in software and 95% of the information in those digital models never gets used to build, it disappears. And that's because the process of actually laying out that information in the field is so painful. It requires someone on their hands and knees marking out each and every detail on the robot. It will follow it. And so dusty is automating this information flow by taking those digital models and printing them out in the field. Basically a little box with wheels on it that has a printer on the front and it takes those digital models and it dries itself around the floor. And as it goes, it leaves a trail of ink behind that ink marks out the locations where all the walls, the pipes, plumbing, the electrical fixtures, where everything gets installed inside that building. Dusty's field printer guarantees 1/16 of an inch accuracy to the digital run. It used to be, you drew a duct, you assumed there was some level of tolerance that you had to account for, for other trades. You gave yourself an extra couple of inches. Then the next trade came in, they gave themselves an extra couple of inches. Then by the time you were done, your shilling was a foot and a half lower than it needed to be. When we need to produce more with the workers. We have, we make better tools for the people that we have. You know, a prime example of this is the excavator. We used to dig holes with a shovel. And now all the workers who are digging, the shovels are driving excavators. These types of machinery that help improve productivity, improve jobs exist in the exteriors of spaces. We really haven't seen them penetrate the interiors. And so canvas basically makes tools for installing materials on these spaces. And our first product is in drywall finishing. Everybody has mostly seen the kind of person lift where you have a wheel base where a platform extends up and down on a lift that lifts a person. Instead of putting a person on that, we put a robot arm and a whole suite of sensors that allow us to sense and understand the space that we're working in because of the precision of the machine. It allows us to apply material more all at once as opposed to many iterative steps, which is what you'll see in drywall finishing. And so that actually shortens the schedule of the chain. The owner who wants their building finished and wants to start getting people into it can do that more quickly. Two people are retiring for every one person that enters the industry at a time where we need to build twice as much over the next 40 years. How are we going to build sustainably? How are we going to build affordably? How are we going to be able to grow our companies? Given that it's becoming harder and harder to find uh the labor that we need? You know, I think is a marketing problem because I think construction, once you actually get into it, it actually is a stem career robotics is actually just magnifying that that effect by creating more jobs that are robot operator jobs, robot technician jobs, I'm really excited about the opportunity to attract new talent to the industry and give them, you know, skills that are going to be broadly applicable for their futures going forward. And I think that's going to make construction once again, an incredibly attractive place to have a career. There's certainly growth to be done in the in the world of technology in this industry. In A I A lot of people are afraid that it's gonna replace what we do or it's gonna replace the, the installers or it's gonna replace a labor union. And I just, I don't ever, I don't ever see that happening. I don't see it getting to that point, the experts have just gotten better and refined their skills and input their experience in the right places. The machine is a tool that the worker is operating. And so we use a I more to understand our environment and to interface with the worker so that we can get good instruction from the workers. Robotics has the potential to bring people into the construction industry that would have never considered a job in construction. Because suddenly when you're using a robot, you don't need to be super strong. And that makes construction a lot more appealing to a wider variety of people. And that's really important because one of the challenges in construction is actually hiring the workforce of the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the wake of dramatic technological advances, the workplace of the future will be far different than was envisioned a year ago.

                  Artificial intelligence
                












































A little more than a year ago, we wrote a series of articles for Route Fifty about the future of government jobs in an effort to help states and localities prepare. About a month later, the phrase “generative AI” came into the public’s consciousness and that future has changed dramatically.   As governments increasingly learn how to take advantage of the information retrieval and communication dimensions of this new technology, the impact on customer service fields, call centers and service requests is likely to be especially profound.“If a city is using something like this, you may not need a 311 system,” says Ron Holifield, chief executive officer of Strategic Government Resources and interim executive director of the Alliance for Innovation. “And that has implications for the workforce because [generative AI] will route you where you need to go and get the information you need far more efficiently.”In summer 2022, Ryan Oakes, Accenture’s global health and public services industry practice chair, marveled at the speed with which technological responses to the pandemic had occurred, but wondered whether they would continue at the same rate. “AI has just put what we saw during the pandemic on steroids,” he says now. “It’s opened additional possibilities in the ways that governments can connect data, augment workers and fill gaps in staffing.”A recent report from Accenture, calculated that across both the public and private sectors, generative AI has the potential for automating and augmenting work hours in 63% of office and administrative support jobs, 59% of business and financial services jobs and 40%, on average, of occupations generally.There’s little question that generative AI is a game changer, but how fast the game will move is still an unknown as states, cities and counties try to balance the risks of utilizing the potential advances with the hazards of cybersecurity and privacy issues. There are also significant concerns about bias.Governments will need to be aware of these hazards as they seize on generative AI to power their call centers and 311 lines. This has become an even more alluring opportunity as governments realize that they can avoid troublesome misinformation on the internet by confining the uses of generative AI to “controlled” sources of information, like the entities’ own websites.But even when controlled sources are used, there can still be “missing content on a website and some content is out of date,” says Parth Shah, chief executive officer and founder of Polimorphic, a producer of advanced generative AI services. That's why governments using generative AI tools are beginning to realize they have to pay extra attention to keeping their websites accurate and up to date.Shah has spoken in recent months at ICMA and Alliance for Innovation conferences, emphasizing the importance of limiting searches to controlled generative AI sources. “Controlled content is so important because seeing everything on the internet leads to misinformation and the potential of bias,” he says.

Andy Pederson, the village manager in Bayside, Wisconsin, with about 4,400 residents, began using controlled generative AI on his government’s website in early November with the help of Polimorphic. He is enthusiastic about the possibilities, and though he’s not certain what the impact on government jobs will be, “this makes things more user-friendly for everybody involved, not only the general public but also the staff as well.”As Pederson sees it, the new tool has become “a little bit of a succession plan and training module” for his employees. He can see immediate ways in which generative AI has changed the way his workers get information, produce documents and learn about the small government they serve.

The Future of State and Local Government Jobs


There’s More Than Just AI in the FutureTechnological advancements are not the only force driving job changes. Workforce shortages are as well, especially as problems in hiring persist, staff vacancies continue, competition from the private sector grows and aging employees retire. A government that has 100 staffers now is likely facing the retirement of as many as a third of them in the next 10 years, says Shah.With advances brought on by artificial intelligence, robotics and a range of technologies that improve the efficiency of services, there are a slew of routine jobs that will no longer exist or exist in far fewer numbers. That makes the future of jobs in the public sector extremely dependent on a much more aggressive focus on training, including apprenticeships and other skill-based efforts that also expand work opportunities to populations that have been blocked from jobs in the past by job experience and college degree requirements.As Route Fifty recently reported, at least 16 states have taken steps to move away from more traditional degree requirements, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.   One of the states that has been most active in preparing for the future of government jobs is Colorado, where the Office of the Future of Work was first set up in 2019 and tasked with preparing the state for work transitions. While much of its mission is focused on the general Colorado workforce, it collaborates on a parallel effort within the Department of Personnel Administration to build skill-based learning programs for the state’s own employees. Currently, the task within the personnel administration is to work directly with all 23 of the state’s executive branch agencies on a vast array of programs and techniques to build apprenticeships (both registered and informal), internships, curriculum-based learning programs and experiential-based learning. “We’re intentional about creating sustainable programs that can cast a wide net towards our community,” says Melissa Walker, the director of Workforce Solutions for the state.Hiring changes in Colorado and other entities are accompanied by a commitment to professional development and career growth. This kind of training was often cited as a crucial need in last year’s future of government jobs series along with the warning that training programs have always been dependent on the availability of financial and time resources, particularly given workforce shortages.The Need for CautionAs efforts at automation continue to develop, one of the other major needs is caution as jobs change and new technologies are introduced. Generative AI, in particular, presents dangers as well as opportunities. As governments experiment with the new technology, they will be faced with sales pitches from vendors who may see a striking opportunity in this exciting new world but lack sufficient background and knowledge to provide necessary guardrails.“We can take advantage of technologies like generative AI without necessarily trying to introduce it into the most complicated or complex environments in government,” Accenture’s Oakes says, citing the importance of governance policies that are accessible, provide transparency to algorithms and communicate clearly.“It’s still very early, early on,” he adds. “On Tuesdays, I’m wildly enthusiastic about the potential for generative AI to make this a better world, and on Wednesdays, I wake up in a sweat, absolutely terrified.”

Specialists in fields ranging from medicine to microfinance to the military are evaluating AI tools, exploring how these might transform their work and worlds. For creative professionals, AI poses a unique set of challenges and opportunities — particularly generative AI, the use of algorithms to transform vast amounts of data into new content.
The future of generative AI and its impact on art and design was the subject of a sold-out panel discussion on Oct. 26 at the MIT Bartos Theater. It was part of the annual meeting for the Council for the Arts at MIT (CAMIT), a group of alumni and other supporters of the arts at MIT, and was co-presented by the MIT Center for Art, Science, and Technology (CAST), a cross-school initiative for artist residencies and cross-disciplinary projects.
Introduced by Andrea Volpe, director of CAMIT, and moderated by Onur Yüce Gün SM ’06, PhD’16, the panel featured multimedia artist and social science researcher Ziv Epstein SM’19, PhD’23, MIT professor of architecture and director of the SMArchS and SMArchS AD programs Ana Miljački, and artist and roboticist Alex Reben MAS ’10.

The discussion centered around three themes: emergence, embodiment, and expectations:
Emergence  
Moderator Onur Yüce Gün: In much of your work, what emerges is usually a question — an ambiguity — and that ambiguity is inherent in the creative process in art and design. Does generative AI help you reach those ambiguities?
Ana Miljački: In the summer of 2022, the Memorial Cemetery in Mostar [in Bosnia and Herzegovina] was destroyed. It was a post-World War II Yugoslav memorial, and we wanted to figure out a way to uphold the values the memorial had stood for. We compiled video material from six different monuments and, with AI, created a nonlinear documentary, a triptych playing on three video screens, accompanied by a soundscape. With this project we fabricated a synthetic memory, a way to seed those memories and values into the minds of people who never lived those memories or values. This is the type of ambiguity that would be problematic in science, and one that is fascinating for artists and designers and architects. It is also a bit scary.
Ziv Epstein: There is some debate whether generative AI is a tool or an agent. But even if we call it a tool, we need to remember that tools are not neutral. Think about photography. When photography emerged, a lot of painters were worried that it meant the end of art. But it turned out that photography freed up painters to do other things. Generative AI is, of course, a different type of tool because it draws on a huge quantity of other people’s work. There is already artistic and creative agency embedded in these systems. There are already ambiguities in how these existing works will be represented, and which cycles and ambiguities we will perpetuate.
Alex Reben: I’m often asked whether these systems are actually creative, in the way that we are creative. In my own experience, I’ve often been surprised at the outputs I create using AI. I see that I can steer things in a direction that parallels what I might have done on my own but is different enough from what I might have done, is amplified or altered or changed. So there are ambiguities. But we need to remember that the term AI is also ambiguous. It’s actually many different things.
Embodiment
Moderator: Most of us use computers on a daily basis, but we experience the world through our senses, through our bodies. Art and design create tangible experiences. We hear them, see them, touch them. Have we attained the same sensory interaction with AI systems? 
Miljački: So long as we are working in images, we are working in two dimensions. But for me, at least in the project we did around the Mostar memorial, we were able to produce affect on a variety of levels, levels that together produce something that is greater than a two-dimensional image moving in time. Through images and a soundscape we created a spatial experience in time, a rich sensory experience that goes beyond the two dimensions of the screen.
Reben: I guess embodiment for me means being able to interface and interact with the world and modify it. In one of my projects, we used AI to generate a “Dali-like” image, and then turned it into a three-dimensional object, first with 3D printing, and then casting it in bronze at a foundry. There was even a patina artist to finish the surface. I cite this example to show just how many humans were involved in the creation of this artwork at the end of the day. There were human fingerprints at every step.
Epstein: The question is, how do we embed meaningful human control into these systems, so they could be more like, for example, a violin. A violin player has all sorts of causal inputs — physical gestures they can use to transform their artistic intention into outputs, into notes and sounds. Right now we’re far from that with generative AI. Our interaction is basically typing a bit of text and getting something back. We’re basically yelling at a black box.
Expectations
Moderator: These new technologies are spreading so rapidly, almost like an explosion. And there are enormous expectations around what they are going to do. Instead of stepping on the gas here, I’d like to test the brakes and ask what these technologies are not going to do. Are there promises they won’t be able to fulfill?
Miljački: I am hoping that we don’t go to “Westworld.” I understand we do need AI to solve complex computational problems. But I hope it won’t be used to replace thinking. Because as a tool AI is actually nostalgic. It can only work with what already exists and then produce probable outcomes. And that means it reproduces all the biases and gaps in the archive it has been fed. In architecture, for example, that archive is made up of works by white male European architects. We have to figure out how not to perpetuate that type of bias, but to question it.
Epstein: In a way, using AI now is like putting on a jetpack and a blindfold. You’re going really fast, but you don’t really know where you’re going. Now that this technology seems to be capable of doing human-like things, I think it’s an awesome opportunity for us to think about what it means to be human. My hope is that generative AI can be a kind of ontological wrecking ball, that it can shake things up in a very interesting way.
Reben: I know from history that it’s pretty hard to predict the future of technology. So trying to predict the negative — what might not happen — with this new technology is also close to impossible. If you look back at what we thought we would have now, at the predictions that were made, it’s quite different from what we actually have. I don’t think that anyone today can say for certain what AI won’t be able to do one day. Just like we can’t say what science will be able to do, or humans. The best we can do, for now, is attempt to drive these technologies towards the future in a way that will be beneficial.

For more on the picture of human minds as action-based prediction machines, see Clark, A.  The Experience Machine: How Our Minds Predict and Shape Reality (Penguin Random House, 2023).Generative AI—think Dall.E, ChatGPT-4, and many more—is all the rage. It’s remarkable successes, and occasional catastrophic failures, have kick-started important debates about both the scope and dangers of advanced forms of artificial intelligence. But what, if anything, does this work reveal about natural intelligences such as our own?I’m a philosopher and cognitive scientist who has spent their entire career trying to understand how the human mind works. Drawing on research spanning psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, my search has drawn me towards a picture of how natural minds work that is both interestingly similar to, yet also deeply different from, the core operating principles of the generative AIs. Examining this contrast may help us better understand them both.The AIs learn a generative model (hence their name) that enables them to predict patterns in various kinds of data or signal. What generative there means is that they learn enough about the deep regularities in some data-set to enable them to create plausible new versions of that kind of data for themselves. In the case of ChatGPT the data is text. Knowing about all the many faint and strong patterns in a huge library of texts allows ChatGPT, when prompted, to produce plausible versions of that kind of data in interesting ways, when sculpted by user prompts—for example, a user might request a story about a black cat written in the style of Ernest Hemingway. But there are also AIs specializing in other kinds of data, such as images, enabling them to create new paintings in the style of, say, Picasso.What does this have to do with the human mind? According to much contemporary theorizing, the human brain has learnt a model to predict certain kinds of data, too. But in this case the data to be predicted are the various barrages of sensory information registered by sensors in our eyes, ears, and other perceptual organs. Now comes the crucial difference. Natural brains must learn to predict those sensory flows in a very special kind of context—the context of using the sensory information to select actions that help us survive and thrive in our worlds. This means that among the many things our brains learn to predict, a core subset concerns the ways our own actions on the world will alter what we subsequently sense. For example, my brain has learnt that if I accidentally tread on the tail of my cat, the next sensory stimulations I get will often include sightings of wailing, squirming, and occasionally feelings of pain from a well-deserved retaliatory scratch.Read More: AI and the Rise of MediocrityThis kind of learning has special virtues. It helps us separate cause and simple correlation. Seeing my cat is strongly correlated with seeing the furniture in my apartment. But neither one of these causes the other to occur. Treading on my cat’s tail, by contrast, causes the subsequent wailing and scratching. Knowing the difference is crucial if you are a creature that needs to act on its world to bring about desired (or to avoid undesired) effects. In other words, the generative model that issues natural predictions is constrained by a familiar and biologically critical goal—the selection of the right actions to perform at the right times. That means knowing how things currently are and (crucially) how things will change and alter if we act and intervene on the world in certain ways.How do ChatGPT and the other contemporary AIs look when compared with this understanding of human brains and human minds? Most obviously, current AIs tend to specialize in predicting rather specific kinds of data—sequences of words, in the case of ChatGPT. At first sight, this suggest that ChatGPT might more properly be seen as a model of our textual outputs rather than (like biological brains) models of the world we live in. That would be a very significant difference indeed. But that move is arguably a little too swift. Words, as the wealth of great and not-so-great literature attests, already depict patterns of every kind—patterns among looks and tastes and sounds for example. This gives the generative AIs a real window onto our world. Still missing, however, is that crucial ingredient—action. At best, text-predictive AIs get a kind of verbal fossil trail of the effects of our actions upon the world. That trail is made up of verbal descriptions of actions (""Andy trod on his cat’s tail"") along with verbally couched information about their typical effects and consequences. Despite this the AIs have no practical abilities to intervene on the world—so no way to test, evaluate, and improve their own world-model, the one making the predictions.More From TIMEThe 3 Most Important AI Innovations of 2023More Videos0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9

Loading adLive00:2500:0004:14 This is an important practical limitation. It is rather as if someone had access to a huge library of data concerning the shape and outcomes of all previous experiments, but were unable to conduct any of their own. But it may have deeper significance too. For plausibly, it is only by poking, prodding, and generally intervening upon our worlds that biological minds anchor their knowledge to the very world it is meant to describe. By learning what causes what, and how different actions will affect our future worlds in different ways, we build a firm basis for our own later understandings. It is that grounding in actions and their effects that later enables us to truly understand encountered sentences such as ""The cat scratched the person who trod on its tail."" Our generative models—unlike those of the generative AIs—are forged in the fires of action.Might future AIs build anchored models in this way too? Might they start to run experiments in which they launch responses into the world to see what effects those responses have? Something a bit like this already occurs in the context of online advertising, political campaigning, and social media manipulating, where algorithms can launch ads, posts and reports and adjust their future behavior according to specific effects on buyers, voters, and others. If more powerful AIs closed the action loop in these ways, they would be starting to turn their currently passive and ""second-hand"" window onto the human world into something closer to the kind of grip that active beings like us have on our worlds.But even then, there’d be other things missing. Many of the predictions that structure human experience concern our own internal physiological states. For example, we experience thirst and hunger in ways that are deeply anticipatory, allowing us to remedy looming shortfalls in advance, so as to stay within the correct zone for bodily integrity and survival. This means that we exist in a world where some of our brain’s predictions matter in a very special way. They matter because they enable us to continue to exist as the embodied, energy metabolizing, beings that we are. We humans also benefit hugely from collective practices of culture, science, and art, allowing us to share our knowledge and to probe and test our own best models of ourselves and our worlds.In addition, we humans are what might be called ""knowing knowers""—we depict ourselves to ourselves as having knowledge and beliefs, and we have slowly designed the complex worlds of art, science, and technology to test and improve our own knowledge and beliefs. For example, we can write papers that make claims that are swiftly challenged by others, and then run experiments to try to resolve the differences of opinion. In all these ways (even bracketing obvious but currently intractable questions about ‘true conscious awareness’) there seems to be a very large gulf separating our special kinds of knowing and understanding from anything so far achieved by the AIs.Could AIs one day become prediction machines with a survival instinct, running baseline predictions that pro-actively seek to create and maintain the conditions for their own existence? Could they thereby become increasingly autonomous, protecting their own hardware and manufacturing and drawing power as needed? Could they form a community, and invent a kind of culture? Could they start to model themselves as beings with beliefs and opinions? There is nothing in their current situation to drive them in these familiar directions. But none of these dimensions is obviously off-limits either. If changes were to occur along all or some of those key missing dimensions, we might yet be glimpsing the soul of a new machine.",,,,,,,,,2023-12-20T17:25:47.000Z,PT4M14S,https://time.com/6552233/generative-ai-reveals-human-mind/,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/gIt8zUdS/poster.jpg?width=720,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/gIt8zUdS.m3u8,,,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6552233/generative-ai-reveals-human-mind/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PascualJAN 04, 2024 - 10:20 ESTWhatsappFacebookTwitterLinkedinCopy linkMatthew Butterick seems like a normal guy. He wears a baseball cap, clear-rimmed glasses and a colorful sports jacket. Behind him are two vintage keyboards and synthesizers — they add a bohemian touch to the basement of his Los Angeles home, which is also his office. “I have a collection of more than 20,” he notes, in a video call with EL PAÍS. Nothing in this scene suggests that Butterick is a lawyer… nor that someone so far removed from the classic suit-and-tie stereotype makes giants like Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta hold their breath.The American has started a legal crusade against generative artificial intelligence (AI). In 2022, he filed the first lawsuit in the history of this field against Microsoft, one of the companies that develop these types of tools (GitHub Copilot). Today, he’s coordinating four class action lawsuits that bring together complaints filed by programmers, artists and writers. If successful, he could force the companies responsible for applications such as ChatGPT or Midjourney to compensate thousands of creators. They may even have to retire their algorithms and retrain them with databases that don’t infringe on intellectual property rights. “This is, for many of us, the fight of our lives,” he affirms. The first results of his efforts could arrive in a matter of months.The New York Times took the same path as Butterick a few days ago, suing OpenAI and Microsoft for having used millions of articles from the newspaper (without consent) to train their algorithms. This the first media outlet to take this measure. “I can’t comment on the case because I haven’t read the lawsuit,” Butterick shrugs. “We were the first to sue Meta and OpenAI for training linguistic models with copyrighted material. We’re not surprised that others have subsequently done so. My partner Joe Saveri and I have always viewed our cases and other litigation as one part of an emerging global conversation about how generative AI will coexist with human creativity. This race has just begun,” he adds.2023 was the year in which the world became aware of the potential of generative AI, which is capable of producing (apparently) original texts, images, or music. But the algorithms that make this possible are applied to gigantic databases made up of billions of documents, including texts, illustrations, or pieces of music. All of these works — without which automatic systems would be totally useless — have an author behind them, who not only isn’t compensated for AI’s use of their work, but who may become unemployed as generative AI tools become more sophisticated.Butterick identified this danger in the summer of 2022, months before the emergence of ChatGPT. Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this 53-year-old American has made his living primarily as a typeface designer, programmer and writer. “Like many other creators and artists, it’s become clear to me that my work is doomed. It’s now part of the training data of many generative AI systems. The next step is to get rid of us,” he sighs.The first product that put Butterick on alert was Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, an AI-assisted software tool that trains with a host of open source software. He remembers how its launch sowed doubt among the programming community. The difference between Butterick and the rest of those affected is that he decided to take action on the matter. He dusted off the law degree that he obtained from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) 15 years ago.“After speaking with those affected, I concluded that this system is a violation of open source licenses and that it’s not a benign tool. It’s designed to replace open source programmers… I expressed this in my blog,” he points out. “Joseph Saveri — a lawyer I knew, who was a fan of my typography work — contacted me and said, ‘You know, the point you’re making about GitHub Copilot is pretty interesting.’ At the time, I wasn’t a practicing lawyer, so Joe and I embarked on an investigation and became convinced that there really was a case [to be made].”In November 2022, Butterick and Saveri filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California against Microsoft, owner of GitHub Copilot, alleging that the firm violates open license agreements. This was the first piece of litigation having to do with generative AI.Illustrator Karla Ortiz, along with lawyers Matthew Butterick (on her right) and Cadio Zirpoli, before testifying at the U.S. Senate’s Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, in July 2023.Chip Somodevilla (Getty Images)But programmers weren’t the only ones who saw their jobs in danger. After filing the lawsuit, a group of visual artists approached the lawyers. “They told us: ‘Wow, that sounds similar to the problem we have. Would you be interested in taking our case?’” This is how the legal process they opened in January 2023 against Stability AI, Midjourney and Deviant Art — the main generative AI tools applied to illustration — was conceived. This past November, they submitted amendments requested by the judge. The process continues, just like that of Copilot.The third group that Butterick and Saveri represent are authors of books. In July, they filed two class-action lawsuits against OpenAI and Meta for including books written by plaintiffs — including Richard Kadri and Christopher Golden — in their training dataset.A very real threatIllustrator Karla Ortiz realized the tsunami that was about to hit her and her colleagues in the summer of 2022. This 38-year-old Puerto Rican artist has worked for most of the major Hollywood studios, including Marvel Studios, HBO and Universal Pictures, as well as video game production companies such as Blizzard and Ubisoft. Key characters from blockbusters such as Thor: Ragnarok, Doctor Strange and Jurassic World have been drawn up by her brushes. But not even someone of her status feels safe.Ortiz began researching how generative AI tools are applied to illustration. She soon recognized the work of her colleagues in the drawings produced by the tools. “I was horrified to see that these platforms use your name, so that users can demand your style. [The AI] takes your work to generate images that look like yours,” she explains by video call from her San Francisco studio. “At that moment, I started to worry a lot. I’m a member of the board of directors of the Concept Art Association of America, which brings together artists who work for the film and video game industry. We decided to mobilize.”Ortiz and two other colleagues became plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit filed by Butterick and Saveri against Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt. Her cause gained momentum when, this past July, she was called to testify before the U.S. Senate’s Subcommittee on Intellectual Property to talk about the legality and ethics of AI. “That would have been inconceivable a year earlier. Senators are taking seriously [the fact] that creators have their works taken away without their consent, without compensation and without credit,” Butterick notes. He accompanied his client to the Capitol.“For illustrators, a traditionally important source of income is putting the ideas of producers and directors into images, to then show them to the studios. That activity has literally been erased by generative AI,” Ortiz says. “My job is at risk. It consists of showcasing ideas, and machines are now doing that really well. We artists cannot compete against those tools. I never worried about the future of my career until now.”AI reaches the courtsThe momentum generated by the class-action lawsuits filed by Butterick and his colleague has paved the way for more lawsuits. In 2023, Getty Images sued Stability AI for using images from its archive without permission. In September, two other groups of writers filed complaints against OpenAI. Bestsellers George R. R. Martin, John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen are among them. And, in October, several record labels — including the Universal Music Group — sued Anthropic, a company created by former OpenAI workers, for training its algorithms with copyrighted materials. Hollywood actors’ unions haven’t litigated yet, but they were on strike for months to improve their pay conditions and obtain guarantees that protect them against artificial intelligence.Butterick and Saveri know that the fight is now or never. This wave of lawsuits basically says that generative AI is illegal. When this technology is fully established, it will be more difficult to go against the companies that develop it. But if the courts conclude that the training of algorithms is illegal, the blow to big tech could be massive. They would have to start over and redo their databases. It would also be disastrous for them to have to license these databases, negotiating payments in exchange for permissions from each source.Is it too optimistic to think about such an outcome? “That’s happened before,” Butterick responds with a smile. “The FTC has investigated companies that used models based on private data and made them delete their databases and the algorithms and models built with them,” he explains. Cambridge Analytica — the consulting firm that used data from more than 80 million Facebook users to influence the 2016 presidential election — was the first company to suffer from the FTC’s new policy in 2019, dubbed “algorithmic destruction.”In the EU, the pending regulatory framework on AI — whose final text is not yet public, although there has been wide consensus among member states — establishes the obligation for foundational models to comply with the bloc’s copyright regulations.

He wears a baseball cap, clear-rimmed glasses and a colorful sports jacket. Behind him are two vintage keyboards and synthesizers — they add a bohemian touch to the basement of his Los Angeles home, which is also his office. “I have a collection of more than 20,” he notes, in a video call with EL PAÍS. Nothing in this scene suggests that Butterick is a lawyer… nor that someone so far removed from the classic suit-and-tie stereotype makes giants like Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta hold their breath. The American has started a legal crusade against generative artificial intelligence (AI). In 2022, he filed the first lawsuit in the history of this field against Microsoft, one of the companies that develop these types of tools (GitHub Copilot). Today, he’s coordinating four class action lawsuits that bring together complaints filed by programmers, artists and writers. If successful, he could force the companies responsible for applications such as ChatGPT or Midjourney to compensate thousands of creators. They may even have to retire their algorithms and retrain them with databases that don’t infringe on intellectual property rights. “This is, for many of us, the fight of our lives,” he affirms. The first results of his efforts could arrive in a matter of months. The New York Times took the same path as Butterick a few days ago, suing OpenAI and Microsoft for having used millions of articles from the newspaper (without consent) to train their algorithms. This the first media outlet to take this measure. “I can’t comment on the case because I haven’t read the lawsuit,” Butterick shrugs. “We were the first to sue Meta and OpenAI for training linguistic models with copyrighted material. We’re not surprised that others have subsequently done so. My partner Joe Saveri and I have always viewed our cases and other litigation as one part of an emerging global conversation about how generative AI will coexist with human creativity. This race has just begun,” he adds. 2023 was the year in which the world became aware of the potential of generative AI, which is capable of producing (apparently) original texts, images, or music. But the algorithms that make this possible are applied to gigantic databases made up of billions of documents, including texts, illustrations, or pieces of music. All of these works — without which automatic systems would be totally useless — have an author behind them, who not only isn’t compensated for AI’s use of their work, but who may become unemployed as generative AI tools become more sophisticated. Butterick identified this danger in the summer of 2022, months before the emergence of ChatGPT. Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this 53-year-old American has made his living primarily as a typeface designer, programmer and writer. “Like many other creators and artists, it’s become clear to me that my work is doomed. It’s now part of the training data of many generative AI systems. The next step is to get rid of us,” he sighs. The first product that put Butterick on alert was Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, an AI-assisted software tool that trains with a host of open source software. He remembers how its launch sowed doubt among the programming community. The difference between Butterick and the rest of those affected is that he decided to take action on the matter. He dusted off the law degree that he obtained from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) 15 years ago. “After speaking with those affected, I concluded that this system is a violation of open source licenses and that it’s not a benign tool. It’s designed to replace open source programmers… I expressed this in my blog,” he points out. “Joseph Saveri — a lawyer I knew, who was a fan of my typography work — contacted me and said, ‘You know, the point you’re making about GitHub Copilot is pretty interesting.’ At the time, I wasn’t a practicing lawyer, so Joe and I embarked on an investigation and became convinced that there really was a case [to be made].” In November 2022, Butterick and Saveri filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California against Microsoft, owner of GitHub Copilot, alleging that the firm violates open license agreements. This was the first piece of litigation having to do with generative AI. But programmers weren’t the only ones who saw their jobs in danger. After filing the lawsuit, a group of visual artists approached the lawyers. “They told us: ‘Wow, that sounds similar to the problem we have. Would you be interested in taking our case?’” This is how the legal process they opened in January 2023 against Stability AI, Midjourney and Deviant Art — the main generative AI tools applied to illustration — was conceived. This past November, they submitted amendments requested by the judge. The process continues, just like that of Copilot. The third group that Butterick and Saveri represent are authors of books. In July, they filed two class-action lawsuits against OpenAI and Meta for including books written by plaintiffs — including Richard Kadri and Christopher Golden — in their training dataset. Illustrator Karla Ortiz realized the tsunami that was about to hit her and her colleagues in the summer of 2022. This 38-year-old Puerto Rican artist has worked for most of the major Hollywood studios, including Marvel Studios, HBO and Universal Pictures, as well as video game production companies such as Blizzard and Ubisoft. Key characters from blockbusters such as Thor: Ragnarok, Doctor Strange and Jurassic World have been drawn up by her brushes. But not even someone of her status feels safe. Ortiz began researching how generative AI tools are applied to illustration. She soon recognized the work of her colleagues in the drawings produced by the tools. “I was horrified to see that these platforms use your name, so that users can demand your style. [The AI] takes your work to generate images that look like yours,” she explains by video call from her San Francisco studio. “At that moment, I started to worry a lot. I’m a member of the board of directors of the Concept Art Association of America, which brings together artists who work for the film and video game industry. We decided to mobilize.” Ortiz and two other colleagues became plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit filed by Butterick and Saveri against Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt. Her cause gained momentum when, this past July, she was called to testify before the U.S. Senate’s Subcommittee on Intellectual Property to talk about the legality and ethics of AI. “That would have been inconceivable a year earlier. Senators are taking seriously [the fact] that creators have their works taken away without their consent, without compensation and without credit,” Butterick notes. He accompanied his client to the Capitol. “For illustrators, a traditionally important source of income is putting the ideas of producers and directors into images, to then show them to the studios. That activity has literally been erased by generative AI,” Ortiz says. “My job is at risk. It consists of showcasing ideas, and machines are now doing that really well. We artists cannot compete against those tools. I never worried about the future of my career until now.” The momentum generated by the class-action lawsuits filed by Butterick and his colleague has paved the way for more lawsuits. In 2023, Getty Images sued Stability AI for using images from its archive without permission. In September, two other groups of writers filed complaints against OpenAI. Bestsellers George R. R. Martin, John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen are among them. And, in October, several record labels — including the Universal Music Group — sued Anthropic, a company created by former OpenAI workers, for training its algorithms with copyrighted materials. Hollywood actors’ unions haven’t litigated yet, but they were on strike for months to improve their pay conditions and obtain guarantees that protect them against artificial intelligence. Butterick and Saveri know that the fight is now or never. This wave of lawsuits basically says that generative AI is illegal. When this technology is fully established, it will be more difficult to go against the companies that develop it. But if the courts conclude that the training of algorithms is illegal, the blow to big tech could be massive. They would have to start over and redo their databases. It would also be disastrous for them to have to license these databases, negotiating payments in exchange for permissions from each source. Is it too optimistic to think about such an outcome? “That’s happened before,” Butterick responds with a smile. “The FTC has investigated companies that used models based on private data and made them delete their databases and the algorithms and models built with them,” he explains. Cambridge Analytica — the consulting firm that used data from more than 80 million Facebook users to influence the 2016 presidential election — was the first company to suffer from the FTC’s new policy in 2019, dubbed “algorithmic destruction.” In the EU, the pending regulatory framework on AI — whose final text is not yet public, although there has been wide consensus among member states — establishes the obligation for foundational models to comply with the bloc’s copyright regulations. We’ll have to wait for the fine print of the framework to see how it’s executed. Butterick has put writing, design and programming on hold for almost a year to focus on his lawsuits. He believes this is the right thing to do. “I have the firm conviction that if I don’t stop my regular work and join these cases, I won’t have anything left.

However, AI is more transformational technology-wise and has come at a time when two wars are being fought with global ramifications. So, the likelihood of AI-related jobs that will get created may not be enough to dwarf the job losses created by AI's disruption,” he said.Vijay Sivaram, chief executive at Quess IT Staffing, said although AI innovation has been there for a while, its implications on the workforce are being felt only now because of rapid evolution in generative-AI tools.“We will continue to see AI replacing certain skills, especially among yesteryear engineers who have not been able to upskill,” Sivaram said.At a macro level, the IT hiring market is in itself in a slowdown, he said. “The ongoing job displacement is also playing out now due to over-hiring that happened in the 2021-22 pandemic cycle. And, therefore, organisations are looking at thinning their teams through AI automation wherever possible.”ET had previously reported that the big tech pack of ‘FAAMNG’ companies in India are in a near hiring pause amid the macroeconomic headwinds and global layoffs.These companies — Facebook (Meta Platforms), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and Google (Alphabet) — registered a 90% drop in active job postings in India so far in 2023 compared with last year, according to data put together for ET by Xpehno. In fact, the combined current job postings by these companies at 200 is just 2% of what usually is the number in India.Cumulatively, the top four Indian IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech and Wipro — have cut down their headcount by 37,299 over the past two quarters. This compares to an addition of 81,678 jobs during the first half of fiscal 2023.Vikram Ahuja, CEO of hiring solutions provider Talent500, said IT support services and routine software development have started to see a change in opportunities. “Organisations have started to explore chatbots and customer support products which will help them drive higher productivity and conversion,” he said.Conversely, AI has positively impacted sectors such as advanced tech (AI development, machine learning), healthcare (AI-assisted diagnostics) and finance (algorithmic trading, fraud detection), he added.Munira Loliwala, assistant vice president (strategy and growth), TeamLease Digital, said the need for reskilling 16 million employees will also create more than 4.7 million new opportunities by 2027, across manufacturing, retail, education, finance & insurance. The manufacturing sector alone is expected to add nearly 1 million new tech jobs led by AI.“Roles in application developers, data analysts and platform owners will be the most sought-after skills … Slightly over 50% of these roles are expected to fall in manufacturing, retail / consumer and healthcare sectors that involve substantial amounts of repetitive work that lends itself to automation.

Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) physicians and researchers are applying artificial intelligence (AI) in innovative ways to advance clinical care and scientific understanding of these cutting-edge tools. Some examples of the use of AI are included here but other new examples are being developed and tested.
VUMC recently began testing AI for assisting health care documentation with a 10-physician pilot involving a system called DAX Copilot, from Nuance, a Microsoft subsidiary.
DAX Copilot is an AI-powered, voice-enabled system designed to automate the creation of clinical notes. The program listens to patient encounters and leverages generative AI to generate real-time, comprehensive clinic visit notes with appropriate headings and context. These notes are then made available immediately for clinician review and editing, integrating directly into VUMC’s electronic health record system.
Dara Mize, MD, MS
A key aspect of AI-assisted documentation is its potential to alleviate physician burnout while improving patient interactions, said the leader spearheading the pilot, Dara Mize, MD, MS, assistant professor of Biomedical Informatics and Medicine and Chief Medical Information Officer for VUMC.
“Generative AI shows promise in improving both the quality and efficiency of health care documentation. The upcoming pilot marks a significant step in VUMC’s exploration of AI’s potential in streamlining clinician workflows and enhancing medical record-keeping while reducing time spent on documentation,” Mize said.
The initial pilot will involve physicians from the Division of General Internal Medicine and Public Health and the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. The Medical Center may evaluate additional AI-powered documentation assistants, Mize said, and these tests could expand to involve faculty in other divisions and departments.
“This continues VUMC’s commitment to identifying and integrating leading health care technologies for quality, safety, and an enhanced patient/provider experience,” Mize said.
For research, VUMC has created a version of OpenAI’s large language model which is deployed inside of VUMC’s Azure tenant and is available to VUMC’s researchers. The VUMC-hosted graphical user interface (GUI) supports common prompt and response features.
Researchers can experiment using this interface as an alternative to the public version of ChatGPT which is disabled on VUMC’s networks. The Chat playground provides more controls than the public chat interface from OpenAI.
Unlike the public version of ChatGTP, VUMC retains control over all data submitted to aiChat. aiChat is HIPAA certified and its use is covered under VUMC’s Business Associates Agreement with Microsoft.
“Health IT worked closely with leaders in the Department of Biomedical Informatics to create a platform for the VUMC community to safely explore large language models,” said Travis Osterman, DO, MS, Associate Vice President for Research Informatics and associate chief medical information officer for VUMC.
More information about generative AI can be found at the Office of Research On the Horizon Town Hall Series (https://www.vumc.org/oor/horizon-series). Researchers can test aiChat at https://aichat.app.vumc.org/ (on campus or vpn required).
The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) was an early adopter of using AI to help schedule treatment for patients with cancer. In 2019 VICC implemented the LeanTaaS iQueue system to reduce patient wait times in infusion centers, assist with nurse scheduling, and improve throughput. The iQueue platform collects actual infusion times for various treatments and leverages AI to recommend the optimal infusion appointment for patients.
“Use of the LeanTaaS iQueue for Infusion product has helped TVC 2 Infusion achieve a 50% reduction in median patient wait time, while increasing our average patient hours by 10%. Our scheduled is now level-loaded throughout the day, leading to significantly fewer bottlenecks, increased patient satisfaction, and increased nurse satisfaction,” said Cody Stansel, MSN, RN, administrative director of Nursing for VICC.
“Patients typically feel that their wait times are more reasonable and that they can get in and get their treatment faster. Our nursing staff are enabled to take their breaks on time and no longer feel the pressure caused by a consistent lobby full of patients waiting to be seen.”
As another example of AI adoption at VUMC, RapidAI is also currently being used to assist the VUMC Stroke Team in evaluating patients with stroke. These tools deliver quantified and color-coded CT perfusion maps that help physicians quickly assess salvageable brain tissue — enabling faster clinical decisions that facilitate better patient outcomes (https://www.rapidai.com/rapid-ctp).
In addition to deploying commercial AI applications, VUMC also has a history of developing its own. For instance, in 2014 Vikram Tiwari, PhD, MBA, associate professor of Anesthesiology and Biomedical Informatics, William R. Furman, and Warren Sanberg, MD, PhD, chair of the Department of Anesthesiology and professor of Biomedical Informatics, developed an AI tool to predict elective surgical case volume that is still used today. Their work is published in the journal Anesthesia.
Developing elective schedules allows anesthesiologists to predict final case volumes weeks in advance. After implementation, overly high or low-volume days are revealed in advance, allowing nursing, ancillary service, and anesthesia managers to proactively fine-tune staffing to match demand.

There is a serious concern that with the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), entry-level job seekers are doomed. However, the more I’ve spoken with employers across the continent, it has become clear that we are not dealing with an AI problem. Instead, we’re dealing with a change in investment philosophy that is leading to a shift in the fundamental strategy behind technology’s rapid growth.Employees are expressing sweeping concerns about the impact of AI on their jobs. We’re seeing new terms like FOBO, or fear of becoming obsolete, enter our lexicon. It’s natural to feel this way. In fact, 74 per cent of Canadian (both employed and unemployed) job seekers do, expressing concern that generative AI may replace them. This concern has only escalated with the incessant layoffs that have plagued the tech sector.

The recent firing and subsequent re-hiring of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sparked conversations about the potential consequences of superintelligent systems. This fall, the federal government launched a voluntary code of conduct for the responsible use of AI. In the U.S., President Joe Biden recently issued an executive order for AI, in part to mitigate the harms of AI for workers and address job displacement. While prudent, most of this will be addressing future iterations of AI, as the reality is that AI is not taking people’s jobs ... yet. There is no denying that companies are trying it as a job replacement, but up until now it has been relatively unsuccessful. The reason they are trying this hard is the fundamental shift in how technology companies grow and value themselves — from the startup to the enterprise stage.

Let’s take a step back.The reality is that AI has the potential to boost productivity. At the beginning of the pandemic, investors heavily funded tech companies with the expectation of rapid growth, prioritizing expansion and speed over profitability. If AI had arrived during that period, we would be talking about the potential to accelerate company builds, not the threat to junior jobs. Instead, companies entered a talent war and hired an abundance of employees at inflated salaries.Since then, a number of factors, underscored by rising interest rates, have shifted investment strategies. Companies previously valued at $100 million missed a couple of targets and almost immediately were pressured to turn a profit to justify that valuation. That pressure to achieve profit is what led to a rapid increase of layoffs in 2023 and will likely lead to more in 2024. Companies had to rightsize on a new standard.Over the past decade, a combination of low-interest rates, consumer confidence and a growing pool of educated professionals encouraged a healthy business ecosystem. This environment incentivized tech companies to take business risks that they are now struggling with, and there is an increased urgency for companies to deliver profitability. This change in philosophy means there’s not a lot of room for hiring, and what’s left is a massive group of people on the market. Amazon, Google and Shopify are not going bankrupt. They laid people off because they needed to drive more profitability. It’s as simple as that.The tides have shifted. Don’t get lost at sea.This is where AI comes into play. AI is a powerful tool that has the ability to streamline administrative tasks and simplify decision-making. The reconciliation tech companies now face between growth and profit offers the opportunity to re-evaluate business models and focus on achieving profitability, while harnessing the technology’s potential.Many companies can’t afford to hire right now, but if they use AI, maybe they’ll be more productive. They’re not using AI to replace juniors, they’re simply using AI to get the most out of the teams they currently have and hit inflated goals. The important thing to keep in mind is that there are still more roles than people with the talent to fulfil them. This overcorrection has led to an abundance of talent searching for homes while companies are under pressure to not hire, but that will change, because it’s not sustainable.

The importance of entry-level jobs cannot be overstated. Schools and training can provide the skills necessary to succeed in the job, but to meet the talent needs of the next decade, there will be a need for a constant influx of talent. As the backbone of all industries, the entry-level market provides individuals with a pathway to gain experience and develop skills. A healthy job market relies on varying degrees of seniority to succeed.Entry-levels jobs are here to say — just not in the way they have been existing. Technology companies will need to continue acclimating to the demands of innovation, and juniors will have to pivot to new territory. But, at the end of the day, AI is not yet useful without humans attached to it. Instead, we should all watch how the change in investment and tech growth philosophy impacts innovation and the job market.

Rapid use of Generative AI, the emergence of a new blended workforce of humans and digital workers, and increasing employee fear of being obsolete (FOBO), together prove what Intel co-founder Gordon Moore (and the author of Moore’s Law) said, at any given point in time, “change has never been this fast and will never be this slow ever again.”


Resiliency, agility, and adopting a “test and learn approach” will mark the winning strategies for 2024.

As I have done in in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,  2022, and 2023, here is my countdown of what you should include on your HR roadmap for 2024.



1. Generative AI Will Be Your New Work Buddy
PROMOTED
In 2024, Generative AI will shake up how we think about what work we do and what we delegate to our new “work buddy.” This will be the year of specialized AI powered assistants working side by side with humans. Teachers will get a copilot for homework grading, such as Class Companion. Architects will get an AI assistant for design, SketchPro, and online learners studying at Kahn Academy will be able to access Kahnmigo to aid in brainstorming helping them to become better writers and learners while decreasing a teacher’s administrative workload.
Walmart launched one of the largest AI powered work buddies, called My Assistant, an AI powered app to help Walmart’s 50,000 corporate employees be more productive in summarizing long documents, creating new content, and taking over routine tasks that humans did in the past. Microsoft’s Co-Pilot, soon to launch, will integrate generative AI into Microsoft 365, allowing workers to perform at a much higher level. Jared Spataro, Microsoft Corporate Vice President, believes Microsoft Co-Pilot will transform meetings from a point in time and place to a knowledge object. This means employees working with Microsoft Co-Pilot will not only be able to create a summary of the meeting, but also use Co-Pilot to query the group’s sentiment on the meeting topic, the dissenting opinions, who the key dissenters were, and the agreed-to next steps. While these AI powered work buddies can boost efficiency and performance, it will be up to humans to have a strategy to capitalize on their potential.

2. Generative AI Will Impact How Managers Lead 
Generative AI has evolved to one of the fastest adopted technologies, with nearly 200 million users of ChatGPT since it launched on November 30, 2022. Business and HR leaders are struggling with how to keep pace with rapid adoption in the workplace. The impact on managers is not simply in training employees on how to use Generative AI, but also in helping managers lead teams of humans and digital workers. Morgan Stanley estimates Generative AI technologies will likely affect a quarter of all occupations that exist today, and this will rise to 44% within three years. To address this, companies and education providers need to provide training on how to use Generative AI. Within the next three years, this will translate into a $16 billion market for re-skilling workers displaced by Generative AI.

As Generative AI becomes increasingly adept at problem solving, it will be up to managers to get better at problem finding. Managers will be working side-by-side with their human and digital teams to foster a culture of continuous learning while leaning into their uniquely human skills, such as relationship building, communications, and collaboration. One thing is certain: Generative AI will drive organizational change, impact workflows, automate some jobs, and create new ones. But it will always be humans augmented by machines that will create innovation.

3. The Fear of Obsolescence Will Force Companies to Increase Spending in Career Development & Mobility 
While employers see the promise of increased productivity using Generative AI, a recent survey by EY reports that 75% of employees are concerned AI will make certain jobs obsolete, and two-thirds say they fear AI will replace their job. This fear of being obsolete is causing employees to seek out training in using Generative AI and acquiring new skills to better deal with their fears. PwC announced a $1 billion investment in training its workers on AI with courses on topics such as the ethics of AI, responsible use of AI, and how to create AI prompts to generate the best results. Their goal is to engage 75,000 U.S. PwC employees to both enroll and complete these courses.
In addition to training employees on how to use Generative AI, there is an explosion of new internal talent marketplaces as companies continue to find it difficult to successfully recruit external talent. Internal talent marketplaces have become the de facto way companies connect employees with internal career opportunities and resources to grow in their careers. For example, Grow at Key is KeyBank’s AI powered employee-led, and manager supported talent platform to support internal talent mobility. Launched with the vision that every employee can be the CEO of her own career, Grow at Key provides a range of resources, from matching employees to new job roles to accessing mentoring, coaching, and stretch assignments. To date, there has been a 60% increase in employees engaging in training programs and one in three KeyBank employees have enrolled in an Investing in My Development session to prepare them for understanding how to better manage their careers.
4. Hybrid Work Environments Are Good for Business 
Companies need to stop debating the merits of hybrid work and realize this is the new way of working for many knowledge workers as we enter 2024. An ADP survey of 32,000 workers reports that 64% of workers would consider quitting if asked to return to the office full time. Recent research shows companies that allow choice and a remote first/hybrid work environment have revenue growth four times faster than their peers who are more stringent about office attendance. This research conducted by Boston Consulting Group and Scoop Technologies Inc. among 554 public companies employing 26.7 million people, found that “fully flexible” firms — which are either completely remote or allow employees to choose when they come to an office — increased sales 21% between 2020 and 2022, on an industry-adjusted basis. The better growth rates for more remote-friendly companies reflects their ability to hire faster and from a wider geographic area, along with higher rates of employee retention.
As hybrid work becomes the norm, leaders must have a plan to combat proximity bias, or the phenomenon of favoring in-person workers for career development, mentoring, and stretch assignments at the expense of those who work remotely. Hybrid work environments “work” when leaders ensure they are equitable for all and grant autonomy for individual leaders to determine when and where work happens, rather than follow a CEO mandate. Leaders must remember presence in the office does not equate to performance, so they need to shift from “managing by walking around,” to “managing by connecting across geographies.”
5. The Workforce Is a Blend of Full-time Employees, Part-Timers, Contingent Workers, and Digital Workers 
Remember when the blended workforce was simply a distinction between full-time workers and part-time workers. Today’s work now gets accomplished by a blend of full-time workers, part-timers, teams of contractors, contingent workers, and digital workers, the later designed to augment some tasks of human labor. In fact, Statista reports a growth in all sectors except full-time workers, with part-timers (growing from 20 million in 1990 to 26 million in 2022) and contingent workers forecast to be half of the US workforce by 2027.
This blended workforce is not a new concept; it’s been around for decades. What’s different now is that a greater percentage of key jobs are performed by contingent workers. Overall, we are starting to see upwards of 30% to 50% of a global organization’s total workforce composed of contingent workers. MIT Sloan Management Review  reported that the Novartis workforce includes 110,000 full time employees plus 50,000 contractors and temporary workers. Cisco has 83,000 full time employees and 50,000 plus contingent workers of various types. This new workforce ecosystem requires a new set of management practices, and leadership approaches, especially as 81% of companies in a recent HBR Analytical Services survey report that contingent workers are important to their organization, but only 38% say that their organization is effective at managing them.
Leaders will need to acknowledge they will have more types of contributors—human and digital, full time, part time and contingent—that must seamlessly work together. What is needed is a total workforce strategy where HR plays a central role in coordinating all the cross-functional disciplines that hire internal and external workers.
6. The Four Day Work Week is Desired by Both Front-line and Knowledge Workers 
Many of the assumptions we have about how we work, when we work, the needs of our workers, the demographics of the workforce, and where we work have been changed forever. One of the major changes, as we move into 2024, is our assumptions about a five-day work week. All workers, including both frontline and knowledge workers, want flexibility in when they work. Research conducted among 1,301 workers found 41% of both front-line workers and knowledge workers want flexibility in when they work, and 56% of front-line workers and 69% of knowledge workers want the ability to opt for a 4-day work week with no pay reduction.
As I wrote in my Forbes column, the UK four-day work week pilot was conducted among 61 companies and found 56% intend to continue trying the four-day week citing benefits of increased productivity and decreased employee attrition. These UK companies adopted the 80-100-100 model of flexible working: a drop in hours to 80% of their standard work week, while retaining 100% pay and 100% productivity.
Experiments on a shortened work week are also occurring in the US. For example, several Chick-Fil-A stores are allowing front-line workers the opportunity to work 13 hour shifts for three consecutive days with full pay. The results so far have been increased retention while maintaining customer service efficiencies.
However, it’s important to remember the three- or four-day work week is not a one size fits all solution. Companies should adopt a “test and learn approach,” focusing on the type and magnitude of changes required to allow for a shortened work week, the level of employee and manager training needed, and the type of well-being support required for new ways of working.
7. Cognitive Skills Will Increase in Importance as Generative AI Gains Traction 
The World Economic Forum estimates that 44% of a workers’ core skills are expected to change in the next five years. While there are endless lists of the most important skills for the future, World Economic Forum identifies five core skills that will increase in importance in the next five years. This are shown in Figure 1 as:Figure 1: Top Five Skills Gaining in Importance For Future of Work Jeanne Meister LLC
Cognitive skills are growing in importance, reflecting the increased demand for creative and analytical thinking in the age of AI. This combined with technological literacy, the third fastest growing skill along with the skills of resilience, flexibility, curiosity, and lifelong learning are evidence that leaders will continue to emphasize a culture of lifelong learning. As Generative AI gains traction, one skill I see that is foundational to all of them is the ability to be digitally curious, meaning seeking out and using new and emerging digital technologies to enhance one’s cognitive skills. I think about the past few years where some of the new technologies I have used include Mural, an online visual collaborative tool, StreamYard, a live streaming studio, and ChatGPT 4.0 and Pictory, to create a new video entitled, Flexible Work for All. This is the start of building my digital curiosity muscle, trying out these platforms and seeing what they might mean for enhancing my work.
8. Holistic Financial Well-being Is The Must Have Benefit for 2024
Financial well-being among workers is eroding. LendingClub reports 61% of American workers live paycheck to paycheck and lack a core set of financial literacy skills, and over half of workers earning $100,000 are living paycheck to paycheck. 
Unifi, a leader in aviation services with more than 23,000 employees, became aware of this two years ago and created a new offering for frontline workers to access their earned wages on-demand.  Since then, this has grown beyond early access to wages to a holistic financial well-being offering with almost 20% frontline workforce enrolled and taking advantage of free services including anonymous financial coaching and customizable saving plans. Dr. Archana Arcot, Chief People Officer at Unifi, believes that, “the major driver of this program is to relieve an employee’s financial stress and make financial wellness part of their everyday life.”
MetLife reports nearly half of workers surveyed cited financial concerns as the cause of poorer mental health. To address this, Unifi adopted a Goal Based Savings program which resulted in the company moving to the top 1% with a total amount saved of $10,000+ YTD, as reported by Payactiv. By offering holistic financial well-being programs, companies like Unifi can not only enhance their employee experience but build financial wellness into their employer value proposition and be better able to attract talent in a tight labor market.
9. The Sexy C-Suite Job For 2024 Is Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer 
While we have seen a myriad of new C-suite job roles in the past decade—from Chief Medical Officer to Chief Ethics Officer—the Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer is coming at a time when organizations are looking for guidance with how to create guidelines and policies for safe and ethical use of generative AI in the workplace. LinkedIn reports 44% globally and 57% in the U.S. say their organizations don’t have policy guidelines or training for how to use these new tools at work. 
Organizations are starting to appoint a new C-suite player to lead this effort. Research from Foundry, an IDG company, finds 11% of mid-size to large organizations already have an individual with the role of Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer and another 21% of organizations are actively seeking such a person for this role. This role is growing in importance as business leaders develop an AI strategy, create governance practices, and engage cross functional leaders in safe, ethical, and responsible use of generative AI.
A new Wavestone survey of Data and AI leaders found 61.7% report the responsibility for Generative AI is currently part of the Chief Data Officer (CDO) remit. But a growing number of organizations are creating a new role, the Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAIO) to oversee AI developments for their organization. “This will be very much a focus during 2024,” says Randy Bean, Innovation Fellow at Wavestone. 
10. An Organization’s Sustainability Record Will Attract and Retain Talent 
As the talent marketplace continues to be competitive, climate change and sustainability has become one of the defining challenges for current and future generations. A growing number of publicly traded companies, such as Alphabet, Apple, Cisco, and PayPal, have created sustainability annual reports with Alphabet committing its entire $5.57B Sustainability Bond to support environmentally and socially responsible projects such as clean energy, clean transportation, and circular economy design.
A company’s sustainability record is proving to make a difference in talent acquisition and retention. Research by IBM Institute for Business Value, found 70% of workers and those in the job market, are drawn to environmentally sustainable employers. And almost half of these workers said they would take a lower salary to work for environmentally and socially responsible organizations. Gartner predicts employers will respond by promoting climate change protections, such as offering employees shelter during natural disasters, as part of employee benefit offerings.
In addition, a growing number of universities are building ambitious goals to integrate sustainability into their curriculum, campus operations, and endowment. The University of Toronto, placing first out of 1,400 universities in environmental and social impact, is making headway to de-carbonize its campus by 2050, developing new energy efficient student centers, and committing to climate responsible construction.
The Global Business School Network, a network of 150 global business schools in 50 countries, has several new initiatives for universities to share sustainability “next practices.” While companies and universities are each addressing sustainability, I see the need for greater collaboration among them, as both employees and students weigh the environmental impact of their employer and university. Sustainability is both a business and educational issue requiring joint corporate and university solutions.

That's what Matthew Candy, IBM's global managing partner for generative AI, told Fortune in a recent interview. Candy said that AI would make it possible for anyone with an idea to create products without having to code. ""The speed at which people will be able to come up with an idea, to test the idea, to make something, it's going to be so accelerated,"" Candy said in the story. ""You don't need to have a degree in computer science to do that,"" he added. Instead of technical skills, Candy said that soft skills like creativity and innovation would be more valuable in the age of AI. ""Questioning, creativity skills, and innovation are going to be hugely important because I think AI's going to free up more capacity for creative thought processes,"" he told the publication earlier. But it's not just the tech industry that will be affected by AI. Candy said that AI image-generation technology could also transform the arts. ""You're going to be able to take on the role of a designer. You don't need to be a graphic designer and have an art degree to do these things,"" he said. Even as tech executives are welcoming the AI wave, the outlook of other working professionals is not as positive. A recent report by edtech startup Hero Vired revealed that 82% of professionals fear job redundancy amid AI advancement. In fact, back in May of last year, IBM itself said they were considering a freeze on hiring people for jobs that AI could potentially do instead. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in a Bloomberg interview that he sees 30% of the company’s back-office roles getting replaced by AI over a five-year period, which roughly amounted to over 7,800 positions. &nbsp;",,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'IE Premium', 'productID': 'indianexpress.com:showcase'}",,,,The Indian Express,,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Express Building, B-1/B, Sector-10', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}",,,,https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-23,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",1932,JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,"{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/01/matthew-candy-ibm-featured.jpg', 'caption': 'Creativity and innovation are the new skills for the AI era, says IBM&#039;s generative AI boss.

More than a third of state agencies are using AI. Texas is beginning to examine its potential impact.



Amid fears that AI could heighten bias or affect privacy, the state is forming an advisory committee to recommend how the technology is deployed. “We’re gonna have to set up some rules,” the committee’s founder says.

When the Texas Workforce Commission became inundated with jobless claims in March 2020, it turned to artificial intelligence.
Affectionately named for the agency’s former head Larry Temple, who had died a year earlier, “Larry” the chatbot was designed to help Texans sign up for unemployment benefits.
Like a next generation FAQ page, Larry would field user-generated questions about unemployment cases. Using AI language processing, the bot would determine which answer prewritten by human staff would best fit the user’s unique phrasing of the question. The chatbot answered more than 21 million questions before being replaced by Larry 2.0 last March.
Larry is one example of the ways artificial intelligence has been used by state agencies. Adaptation of the technology in state government has grown in recent years. But that acceleration has also sparked fears of unintended consequences like bias, loss of privacy or losing control of the technology. This year, the Legislature committed to taking a more active role in monitoring how the state is using AI.

“This is going to totally revolutionize the way we do government,” said state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, who wrote a bill aimed at helping the state make better use of AI technology.
In June, Gov. Greg Abbott signed that bill, House Bill 2060, into law, creating an AI advisory council to study and take inventory of the ways state agencies currently utilize AI and assess whether the state needs a code of ethics for AI. The council’s role in monitoring what the state is doing with AI does not involve writing final policy.
Artificial intelligence describes a class of technology that emulates and builds upon human reasoning through computer systems. The chatbot uses language processing to understand users' questions and match it to predetermined answers. New tools such as ChatGPT are categorized as generative AI because the technology generates a unique answer based on a user prompt. AI is also capable of analyzing large data sets and using that information to automate tasks previously performed by humans. Automated decision making is at the center of HB 2060.
More than one third of Texas state agencies are already utilizing some form of artificial intelligence, according to a 2022 report from the Texas Department of Information Resources. The workforce commission also has an AI tool for job seekers that provides customized recommendations of job openings. Various agencies are using AI for translating languages into English and call center tools such as speech-to-text. AI is also used to enhance cybersecurity and fraud detection.





Automation is also used for time-consuming work in order to “increase work output and efficiency,” according to a statement from the Department of Information Resources. One example of this could be tracking budget expenses and invoices. In 2020, DIR launched an AI Center for Excellence aimed at helping state agencies implement more AI technology. Participation in DIR’s center is voluntary, and each agency typically has its own technology team, so the extent of automation and AI deployment at state agencies is not closely tracked.
Right now, Texas state agencies have to verify that the technology they use meets safety requirements set by state law, but there are no specific disclosure requirements on the types of technology or how they are used. HB 2060 will require each agency to provide that information to the AI advisory council by July 2024.
“We want agencies to be creative,” Capriglione said. He favors finding more use cases for AI that go well beyond chat bots, but recognizes there are concerns around poor data quality stopping the system from working as intended: “We’re gonna have to set some rules.”
As adoption of AI has grown, so have worries around the ethics and functionality of the technology. The AI advisory council is the first step toward oversight of how the technology is being deployed. The seven-member council will include a member of the state House and the Senate, an executive director and four individuals appointed by the governor with expertise in AI, ethics, law enforcement and constitutional law.

Samantha Shorey is an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has studied the social implications of artificial intelligence, particularly the kind designed for increased automation. She is concerned that if technology is empowered to make more decisions, it will replicate and exacerbate social inequality: “It might move us towards the end goal more quickly. But is it moving us towards an end goal that we want?”
Proponents of using more AI view automation as a way to make government work more efficiently. Harnessing the latest technology could help speed up case management for social services, provide immediate summaries of lengthy policy analysis or streamline the hiring and training process for new government employees.
However, Shorey is cautious about the possibility of artificial intelligence being brought into decision-making processes such as determining who qualifies for social service benefits, or how long someone should be on parole. Earlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department began investigating allegations that a Pennsylvania county’s AI model intended to help improve child welfare was discriminating against parents with disabilities and resulting in their children being taken away.
AI systems “tend to absorb whatever biases there are in the past data,” said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, director of the Center for Technology Responsibility at Brown University. Artificial intelligence that is trained on data that includes any kind of gender, religious, race or other bias is at risk of learning to discriminate.

In addition to the problem of flawed data reproducing social inequality, there are also privacy concerns around the technology’s dependence on collecting large amounts of data. What the AI could be doing with that data over time is also driving fears that humans will lose some control over the technology.
“As AI gets more and more complicated, it's very hard to understand how these systems are working, and why they're making decisions the way they do,” Venkatasubramanian said.
That fear is shared by Jason Green-Lowe, executive director at the Center for AI Policy, a group that has lobbied for stricter AI safety in Washington DC. With the accelerating pace of technology and a lack of regulatory oversight, Green-Lowe said, “soon we might find ourselves in a world where AI is mostly steering. … And the world starts to reorient itself to serve the AI's interests rather than human interest.”
Some technical experts, however, are more confident that humans will remain in the driver’s seat of increasing AI deployment. Alex Dimakis, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, worked on the artificial intelligence commission for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

In Dimakis’ view, AI systems should be transparent and subject to independent evaluation known as red teaming, a process in which the underlying data and decision-making process of the technology are scrutinized by multiple experts to determine if more robust safety measures are necessary.
“You cannot hide behind AI,” Dimakis said. Beyond transparency and evaluation, Dimakis said the state should enforce existing laws against whoever created the AI in any case where the technology produces an outcome that violates the law: “apply the existing laws without being confused that an AI system is in the middle.”
The AI advisory council will submit its findings and recommendations to the Legislature by December 2024. In the meantime, interest is growing in deploying AI at all levels of government. DIR operates an artificial intelligence user group made up of representatives from state agencies, higher education and local government interested in implementing AI.
Interest in the user group is growing by the day, according to a DIR spokesperson. The group has more than 300 members representing more than 85 different entities.

Well, recent cases have shown us that AI is more cost-effective and way more efficient than human employees, according to some companies that have chosen AI over human resources.A business startup called Dukan replaced ninety per cent of its employees with chatbots in 2022. Paytm, a payment aggregator, also laid off 1000 workers at the close of the previous year. The business claims that the results of AI have exceeded their expectations. Paytm claims that it can cut personnel costs by 10% to 15% with the use of AI. According to some unconfirmed reports.

Truth be told, human resources are still needed. For instance, it is a known truth that many people lost their employment when industrial organisations began to use automation. It’s also true, though, that humans were required to run those automated devices. The difference is that the task that was previously completed by five persons is now being completed by one person.Top Videos View AllSwipe Left For Next VideoPiyush Raj Akhouri, managing partner of BridgeNTech and Hire++ Technology, which uses AI for hiring and staffing, says that AI will lead to job loss but at the same time, it will create new job opportunities. According to Akhouri, people will have to skill themselves for AI and those who can do so will find themselves in a better position than before.Piyush says that AI will mainly eliminate human intervention in tasks that are very repetitive, for example, security checking or similar designing. He says that the people who are less promising in their work but have strengthened their hold on AI will be more benefited from it.About the AuthorBusiness DeskA team of writers and reporters decodes vast terms of personal finance and making money matters simpler for you.
