The research, by the cross-party Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank, found that even relatively modest gains from using robots and AI had the potential to give British workers Scandinavian levels of leisure time.The conclusions of the study will come as a boost to John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who wants to look at reducing hours in the working week. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady used her speech to the organisation’s annual gathering last month to call for a four-day working week, saying that it should be achievable by the end of the century. She also attacked the likes of Amazon chief Jeff Bezos for overseeing a trillion-dollar company while “his workers are collapsing on the job exhausted”.View image in fullscreenShadow chancellor John McDonnell wants to look at reducing hours in the working week. Photograph: Kirsty O'Connor/PAWhile Labour is prioritising policies to deal with the insecurities of the gig economy in its next manifesto, McDonnell told the Observer: “We are interested in the TUC’s proposals in how the benefits of automation, robotics and AI of the fourth industrial revolution are shared with the workers, both in rewards and potentially a shorter working week. Work-life balance is increasingly coming on to society’s agenda.”British employees currently work longer hours on average than most of their European counterparts, while at the same time the UK has seen a slump in productivity. The typical British worker spends 42 hours a week at work but produces 16% less on average than counterparts in other leading economies, according to the Office for National Statistics.The SMF analysis suggests that a 10% gain in workforce productivity could allow employers to produce the same output with a 38-hour week, assuming pay and employer profits remained the same. It would give British employees the same working week that Norwegians and Danes currently enjoy. A 30% productivity gain could allow the working week to fall to just 32 hours, or a standard four-day working week.While new technologies could bring economic rewards for employers, the SMF also warned that without the right government policies the workforce may not see any benefits.It called for big companies to be required to report their average profit per employee and to show how this is changing relative to wages. It also called on chancellor Philip Hammond to use his budget at the end of this month to give tax breaks to workers trying to improve their skills.Scott Corfe, the SMF’s chief economist who authored the report, said: “Robots, AI and big data could dramatically change society for the better, addressing the UK’s productivity crisis and creating more enjoyable work as mundane tasks are automated. If we manage this revolution properly, workers will get new choices, including whether to reduce their working week and having more leisure time.“However, it also brings challenges. Some firms are using new technologies to micromanage and monitor every movement of staff – including how long they spend in the toilet. We need to ensure that technology is rolled out in an ethical way that maintains the dignity of work, and that workers are properly consulted.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersThe ObserverRobotsWork-life balanceArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this contentMost viewedUnderground cave found on moon could be ideal base for explorersFormer classmate describes Trump rally gunman as ‘definitely conservative’LiveTrump picks Ohio senator JD Vance as his vice-presidential pick for the 2024 US elections – liveBlue Maga: we need to talk about the cult-like turn of the Democratic partyMehdi HasanAOC to anonymous Democrat who said party resigned to Trump win: ‘Retire’",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How Artificial Intelligence Will Impact Human Well-being
By Brent Orrell
RealClearMarkets
October 12, 2018



FacebookTwitterLinkedIn The question of how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact human well-being is something of a Rorschach test. It depends on whom you ask. For some, the advent of “smart” everything portends a future of rising living standards and unimagined opportunities for human flourishing. Others help us see the dark side. Without going “full Terminator,” some of the best informed people in the AI field see an economic transformation that threatens social cohesion as human labor — mental and physical — becomes slow, antiquated and artisanal and is ultimately consolidated and replaced by the unlimited energy, dynamism, and rocketing productivity of an algorithm-driven world.
Sophia, a robot integrating the latest technologies and artificial intelligence developed by Hanson Robotics is pictured during a presentation at the “AI for Good” Global Summit at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Geneva, Switzerland June 7, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse.
Two recent books, Work in the Age of Robots (Encounter Books, 2018) by the Manhattan Institute’s Mark Mills, and AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018) by Kai-Fu Lee, former head of Google China, embody the polarities of this debate. For Mills, the supposed threat of AI to human work is same macro-economic mistake we’ve been re-living since the Kennedy Administration: we see automation destroying jobs but can’t yet envision the economic demand and jobs automation will create. For Lee, this chapter of innovation is truly different. AI is like the introduction of electricity, a “breakthrough technology that once harnessed can be applied to revolutionizing dozens of different industries” so fast and so disruptively that it will result in massive economic dislocations, and overwhelm the ability of individuals and societies to adapt. Mills is sanguine; Lee sanguinary.
Lee’s argument is rooted in his career as an architect and builder of the modern Chinese economy, his stewardship of Google’s failed entrance into the Chinese market, and — surprisingly — his battle with lymphoma. He describes the Chinese economy as being built on what he euphemistically calls “imitation” — known as “theft” in the West — of technology chiefly from North American innovators. This technology has been assimilated and is morphing under the pressure of a gladiator entrepreneurial culture of rapid-cycle competition and development. China has taken what it needs from the West and is now leaping ahead by applying that technology to products like WeChat, a “Swiss army knife” app that combines social networking with everything from grocery shopping to booking doctor appointments and airplane tickets. Backed by oceans of data (Lee calls China the Saudi Arabia of consumer information) Lee predicts Chinese firms will garner more than half the projected $15 trillion increase in global GDP that AI will generate.
In the world Lee envisions, the money gleaned from AI innovations leads not to rising living standards but to economic and employment dystopia. Vast wealth accumulates to a small number of early AI investors and developers while the rest of humanity scrapes together a bare subsistence performing tasks requiring too much manual dexterity for robots. In Lee’s view, AI is a general purpose technology, like steam engines, that reshapes all production. Unlike the Industrial Revolution, where the introduction of industrial-scale mills provided employment to millions while wiping out the jobs of a comparative handful of small artisan weavers, AI will do the opposite. Rather than breaking work down into assembly-line processes that require more workers, AI eliminates jobs by concentrating work in the hands of a few highly skilled technology workers managing algorithm-driven systems. Eliminate hundreds of thousands of skilled tax preparers and replace them with the effectively unlimited capacity of web-based Turbo Tax. In other words, AI takes aim at the cognitive workers who do lots of repetitive “assembly-line” information tasks of the types that provide a lot of middle-skill, well-paid work. The robots are coming for the factory workers, and for the information economy professionals.
To Mills, the Lee scenario is amped up Luddism. Every human being, he says, is allotted about one million hours in a normal life-span. The story of human advancement has been one of figuring out how to substitute machine for human labor thereby reducing the number of hours devoted to backbreaking drudgery. AI is merely the next step in that journey of reducing labor inputs and increasing productivity, wealth, and well-being. In this view, economic growth is centered in manufacturing but surrounded, as it has been since the dawn of the modern era, by a much larger service economy. Demand for new and existing products is nowhere near its limit. In the developed world, there are 700 cars for every 1,000 people; in the developing world there are several hundred people for every car. If AI boosts productivity and reduces the price of finished products, demand will rise and with it the total employment required to supply materials, fabricate products, and distribute, sell, and service the gadgets.
And here’s where the Lee and Mills perspectives partially converge. Whatever else AI is, it cannot replace the human beings at the center of economic life. Lee learned this during his bout with cancer. Machines diagnosed his illness and he benefited from the best drugs and medical protocols. But it was his family, whom he says he neglected during his career, who really got him through treatment. They paid exquisitely focused attention to his needs — down to observing his reactions to the food they prepared and adjusting the spices to reduce nausea — something a machine could never do. Lee’s conclusion is that we can employ those who might have worked in factories and offices in jobs that provide education and care. State subsidies, paid for by taxes on the tidal wave of AI generated wealth, would raise compensation for those jobs to a respectable level. Similarly, Mills notes that it is absurd to assume that machines, however sophisticated, could ever replace people. An internal Google study listed eight hiring qualifications required by managers. At the top were communication, cooperation, and critical thinking — distinctively human characteristics. At the bottom were degrees in hard sciences.
The human element both Lee and Mills emphasize is the bedrock on which the economic future is built, regardless of which perspective ultimately turns out to be more accurate. The sci-fi nightmare of a general artificial intelligence capable of replicating or imitating human behavior is a mirage. Algorithms operate in narrow, well-defined tasks. The human mind is like an infinite number of highly complex and perfectly synchronized and integrated algorithms that are built, first and foremost, to respond to other human minds. This inherent human sociability, which Adam Smith identified as the source and purpose of economic life, is what will shape our future not the silica pathways of our magnificent computing machines.

April 13, 2021October 16, 2018 by David Nikel

Some of Norway's biggest companies and research institutes are getting together to build competence in artificial intelligence.
Big names in Norwegian business like Telenor, DNB and Kongsberg are joining forces with Trondheim-based research powerhouses NTNU and SINTEF to seek out opportunities in AI and reduce the reliance on oil revenues.
The group of investors also includes energy giant Equinor (formerly Statoil) and the global classification agency DNV GL.
The first step in a collaborative approach was to establish the joint venture enterprise Norwegian Open AI Lab (NOAIL), which will develop expertise and technologies for use in Norway and for export potential.







Making a global impact
That latter point is crucial, as Norway wants to develop and deliver AI solutions that have big potential for global sales. The country has long been criticised by some for its inward focus when it comes to innovation and entrepreneurship, outside of oil and gas and the shipping industry, that is.
It's part of the reason the country has always played catch-up in the world of innovation. Norway's Nordic neighbours Sweden, Denmark and Finland are all better established in the world of technology entrepreneurship.
SINTEF CEO Alexandra Bech Gjørv told Computer Weekly that the background for the collaboration is that we are living in a highly competitive world that is fast-moving and increasingly challenging.
“It’s critical that we start to build Norway's competence within the AI domain now. Industry in Norway faces challenges and requirements that can't be solved by using off-the-shelf solutions. We must work to develop technology that can strengthen Norwegian industry’s competitive advantage.”






One of the reasons NTNU and SINTEF are so involved is that NOAIL aims to build a bridge between industry and academia. NOAIL will serve as a centre of excellence to strengthen the quality and capacity for research, education and innovation in the AI-domain.
The basis for this cooperation is the shared understanding that industry and academia will need to form a deeper bond in the AI-area for Norway to gain its much sought-after strong and sustainable international position in the global marketplace.
Where are we with AI?
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have moved from the realm of sci-fi novels into realism. But how far down the road are we? Possibly farther than you think…
IBM interviewed 30 AI experts to uncover the key elements to sparking the next AI innovation wave. All agreed that the technology has entered a period of rapid R&D.
“Faced with a constant onslaught of data, we needed a new type of system that learns and adapts, and we now have that with AI,” says Arvind Krishna, Senior Vice President of Hybrid Cloud and Director of IBM Research.






“What was deemed impossible a few years ago is not only becoming possible, it’s very quickly becoming necessary and expected.”
Experts express little doubt that deep learning will serve as a vital variable in the new AI growth equation, much as it did in the current one. However, deep learning has yet to demonstrate a strong ability to help machines with reasoning, a skill they must master to enhance many AI applications.
“The next big opportunity is to do for reasoning what deep learning did for perception and classification. Reasoning is required for a range of cognitive tasks including using basic common sense, dealing with changing situations, simple planning and making complex decisions in a profession”, states the report.
“Real machine learning is changing the world”
The South China Morning Post reported from this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that much of what was promoted as AI was actually natural language processing rather than machine learning, but the stories were there.
“Despite not being obvious at the CES, machine learning is having a lot of success in the background”, said the report.






“Google’s latest AI tool, called DeepVariant, was recently used to sequence human genomes in significantly more detail than humans could manage by presenting the data as an image. It initiated discoveries of mutations that would otherwise have remained hidden.”
“Similarly at the University of Texas, researchers worked with Google’s AI tools to trawl through data from the Kepler Space Telescope after astronomers had found all they could using their existing methods. They found “extra” planets around distant solar systems that would have otherwise remained undiscovered.”
Presumably it's these type of breakthroughs that NOAIL will be aiming to make within its new lab.
Building on existing competence
Hopes are high that the new Norway lab will make get off to a flyer because the team is not actually starting from scratch.
NOAIL is an expansion of the existing Telenor-NTNU AI-Lab located in Trondheim. It builds further on the work already carried out there in the areas of innovation within artificial intelligence/machine learning and big data.






“NTNU is proud to host the Norwegian Open AI Lab. With this powerhouse, we ensure the recruitment of talented professionals and students to the field. This lab will develop tomorrow's technology and methods as well as help solve today's challenges across fields and usage areas,” says the Rector of NTNU, Gunnar Bovim.

Although schools across the country are adding classes, increasing enrollment and developing new programs to accommodate student demand, there are too few potential employees with training or experience in AI. That has big consequences. Too few AI-trained job-seekers has slowed hiring and impeded growth at some companies, recruiters and would-be employers told Reuters. It may also be delaying broader adoption of a technology that some economists say could spur U.S. economic growth by boosting productivity, currently growing at only about half its pre-crisis pace. Andrew Shinn, a chip design manager at Marvell Technology Group who was recruiting interns and new grads at UC Berkeley's career fair, said his company has had trouble hiring for AI jobs. ""We have had difficulty filling jobs for a number of years,"" he said. ""It does slow things down."" ""COMING OF AGE""Many economists believe AI has the potential to change the economy's basic trajectory in the same way that, say, electricity or the steam engine did. ""I do think artificial intelligence is ... coming of age,"" said St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard in an interview. ""This will diffuse through the whole economy and will change all of our lives."" But the speed of the transformation will depend in part on the availability of technical talent. A shortage of trained workers ""will definitely slow the rate of diffusion of the new technology and any productivity gains that accompany it,"" said Chad Syverson, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. U.S. government data does not track job openings or hires in artificial intelligence specifically, but online job postings tracked by jobsites including Indeed, Ziprecruiter and Glassdoor show job openings for AI-related positions are surging. AI job postings as a percentage of overall job postings at Indeed nearly doubled in the past two years, according to data provided by the company. Searches on Indeed for AI jobs, meanwhile increased just 15 percent. (For a graphic, please see https://tmsnrt.rs/2CEi4eG Universities are trying to keep up. Applicants to UC Berkeley's doctoral program in electrical engineering and computer science numbered 300 a decade ago, but by last year had surged to 2,700, with more than half of applicants interested in AI, according to professor Pieter Abbeel. In response, the school tripled its entering class to 30 in the fall of 2017. At the University of Illinois, professor Mark Hasegawa-Johnson last year tripled the enrollment cap on the school's intro AI course to 300. The extra 200 seats were filled in 24 hours, he said. Carnegie Mellon University this fall began offering the nation's first undergraduate degree in artificial intelligence. ""We feel strongly that the demand is there,"" said Reid Simmons, who directs CMU's new program. ""And we are trying to supply the students to fill that demand."" Still, a fix for the supply-demand mismatch is probably five years out, says Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. The company has algorithms that trawl job postings on company websites, and their data show AI-related job postings having doubled in the last 11 months. ""The supply of people moving into this field is way below demand,"" he said. A JOB-SEEKER'S MARKETThe demand has driven up wages. Glassdoor estimates that average salaries for AI-related jobs advertised on company career sites rose 11 percent between October 2017 and September 2018 to $123,069 annually. Michael Solomon, whose New York-based 10X Management rents out technologists to companies for specific projects, says his top AI engineers now command as much as $1000 an hour, more than triple the pay just five years ago, making them one of the company's two highest paid categories, along with blockchain experts. Liz Holm, a materials science and engineering professor at Carnegie Melon, saw the increased demand first-hand in May, when one of her graduating PhD students, who used machine learning methods for her research, was overwhelmed with job offers, none of which were in materials science and all of them AI-related. Eventually the student took a job with Proctor & Gamble, where she uses AI to figure out where to put items on store shelves around the globe. ""Companies are really hungry for these folks right now,"" Holm said. Mark Maybury, an artificial intelligence expert who was hired last year as Stanley Black and Decker's first chief technology officer, agreed. The firm is embedding AI into the design and production of tools, he said, though he said details are not yet public. ""Have we been able to find the talent we need? Yes,"" he said. ""Is it expensive? Yes."" The crunch is great news for job-seeking students with AI skills. In addition to bumping their pay and giving them more choice, they often get job offers well before they graduate. Derek Brown, who studied artificial intelligence and cognitive science as an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon, got a full-time post-graduation job offer from Salesforce at the start of his senior year last fall. He turned it down in favor of Facebook, where he started this past July.    by Taboolaby TaboolaSponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksYou May LikeHorror Stories Of Entitled PeopleA family of 5 gets on my flight.

IBM’s Watson supercomputer has beat Jeopardy champions, reconstituted recipes, and even helped create highlight reels for the World Cup. Now it’s taking on a new tech challenge; changing how the construction industry operates. 
A new partnership between IBM and Fluor, a global engineering and construction company, will put the supercomputer’s computational skills to work on making building more efficient. 
The new Watson-based system, in development since 2015 and now in use on select projects, will be able to analyze a job site “like a doctor diagnoses a patient,” according to Leslie Lindgren, Fluor’s vice president of Information Management. That degree of risk analysis, predictive logistics, and comprehension is no small challenge given the complexity of today’s construction megaprojects. 
“These are multibillion dollar project sites, that are like walking into a city,” says Lindgren. “The sheer volume of data is tremendous.” 
On especially complicated projects, Fluor will begin using two new tools, the EPC Project Health Diagnostics and the Market Dynamics/Spend Analytics, to make sense of the thousands of data points found on a crowded construction site. Constant analysis will help forecast issues before they show up, and automate how materials and workers are distributed. Eventually, the system will develop natural language functionality.
“Think of it as a living and breathing system,” says Sai Yadati, a partner for IBM Global Business Services. “This is truly one-of-a-kind for the marketplace.”  
It’s a bold bet that reflects the ways in which the $10 trillion global construction industry continues to play catch-up with technology. That gap has created an opportunity for startups and technology firms to make a huge difference in an industry beset by increasing costs and labor shortages. 
Applying artificial intelligence to the field won’t bring robots in hard hats, at least not anytime soon. But it can help with cost, scheduling, and quality for an industry in need of cost cutting. According to a McKinsey & Co. analysis, construction projects routinely lose up to a third of their value to waste. 
“Construction is one of the least digitized industries, so many startups are seizing the opportunity to build technology that would increase efficiency within this market,” Michael Wholey, an intelligence analyst for CB Insights, told Curbed.
Startups sees opportunity in construction  
The sharp rise in startup funding in the AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) space makes it an ideal time to sell the promise of AI for the building trades. According to data from CB Insights, the industry saw $882.3 million in venture capital investment last year across 103 deals, and has already bested that in 2018, racking up $1.38 billion across 61 deals. KcKinsey found the construction tech industry has benefited from $18 billion in investment since 2013.
While AI’s more fervent converts predict massive leaps forward with adoption of the evolving technology, analysts predict construction will see more moderate gains. 
Turns out the technology gap can’t be leapfrogged immediately; that same McKinsey analysis found that while AI could offer extensive benefits, “few E&C firms or owners currently have the capabilities—including the personnel, processes, and tools—to implement them.”

The report goes on to say that construction, in the short-term, will benefit from second-order improvements, especially as other industries in the supply chain continue to adapt the technology. Construction AI investment will still lag for the foreseeable future. Of the 12 industries McKinsey analyzed, 10 will increase AI spending at a faster pace than construction. 
Carlos Serra, a managing director at JLL, a global real estate management firm, believes the impact of AI is, at best, five to 10 years off, due to the industry’s lack of standardization. JLL has made extensive bets in property technology, and recently built a new proprietary project management system that can work with AI applications. But he feels the fragmented nature of the industry makes it unlikely a technology will be introduced that works for everyone involved, from architects and owners to labor. 
“We get compared to the auto industry, and people ask why we can’t be standardized like them, but it’s really not comparable,” Serra says. “For that to be fair, you’d have to have an individual design for each and every car. For us to get there, we’d need to make architecture redundant.” 
Serra says that JLL is even using a basic AI system for a project in Los Angeles (he can’t name the client due to confidentiality issues). A system of small robots at the job site check and crosscheck real-word construction with a digital model of the project. While the technology can be helpful, it also added millions to the project, a premium Serra says won’t work for most job sites. 
Betting on a more automated future
But that doesn’t mean there won’t be substantial investment. Fortune found many tech firms investing billions in construction tech firms, including Oracle, which purchased Aconex for $1.2 billion in February, and Trimble, which bought Viewpoint for $1.2 billion in April. 
In addition, other ACE firms are creating their own systems. AECOM, the LA-based multinational engineering firm, introduced Capture, a new web and mobile platform that continuously analyzes construction sites and can build an accurate 3D model at any point in a project’s lifecycle. 
Startup indus.ai, a construction intelligence-as-a-service solution which uses neural nets, computer vision, and analysis of millions of construction site photos to train AI to identify problems on existing job sites, just raised $3.7 million in seed funding. 
With such a relatively small technology spend by the industry—McKinsey found engineering and construction only invested 1 percent overall into technology, significantly smaller than other industries—the opportunity for new technologies to change construction sites is vast.

Artificial intelligence research has a lot to learn from nature. My work links biology with computation every day, but recently the rest of the world was reminded of the connection: The 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to Frances Arnold together with George Smith and Gregory Winter for developing major breakthroughs that are collectively called “directed evolution.” One of its uses is to improve protein functions, making them better catalysts in biofuel production. Another use is entirely outside chemistry – outside even the traditional life sciences.
That might sound surprising, but many research findings have very broad implications. It’s part of why just about every scientist wonders and hopes not only that maybe they would be selected for a Nobel Prize, but, far more likely, that the winner might be someone they know or have worked with. In the collaborative academic world, this isn’t terribly uncommon: In 2002, I was studying under a scholar who had studied under one of the three co-winners of that year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. This year, it happened again – one of the winners has written a couple of papers with a scholar I have collaborated with.
Beyond satisfying my own vanity, the award reminds me how useful biological concepts are for engineering problems. The best-known example is probably the invention of Velcro hook-and-loop fasteners, inspired by burrs that stuck to a man’s pants while he was walking outdoors. In the Nobel laureates’ work, the natural principle at work is evolution – which is also the approach I use to develop artificial intelligence. My research is based on the idea that evolution led to general intelligence in biological life forms, so that same process could also be used to develop computerized intelligent systems. 
When designing AI systems that control virtual cars, for example, you might want safer cars that know how to avoid a wide range of obstacles – other cars, trees, cyclists and guardrails. My approach would be to evaluate the safety performance of several AI systems. The ones that drive most safely are allowed to reproduce – by being copied into a new generation. 
Yet just as nature does not make identical copies of parents, genetic algorithms in computational evolution let mutations and recombinations create variations in the offspring. Selecting and reproducing the safest drivers in each new generation finds and propagates mutations that improve performance. Over many generations, AI systems get better through the same method nature improves upon itself – and the same way the Nobel laureates made better proteins.
In the effort to understand human intelligence, many researchers are working to reverse-engineer the brain, figuring out how it works at all levels. Complex gene networks control the neurons that form the layers of the neocortex that are sitting on top of a highway of connections. These interconnections support communications between the different cortical regions that make up most of our cognitive functions. All of this is integrated into the phenomenon of consciousness.

Deep learning and neural networks are computer-based approaches that attempt to recreate how the brain works – but even they can only achieve the equivalent activity of a clump of brain cells smaller than a sugar cube. There remains an enormous amount to learn about the brain – and that’s before trying to write the intensely complicated software that can emulate all those biological interactions.
Capitalizing on evolution can make systems that seem lifelike and are inherently as open-ended and innovative as natural evolution is. It is also the key methodology used in genetic algorithms and genetic programming. The Nobel Prize committee’s recognition highlights a technology that has evolution at its core. That indirectly justifies my own research approach and the idea that evolution in action is a critical research topic with vast potential.

The robots are taking over, and some of the tech billionaires who drove their rise are stepping up to give big to programs focused on artificial intelligence.Since 2015, nine wealthy donors have given a total of about $583.5 million to nonprofit institutions that are developing new artificial-intelligence tools and studying the effects of A.I. on human life, according to a Chronicle tally of publicly announced gifts.Of those nine, five are technology moguls. Among them is the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who died Monday. He gave $125 million in February to his Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a Seattle nonprofit he launched in 2013. His last gift during his lifetime went to a new research program that is studying ways to instill common sense in artificial-intelligence programs to improve problem-solving without human input.

The robots are taking over, and some of the tech billionaires who drove their rise are stepping up to give big to programs focused on artificial intelligence. Since 2015, nine wealthy donors have given a total of about $583.5 million to nonprofit institutions that are developing new artificial-intelligence tools and studying the effects of A.I. on human life, according to a Chronicle tally of publicly announced gifts. Of those nine, five are technology moguls. Among them is the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who died Monday. He gave $125 million in February to his Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a Seattle nonprofit he launched in 2013. His last gift during his lifetime went to a new research program that is studying ways to instill common sense in artificial-intelligence programs to improve problem-solving without human input. Allen’s institute operates several programs that center on creating new A.I. systems and tools, and his gift reflects the majority of those donating large sums to A.I.: philanthropists who want to back the creation of new ways of applying artificial intelligence by supporting new research, academic courses, and professorships. Allen was joined in that effort by others, including Dwight Diercks, an executive at Nvidia, a tech company specializing in A.I. and supercomputing, who gave the Milwaukee School of Engineering $34 million last year for a center for courses on A.I., robotics, and related technologies; and Austin McChord, a cybersecurity entrepreneur who dedicated $20 million of a $50 million donation he gave to his alma mater, Rochester Institute of Technology, to hire more A.I. and cybersecurity faculty.

 Growing Unease But there is another group of rich donors who are using their big gifts to address and explore ethical and other implications of artificial intelligence on our lives. Of the nine philanthropists in the Chronicle’s tally, four directed millions to these concerns in the past 20 months, suggesting a growing unease among even masters-of-the-universe types about the potential down sides of artificial intelligence. Top among this crowd is LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who gave $10 million last year to jump-start the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, a collaboration between MIT Media Lab and Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. The fund is working on developing artificial intelligence that puts ethics first and will serve the public good. Hoffman also recently gave nearly $2.5 million to the University of Toronto to create a professorship to study how future artificial intelligence will affect people’s lives. Elon Musk, who co-founded PayPal and Tesla Motors, gave $10 million in 2015 to the Future of Life Institute, a research organization that studies the risks from advanced technologies and seeks to harness them in ways that will help people flourish rather than self-destruct. Multimillion-dollar gifts exploring the implications of A.I. are starting to come at a more rapid pace. On Monday the New York financier Stephen Schwarzman gave $350 million to MIT for a new College of Computing, which will focus on developing new breakthroughs and the ethical application of artificial intelligence. Late last month, he gave $5 million to Harvard Business School to develop case studies and other programs to analyze how A.I. is affecting different industries, individual companies, and financial markets.

 The significance of increasing concerns about A.I. is not lost on the companies that have spawned the rise of technology in our everyday lives. Microsoft, which Allen and Bill Gates co-founded, announced late last month a $40 million grant for the third phase of its A.I. for Good program. The grant will go to A.I. for Humanitarian Action, a five-year program aimed at using artificial intelligence to address global problems like disaster response and the refugee crisis.

What from skeptics to conclusions in the direction of “Well, you all, panic!” Is reinterpreted.Here, a differentiated statement is instrumentalized to consolidate one’s own reasoning. It would be just as tricky to claim that the present state of artificial intelligence is a useful indicator for the next 10, 20 or 100 years. What is actually said?

Almost two-thirds of the school's student population are considered to be among the most disadvantaged 25 per cent of learners in the country, according to the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority.""There are some select schools across the state that have been tinkering with these things for a few years, but it's only in the last two years that it's cheap enough and accessible enough that we can be working with this type of equipment,"" Mr McPherson said.""You have to be able to allow for the cost of the robot, and a bit extra for breakages."" Charlotte Hazeldine and her friends, Makayla Stork and Georgie Milburn, have been working on putting together a robot they call 'Fred'.(ABC Central Victoria: Mark Kearney)Open-source solutionThe school has recently used a Victorian Government grant to purchase several do-it-yourself robotics kits, made entirely from components that can be bought on the open market — not from a robot manufacturer.Step-by-step assembly instructions can be downloaded online for free.All together, the parts for one robot cost about $100. The price is less again if the body of the robot is constructed from cardboard or another commonly found material.

Harry Bartlett (right) is applying skills from robotics classes to computer-making.(ABC Central Victoria: Mark Kearney)Asked whether the rise of robotics made him nervous, Harry said it depended.""If you just had a robot to help around the house and can think for itself, that really wouldn't be that threatening,"" he said.""But say if it was a military robot. What if something happens to them and they start going rogue, because no one can really stop it?""Testing patience and imaginationFor Harry's schoolmate, Charlotte Hazeltine, robotics was an entirely new challenge, one that tested her concentration.Get ready for the AI raceFrom truckies to lawyers and doctors, artificial intelligence will change every job and profession.

It was an experience students wouldn't have if the school bought pre-built robots to program.""They've got to work out after they've made it, why did it or didn't it work, and then go back and make it again, in the same way an engineer would keep refining and reiterating a design until they've made, say, the perfect bridge,"" he said.Friend or foe? Dr Simon Egerton holds the hand of one of his electronic creations, designed to make robotics an affordable reality for schools.(ABC Central Victoria: Mark Kearney)Charlotte said she was scared about the potential for artificial intelligence to disrupt the future, but understood that was why she needed to understand new technologies.""The way the world is progressing and how fast everything is becoming automated, by the time I'm about my parents' age, the majority of things will be controlled by robots,"" she said.""It seems like it's so far away, but it's so close.""Dr Egerton said the miniature humanoids were an example of the sorts of disruptive technology that these students would confront in their workplaces.But he promised his robots were benevolent creations.""You can program it to be social, you can program it to play games with you, you can program it — with some imagination — to be your buddy,"" he said.Posted 14 Oct 201814 Oct 2018Sun 14 Oct 2018 at 3:39pm, updated 14 Oct 201814 Oct 2018Sun 14 Oct 2018 at 4:54pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesRobots drawing more girls to STEM subjectsAI that can teach?

MIT To Build New College With USD 1 Billion Dedicated For Artificial Intelligence

— October 16, 2018
















In a recent announcement, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology said that it wants to create a new college specially dedicated for the science of artificial intelligence. The University committed a total of USD 1 billion for the program with the main focus on “responsible and ethical” uses of the technology.













Along with that, the university also said that it would add a total of 50 new faculty members and create a hub of inter-disciplines for dedicated work in the fields of computer science, Artificial Intelligence and other related fields.





A big amount of the new funds is slated to come from a gift from Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and co-founder of the financial giant Blackstone. The college will also be named after him.


“As computing reshapes our world, MIT intends to help make sure it does so for the good of all,” said MIT President Rafael Reif.


A statement by MIT said that the crucial initiative represents the single largest investment being done in computing and AI by an American academic institution.
The grand initiative news comes at a time when there are growing concerns over the impacts of artificial intelligence on global institutions, and fears that China is going ahead that extra mile compared to United States in this field.


“There is no more important opportunity or challenge facing our nation than to responsibly harness the power of artificial intelligence so that we remain competitive globally and achieve breakthroughs that will improve our entire society,” Schwarzman said.
“We face fundamental questions about how to ensure that technological advancements benefit all — especially those most vulnerable to the radical changes AI will inevitably bring to the nature of the workforce.”

The new college is expected to open in the month of September of the year 2019. The college will have a new and dedicated building and that will be completed in the year 2022.
There have been speculations over the use of Artificial Intelligence with many experts saying that the technology may overcome human power of intelligence finally to overtake us. This may even result in the extinction of human race. Amid these concerns, many scientists are advising to take all precautions beforehand to face the risk in case we come across such a situation. Artificial Intelligence tries to mimic human intelligence in various forms. But that does not mean that it can be limited to a form. It can be coded for any kind of software.
