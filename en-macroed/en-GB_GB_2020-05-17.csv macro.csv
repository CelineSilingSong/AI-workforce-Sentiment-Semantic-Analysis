Category: AIMay 19, 2020 Microsoft announces new supercomputer, lays out vision for future AI work

By Jennifer Langston 













Microsoft has built one of the top five publicly disclosed supercomputers in the world, making new infrastructure available in Azure to train extremely large artificial intelligence models, the company is announcing at its Build developers conference.
Built in collaboration with and exclusively for OpenAI, the supercomputer hosted in Azure was designed specifically to train that company’s AI models. It represents a key milestone in a partnership announced last year to jointly create new supercomputing technologies in Azure.
It’s also a first step toward making the next generation of very large AI models and the infrastructure needed to train them available as a platform for other organizations and developers to build upon.
“The exciting thing about these models is the breadth of things they’re going to enable,” said Microsoft Chief Technical Officer Kevin Scott, who said the potential benefits extend far beyond narrow advances in one type of AI model.
“This is about being able to do a hundred exciting things in natural language processing at once and a hundred exciting things in computer vision, and when you start to see combinations of these perceptual domains, you’re going to have new applications that are hard to even imagine right now,” he said.

A new class of multitasking AI models
Machine learning experts have historically built separate, smaller AI models that use many labeled examples to learn a single task such as translating between languages, recognizing objects, reading text to identify key points in an email or recognizing speech well enough to deliver today’s weather report when asked.
A new class of models developed by the AI research community has proven that some of those tasks can be performed better by a single massive model — one that learns from examining billions of pages of publicly available text, for example. This type of model can so deeply absorb the nuances of language, grammar, knowledge, concepts and context that it can excel at multiple tasks: summarizing a lengthy speech, moderating content in live gaming chats, finding relevant passages across thousands of legal files or even generating code from scouring GitHub.
As part of a companywide AI at Scale initiative, Microsoft has developed its own family of large AI models, the Microsoft Turing models, which it has used to improve many different language understanding tasks across Bing, Office, Dynamics and other productivity products.  Earlier this year, it also released to researchers the largest publicly available AI language model in the world, the Microsoft Turing model for natural language generation.
The goal, Microsoft says, is to make its large AI models, training optimization tools and supercomputing resources available through Azure AI services and GitHub so developers, data scientists and business customers can easily leverage the power of AI at Scale.
“By now most people intuitively understand how personal computers are a platform — you buy one and it’s not like everything the computer is ever going to do is built into the device when you pull it out of the box,” Scott said.
“That’s exactly what we mean when we say AI is becoming a platform,” he said. “This is about taking a very broad set of data and training a model that learns to do a general set of things and making that model available for millions of developers to go figure out how to do interesting and creative things with.”
Training massive AI models requires advanced supercomputing infrastructure, or clusters of state-of-the-art hardware connected by high-bandwidth networks. It also needs tools to train the models across these interconnected computers.
The supercomputer developed for OpenAI is a single system with more than 285,000 CPU cores, 10,000 GPUs and 400 gigabits per second of network connectivity for each GPU server. Compared with other machines listed on the TOP500 supercomputers in the world, it ranks in the top five, Microsoft says. Hosted in Azure, the supercomputer also benefits from all the capabilities of a robust modern cloud infrastructure, including rapid deployment, sustainable datacenters and access to Azure services.

This is about being able to do a hundred exciting things in natural language processing at once and a hundred exciting things in computer vision, and when you start to see combinations of these perceptual domains, you’re going to have new applications that are hard to even imagine right now.

“As we’ve learned more and more about what we need and the different limits of all the components that make up a supercomputer, we were really able to say, ‘If we could design our dream system, what would it look like?’” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “And then Microsoft was able to build it.”
OpenAI’s goal is not just to pursue research breakthroughs but also to engineer and develop powerful AI technologies that other people can use, Altman said. The supercomputer developed in partnership with Microsoft was designed to accelerate that cycle.
“We are seeing that larger-scale systems are an important component in training more powerful models,” Altman said.
For customers who want to push their AI ambitions but who don’t require a dedicated supercomputer, Azure AI provides access to powerful compute with the same set of AI accelerators and networks that also power the supercomputer. Microsoft is also making available the tools to train large AI models on these clusters in a distributed and optimized way.
At its Build conference, Microsoft announced that it would soon begin open sourcing its Microsoft Turing models, as well as recipes for training them in Azure Machine Learning. This will give developers access to the same family of powerful language models that the company has used to improve language understanding across its products.
It also unveiled a new version of DeepSpeed, an open source deep learning library for PyTorch that reduces the amount of computing power needed for large distributed model training. The update is significantly more efficient than the version released just three months ago and now allows people to train models more than 15 times larger and 10 times faster than they could without DeepSpeed on the same infrastructure.
Along with the DeepSpeed announcement, Microsoft announced it has added support for distributed training to the ONNX Runtime. The ONNX Runtime is an open source library designed to enable models to be portable across hardware and operating systems. To date, the ONNX Runtime has focused on high-performance inferencing; today’s update adds support for model training, as well as adding the optimizations from the DeepSpeed library, which enable performance improvements of up to 17 times over the current ONNX Runtime.
“We want to be able to build these very advanced AI technologies that ultimately can be easily used by people to help them get their work done and accomplish their goals more quickly,” said Microsoft principal program manager Phil Waymouth. “These large models are going to be an enormous accelerant.”
In “self-supervised” learning, AI models can learn from large amounts of unlabeled data. For example, models can learn deep nuances of language by absorbing large volumes of text and predicting missing words and sentences. Art by Craighton Berman.
Learning the nuances of language
Designing AI models that might one day understand the world more like people do starts with language, a critical component to understanding human intent, making sense of the vast amount of written knowledge in the world and communicating more effortlessly.
Neural network models that can process language, which are roughly inspired by our understanding of the human brain, aren’t new. But these deep learning models are now far more sophisticated than earlier versions and are rapidly escalating in size.
A year ago, the largest models had 1 billion parameters, each loosely equivalent to a synaptic connection in the brain. The Microsoft Turing model for natural language generation now stands as the world’s largest publicly available language AI model with 17 billion parameters.
This new class of models learns differently than supervised learning models that rely on meticulously labeled human-generated data to teach an AI system to recognize a cat or determine whether the answer to a question makes sense.
In what’s known as “self-supervised” learning, these AI models can learn about language by examining billions of pages of publicly available documents on the internet — Wikipedia entries, self-published books, instruction manuals, history lessons, human resources guidelines. In something like a giant game of Mad Libs, words or sentences are removed, and the model has to predict the missing pieces based on the words around it.
As the model does this billions of times, it gets very good at perceiving how words relate to each other. This results in a rich understanding of grammar, concepts, contextual relationships and other building blocks of language. It also allows the same model to transfer lessons learned across many different language tasks, from document understanding to answering questions to creating conversational bots.
“This has enabled things that were seemingly impossible with smaller models,” said Luis Vargas, a Microsoft partner technical advisor who is spearheading the company’s AI at Scale initiative.
The improvements are somewhat like jumping from an elementary reading level to a more sophisticated and nuanced understanding of language. But it’s possible to improve accuracy even further by fine tuning these large AI models on a more specific language task or exposing them to material that’s specific to a particular industry or company.
“Because every organization is going to have its own vocabulary, people can now easily fine tune that model to give it a graduate degree in understanding business, healthcare or legal domains,” he said.

AI at Scale
One advantage to the next generation of large AI models is that they only need to be trained once with massive amounts of data and supercomputing resources. A company can take a “pre-trained” model and simply fine tune for different tasks with much smaller datasets and resources.
The Microsoft Turing model for natural language understanding, for instance, has been used across the company to improve a wide range of productivity offerings over the last year. It has significantly advanced caption generation and question answering in Bing, improving answers to search questions in some markets by up to 125 percent.
In Office, the same model has fueled advances in the smart find feature enabling easier searches in Word, the Key Insights feature that extracts important sentences to quickly locate key points in Word and in Outlook’s Suggested replies feature that automatically generates possible responses to an email. Dynamics 365 Sales Insights also uses it to suggest actions to a seller based on interactions with customers.
Microsoft is also exploring large-scale AI models that can learn in a generalized way across text, images and video. That could help with automatic captioning of images for accessibility in Office, for instance, or improve the ways people search Bing by understanding what’s inside images and videos.
To train its own models, Microsoft had to develop its own suite of techniques and optimization tools, many of which are now available in the DeepSpeed PyTorch library and ONNX Runtime. These allow people to train very large AI models across many computing clusters and also to squeeze more computing power from the hardware.
That requires partitioning a large AI model into its many layers and distributing those layers across different machines, a process called model parallelism. In a process called data parallelism, Microsoft’s optimization tools also split the huge amount of training data into batches that are used to train multiple instances of the model across the cluster, which are then periodically averaged to produce a single model.
The efficiencies that Microsoft researchers and engineers have achieved in this kind of distributed training will make using large-scale AI models much more resource efficient and cost-effective for everyone, Microsoft says.
When you’re developing a cloud platform for general use, Scott said, it’s critical to have projects like the OpenAI supercomputing partnership and AI at Scale initiative pushing the cutting edge of performance.
He compares it to the automotive industry developing high-tech innovations for Formula 1 race cars that eventually find their way into the sedans and sport utility vehicles that people drive every day.
“By developing this leading-edge infrastructure for training large AI models, we’re making all of Azure better,” Scott said. “We’re building better computers, better distributed systems, better networks, better datacenters. All of this makes the performance and cost and flexibility of the entire Azure cloud better.”

They'd already spent years mapping the cells in the neocortex, the supposed seat of thought and perception. “It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rain forest,” Markram explained. “How many trees does it have? What shapes are the trees?” Now his team would create a virtual rain forest in silicon, from which they hoped artificial intelligence would organically emerge. If all went well, he quipped, perhaps the simulated brain would give a follow-up TED talk, beamed in by hologram.Related StoriesWired Q&AGoogle’s AI Guru Wants Computers to Think More Like BrainsTom SimoniteThe A.I.

Carroll imagined a nation so obsessed with cartographic detail that it kept expanding the scale of its maps—6 yards to the mile, 100 yards to the mile, and finally a mile to the mile. A map the size of an entire country is impressive, certainly, but what does it teach you? Even if neuroscientists can re-create intelligence by faithfully simulating every molecule in the brain, they won't have found the underlying principles of cognition. As the physicist Richard Feynman famously asserted, “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” To which Markram and his fellow cartographers might add: “And what I can create, I do not necessarily understand.”It's possible that AI models don't need to mimic the brain at all. Airplanes fly despite bearing little resemblance to birds. Yet it seems likely that the fastest way to understand intelligence is to learn principles from biology. This doesn't stop at the brain: Evolution's blind design has struck on brilliant solutions across the whole of nature. Our greatest minds are currently hard at work against the dim almost-intelligence of a virus, its genius borrowed from the reproductive machinery of our cells like the moon borrows light from the sun. Still, it's crucial to remember, as we catalog the details of how intelligence is implemented in the brain, that we're describing the emperor's clothes in the absence of the emperor.

As the physicist Richard Feynman famously asserted, “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” To which Markram and his fellow cartographers might add: “And what I can create, I do not necessarily understand.”
It's possible that AI models don't need to mimic the brain at all. Airplanes fly despite bearing little resemblance to birds. Yet it seems likely that the fastest way to understand intelligence is to learn principles from biology. This doesn't stop at the brain: Evolution's blind design has struck on brilliant solutions across the whole of nature. Our greatest minds are currently hard at work against the dim almost-intelligence of a virus, its genius borrowed from the reproductive machinery of our cells like the moon borrows light from the sun. Still, it's crucial to remember, as we catalog the details of how intelligence is implemented in the brain, that we're describing the emperor's clothes in the absence of the emperor. We promise ourselves, however, that we'll know him when we see him—no matter what he's wearing.

(Mark Lennihan/AP)ShareComment on this storyComment474Add to your saved storiesSaveSAN FRANCISCO — Facebook is joining the permanent work-from-home trend, saying it will start allowing some employees to apply to work remotely for good.Facebook could have about 50 percent of its 45,000-person company working remotely in the next five to 10 years, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a public video announcing the policy Thursday. But the social media giant will also lower paychecks to reflect cheaper costs of living in some cases, depending on location.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeFacebook will start “aggressively” opening up hiring for remote workers, Zuckerberg said, including for people living in areas a few hours away from its offices and in new hubs it will establish.Story continues below advertisement“Certainly being able to recruit more broadly, especially across the U.S. and Canada to start, is going to open up a lot of new talent that previously wouldn't have considered moving to a big city,” he said.Twitter employees can work from home foreverTech companies have been the first to move to permanent work-from-home policies after proving the practice works during the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter said last week that it would allow all of its employees to choose to continue working from home long term even after the pandemic ends.AdvertisementThe industry, which relies heavily on positions in which jobs are completed on computers, is better-positioned than many for most remote work. But the companies have long relied on sprawling open campuses that put an emphasis on hallway interactions and collaboration spaces. The coronavirus pandemic, which has sent most employees home, is shifting that. Many expect that even when companies decide it is safe to reopen offices, the spaces and remote work policies will look very different than they did before.Story continues below advertisementFacebook is taking a more measured approach than Twitter. It will begin recruiting hires for remote work outside its usual office hubs, Zuckerberg said, and some existing employees can apply to work remotely. But he said choosing to live in cheaper cities could mean employees’ paychecks would be reduced.💻Follow TechnologyFollow“Our goal here is to enable many existing employees to become remote workers, if you want,” he said.Facebook usage is up amid coronavirusThe company will adjust salaries depending on where employees live — paying less to those who work remotely from cities where the cost of living is lower. Facebook already pays different salaries based on locations, but this means employees who are allowed to work remotely have until Jan. 1 to tell Facebook where they are living and might get a paycheck cut.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“That means if you live in a location where the cost of living is dramatically lower, or the cost of labor is lower, then salaries do tend to be somewhat lower in those places,” Zuckerberg said.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextDissenting Republican delegates sign protest of Trump platform SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.U.S., Germany foiled Russian plot to assassinate CEO of arms manufacturer, officials saySparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Family of teen who died after ‘One Chip Challenge’ sues snack companySparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.La Niña is coming.

Here’s what renters should know.SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Still, lower salaries in smaller cities might not work for all positions, especially for executive-level jobs. Will Hunsinger, CEO of Silicon Valley executive recruiting company Riviera Partners, said companies like Facebook will need to keep executive pay high to compete with rivals. In addition, the company will likely save money on operational expenses such as free food and shuttle services. “They’re going to pay them what it takes to get that talent,"" he said.Story continues below advertisementAn internal company survey found that about 45 percent of employees interested in remote work were “pretty confident” they would move to another location. It also said about 40 percent of employees said they were somewhat, extremely or very interested in remote work. About 60 percent of employees asked for flexibility, or a combination of remote work and office work.AdvertisementFacebook responding to that survey with its new policy could prove a morale booster for the workforce. Some workers have said that a string of scandals, from the Cambridge Analytica data privacy breach to the use of the company’s platform to spread conspiracy theories and false news, has hurt morale there.Big Tech was the first to send workers home. Now it’s in no rush to bring them back.Facebook has already said most employees will work remotely through the end of the year, though it expects its offices will open for a small number of employees starting in July. Initially, offices will only allow about 25 percent capacity because of social distancing guidelines, Zuckerberg said.Story continues below advertisementFacebook’s decision is likely to send ripples across the industry.“It’s going to have a big effect,” said Margaret O’Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington who studies Silicon Valley. “Facebook is big, it hires a lot of people, it’s a big force of recruitment. The landscape of tech right now is so dominated by these five very big companies.”AdvertisementIt will also give the company a recruiting advantage by giving it flexibility geographically, she said.Facebook has the money to keep its Menlo Park campus — something Zuckerberg pledged to do in his Thursday announcement. But the company’s announcement might be even more influential for smaller and midsize tech companies, O’Mara said, which might now seriously consider remote work in part as a way to reduce spending on office space.Story continues below advertisementEngineers at the company with strong performance reviews will be the first group allowed to apply for remote work.With the idea of working from home becoming more appealing as people try to limit exposure to the coronavirus, Zuckerberg’s decision also tracks with other moves in which he has been able to quickly seize on a popular idea or product just gathering momentum in the tech industry. He jumped on cryptocurrency as the idea gained traction, working to launch a digital currency. His move to buy Instagram when the company had just a dozen employees demonstrated an ability to see trends in technology moving toward image-sharing long before others, and his mega-purchase of WhatsApp for $19 billion showed an ability to understand the role messaging would play in social networking.AdvertisementBut the offer to allow employees to work from home wherever is also viewed as a potentially powerful recruiting and retention tool. Many Silicon Valley start-ups already have moved to remote work in the short term to compete for talent with tech giants.Story continues below advertisementNow, remote work may become an even more expected part of tech culture.“I think with Facebook doing it… it will be a standard thing now. It won’t even be a perk, it will be an option,"" said David Chie, CEO of Silicon Valley recruiting agency Palo Alto Staffing.The great video chat faceoff: Six apps. Dozens of heads. One came out on top.Facebook has already broadcast it is recruiting 10,000 people this year at a time when Silicon Valley start-ups are laying off thousands of people. This new permanent work-from-home benefit will become a recruiting tool, increasing its leverage as compared to some start-ups.Still, some of Facebook’s contract workers are likely to continue to come into the office, particularly its army of over 15,000 content moderators, whose work reviewing graphic posts is generally considered too sensitive to be done from home.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementZuckerberg emphasized how this policy would help the company build tools for other businesses that support remote work. The company said its new video chat service, Messenger Rooms, would be available for business customers to host work meetings.Facebook also announced Thursday that its Workplace tools for businesses on the social network is now used by 5 million paying customers, up from 2 million in October.“Moving to more remote work I think will give us the opportunity to advance some of the important future technology that we work on,” he said.Heather Kelly contributed to this report.Share474 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

The company will use artificial intelligence to help identify these potential bad actors and provide safety notices to users about messages from shady accounts. This represents the latest example of Facebook employing automation to address its myriad content moderation problems. The company also says it brings Messenger closer to being end-to-end encrypted by default.A key detail of how this new strategy works is that Facebook is trying to limit how much its AI actually reads the content of user messages in order to identify scams. The technology is instead watching for potential abuse based on what accounts are doing.“We may use signals [such as] user reports or reported content to inform the machine learning models,” a Facebook spokesperson told Recode, “but we don’t do so proactively, and we primarily use behavioral signals to determine when to surface a safety notice.”For instance, it might create a notice if an account is trying to use a name that looks like one of your friends, or an account that belongs to an adult is sending a bunch of messages or friend requests to minors. As the moderation tool is not accessing message content, it’s designed to work with full encryption, which Facebook has long said will roll out on Messenger. (Facebook-owned WhatsApp is already end-to-end encrypted.)Notably, Facebook does not automatically block potentially fake or scammy accounts if they’re flagged by this new automated moderation tool. Messenger will now display a safety notice that warns the user and gives them the chance to block the person or read about how to protect themselves from scams. This strategy is not unlike Facebook’s recent move to nudge users who have liked coronavirus hoaxes.Facebook will provide a notice to users when it detects an account that might be an impersonation of another Facebook friend. FacebookThis new tool is attempting to solve a well-documented problem on Messenger. Con artists continue to find creative and convincing ways to impersonate users’ friends and family in order to trick people into giving up their money or financial information. One of Facebook’s new safety messages even specifically warns people to “Refuse requests for money.” And more recently, those ploys have taken advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic, with scammers promoting fake treatments and charity efforts. The problem got bad enough that the Better Business Bureau issued a public warning about it.If Messenger determines that an account might be associated with spam, it will provide recommendations and tips.Fakes like these are a systemic problem on Facebook’s platform. The company estimates in its own community standards enforcement report that it disabled 1.7 billion fake accounts in the first three months of 2020 alone. Facebook also estimates that about 5 percent of its monthly active users in the last quarter were fake accounts, though the company claims it catches almost all of these accounts with automation before users need to report them.Importantly, however, this latest attempt to address its massive scam problem will not apply to misinformation, which has long festered on Facebook’s platforms. Fake news and conspiracy theories are finding new fertile ground amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Facebook has made several policy changes in order to curb the Covid-19 “infodemic,” as Recode has noted. But again, these new safety notices do not apply to fake news and misinformation, despite its prevalence on private messaging apps like Messenger and WhatsApp.A Facebook spokesperson told Recode in an email that it uses a “forwarded” label in Messenger to indicate when a specific message did not originate from the sender and that the company is “exploring more strict forward limits.” For at least a couple of years, Facebook has gone even further by limiting forwarding on its messaging platforms. The company employed this method to fight fake news after violence in India and Myanmar a few years ago, and more recently claimed that limiting forwarding cut down on the spread of viral messages in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic by 70 percent. It’s unclear if these messages actually contained fake news, however.Related:Coronavirus scammers are flooding social media with fake cures and testsThe new safety notices also represent yet another attempt by Facebook to use automation to curb its toughest content challenges, which are significant. Facebook has already employed AI in its efforts to solve problems as wide-ranging as terrorist propaganda and recruitment to illegal opioid sales, though none of those abuses have completely gone away. And most recently, when the pandemic forced the company’s human reviewers from their offices, Facebook again turned to its AI-powered content moderation technology, though it warned that the technology would be less than ideal.Ultimately, time will tell whether the new safety alerts in Messenger will cut down on scams — and there’s no reason to scoff at the technology’s power to quickly flag large amounts of content to give users a heads up that something might be fishy. Scammers invariably tend to find workarounds, so the technology will continue to evolve. And again, at the end of the day, it’s up to the user to notice the alert and do something about it.The feature has been rolling out on Android devices since March, and Facebook says it has been flagging potentially concerning messages for more than 1 million people a week. Starting next week, the feature will start to be expanded to iOS users.Open Sourced is made possible by Omidyar Network.

The plan involved chest CTs—three-dimensional scans of lungs displayed in finely detailed slices. By studying thousands of such images, an algorithm would learn to decipher whether a given patient's pneumonia appeared to stem from Covid-19 or something more routine, like influenza.In the US, as the virus spread in February, the idea appeared to hold promise: With conventional tests in short supply, here was a way to get more people screened, fast. Health professionals, however, weren't so sure. Although various diagnostic algorithms have won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration—for wrist fractures, eye diseases, breast cancer—they generally spend months or years in development. They're deployed in different hospitals filled with different kinds of patients, interrogated for flaws and biases, pruned and tested again and again.Related StoriesPublic HealthWhat if Covid-19 Returns Every Year, Like the Common Cold?Gregory BarberOpinionArtificial Intelligence Won't Save Us From Coronavirus Alex EnglerMachine VisionChinese Hospitals Deploy AI to Help Diagnose Covid-19Tom SimoniteWas there enough data on the new virus to truly discern one pneumonia from another?

The politely bureaucratic assessment was that few projects had achieved “operational maturity.”The limitations were older than the crisis, but aggravated by it. Reliable AI depends on our human ability to collect data and make sense of it. The pandemic has been a case study in why that's hard to do mid-crisis. Consider the shifting advice on mask wearing and on taking ibuprofen, the doctors wrestling with who should get a ventilator and when. Our daily movements are dictated by uncertain projections of who will get infected or die, and how many more will die if we fail to self-isolate.As we sort out that evidence, AI lags a step behind us. Yet we still imagine that it possesses more foresight than we do.Take drug development. One of the flashiest AI experiments is by Google-affiliated DeepMind. The company's AlphaFold system is a champion at the art of protein modeling—predicting the shape of tiny structures that make up the virus. In the lab, divining those structures can be a months-long process; DeepMind, when it released schematics for six viral proteins in March, had done it in days. The models were approximations, the team cautioned, churned out by an experimental system. But the news left an impression: AI had joined the vaccine race.In the vaccine community, however, the effort elicited a shrug.“I can't see much of a role for AI right now,” says Julia Schaletzky, a veteran drug discovery researcher and head of UC Berkeley's Center for Emerging and Neglected Diseases. Plenty of well-defined protein targets have been confirmed in labs without the help of AI. It would be risky to spend precious time and grants starting from scratch, using the products of an experimental system. Technological progress is good, Schaletzky says, but it's often pushed at the expense of building on what's known and promising.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDShe says there's potential in using AI to help find treatments. AI algorithms can complement other data-mining techniques to help us sift through reams of information we already have—to spot encouraging threads of research, for example, or older treatments that hold promise. One drug identified this way, baricitinib, is now going to clinical trials. Another hope is that AI could yield insights into how Covid-19 attacks the body. An algorithm could mine lots of patient records and determine who is more at risk of dying and who is more likely to survive, turning anecdotes whispered between doctors into treatment plans.Keep ReadingThe latest on artificial intelligence, from machine learning to computer vision and moreBut again, it's all a matter of data—what data we've already gathered, and whether we've organized it in a way that's useful for machines. Our health care system doesn't give up information easily to train such systems; privacy regulations and balkanized data silos will stop you even before the antiquated, error-filled health databases do.It's possible this crisis will change that. Maybe it will push us to rethink how data is stored and shared. Maybe we'll keep studying this virus even after the chaos dissipates and the attention wanes, giving us solid data—and better AI—when the next pandemic arrives. For now, though, we can't be surprised that AI hasn't saved us from this one.This article appears in the June issue. Subscribe now.Let us know what you think about this article.

Consider the shifting advice on mask wearing and on taking ibuprofen, the doctors wrestling with who should get a ventilator and when. Our daily movements are dictated by uncertain projections of who will get infected or die, and how many more will die if we fail to self-isolate.
As we sort out that evidence, AI lags a step behind us. Yet we still imagine that it possesses more foresight than we do.
Take drug development. One of the flashiest AI experiments is by Google-affiliated DeepMind. The company's AlphaFold system is a champion at the art of protein modeling—predicting the shape of tiny structures that make up the virus. In the lab, divining those structures can be a months-long process; DeepMind, when it released schematics for six viral proteins in March, had done it in days. The models were approximations, the team cautioned, churned out by an experimental system. But the news left an impression: AI had joined the vaccine race.
In the vaccine community, however, the effort elicited a shrug.
“I can't see much of a role for AI right now,” says Julia Schaletzky, a veteran drug discovery researcher and head of UC Berkeley's Center for Emerging and Neglected Diseases. Plenty of well-defined protein targets have been confirmed in labs without the help of AI. It would be risky to spend precious time and grants starting from scratch, using the products of an experimental system. Technological progress is good, Schaletzky says, but it's often pushed at the expense of building on what's known and promising.
She says there's potential in using AI to help find treatments. AI algorithms can complement other data-mining techniques to help us sift through reams of information we already have—to spot encouraging threads of research, for example, or older treatments that hold promise. One drug identified this way, baricitinib, is now going to clinical trials. Another hope is that AI could yield insights into how Covid-19 attacks the body. An algorithm could mine lots of patient records and determine who is more at risk of dying and who is more likely to survive, turning anecdotes whispered between doctors into treatment plans.
But again, it's all a matter of data—what data we've already gathered, and whether we've organized it in a way that's useful for machines. Our health care system doesn't give up information easily to train such systems; privacy regulations and balkanized data silos will stop you even before the antiquated, error-filled health databases do.
It's possible this crisis will change that. Maybe it will push us to rethink how data is stored and shared. Maybe we'll keep studying this virus even after the chaos dissipates and the attention wanes, giving us solid data—and better AI—when the next pandemic arrives. For now, though, we can't be surprised that AI hasn't saved us from this one.

Commentators have been raising concerns over Twitter's recent hiring of artificial intelligence (AI) star Fei-Fei Li, who has links to the Chinese Communist Party.Twitter appointed Stanford professor and former Google vice president Li to its board as an independent director earlier this month, citing her AI expertise.Li's appointment came after she left her role as chief scientist of AI/ML (artificial intelligence/machine learning) at Google Cloud in October 2018 following a controversy surrounding Google's Project Maven initiative, which helped the Pentagon identify drone targets from blurry video footage.The project prompted an employee revolt at Google, with some 4,000 signing a petition against Project Maven, and some quitting in protest.Li was also instrumental in the setting up of a new Google AI lab in China.Twitter currently uses an AI technique called deep learning to recommend tweets to its users and also uses AI to identify racist content and hate speech, or content from extremist groups.France-based commentator Wang Longmeng said hiring Li to work at Twitter was like hiring a fox to guard the hen-coop.""They seem to have ignored the backstory of Li's previous cooperation with China,"" he said. ""Li Fei-fei ... secretly opposed Google's cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense from a high moral standpoint ... but turned a blind eye to Project Dragonfly, in which Google was planning to help the Chinese Communist Party vet online speech.""Wang said Li also used a slogan closely associated with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a 2017 media interview in China, pledging to help China develop its AI capabilities.""I hope that democratic countries will reflect on this and start plugging the loopholes,"" he said. ""Fei-fei Li is very likely to be one of those loopholes.""Key military technologyLi is also an adviser on AI to China's prestigious Tsinghua University. Its vice president You Zheng has said that the university's AI research has two main purposes, one of which is to meet national defense needs under a ""military-civilian integration policy.""AI has been named as a key military technology under President Xi, who has announced that China plans to become a world leader in the field by 2030.In addition, Li has been linked to a students' association under the aegis of the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department.Mainland media reports listed  her as a guest at China Overseas Talent Exchange Conferences in the southern city of Guangzhou in 2017 and in Beijing in 2018, both of which were hosted by the European and American Alumni Association under the aegis of the United Front Work Department.Li also has ties to the Beijing-based Future Forum for the development of mobile technology with a strong 5G focus. The organization operates under the aegis of the state-run China Association for Science and Technology, and is supported by Beijing's Chaoyang District Government, according to its website.The Forum has been linked with some of the biggest names in Chinese technology, including NetEase founder Ding Lei and Baidu founder Li Yanhong. More interestingly, there are a number of descendants of veteran revolutionaries involved in the organization -- including Zhu Yulai, son of former premier Zhu Rongji, and Liu Lefei, son of former Politburo member Liu Yunshan.Uphold free speechRenee Xia, head of the overseas-based Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network, called on Twitter to uphold free speech.She said that the company has already issued ""blue tick"" symbols to accounts operated by the ruling Chinese Communist Party regime, including the Chinese foreign ministry, state-run Xinhua news agency, and the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the ruling party.""One of Twitter ’s certification criteria is that [blue-tick accounts] should work for the public good,"" Xia said. ""How can you certify a government agency that monitors people's internet use and suppresses freedom of expression? Twitter needs to do more.""Xia cited the recent detention of former journalist Zhang Jialong, who was tried on public order charges for comments made on social media this month.""The vast majority of the Chinese people cannot use Twitter freely and legally, but Chinese officials can illegally obtain Zhang Jialong's comments on Twitter,"" Xia said.Reported by Ng Yik-tung and Sing Man for RFA's Cantonese Service, and by Zheng Chongsheng for the Mandarin Service.

Cap’FALC Project: the digital tool for an inclusive society by Inria, Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research and Unapei

In the face of the current health and economic crisis, it is important to be able to provide all citizens with the information they need to understand the situation and find answers. However, as Unapei member associations have pointed out, people with intellectual disabilities do not have access to this multiple and complex information. This is why the Cap’FALC project makes sense with a new digital tool developed thanks to the skills of Inria, Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research and Unapei.

Cap’FALC aims to significantly advance access to information for all and to facilitate the sustainable participation of people with intellectual disabilities in the life of society.
Access to information: a major societal challenge for people with intellectual disabilities
In this period of crisis, every individual needs to know what to do to protect himself, to understand his rights, to be informed about the reality of this complex situation. And as proof: television news channels are enjoying their highest ratings of the decade. But this information conveyed by the major national media is still very often inaccessible to people with intellectual disabilities.
A truly supportive and inclusive society must enable people with intellectual disabilities to be citizens like others, and in particular to be informed. This is the objective of the FALC method, developed in 2009 by European associations of people with intellectual disabilities and their families. This method makes it possible to make information accessible to all people who have difficulties in understanding. It is based on the expertise of people with disabilities and implies that they are at the heart of the production of written material that is easy to read and understand.
Also, since the beginning of the health crisis, the Unapei member associations have been producing and publishing documents in FALC: validated derogatory travel certificates, information on the coronavirus, explanations of barrier gestures. And today, clarifications on the deconfinement and on the realization of the tests. These documents in FALC relayed on the site https://unisetsolidaires.unapei.org/, by the Government and by certain media have enabled many people with intellectual disabilities to better understand the period of confinement. The Secretary of State for Disabled Persons has also already published two FALC sheets, accessible on www.handicap.gouv.fr, one on the new rules associated with deconfinement and the other designed to help disabled persons to choose between remaining confined or deconfining after 11 May.
Cap’FALC, a digital tool for an inclusive society
To date, many associations, including 15 ESATs (Établissements et services d’aide par le travail) managed by associations of the Unapei movement, have developed an activity of transcription of texts in FALC by workers or volunteers with disabilities. These associations regularly transcribe texts entrusted by companies and administrations to make them accessible to all.
However, the number of writings available in FALC remains insufficient! In view of the absolute necessity to improve access to information for all, it becomes essential to facilitate the work of transcribers in FALC.
Cap’FALC’s objective is to develop an accessible digital tool that meets this precise need by facilitating the production of texts in FALC thanks to a transcription aid algorithm. The research project used to develop the tool is the subject of a thesis supervised by INRIA and Facebook AI Research.
“What I particularly like about this project, in which I am currently working to develop the algorithm that will be used by Unapei, is the fact that it puts cutting-edge research in Artificial Intelligence at the service of inclusion,” says Louis Martin, PhD student in charge of developing the tool. “It’s motivating to know exactly what my research work will be used for and to be able to make it evolve according to the needs of the people who will use it”.
The Cap’FALC project aims to reduce the isolation and exclusion of people with intellectual disabilities by improving the accessibility of information through the widespread use of Easy to Read and Understand (FALC). This project will be operational in 2021.
“FALC is a kind of universal language that speaks to everyone. Initially designed to enable people with intellectual disabilities to understand certain texts, it is proving to be a formidable driving force in the service of dyslexic and visually impaired people, as well as foreigners with a poor command of a language, illiterate people, the elderly and primary school children. Moreover, Europe has been involved in the FALC since 2009 with the mission of reducing the social divide linked to language,” underlines Sophie Cluzel, Secretary of State for People with Disabilities.
People with intellectual disabilities at the heart of the Cap’FALC project
People with intellectual disabilities are fully involved in the project at all stages of its development. Their experience in transcription and their expertise in its use are indispensable.
“Unapei and its associations have always been pioneers in making information accessible to people with intellectual disabilities. At a time when demand is growing, Cap’FALC will make it possible to meet that demand while capitalizing on the user expertise so essential for people with disabilities in the production of texts in FALC for a more accessible and inclusive society,” said Luc Gateau, President of Unapei.
Antoine Bordes, Director of Facebook AI Research, also adds:
“This is a very important project for the Facebook AI Research teams. In our fundamental research laboratory in artificial intelligence, we seek excellence in our work, but above all, we want these advances to serve the common good and be put to work for everyone. We are delighted to be a founding partner of this unique project and look forward to seeing the first results. Cap’Falc will have a very concrete impact on the daily lives of thousands of people in France”.
The algorithm uses the latest advances in artificial intelligence and language processing for the FALC transcription task. This research work, carried out by Inria and Facebook AI Research, has already resulted in several scientific publications presented at international conferences.
This algorithm will work in a similar way to a spell checker, which finds passages in a text, proposes solutions but does not correct without human validation. Thus, while the tool developed will be a valuable aid for disabled people responsible for transcribing texts into FALC, it will in no way replace their intervention at all stages of the writing process; it is their eyes that validate a text as accessible and easy to read and understand.
The Cap’FALC project is sponsored by the French Secretary of State for Disabled Persons and brings together Unapei, the main French associative movement in the field of intellectual and cognitive disabilities, Inria, the National Research Institute for Digital Sciences, and FAIR, Facebook’s artificial intelligence research laboratory. The project is supported by Malakoff Humanis via the CCAH (Comité national coordination action handicap).

Several private universities like Shiv Nadar University, OP Jindal Global University, and Symbiosis International among others have opted for AI Proctored online entrance exams.So, how is an AI proctored exam conducted? Can these tests be taken on a tablet or mobile device? Read on.Also ReadTop-B Schools Waive GMAT Score Requirement, Extend Applications ADVERTISEMENTREMOVE ADHow does this technology work?The AI Proctored tests use a combination of artificial intelligence and human proctors. This is because it may not be possible to deploy adequate human proctors for lakhs of students who often take competitive entrance tests.Since a video of the candidate taking the test is recorded through a webcam, the AI is able to flag or report any suspicious movement or activity.“Although the number of proctors may vary depending upon the test you are taking, it is the AI that flags any suspicious activity in the first instance, which is then checked by a human proctor,” says Sunil Agarwal, Head of Test Prep division at Pearson India, an Edtech company offering the technology to several universities in India.Can these tests be taken on a tablet or mobile device?According to Agarwal, students should take these tests on either a laptop or a desktop. The test is compatible with most browsers. However, students must ensure that they have the following systems in place:Operational webcam, which must be kept switched on during the test.Operational audio, which too must be switched on.An minimum internet speed of 1 MBPS is preferred.Agarwal, however, adds that Pearson is working on a technology that could allow students to take this from their mobiles and tablets.Also ReadCBSE Students to Write Exams in Their Own Schools: HRD MinisterWhat happens after log-in?The moment a candidate clicks on the given link, the computer will enter into safe browsing mode, which will not allow the candidate to perform any other tasks or open any other window.

Several private universities like Shiv Nadar University, OP Jindal Global University, and Symbiosis International among others have opted for AI Proctored online entrance exams.So, how is an AI proctored exam conducted? Can these tests be taken on a tablet or mobile device? Read on.Top-B Schools Waive GMAT Score Requirement, Extend Applications How does this technology work?The AI Proctored tests use a combination of artificial intelligence and human proctors. This is because it may not be possible to deploy adequate human proctors for lakhs of students who often take competitive entrance tests.Since a video of the candidate taking the test is recorded through a webcam, the AI is able to flag or report any suspicious movement or activity.“Although the number of proctors may vary depending upon the test you are taking, it is the AI that flags any suspicious activity in the first instance, which is then checked by a human proctor,” says Sunil Agarwal, Head of Test Prep division at Pearson India, an Edtech company offering the technology to several universities in India.Can these tests be taken on a tablet or mobile device?According to Agarwal, students should take these tests on either a laptop or a desktop. The test is compatible with most browsers. However, students must ensure that they have the following systems in place:Operational webcam, which must be kept switched on during the test.Operational audio, which too must be switched on.An minimum internet speed of 1 MBPS is preferred.Agarwal, however, adds that Pearson is working on a technology that could allow students to take this from their mobiles and tablets.CBSE Students to Write Exams in Their Own Schools: HRD MinisterWhat happens after log-in?The moment a candidate clicks on the given link, the computer will enter into safe browsing mode, which will not allow the candidate to perform any other tasks or open any other window.

And are continuously supported from beyond the Indian borders, primarily misusing modern technology for funding or Command and Control purposes. Prevention of violent extremism in India is an important and necessary requirement for the country. Such efforts need multi-dimensional coordination between Armed Forces and various National law enforcement agencies. Today’s asymmetric warfare requires newer tools and techniques to keep pace with the changing times. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evolving as a very effective and well-established technique in counter-terrorism and is the way ahead for Indian Armed Forces to undertake ‘predictive counter-terrorism’ measures so as to prevent violent extremism in hotbeds of terrorism like Northern Command of Army. What is Artificial Intelligence? Broadly, AI refers to the Information Systems capable of performing tasks that resemble human problem-solving abilities, use computer algorithms or rule-sets to do things that would normally require human intelligence. &quot;AI is a tool that carries out functionalities encoded in them, which are inherited from the intelligence of their human programmers. However, with the correct set of data, these AI engines can be trained to learn to identify patterns and information which may be humanly impossible, especially while working with huge digital database moving at a high data rate,&quot; Milind Kulshreshtha, C4I expert says. AI and Counter-Terrorism For India, terrorism is no new entity and the Nation is familiar with violent activities throughout. It is well established that the terrorists, along with those who inspire them, represents a major transnational challenge, with detection and disruption of such groups always being a priority. The dynamic means of terror financing is one of the key factors in the proliferation of anti-social activities. Along with the changing times, terrorism and its connectivity too has become highly digital and are benefitting from cyber-crime networks. The use of various AI techniques such as Facial Recognition, Artificial Neural Networks and Social Network Analysis are some of the popular tools. “An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a feed-forward back propagation network has been found to establish with a high degree of certainty various deceptive behaviour patterns. Such tools in hands of investigator support system would be valuable in the identification of terrorists. A Social Network Analysis tool is particularly suitable for analyzing terrorist networks since they take relationships into account, rather than only attributes, which are otherwise difficult to obtain for covert networks. Dark-web based investigations are of main interest here, apart from analysis of social media platforms like Facebook, Blogs, Twitter etc,” explains Kulshreshtha, C4I expert. Digital Database for AI Implementation India has established a wide range of surveillance and data gathering advance tools. And, through database-centric schemes like National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID), Network Traffic Analysis System (NETRA) and the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network &amp; Systems (CCTNS), law enforcement agencies have achieved centrally a Lawful Intercept and Monitoring (LIM) system. Post 2008 Mumbai terror attack, these mechanisms got a big boost. Explaining how this will work, Kulshreshtha says, “The AI work may start by collecting information on `lessons learnt’ after each terrorist skirmish in a specified data format. This record shall have the profile of a terrorist and their tactics, while also recording own shortcomings for improvement. In time, with past and subsequent data sets, Indian Defence Forces shall have an institutionalized database on each terrorist activity or engagement which is geotagged and linked to various other factors like weather etc.” “This data, when stored in AI relevant format, is highly useful for training the prediction algorithm and with some iterations shall be able to through results on next likely move of the terrorists based on various circumstances like weather conditions or when cornered inside a building etc. With this, the present human-based experience shall be harnessed within the AI engine and form the basis of predictive counter-terrorism. This shall assist in gaining effective progress against terrorists while ensuring the safety of personnel on Ground Zero.” Make In India Initiative DRDO lab Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) is nodal agency for research and development in the areas of AI and Robotics for the Defence Forces. Despite being accredited with certifications like CMMI ML2 or ISO 9001:2015, involvement in resolving field-level solutions for soldiers in high risk areas have been an ever-widening gap. “The NITI Aayog’s National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence had no mention of Armed Forces or Security forces in the Charter, probably a report driven more by the Industry initiative. With pandemic highlighting various human vulnerabilities, and Prime Minister’s initiative of ‘atmanirbhar’, this can be considered as an opportunity for Defence Forces to undertake their own problem-solving by extending the Financial Powers at GOC level for execution of AI Projects directly with the Industry so as to develop solutions to meet their local requirements, to which only they are well versed when compared to Central Agencies in New Delhi,” he suggests.",,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'Financialexpress', 'productID': 'financialexpress.com:showcase'}",True,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/', 'name': 'Business News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/business/', 'name': 'business'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/business/defence/', 'name': 'defence'}}]",Financial Express,The Financial Express,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fe-logo-600.png', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'width': 600, 'height': 60, 'caption': 'Financial Express'}",,"['https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress', 'https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-financial-express-india', 'https://www.instagram.com/financialexpressonline/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmk6ZFMy1CT80orXca4tKew']","{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Express Building, B-1/B, Sector-10', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}","{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://www.financialexpress.com?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",[],,,,,2024,,en_IN,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-09,"{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/artificial-intelligence.jpg', 'caption': 'The use of various AI techniques such as Facial Recognition, Artificial Neural Networks and Social Network Analysis are some of the popular tools.', 'description': 'artificial intelligence,terrorism,\xa0Indian borders, armed forces, make in india,\xa0Counter Terrorism,\xa0AI Implementation,\xa0Digital Database, defence news', 'width': 1200, 'height': 675}",[],[],"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://financialexpress.page.link/fe_app'}",1961,Read to Lead,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': ['https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/']}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': '108'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'en-US', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}",

The Internet Furry Drama Raising Big Questions About Artificial Intelligence

















Gizmodo International


4 years ago
May 18, 2020 at 8:45 am














Much of the fun of internet drama comes from its frivolousness, but sometimes an online shitfest points to something bigger. Last week, the AI-powered furry art site thisfursonadoesnotexist did just that, igniting a fandom firestorm while also highlighting an important debate about digital art. Trained on more than 55,000 images pulled (without permission) from a furry art forum, the algorithm was a simple case of art theft to some. For others, it was a chance to break out the popcorn. But legal scholars who spoke with Gizmodo said the conflict raises thorny questions about ownership in the age of AI—questions that may ultimately have to be answered in court.

Arfa, the programmer behind thisfursonadoesnotexist, says he used the same GAN (generative adversarial network) architecture behind the site thispersondoesnotexist to generate around 186,000 furry portraits. When he posted the project on Twitter last Wednesday, dozens of commenters rushed to weigh in. While many were fascinated by the project, some in the furry community objected to Arfa’s unauthorised use of art from the furry forum e621.net as training data. At least one person tried (and failed) to find proof that the algorithm was copying images from e621.net outright. And within days, the entire site was slapped with a DMCA copyright infringement complaint. (The company whose name the DMCA was issued in, according to Arfa, denied filing the notice and requested it be withdrawn.)
https://twitter.com/a/status/1258344026706599937
Some degree of backlash is understandable. Furry fandom has long been a close-knit community of independent creators supported by individual commissions. A project aimed at mass-producing fursonas—using original art as training material, no less—could be seen as a threat to creators’ livelihood. Some  commenters accused Arfa of disrespect and asked for the choice to opt out of the project. Others complained that their work had been uploaded to e621 without their permission in the first place.
The creator of thisfursonadoesnotexist thinks it would’ve been impossible to contact all the artists involved. Arfa told Gizmodo that he scraped 200,000 images that were then narrowed down to a 55,000-image training set representing approximately 10,000 different artists—creators who may go by different names now or have left the fandom entirely. According to Arfa, he’s more than willing to take an image down from thisfursonadoesnotexist if it clearly copies an original character, but he says he has yet to see credible evidence of that.
In defence of the AI’s originality, the site has produced a collection of mushier fursonas whose delirious weirdness inspired a flurry of memes. “Some of these have designs that are so… specific? Holistic?” a commenter on Hacker News wrote, linking to a fursona with a tail sticking out of her head and an adorably half-formed feline mouse. Do these Cronenberg-esque misfit furries, with their wild-eyed gazes, scream “LOVE ME”or “SAVE ME”? The art world adores liminality—that’s value added right there. 
Furry artists aren’t alone in facing the dilemma of digital manipulation. Just last month, Jay Z filed DMCA takedown notices against a YouTuber who used speech synthesis software to make his voice read the Book of Genesis and cover Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” While experts explained to Gizmodo that Jay Z’s issue isn’t copyright, since copyright doesn’t cover speech patterns, both incidents suggest a future where machine learning art is widespread, even commonplace. In such a future, can an artist’s original work be used as training material? If so, to what end? (In Jay Z’s case, YouTube ultimately allowed the videos to stand.)
The monkey and the camera
One significant hurdle an AI art lawsuit would need to clear is evidence of actual copyright infringement, not just use. To be actionable, an infringing work must be “substantially similar” to the source work—a determination that would be up to the courts to decide. But if an AI does infringe on a copyrighted work, who’s responsible? Art world attorney Nicholas O’Donnell compared the question to those raised when PETA tried to get a copyright on behalf of a monkey that took a viral selfie. A U.S. court dismissed that case, finding that works produced by animals can’t be copyrighted. “One of the things that [decision] spotlighted was the necessity that the author be a person,” O’Donnell said.  But is the AI the monkey or the camera?
It could be a bit of both—and neither. AI itself can’t be held liable for infringement, but unlike a monkey or a camera, you can train AI not to infringe. It’s ultimately up to the programmer to ensure that the training data is broad enough so that the program doesn’t predictably spit out a similar work. “If the program is being used as a tool, then the identity of the alleged infringer is someone who’s using those tools to potentially infringe on a protected work,” O’Donnell said. “And certainly, the narrower the scope of the program’s target, the more one could see that being argued. That if I take a program, and all I put in front of it is one protected work—and then I say, ‘the program [infringed], not me,’ that doesn’t really fly.” When asked whether the  AI-generated image below looks “substantially similar” to images found on e621, O’Donnell said, “I don’t know. I don’t know. It’s not jumping off the page.”
Nick Wilde
“The AI is learning, but it is also copying,” Jon Garon, who teaches intellectual property, cybersecurity, and technology law at Nova Southeastern University, told Gizmodo. To survive a legal challenge, an artistic AI would need to be trained in the same way that an art student learns not to copy a masterwork. If it duplicates a work in its database, then the developer could be held responsible. 
In the case of thisfursonadoesnotexist, Garon said that one possible plaintiff is Disney. Given the amount of fanart that can be found on e621, it’s unsurprising that some of the images on the site look suspiciously like copyrighted corporate characters: Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps from Disney’s Zootopia, even an unholy amalgam of the two; Rouge the Bat from Sonic the Hedgehog; Nala from The Lion King. Because intermediary copiers don’t matter, Garon explained, if someone steals his song and puts it on YouTube, and the song eventually makes it onto a pop star’s album, he could still sue the pop star.
“If [a program] is being shown a million images of Mickey Mouse, the AI will have the potential to create a work that is very different from any of the particular images,” Garon said. “But since all of the images are variations on the same copyrighted Mickey Mouse, it’s going to necessarily copy Mickey Mouse. And then Disney would have a case directly against the programmer of the AI.”
The monkey on a typewriter
The infringement issue flips if an AI randomly generates a nearly identical version of a work that wasn’t used to train its algorithm. If the AI had never seen a version of the work, it cannot infringe upon it.
“If their work was never copied at all, there’s no copyright claim,” Zahr Said, professor at the University of Washington School of Law, explained to Gizmodo. Said pointed to Judge Learned Hand’s famed 1936 statement in a copyright case against Metro-Goldwyn Pictures:

…if by some magic a man who had never known it were to compose anew Keats’s Ode on a Grecian Urn, he would be an “author,” and, if he copyrighted it, others might not copy that poem, though they might of course copy Keats’s.

Hand was referencing the idea of independent creation, when two authors happen to create the same work by chance. “It’s rarely found, but in a hypothetical in which the AI never had the work copied into the sample set, it couldn’t be infringing,” Said said.
But even if the AI did produce a substantially similar image to one in its sample set, Said continued, you’d have to take into account the commonality of elements (in copyright lingo, “scènes à faire”) that are essential to a genre and therefore not copyrightable—elements like large eyes and rounded snouts. “If you’re creating work in a boarding school wizard genre, there will be teachers with witch hats and flying brooms,” Said added. The case gets trickier when you name a student “Harry Potter.”
To what end?
AI is broad, and a copyright case would depend on whether it’s being used for scholarly purposes, in which case courts have tended to rule that AI needs, and can fairly use, training data. The case would be viewed differently if, say, you were selling an AI-generated painting for half a million dollars (which artists have).
Said said that every case depends on the alleged infringer’s purpose, and lawyers often advise defendants to make that clear from the outset. (For his part, Arfa told Gizmodo, “I’m just a guy trying to show people some cool tech.”) Said said that the fact that thisfursonadoesnotexist calls itself a “project,” and, through its URL, references a previous project which was created to show how AI works, a fair use finding is more likely. “If there were facts showing that this programmer was selling ads or downloads from the site that would allow people not to pay licensing fees that they were habitually paying to furry artists—that they’re supplanting demand—the worse it looks for the defendant.”
“You can do a lot of damage to a market even if you’re not charging money for your infringing copy,” he added.
It’ll take more than one AI-generated database to supplant the highly valued artists of the furry fandom, however. Commercial ventures have tried and failed to monetise furries in the past—and will keep trying. Others have taken thisfursonadoesnotexist on its face: a depersonalized bucket of elements, to be recycled as inspiration for improvement and play.

Fundamentally, these questions about authorship and originality aren’t new, stretching back thousands of years to the very beginning of Western art. Like a photocopier, modern technology has simply taken art’s oldest predicaments and made them bigger and blurrier. Unfortunately for us, a cigar-waving Orson Welles isn’t here to pace through the mist in a cape and pontificate on furry forgery. Instead, courts  will have to wade through these issues—giving the rest of us plenty to argue about in the meantime.

The soldier who is a split second quicker on the draw may walk away from a firefight unscathed; the ship that sinks an enemy vessel first may spare itself a volley of missiles. In cases where humans can't keep up with the pace of modern conflict, machines step in. When a rocket-propelled grenade is streaking toward an armored ground vehicle, an automated system onboard the vehicle identifies the threat, tracks it, and fires a countermeasure to intercept it, all before the crew inside is even aware. Similarly, US Navy ships equipped with the Aegis combat system can switch on Auto-Special mode, which automatically swats down incoming warheads according to carefully programmed rules.These kinds of defensive systems have been around for decades, and at least 30 countries now use them. In many ways, they're akin to the automatic braking systems in newer cars, intervening only under specific emergency conditions. But militaries, like automakers, have gradually been giving machines freer rein. In an exercise last year, the United States demonstrated how automation could be used throughout the so-called kill chain: A satellite spotted a mock enemy ship and directed a surveillance plane to fly closer to confirm the identification; the surveillance plane then passed its data to an airborne command-and-control plane, which selected a naval destroyer to carry out an attack. In this scenario, automation bought more time for officers at the end of the kill chain to make an informed decision—whether or not to fire on the enemy ship.Related StoriesArtificial intelligenceAI Is Fueling a New Global Arms RaceTom SimoniteEthics of WarA Tech Group Suggests Limits for the Pentagon’s Use of AITom Simonitetop algorithmThe Pentagon's AI Chief Prepares for BattleElias GrollMilitaries have a compelling reason to keep humans involved in lethal decisions.
