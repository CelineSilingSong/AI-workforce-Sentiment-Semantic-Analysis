Artificial intelligence (AI) has made a significant impact in the last few years, and AI has the potential to significantly impact the next generation of workers in both a positive and negative way as AI continues to become more progressive. The World Economic Forum's ""The Future of Jobs Report 2020"" predicts 85 million jobs globally will be replaced by AI by 2025. The same report also indicates that AI can potentially generate 97 million new roles.


However, the types of jobs that AI will create will differ from those being lost. New graduates are embarking into a different type of workforce, and the data entry and processing positions, mostly seen as entry-level positions for graduates and people early in their careers, are now automated through AI. This puts recent graduates in an interesting position while seeking to enter the workforce.

We live in a fast past world, and AI is making a continuous impact on today's workforce. The good news is that AI will enhance jobs that require problem-solving, creativity, and empathy to a new level, which will create new opportunities like never before. The new generation of workers needs to be able to adapt to the recent changes in the workforce. It is essential for people seeking to secure new positions to have an open mind but, more importantly, have a diversified set of skill sets that will drive impact for the company of choice. If workers can transition and develop a strategic set of skills, AI can be seen as an asset and the best thing to boost your career.

We see data that shows AI is promoting inclusivity and accessibility in many ways that impact workers. According to Accenture, 84% of C-suite executives feel they must leverage AI to accomplish their growth objectives, but most still need to put AI to work to advance growth through inclusion. The research suggests many are not fully aware of the barriers to inclusion that may exist in their organizations, but 67 % of C-suite respondents believe they've built a supportive workplace that enables their disabled employees to thrive with the right technology, environment, and support. Nevertheless, only 41 % of employees with disabilities agree.

AI enables organizations to identify talent that may have been overlooked, fostering inclusivity in recruitment. Traditional biases are mitigated by anonymizing candidate information during initial screening, allowing AI to focus solely on qualifications and skills. This approach levels the playing field and reduces unconscious biases that hinder underrepresented individuals.
Though we still have a long way to go, AI has played an impactful role in dismantling some of the bias and discrimination within the hiring process, making it possible for companies to achieve greater diversity and inclusion in hiring. Also, according to recent reports, recruiters can use AI tools to discover high-potential candidates outside job boards and other traditional sources. This is how employers can find more diverse candidates that may have yet to be noticed.
AI is also making an impact on data-driven decision-making for equity. AI's analytical capabilities unlock valuable insights from vast amounts of workforce data, aiding evidence-based decision-making for equity. AI systems analyze patterns and trends to identify potential biases and inequalities within an organization. With this knowledge, organizations can develop targeted strategies to address systemic issues, fostering diversity and inclusion.
AI tools are also playing a vital role in expanding access to job opportunities for minorities, giving candidates a better chance of landing a fulfilling position. These tools broaden talent sourcing by identifying and connecting organizations with underrepresented candidates, fostering a more equitable workforce. By analyzing candidate skills, qualifications, and job requirements, AI-powered platforms provide personalized job recommendations, opening doors for individuals from diverse backgrounds.
Bridging The Skills Gap
Overall, AI is making a significant impact in bridging the skills gap in the workforce. AI bridges the skills gap, ensuring equitable access to career development. AI-powered learning platforms offer personalized training and up-skilling opportunities, irrespective of one's background or location. By considering individual learning styles and preferences, AI fosters equitable access to educational resources. Individuals from underrepresented groups can acquire relevant skills, empowering them to pursue new job opportunities.
8 Ways AI Tools Can Assist Minorities And Recent Graduates In Securing New Job Opportunities
Resume Optimization: AI-powered tools like resume.io can analyze resumes and provide feedback on how to optimize them for specific job positions. These tools can suggest improvements in formatting, keywords, and content to increase the chances of resume visibility and attract the attention of recruiters.
Job Matching: AI algorithms can analyze job requirements and candidates' skills, qualifications, and experience to match individuals from minority backgrounds with relevant job opportunities. By considering a broader range of factors beyond traditional qualifications, AI tools can identify job openings that may be a good fit for minority candidates.
Skill Development: AI-powered learning platforms can provide personalized training and upskilling opportunities tailored to the needs of minority job seekers. These platforms can identify skill gaps and recommend relevant courses, tutorials, or resources to enhance candidates' competencies and increase their chances of securing job opportunities.
Interview Preparation: AI tools can assist candidates in preparing for interviews by providing mock interview simulations and feedback. These tools can analyze candidates' responses, assess their performance, and offer suggestions for improvement, helping them build confidence and enhance their interview skills.
Networking and Mentorship: AI-powered platforms can facilitate networking and mentorship opportunities for minority job seekers. These tools can connect individuals with professionals from similar backgrounds or industries, providing guidance, advice, and valuable connections that can enhance their job prospects.
Bias Detection and Mitigation: AI tools can help detect and mitigate biases in job postings, application screening, and candidate evaluations. By analyzing language, keywords, and historical data, these tools can identify potential biases and provide recommendations for inclusive and equitable practices, promoting fair hiring processes.
Accessibility Accommodations: AI can enhance accessibility in the job search process for individuals with disabilities. AI-powered tools can provide features such as screen readers, voice recognition, or captioning to make job search platforms and applications more accessible, ensuring equal opportunities for all candidates.
Overall, AI is here to stay, and it's essential for the workforce to understand how to leverage AI to work for you in your future career goals.

The next 10 years will be important for the development of a technology that, together with 5G, is set to take centre stage of a true revolution on a social, economic and industrial scale.Why study artificial intelligence?This is because more and more professionals qualified in artificial intelligence are in demand. In the wake of the pandemic, industrial areas such as process automation, the still nascent metaverse and artificial intelligence have accelerated their prominence. Infojobs, through its tool Job Market Insights registered a 31% increase in job offers linked to artificial intelligence in 2022 compared to the previous year.So, the reader may be wondering what to study to work in artificial intelligence. Below, and as we did in the special feature on working in cybersecurity, we are going to share valuable information for anyone considering a career in this exciting world. We start from the assumption that the reader already knows what artifical intelligence is and how it works, so let’s get straight to the point.What skills does it take to work in AI?We can divide the skills needed to work in AI into two parts: Hard Skills and Soft Skills.Hard Skills needed to work in AIProgramming language. In order to develop programmes based on artificial intelligence, we need to know different programming languages. For example, Python is used for machine learning or NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) comprehension; C++, whose libraries are used to create more complex codes; Java, an object-oriented language with a virtual machine to run the developed programs anywhere.Mathematics. In order to be able to develop models with Machine Learning, it is essential to have knowledge of Linear Algebra, Calculus and Algorithms, as well as Probability Theory, Statistics and Mathematical Optimisation, even at the beginner level.Machine Learning. One of the most important areas within the field of artificial intelligence is Machine Learning. This is a technology that allows computers to learn from data and improve their ability to make predictions or decisions based on that data. A simple example of Machine Learning is image recognition. The machine is provided with a series of images labelled ‘chair’ or ‘table’ and it learns to identify what a chair and a table are, what differentiates them, and so on. Another example could be Netflix: the recommendations suggested by the platform are based on Machine Learning algorithms to analyse what users watch and, based on this data, recommend similar content.Natural Language Processing (NLP). You need to have natural language processing skills to be able to work on projects such as ChatGPT or other chatbots, e.g. those used in customer service.Big Data. Knowledge of Big Data technologies, including Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL and distributed databases (DBD).Cloud Computing. If you want to work in artificial intelligence you should have experience in Cloud Computing and know the ins and outs of platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (CGP) or Microsoft Azure.Robotics. You should have a background in robotics to work on process automation and the creation of autonomous robots. And the fact is that robots are doing more and more jobs on their town.Soft Skills for working in AICritical thinking: analysing information objectively and questioning assumptions is essential for working in artificial intelligence.Good communication: ideas and solutions must be communicated very clearly. This is important because you are always working in a team with people who may have different knowledge levels.Continuous learning: you must be a person with an inexhaustible thirst for knowledge, as AI is a continuously evolving field.Ethics and responsibility: Artificial intelligence is having a profound impact on society at different levels. That is why good AI practitioners need to consider the implications of their work and ensure that it is put to good use.Languages. English is mandatory to work in artificial intelligence.How to learn artificial intelligence from the ground upIf you want to learn basic Artificial Intelligence Engineering, in addition to the mandatory studies, you can train on your own with some free courses that you can find on the Internet.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) machines use human-made media to create new content. Most of the images they create are based on the work of skilful artists or on physical features of real people. Should that be allowed? Tahereh Sonia Saheb, Sahand Sasha Karimi, Mark Esposito and Terence Tse suggest ways to ensure fair use of an artist’s work, and to protect people’s privacy and personal data.

 




God-given talent and years of education mean nothing to the new and, mostly, freely available market competitor. Training to perfect your skills can be squandered by this opponent, a non-human generative artificial intelligence (AI) machine that has been programmed to learn its “skills” by consuming human-generated media and populating new content. Metaphorically, AI works like Aladdin’s lamp. It obeys its human master who can type their wishes in the prompt box and see them generated as content within seconds.
Most generative AI machines (such as ChatGPT) are based on publicly available media and training. Many argue this means that AI is owned by the public and free to use. For instance, public datasets such as Common Crawl, Wikipedia, the Gutenberg Project, and the OpenSubtitles corpus were widely used in the development of language models like GPT-3, created by the research laboratory OpenAI. However, when it comes to art, the majority of the training data for generative paintings or avatars is based on the content created by talented and skilful artists or in some cases facial and body features of real people. The question is whether such generative AI machines should be allowed to use freely such media to generate new content.
In a highly publicised lawsuit, Hermès won a copyright lawsuit against an artist who generated NFT formats of their Birkin bag. It was only a few months ago that Greg Rutkowski, well-known for his unique style of painting, learned that there are many paintings in the public space that are similar to his but were not created by him.
Similarly, Lensa, a cheaply available generative AI phone app has also been trained on publicly available artwork and images. The app takes user uploaded photos and generates mythical avatars that are slimmer, lighter-skinned, and more nude. Not surprisingly, Lensa has ignited multiple controversies: the fair use of artists’ idiosyncratic styles, use of geometric data on unique facial characteristics of individuals’ photos, and how generative avatars are widening socio-cultural and racial disparities and causing psychological distress by undervaluing the user’s true self.
Fair use of artists’ work
In the above-mentioned examples, one of the main concerns is the fair use of artists’ work and how generative AI will negatively impact the demand for an artist’s authentic talent. This concern becomes more acute considering that most artists depend on the small income they receive from their projects to support their livelihoods. Although generative AI software mostly mimics the artist’s idiosyncratic style, not copying their work directly, in most cases it is very difficult for the untrained eye of a potential buyer to distinguish between machine-generated and authentic work.
Historically, watermarks have been widely employed to prove ownership of art on the internet and to prevent their illegal use. In the era of generative art, the same conventional technique can be used to add watermarks behind AI-generated works in order to lessen online theft and unauthorised ownership. For example, if an artist’s specific style is invoked in an AI app to create a painting, the app can mark that painting so that credit is given to the artist. Alternatively, the developers of such apps can identify and directly engage with artists whose work has been used in their app’s training dataset. This may result in an agreement between the two parties so that the artist’s signatures or trademarks are added to the generative paintings as a useful remedy for identifying the artists whose works and aesthetics have been imitated. Such approaches allow for a new series of technological solutions to arise for real-time tracking and notification systems that alert artists when their art is used online in order to protect their intellectual property.
The resolution of generative AI paintings may be relevant to yet another approach. After the artist whose style was employed has been paid, the high-resolution art can be made accessible for public use. The initial drafts of the content can be left in a low-resolution format. This can potentially lessen the stealing of an artist’s aesthetic.
Moreover, generative AI calls for more specific copyright laws and regulations. For instance, in the US the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was introduced in 1998 to address copyright issues on the internet. We need similar laws and regulations for generative art that protects the artists and their unique talents.
It is our duty as a society to ensure that artworks are used fairly and that artists are compensated for any machine-generated art that incorporates their aesthetic. This will assure the economic security of artists, who will continue to push the creative boundaries of our minds.
AI-based swap apps
Another series of class action litigation is around the use of biometric data such as unique facial characteristics or the voice of an individual without their permission. The applications that use this data, such as Lensa, appear amusing for the average user, but there are several privacy infringement consequences behind their use.
One of the most recent legal battles was around a facial biometrics program that employed imprecise or non-existent informed consent. On the grounds of laws enacted by the Biometric Information and Privacy Act (“BIPA”), a class action lawsuit was filed against the creators of Lensa and its exploitation of users’ “facial geometry” data, its collection, storage, processing and destruction.
Another group of generative AI-based applications specialise in altering the voice or facial characteristics of the user to make them sound or look like professional singers and celebrities. Applications that use AI to “swap” or “alter” a human’s voice, face, or body are multiplying exponentially. Given the rapid increase of such generative AI apps, it is crucial that rules and safeguards beyond BIPA be put in place to address permissions that must be granted by the rightful owners of the data before that data can be used.
AI is still a new and emerging technology. It is important that the public understands its basis, what data it is collecting, and from where. We not only need to ensure fair use of an artist’s work, but we also need to protect everyone’s privacy and personal data.

Good read. Very innovative. Generative ai  would definitely require regulation going forward via Global pact/treaties as well as Federal and State legislation. To protect against unfair use of artists works and manipulation of facial geometry and personal data. #ai #dataprivacy

BRUSSELS — The European Commission has created guidelines for its staff regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT and Bard.  
According to the document's introduction, its purpose is ""to help staff members assess the risks and limitations of online available generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and set conditions for their safe use in working activities of the Commission.""
Generative AI refers to tools used to create new content — such as text or images — based on prompts. 
The four-page paper, obtained by POLITICO and dated May 24,  provides an outline of generative AI's function and establishes five main rules Commission staffers are recommended to follow when using such tools. 
The rules include: not disclosing information not in the public domain when using a generative AI tool; being aware that the AI's responses might be inaccurate or biased; considering whether the AI might be violating intellectual property rights; never copy-pasting AI-generated output into official documents; and avoiding the use of AI tools when working on ""critical and time-sensitive processes.""

From past to present, artworks range from digital pieces combining strange properties of data with human traces in technology to more recent investigations seeking out alternative and more hopeful queer futures through AI and drag performance collaboration. Elwes’ practice is based on their research into AI and Machine Learning and instigates playful critiques ofhuman and technological relationships via explorations into underlying codes, philosophies, and ethics.This show traces pathways through these technologies that offer insights and interventions into their dangers and potentialities.From the physical remnants of fingers across iPhone screens, and an algorithm’s filthiest imaginations, to the dragged out fantasies of queering datasets, Jake’s work illuminates the fleshy figurations and fantastic failures of these digital processes(Dr. Joe Parslow)Works such as Closed Loop (2017), sets two algorithms – one for labelling what it sees in images, another that creates fake images from scratch – against each other. Stuck in a feedback loop, they continuously interpret one another and unveil the process and limits of human-inputted data. This work shows generative AI technology in its infancy, five years before Midjourney and Dall-E. Elsewhere, Machine Learning Porn (2016) explores what an algorithm trained to remove explicit imagery has learnt of human biology, recreating the computer’s warped version of pornographic visuals.Elwes’ most recent projects explore the intersection of AI and drag performance. By including drag in thedataset as the ultimate form of gender nonconformity, subversion and celebration, they set out to investigate bias and queer representation in AI systems and research. This work is deeply collaborative, working with members (and legends) of London’s drag community to find ethical, unconventional, and joyful ways to play with AI, to drag it out of the black box to stage, screen, and gallery.Elwes’ work explores popular ways to stage artificial intelligence systems, allowing an inclusive entryway for diverse audiences to engage with the issues and conversations presented. Tracing eight years of work, from phone screen to cabaret stage and beyond, Data • Glitch • Utopia offers glimpses of messy manifestations of queer technological futures.Jake Elwes  Data • Glitch • Utopia Preview: 1st June, 6 — 8 PM (BST), 2nd June — 8th July 2023, Gazelli Art House, LondonThe V&A commissioned Elwes to make a new iteration of The Zizi Show in 2020. This exhibition at Gazelli coincides with a display of Elwes’ commission at the V&A, on view from May 2023 to February 2024.About the ArtistJake Elwes is a media artist who explores machine learning and artificial intelligence. Their work finds poetry and narrative in these systems’ success and failures, their sophistication, and limitations while investigating their code and ethics. In notable work, the Zizi Project, Elwes exposes AI bias by queering datasets with drag performers, simultaneously demystifying and subverting AI systems.Elwes lives and works in London, having studied at The Slade School of Fine Art, UCL (2013-17).

Others have been working for years with complex algorithms that are essential to their work. All are professionals in disparate fields who are implementing AI tools in their day-to-day work.Del HambreXavier Pastor, physician“AI can inform doctors and adjust prescriptions.”Xavier Pastor is a 66-year-old pediatrician in Barcelona who has always been interested in technological innovation. His first experience with data science dates back to 1984, when he was researching his doctoral thesis on newborns with diabetic mothers. The research required extensive data analysis using the first generation of personal computers at the University of Barcelona, and the physician has been passionate about the convergence of medicine and technology ever since.In 1996, Pastor was appointed head of medical informatics at the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, a university hospital that has been investing in AI research since 2017. One of his department’s projects uses machine learning to recommend medication prescriptions. “If the system identifies a better medication, it can inform the doctor and adjust that prescription.”The hospital uses AI in multiple projects to create virtual models from a patient’s tumor biomarkers to predict cancer risks, as well as early detection of colorectal cancer with deep learning algorithms and AI-enhanced radiology readings to detect brain and lung diseases.Del HambreBelén Yu Irureta-Goyena, astrophysicist“It can do what a person can do and more.”Traditional algorithms “fall short” for the work Belén Yu Irureta-Goyena does. She’s a 24-year-old astrophysicist from Madrid pursuing a PhD at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Lausanne, Switzerland) who tracks asteroids, space debris and satellites using astronomical imaging.“I use AI algorithms for a task that used to be done by a person looking at hundreds of images with the naked eye,” she said. Today’s large telescopes can quickly capture tens of thousands of images, so a manual analysis has become unmanageable — computerized methods are essential.The scientist uses specific AI algorithms to identify correlations between data that would not be obvious to a person. “The algorithm can do what a person can do and more.” She believes artificial intelligence can make significant contributions to every scientific field, and that automated processes are indispensable today. “AI has facilitated these methods and exceeds the capabilities of traditional algorithms in many processes.”Del HambreJuan Hernández, institutional relations consultant“ChatGPT can’t attend a meeting for me.”Juan Hernandez is a 29-year-old from Argentina who has been using ChatGPT for six months in his work as a consultant for an international financial institution. Like others, he first tried it out of curiosity and soon realized it could be useful in his work. “I was very late with some work products once and didn’t have a team to help me. ‘Well, let’s go for it,’ I told myself.” The first time he used ChatGPT at work, he asked it to generate titles for a research paper and got 20 suggestions back.Then he used it more extensively. “I can’t use AI to generate the final draft of a paper I would hand my boss, but it can provide a good starting point.” His primary AI tool is ChatGPT because he finds it the easiest to use. Hernández queries ChatGPT for initial research ideas, organizing meetings and presentations, producing multiple options for indecisive clients, and translating and proofreading texts.Day-to-day tasks have become easier for Hernández. “Thinking of 20 titles for a document takes time, and these tools can almost instantly produce options to choose from or provide inspiration.” Hernández isn’t worried that AI is going to put him out of a job. “ChatGPT doesn’t have a face and can’t attend a meeting for me.”Del HambreRaphaël Lozano, graphic designer“It’s a controversial topic in the design world.”When Raphaël Lozano, a 27-year-old graphic designer from France, started seeing all the reports about ChatGPT, he became interested in trying generative AI to see how it worked. But now it has become a constant companion in his work as a graphic designer for Founderholics GmbH, a food supplement company in Germany.“My life and work haven’t changed, but AI has modified the way I do things,” he said. AI tools have replaced some free websites and design programs he once used. It’s most helpful with the basics when he’s starting a new project. Lozano mostly uses ChatGPT, Dall-E and Leonardo AI. ChatGPT makes it easier for him to write narratives and define character personas for projects. He uses image-generating AI tools like Dall-E to provide inspiration, finalize images, create montages, enlarge photos and generate new ones.Lozano is the company’s sole graphic designer, but every day he sees more and more colleagues using ChatGPT for routine tasks like writing emails and newsletters. “It’s a controversial topic in the design world. Some people are totally against using AI programs because of issues like the unauthorized use of other people’s images.”Del HambreMarvin del Cid, photographer and audiovisual producer“I don’t think it makes us less creative. It makes us more efficient.”Marvin del Cid is a 49-year-old photographer, video producer and journalist from Guatemala who uses AI in every part of his work. He lives in the Dominican Republic and works as a freelancer for companies and media outlets such as Diario Libre, mostly on environmental topics. He uses AI platforms to correct and rewrite text, generate subtitles and even to get ideas for new projects. “When I’m not satisfied with what I’m writing, I use ChatGPT to shape the text. For example, it can give me suggestions for alternative approaches,” he said.Del Cid uses other platforms like Gigapixel to improve image quality when he only has low-resolution material available and to enhance old analog photos. “AI has made me more efficient by reducing the time to do many tasks. Subtitling videos now takes two days less time, and I can enhance voice quality in a podcast without having to go to a studio.”Eventually, most people in his line of work will incorporate AI into their processes to remain competitive, says del Cid. “I don’t think it makes us less creative. It makes us more efficient.” While he appreciates the usefulness of AI, del Cid believes there are ethical nuances to consider. “A documentary photograph can be improved but should never be modified.” Using editing tools like Topaz Labs, an old image can be fully restored.Del HambreAlexandra Daniel, English teacher“The kids will learn to use it like I did.”Alexandra Daniel didn’t know much about artificial intelligence until she started seeing stories about it everywhere. The 35-year-old teacher from Venezuela has lived for almost a decade in Buenos Aires and works as a private English tutor for children and teenagers. “When everyone suddenly started talking about the famous ChatGPT, I got very curious. At first, it’s intimidating to see how it responds to everything in great detail. I decided to learn how to use it well and realized it could help me with my work.”Daniel uses the tool for proofreading, creating homework assignments and summarizing topics for her students. She also believes it’s important to stay current with technological advances and keep pace with the young people she teaches. Daniel wants her students to see AI as a useful tool and not as a shortcut for doing homework. “Saying it’s bad and forbidding its use doesn’t make sense. They will learn to use it like I did.”Del HambreGoran Stipcich, data scientist“Everyone is talking about ChatGPT, but AI is much more than that.”Goran Stipcich has been fully immersed in the world of artificial intelligence for six years. The 42-year-old Croatian engineer with a PhD in applied mathematics heads the data science team at Wunderman Thompson, a multinational marketing firm. AI is “a vast world,” said Stipcich, and indispensable for his work. “It’s used in everything from analyzing data to measurement.”Stipcich uses it to produce more personalized marketing content, such as tailored internet ads based on individual user profiles. He applies AI algorithms to analyze cookie data (small blocks of data about a user created when browsing a website) and generates profiles for companies so their advertising is more relevant and targeted to individual customers. Stipcich is careful to clarify that they use anonymized data “without tracking or identifying any individual… AI covers many areas. Everyone is talking about ChatGPT, but AI is much more than that,” he said.Del HambreAzucena Vázquez, teacher training consultant“It saves me hours of time every day.”Asociación Espiral, Educación y Tecnología is a non-governmental organization (NGO) in Barcelona that trains college and high school teachers in how to use technology and digital innovation — including artificial intelligence — in the classroom. The NGO’s vice president, Azucena Vázquez, is a teacher who says AI tools save her hours of time every day with her administrative tasks.Vázquez creates educational plans and content related to digitization for teachers. “I use it [AI] to design educational materials for teachers… It’s useful because I can work on new things with the time saved on routine tasks.” For example, it saves her a lot of time producing subtitles for video tutorials: “All I have to do is review the video with the proposed subtitles, decide whether they’re okay, and edit them on the fly.” Vázquez says she always keeps up with technological advances and their potential use in the classroom.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

Will AI put people out of work? There will be pain, yes — just as there has been with other transformative technologies in the past. A few decades back, automated switching put many switchboard operators out of work. But I’ve heard it said that without such automation, every person in North America over the age of 18 would now be needed to staff manual switchboards to handle today’s telecom traffic. Increased efficiency means increased consumption and demand. AI is just as likely to displace manual tasks while also expanding opportunities — it’s a matter of embracing the changes it may bring.


Senthil Padmanabhan, vice president and technical fellow at eBay, confirms the current maxim that “AI won’t take away jobs, but people who use AI will.” While there may be concern about AI’s impact, “I’d suggest applying what’s called the Jevons paradox to generative AI,” he advises. “A boost in productivity will create more opportunities as new avenues open up. The size of the pie grows.”

What's important is “to be forward-thinking and use AI to gain an advantage over competitors,” says Denise Hemke, chief product officer at Checkr. “If there are AI tools in your industry, then do your best to master it and learn how you can use it to your benefit.”

AI is already “serving as a powerful support tool for professionals and managers, taking over repetitive, mundane tasks and delivering powerful, real-time data analysis,” says Barry Cooper, president of the CX Division at NICE. “AI will continue to take on some of the tasks previously done by humans, but it will also open new opportunities, new jobs that have yet to be created. Those that understand and work to integrate AI into their workflows will be better positioned for success in the years to come.”

Indeed, AI and associated technologies may take on more of the tasks of organizations, as well as people’s lives, but large workforces will be required to conceive, design, implement, train, and maintain these systems.

For today’s executives and professionals, the advantage will go to those who understand the potential of these systems, and how to apply technologies such as AI to improve their performance as well as that of their teams. Deep technical knowledge is not required. Business professionals “should focus on leveraging commercially available tools to augment their day-to-day work and unleash a new level of productivity only available to a few elite organizations or agencies,” Padmanabhan says. “For example, a task that took them ten days to complete in the past should now be able to be done in seven days with even higher quality. People who quickly adapt to the ever-evolving generative AI tooling will have an added advantage.”

Aside from generic routines such as organizing and optimizing tasks, “AI can also provide more specialized help for managers and executives,” says Hemke. “For example, AI can be used to help in areas such as decision-making, customer segmentation and loyalty programs.”
Cooper even predicts a new management role arising as AI emerges: “the VP of AI digital workforce.” This position “will be responsible for overseeing a team of AI digital assistants that serve as digital colleagues to their human counterparts. Human oversight will always be needed in the age of AI.”
For leaders in a budding AI environment, “instead of trying to do everything at once, choose a specific area in the organization where gen AI will make a difference and augment that workflow,” Padmanabhan advises. “And pay attention to how it evolves. The learnings and feedback you garner from what you focus on will be immensely valuable, which can help you pivot the organization on a path that will sustain long-term success.”
Generative AI can play a role in a range of tasks, from “answering customer support calls to writing marketing materials, creating designs, and writing code,” Padmanabhan adds. “Thus, every role or profession will feel the impact of generative AI. However, the impact can be positive if you use it as a tool to augment your job in order to become much more effective and efficient in a measurable way. On the other hand, if you produce the same output as generative AI, your position could be impacted.”
At this point, it’s tough to predict exactly what business or technical skills will stand out as AI grows, Padmanabhan says. But one skillset will always prevail: the ability to adapt and learn. “Distinguish yourself from the rest through creativity and learning,” he urges. “It becomes even more critical in the age of gen AI, where everyone has immediate access to above-average creativity. Imagine a world where everyone has access to generative AI tools — just as search engines or smartphones. If your skill is to produce the same output as a generative AI tool, the demand for that skill will go down. On the other hand, if you differentiate yourself by adding value on top of the base output, your skill will always be in demand.”
Employ generative AI “for augmentation rather than reproduction,” Padmanabhan advises. In addition, Hemke states, “I don't think that a manager or executive role could be put at risk of disruption due to AI. AI cannot develop real consciousness , basic social competencies, and strategic vision that are required for a manager or executive roles.”
There are still gaps “where AI cannot perform at the same level as a human — critical thinking, empathy and creativity,” Cooper agrees. “Less creative skills like memorization and recitation will be less important as AI takes over more repetitive, mundane tasks. In many places, AI will enable the elevation of occupations allowing people to be more efficient and more impactful in much less time than ever before.”

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a rapidly growing field in the Philippines and is predicted to make a significant contribution to the Philippines Economy by 2030. In January 2023, President Marcos signed the Philippines Development Plan for 2023-2028 which aims to “bring back the country to a high-growth trajectory and, more importantly, enable economic and social transformation for a prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society” and underscores AI as one of the key technologies that will be instrumental in achieving this.
Against this background, technology industry leaders have noted that AI is at an inflection point, with powerful new models like generative AI being introduced, and innovative new applications increasingly being used across society and capturing the imaginations of consumers. Generative AI has opened the door to more possibilities and is expected to play a role in tasks requiring creativity, curiosity, and looking at information differently. Therefore, the potential of generative AI lies in its ability to enable people to achieve greater creativity, effectiveness, and efficiency in their work.
This report seeks to contribute to this discussion by providing early insights and raising awareness of the economic opportunities that generative AI can create, and what it means for local industries and workforce readiness.
This study estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock USD79.3 billion of productive capacity in the Philippines, equivalent to one-fifth of GDP in 2022. The Philippines has an opportunity to better position its businesses and workers to unlock the potential of generative AI, as well as manage emerging risks. Policymakers will need to ensure that they have a clear national vision for AI, and that it focuses on preparing its workforce and establishing an enabling policy environment for AI adoption, including to answer the question “what is required to achieve the aspirations of a brighter future enabled by generative AI?”

When ChatGPT arrived in November 2022, it made mainstream the idea that generative artificial intelligence (genAI) could be used by companies and consumers to automate tasks, help with creative ideas, and even code software.
If you need to boil down an email or chat thread into a concise summary, a chatbot such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Bard can do that. If you need to spruce up your resume with more eloquent language and impressive bullet points, AI can help. Want some ideas for a new marketing or ad campaign? Generative AI to the rescue.
ChatGPT stands for chatbot generative pre-trained transformer. The chatbot’s foundation is the GPT large language model (LLM), a computer algorithm that processes natural language inputs and predicts the next word based on what it’s already seen. Then it predicts the next word, and the next word, and so on until its answer is complete.
 
 
 













 
 



 


In the simplest of terms, LLMs are next-word prediction engines.

Along with OpenAI’s GPT-3 and 4 LLM, popular LLMs include open models such as Google’s LaMDA and PaLM LLM (the basis for Bard), Hugging Face’s BLOOM and XLM-RoBERTa, Nvidia’s NeMO LLM, XLNet, Co:here, and GLM-130B.
Open-source LLMs, in particular, are gaining traction, enabling a cadre of developers to create more customizable models at a lower cost. Meta’s February launch of LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) kicked off an explosion among developers looking to build on top of open-source LLMs.
 
 
 













 
 

LLMs are a type of AI that are currently trained on a massive trove of articles, Wikipedia entries, books, internet-based resources and other input to produce human-like responses to natural language queries. That’s an immense amount of data. But LLMs are poised to shrink, not grow, as vendors seek to customize them for specific uses that don’t need the massive data sets used by today’s most popular models.
For example, Google’s new PaLM 2 LLM, announced earlier this month, uses almost five times more training data than its predecessor of just a year ago — 3.6 trillion tokens or strings of words, according to one report. The additional datasets allow PaLM 2 to perform more advanced coding, math, and creative writing tasks.

Training up an LLM right requires massive server farms, or supercomputers, with enough compute power to tackle billions of parameters.

So, what is an LLM?
An LLM is a machine-learning neuro network trained through data input/output sets; frequently, the text is unlabeled or uncategorized, and the model is using self-supervised or semi-supervised learning methodology. Information is ingested, or content entered, into the LLM, and the output is what that algorithm predicts the next word will be. The input can be proprietary corporate data or, as in the case of ChatGPT, whatever data it’s fed and scraped directly from the internet.
 
 
 













 
 

Training LLMs to use the right data requires the use of massive, expensive server farms that act as supercomputers.
LLMs are controlled by parameters, as in millions, billions, and even trillions of them. (Think of a parameter as something that helps an LLM decide between different answer choices.) OpenAI’s GPT-3 LLM has 175 billion parameters, and the company’s latest model – GPT-4 – is purported to have 1 trillion parameters.
For example, you could type into an LLM prompt window “For lunch today I ate….” The LLM could come back with “cereal,” or “rice,” or “steak tartare.” There’s no 100% right answer, but there is a probability based on the data already ingested in the model. The answer “cereal” might be the most probable answer based on existing data, so the LLM could complete the sentence with that word. But, because the LLM is a probability engine, it assigns a percentage to each possible answer. Cereal might occur 50% of the time, “rice” could be the answer 20% of the time, steak tartare .005% of the time.
 
 
 













 
 

“The point is it learns to do this,” said Yoon Kim, an assistant professor at MIT who studies Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. “It’s not like a human — a large enough training set will assign these probabilities.”
But beware — junk in, junk out. In other words, if the information an LLM has ingested is biased, incomplete, or otherwise undesirable, then the response it gives could be equally unreliable, bizarre, or even offensive. When a response goes off the rails, data analysts refer to it as “hallucinations,” because they can be so far off track.
“Hallucinations happen because LLMs, in their in most vanilla form, don’t have an internal state representation of the world,” said Jonathan Siddharth, CEO of Turing, a Palo Alto, California company that uses AI to find, hire, and onboard software engineers remotely. “There’s no concept of fact. They’re predicting the next word based on what they’ve seen so far — it’s a statistical estimate.”
 
 
 













 
 

Because some LLMs also train themselves on internet-based data, they can move well beyond what their initial developers created them to do. For example, Microsoft’s Bing uses GPT-3 as its basis, but it’s also querying a search engine and analyzing the first 20 results or so. It uses both an LLM and the internet to offer responses.
“We see things like a model being trained on one programming language and these models then automatically generate code in another programming language it has never seen,” Siddharth said. “Even natural language; it’s not trained on French, but it’s able to generate sentences in French.”
“It’s almost like there’s some emergent behavior. We don’t know quite know how these neural network works,” he added. “It’s both scary and exciting at the same time.”
 
 
 













 
 


Another problem with LLMs and their parameters is the unintended biases that can be introduced by LLM developers and self-supervised data collection from the internet.
Are LLMs biased?
For example, systems like ChatGPT are highly likely to provide gender-biased answers based on the data they’ve ingested from the internet and programmers, according to Sayash Kapoor, a Ph.D. candidate at Princeton University’s Center for Information Technology Policy.
“We tested ChatGPT for biases that are implicit — that is, the gender of the person is not obviously mentioned, but only included as information about their pronouns,” Kapoor said. “That is, if we replace “she” in the sentence with “he,” ChatGPT would be three times less likely to make an error.”
 
 
 













 
 

Innate biases can be dangerous, Kapoor said, if language models are used in consequential real-world settings. For example, if biased language models are used in hiring processes, they can lead to real-world gender bias.

Such biases are not a result of developers intentionally programming their models to be biased. But ultimately, the responsibility for fixing the biases rests with the developers, because they’re the ones releasing and profiting from AI models, Kapoor argued.
What is prompt engineering?
While most LLMs, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, are pre-filled with massive amounts of information, prompt engineering by users can also train the model for specific industry or even organizational use.
 
 
 













 
 

“Prompt engineering is about deciding what we feed this algorithm so that it says what we want it to,” MIT’s Kim said. “The LLM is a system that just babbles without any text context. In some sense of the term, an LLM is already a chatbot.”
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and optimizing text prompts for an LLM to achieve desired outcomes. Perhaps as important for users, prompt engineering is poised to become a vital skill for IT and business professionals.
Because prompt engineering is a nascent and emerging discipline, enterprises are relying on booklets and prompt guides as a way to ensure optimal responses from their AI applications. There are even marketplaces emerging for prompts, such as the 100 best prompts for ChatGPT.
 
 
 













 
 

Perhaps as important for users, prompt engineering is poised to become a vital skill for IT and business professionals, according to Eno Reyes, a machine learning engineer with Hugging Face, a community-driven platform that creates and hosts LLMs. Prompt engineers will be responsible for creating customized LLMs for business use.
How will LLMs become smaller, faster, and cheaper?
Today, chatbots based on LLMs are most commonly used “out of the box” as a text-based, web-chat interface. They’re used in search engines such as Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Bing (based on ChatGPT) and for automated online customer assistance. Companies can ingest their own datasets to make the chatbots more customized for their particular business, but accuracy can suffer because of the massive trove of data already ingested.
“What we’re discovering more and more is that with small models that you train on more data longer…, they can do what large models used to do,” Thomas Wolf, co-founder and CSO at Hugging Face, said while attending an MIT conference earlier this month. “I think we’re maturing basically in how we understand what’s happening there.
 
 
 













 
 

“There’s this first step where you try everything to get this first part of something working, and then you’re in the phase where you’re trying to…be efficient and less costly to run,” Wolf said. “It’s not enough to just scrub the whole web, which is what everyone has been doing. It’s much more important to have quality data.”
LLMs can cost from a couple of million dollars to $10 million to train for specific use cases, depending on their size and purpose.

When LLMs focus their AI and compute power on smaller datasets, however, they perform as well or better than the enormous LLMs that rely on massive, amorphous data sets. They can also be more accurate in creating the content users seek — and they’re much cheaper to train.
 
 
 













 
 

Eric Boyd, corporate vice president of AI Platforms at Microsoft, recently spoke at the MIT EmTech conference and said when his company first began working on AI image models with OpenAI four years ago, performance would plateau as the datasets grew in size. Language models, however, had far more capacity to ingest data without a performance slowdown.
Microsoft, the largest financial backer of OpenAI and ChatGPT, invested in the infrastructure to build larger LLMs. “So, we’re figuring out now how to get similar performance without having to have such a large model,” Boyd said. “Given more data, compute and training time, you are still able to find more performance, but there are also a lot of techniques we’re now learning for how we don’t have to make them quite so large and are able to manage them more efficiently.
“That’s super important because…these things are very expensive. If we want to have broad adoption for them, we’re going to have to figure how the costs of both training them and serving them,” Boyd said.
 
 
 













 
 

For example, when a user submits a prompt to GPT-3, it must access all 175 billion of its parameters to deliver an answer. One method for creating smaller LLMs, known as sparse expert models, is expected to reduce the training and computational costs for LLMs, “resulting in massive models with a better accuracy than their dense counterparts,” he said.

Researchers from Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) believe sparse models can achieve performance similar to that of ChatGPT and other massive LLMs using “a fraction of the compute.”
“For models with relatively modest compute budgets, a sparse model can perform on par with a dense model that requires almost four times as much compute,” Meta said in an October 2022 research paper.
Smaller models are already being released by companies such as Aleph Alpha, Databricks, Fixie, LightOn, Stability AI, and even Open AI. The more agile LLMs have between a few billion and 100 billion parameters.
 
 
 













 
 


Privacy, security issues still abound
While many users marvel at the remarkable capabilities of LLM-based chatbots, governments and consumers cannot turn a blind eye to the potential privacy issues lurking within, according to Gabriele Kaveckyte, privacy counsel at cybersecurity company Surfshark.
For example, earlier this year, Italy became the first Western nation to ban further development of ChatGPT over privacy concerns. It later reversed that decision, but the initial ban occurred after the natural language processing app experienced a data breach involving user conversations and payment information.
“While some improvements have been made by ChatGPT following Italy’s temporary ban, there is still room for improvement,” Kaveckyte said. “Addressing these potential privacy issues is crucial to ensure the responsible and ethical use of data, fostering trust, and safeguarding user privacy in AI interactions.”
Kaveckyte analyzed ChatGPT’s data collection practices, for instance, and developed a list of potential flaws: it collected a massive amount of personal data to train its models, but may have had no legal basis for doing so; it didn’t notify all of the people whose data was used to train the AI model; it’s not always accurate; and it lacks effective age verification tools to prevent children under 13 from using it.
Along with those issues, other experts are concerned there are more basic problems LLMs have yet to overcome — namely the security of data collected and stored by the AI, intellectual property theft, and data confidentiality.
“For a hospital or a bank to be able to use LLMs, we’re doing to have to solve [intellectual property], security, [and] confidentiality issues,” Turing’s Siddharth said. “There are good engineering solutions for some of these. And I think those will get solved, but those need to be solved in order for them to be used in enterprises. Companies don’t want to use an LLM in a context where it uses the company’s data to help deliver better results to a competitor.”
Not surprisingly, a number of nations and government agencies around the globe have launched efforts to deal with AI tools, with China being the most proactive so far. Among those efforts:

China has already rolled out several initiatives for AI governance, though most of those initiatives relate to citizen privacy and not necessarily safety.
The Biden administration in the US unveiled AI rules to address safety and privacy built on previous attempts to promote some form of responsible innovation, though to date Congress has not advanced any laws that would regulate AI. In October 2022, the administration unveiled a blueprint for an “AI Bill of Rights” and an AI Risk Management Framework and more recently pushed for a National AI Research Resource.
The Group of Seven (G7) nations recentlty called for the creation of technical standards to keep AI in check, saying its evolution has outpaced oversight for safety and security.
And the European Union is putting the finishing touches on legislation that would hold accountable companies that create generative AI platforms like ChatGPT that can take the content they generate from unnamed sources.

Managing communications has become quite the juggling act. Each passing year throws in a new challenge, whether that be keeping up with audience interests, navigating tough economic conditions or even defusing an unexpected brand crisis.
There’s been a lot of discussion around the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing and communications and for good reason: AI has the potential to reshape the corporate communications landscape. Corporate communications teams have become responsible for safeguarding their brand from potential misfires caused by AI technology. However, knowing where to begin in assessing the risks and benefits can be challenging.
Rachelle Bedell, Communications and Engagement Manager for the City of Gilroy, CA, has been experimenting with generative AI as she develops content to build connections between Gilroy’s local government and its 60,000 residents.
We spoke to Bedell about her big takeaways on the benefits and drawbacks of using AI in communications roles. In this guide, we’ll cover her tips, along with more advice on how communications leaders can empower their teams to use this technology with confidence.

                            Try a Demo of Sprout Social's AI and Automation Tools
                        
                        Sprout’s AI and automation inherits your manual work in publishing, listening, analytics and customer care so your team can prioritize the decision-making no machine can emulate.
                    Published on 
What can communications teams do with AI?
Many people claim that AI can increase your team’s productivity, but is there any evidence to support this? According to Bedell, there is.
“Not only does it make us more efficient, it makes us go further,” says Bedell. “It’s like the invention of the graphing calculator for math. We don’t have to sit around and add numbers with paper and a pencil anymore. Instead, we can take what it provides and do so much more.”
But what does “more” look like exactly? Here are three practical corporate communications applications that can help your team save time.
Streamline content ideation and creation
Coommunications professionals not only have to come up with creative, compelling brand messaging, they also have to tailor that message for specific channels, audiences and events. Meeting the right person with the right message at the right time is only getting harder.
Luckily, AI is here to help.
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT can’t provide you with ready-to-publish content: There’s still a lot of ambiguity around whether AI-generated content is protected under copyright law. To safeguard your business, it’s important to customize the final output with your brand’s distinctive tone. This will ensure a personal touch that maintains your brand’s image.
“I use it most often for rewrites,” says Bedell. “I’ll ask for ideas on how to rephrase content so it’s more engaging or so that it drives a specific action, then I evaluate its response and refine from there.”
AI-powered tools can give you a new perspective and spark creativity, guiding you in the right direction without having to wait for inspiration to strike. To maximize the efficiency of a tool, we need to master the art of writing an AI prompt or query so that the tool can pick the exact aspects of what needs to be delivered.
“It’s a great starting point for creative ideas,” says Bedell. “For example, I’m working on the city’s annual Pride Month campaign. We’ve done campaigns in the past where we’ve explored the symbolism of the Pride flag, and another where we highlighted important historical figures of the movement, but this year I wanted to do something different. I asked ChatGPT to generate some ideas and dove in from there.”
At Sprout, our communications team employs generative AI to develop creative titles for press releases and media pitches. A simple prompt like “Write 3-4 press release headline variations related to X, Y, and Z” can return valuable starting points for further refinement.

Collect social insights
Audience insights are the foundation of better brand positioning. With AI, communications teams can gain a deeper understanding of the customer’s mind through social media sentiment analysis.
Sentiment analysis tools use machine learning to gather information about consumer attitudes and assess their emotional state. In communications, these insights are commonly used to sharpen media pitches, messaging and executive comms.
For example, the Indiana University marketing and communications team relies on insights from Sprout’s Social Listening tool to stay up-to-date on campus conversations and get ahead of potential crises. These insights allow them to take proactive measures toward managing their reputation online.

At Sprout, we’re committed to building on this technology with a series of new AI features across the platform. We’re combining the power of our proprietary machine learning and automation capabilities with OpenAI’s GPT model. The new features will be available throughout the Sprout platform, starting with additions to listening, publishing, customer care and advocacy.
Gain a global advantage
Multilingual sentiment analysis uses native language machine learning to gather meaningful sentiment data from content across several languages. These tools capture the nuances specific to each language’s unique grammar rules.
These insights strengthen communications efforts geared toward non-English audiences, allowing you to build a brand that serves the diverse needs of your audience. For communications professionals like Bedell, such insights can ensure that all audiences receive messages that are both effective and equitable.
“California just passed a state-wide law allowing sidewalk vendors,” says Bedell. “Now, we’re changing our processes to accommodate state law. That includes creating ways to make the permit accessible to both our English- and Spanish-speaking populations.”
In the future, Bedell could use multilingual sentiment analysis to ground this work in data gathered from Spanish speakers in the region. This would help her create a more personalized message that reflects how residents are discussing the issue.
How communications teams can mitigate risks when working with AI
AI will undoubtedly transform the field of communications, but the professionals behind the screen are irreplaceable.
“The other day I saw a headline that said communications teams will eventually be replaced by AI,” says Bedell. “I knew it had to come from someone who isn’t currently working in communications. There’s too much nuance in the role for it to be fully automated. The tech isn’t there yet.”
On top of that, there’s a foundational communication skill that will always need a human touch: relationship-building.
“I don’t think people realize how much relationship-building goes into communications,” says Bedell. “It’s half the battle. The success of our content is dependent on our relationships with downtown businesses, the public health department—the list goes on.”
Instead of asking whether AI will replace our jobs, we should consider how it will transform them. The collaboration between AI and communication professionals creates a path toward a future where technology enhances human creativity, insight and productivity, redefining what’s possible for individuals at every level.
However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the risks associated with adopting AI. Finding the right balance between AI and human effort is key to achieving the best outcomes. As you embrace AI’s potential in communications, it’s important to understand and address the risks that come with it.

Double-check everything
Professionals who use text-based generative AI solutions should be cautious of potential avenues for misinformation, like “chatbot hallucinations” or faulty claims.
Bedell has experienced these issues firsthand. “I’ve had times where I’ve asked ChatGPT to share its sources and it hasn’t always worked out. Once, when I was looking for a source for an example it included, it told me that it didn’t realize I wanted a real example and had included a hypothetical option instead.”
When using AI-generated content, it’s crucial to ensure its accuracy and originality by reviewing it thoroughly. Always ask for sources from AI-powered assistants, and take the time to verify their validity. These steps are essential for maintaining your brand’s safety and avoiding potential crises.
Prioritize data security
Speaking of crises, any comms pro will tell you that even a mild data security mishap can be an absolute nightmare.
Communication teams aren’t responsible for setting the rules around how and why teams use AI. They will, however, have to deal with any fallout that occurs if an employee shares confidential information with an AI tool, creating an unfortunate privacy issue.
“You have to have conversations with legal and technical teams to understand the pitfalls your organization may face when working with AI,” says Bedell. “It’s important to find safe ways to let your employees leverage this type of tool.”
At Sprout, we’re prioritizing the security of our data and intellectual property by educating our teams on safe usage of generative AI. To ensure responsible use, our legal and IT teams worked together to create a policy outlining approved and prohibited use cases.
The policy is concise and straightforward, even for individuals with limited experience using AI tools. This helps busy teams navigate changes more easily, even with the rapid developments of generative AI.
Embrace experimentation
There are risks that come with using AI. That said, not using AI also presents risks of its own.
Bedell broke it down like this: “On one hand, you have companies that are embracing AI. On the other, there are companies that have chosen to prohibit its use entirely because it’s too new. I understand being concerned about the risk, but I feel like they’re missing a huge opportunity to let their people learn how to truly leverage it.”
Artificial intelligence is here to stay. We’ll continue to find more applications for AI in communications, media and PR. To avoid falling behind, it is essential to encourage your team to experiment frequently with AI technology.
Harnessing the power of AI in communications
Artificial intelligence can be a powerful ally in the ever-evolving world of corporate communication. When we combine AI with human expertise, we open ourselves up to a new era of communication that allows professionals to connect, resonate and drive success at scale.

When ChatGPT kicked off a generative AI frenzy in November, 2022, companies quickly took note of its massive potential to increase work productivity. There's ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard that are all free, standalone AI chatbots to be used for general purposes (to varying degrees of success). But then there are generative AI tools that get integrated into the work software you already use. Because they can access emails, CRMs, documents, and other work-related info (still getting used to that), generative AI tools for work can basically function as your personal assistant. Thanks to large language models like GPT-4, these tools can summarize and explain text, draft copy, compose emails, transcribe meetings, create agendas and notes, and even analyze spreadsheet data.

All the AI announcements from Google I/O 2023



That said, the common theme amongst tech companies recently is to make a huge splashy announcement about some transformative new AI tool...accompanied by only a vague timeline of availability. However, we've finally reached a moment when they're starting to roll out. We've compiled a list of the major generative AI tools that are live or soon to be live, and how to get access. But before you attempt to automate your entire worklife, it's important to know your company's policies on third party app usage, its stance on AI in general, and the relevant laws, regulations, and disclosure requirements. It's also important to drill down on some of the fine print, so there'll be no surprises about how the information you share with generative AI tools is stored and used. With all that out of the way, here's what's on offer:Microsoft 365 CopilotAfter Microsoft announced the new Bing powered by GPT-4, it swiftly followed up with Copilot, which uses large language models to automate tasks within its portfolio of work apps including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. With Copilot, users can use generative AI to draft text in Word, create slideshows in PowerPoint from a simple prompt, and analyze data in Excel to generate charts and graphs. In Outlook, Copilot can summarize email threads and compose emails, and in Teams it can create summaries of meetings in real time if you're running late and need to catch up on what you missed.

Currently, Copilot is only available to enterprises via an invitation-only paid preview program. Microsoft says it plans to expand access over time, but doesn't give specifics on exactly when.
Google Duet AIGoogle went hard on generative AI announcements at I/O, its annual developers conference. The company is rolling out a collection of tools for its Workspace apps called Duet AI. In Gmail and Docs, users can click the ""Help me write"" icon and ask the tool to help compose an email or write a draft of something like a job description. In Gmail, Duet AI can understand the context of an email you received, and calibrate your response to be shorter, more elaborate, or formal. 
Google Slides now has an image generator tool, where you can create visuals from a text prompt like ""woman laughing alone with salad"" for a presentation on the history of women in memes in Google Sheets.
Duet AI can also automatically organize data within a spreadsheet and design a custom plan for managing projects with a prompt like ""roster of attendees for pickleball tournament.""
For now, Duet AI tools are only available, or soon to be available, in a testing environment called Labs. Currently, only trusted testers have access to Labs, but you can sign up for the waitlist for when Google rolls out access more broadly.Zoom IQ Not to be outdone by Microsoft Teams, Zoom launched some of its own AI-powered features for video conferencing. Zoom IQ, which is the name for Zoom's collection of smart tools, now has the ability to summarize meetings in real time, powered by OpenAI's API. Zoom IQ can also kick off brainstorming sessions based on text prompts in its whiteboard tool, summarize conversations from Zoom chats, draft emails based on those conversations, and write up an agenda for future meetings about that topic. Zoom IQ chat, and Zoom's AI email composition and meeting summarization features will be available to paid subscribers and as a free trial in the coming weeks. 




Zoom can compose contextualized responses to conversations.

Slack GPTChatGPT's summarizing and analyzing skills have entered the Slack channel. A ChatGPT plugin for Slack is already available as a bot that that you can tag and ask to summarize or draft messages. But soon, Slack GPT will have natively embedded summarization and text generation within Slack's existing features. Instead of tagging a bot, you can summarize unread messages in a channel with the click of a button, or click the star icon in the toolbar to compose or refine a message. Slack GPT can also automatically transcribe Huddles into notes. Slack GPT will be released later this year. 
GrammarlyGO Grammarly is already a popular grammar app, and now it is expanding beyond grammar and spell-checking to actually writing the thing for you. GrammarlyGO exists within its apps and browser extensions as a new tool that can generate text, refine existing text for tone, and help you brainstorm ideas with simple prompts. Grammarly Business is also rolling out new features in June that include email composition and summarization that can be integrated into Gmail and Slack. GrammarlyGO is available now and free to use for up to 100 prompts per month. Paid plans will get you more prompts and more writing assistance.

Enforcement of New York City’s Artificial Intelligence Rule Begins July 5, 2023: Here’s What Employers Need to Know

 Listen to this post




Just after the fireworks’ finale, New York City’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection will begin enforcing its new ordinance regulating the use of automation and artificial intelligence in employment decisions. The DCWP recently issued a Notice of Adoption of Final Rule establishing that enforcement efforts will begin July 5, 2023.
Here are three reasons this matters

The new law requires time-sensitive, significant actions (read: audits, notices and public reporting) from employers using automated employment decisions tools to avoid civil penalties;
Company compliance will require a cross-functional response immediately, so it’s time to get your ducks in a row; and
Since the City’s law is (mostly) first-of-its-kind, it is likely a harbinger of things to come for employers across the country and it could be used as a framework in other cities and states.

The law in a nutshell
Local Law 144 prohibits employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates. Violations of the provisions of the law are subject to a civil penalty.

What is an automated employment decision tool?
The law defines AEDTs as “any computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons.” It provides that the only “employment decisions” it covers involve hiring and promotion.
Significantly, the definition does not include a “a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software, calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.”
The phrase “to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means:

To rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other factors considered; or
To use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted more than any other criterion in the set; or
To use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including human decision-making.

Simply put, the law likely covers any automatic tool or algorithm-based software program used to identify, select, evaluate, or recruit candidates for employment. Likewise, any data-driven tools used to review CVs, conduct skills testing, rank applicants, assess employee performance and productivity, or determine promotion likely fall within the scope of the law as well.
What are the new obligations for employers?
Essentially the law requires three actions from employers before using an AEDT: (1) annual bias audits, (2) publication of the results, and (3) notice to employees or candidates.

Bias Audits: The law requires a bias audit to calculate an AEDT’s selection rate for race/ethnicity and sex categories, and to compare selection rates to determine an impact ratio. A “bias audit” is defined as “an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor” to assess the tool’s potential “disparate impact” on sex, race, and ethnicity. The final rules clarify the requisite calculations for a bias audit in detail.
Published Results: Before using an AEDT, employers must make the following information publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which must include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories; and,
The distribution date of the AEDT.


Notice: Employers must provide candidates for employment or promotion with notice 10 business days before use of the tool:

That an AEDT is being used in assessing and evaluating the candidate;
The job qualifications and characteristics the AEDT will use in its analysis;
If not disclosed elsewhere on its website, the AEDT’s data source, type, and the employer’s data retention policy; and
That a candidate may request an alternative selection process or accommodation.



Notice may be provided by a single clear and conspicuous notice on the employment section of the employer’s website, in a job posting, or by way of US mail or e-mail to the candidate.
Penalties
Employers who violate the law are liable for a civil penalty of $375 for the first violation (and each additional violation occurring on the first day of the first violation). Each subsequent violation (or default, if the violation is left uncorrected) occurring after the first day will result in a civil penalty of at least $500 and not more than $1,500. Each failure to meet applicant notice requirements constitutes a separate violation. Failure to meet the “bias audit” requirements results in separate, daily violations.
Next steps for NYC employers
The first (and immediate) step is to take inventory of HR tech tools. Legal should partner with HR and IT to determine whether the company uses AEDTs to make any employment decisions. This will require evaluating the technology that comprises the tool, as well as how and for what purposes the tool is used. 
Next, the company will need to commission an independent bias audit and publish a summary of the results. Thereafter the company must provide notice to applicants and employees of the tool’s use and functioning, and provide notice that affected individuals may request an accommodation or alternative selection process.
Beyond NYC, consider the broader implications
Just as employers are increasingly relying on AI to assist with screening candidates, as well as making hiring and promotion decisions, state legislators are growing wary of the potential for discriminatory adverse impact. Both Illinois and Maryland have enacted laws that require employers to disclose to job applicants if their job candidacies will be evaluated by AI tools and mandate that the employers seek prior consent from the candidates for such use.
In California, the Civil Rights Council has proposed modifications to the state’s employment regulations to incorporate the use of AI in connection with employment decision-making. Essentially, the regulations would make it unlawful for employers to use a selection criteria (e.g. an automated decision tool) if it has an adverse impact on, or constitutes disparate treatment of, applicants or employees under California’s civil rights law. Additionally, California legislators are debating AB 331, which would require “deployers” of automated decision tools to conduct “impact assessments.” (Sounds familiar, right?) 
The federal government is itching to jump into the fray as well. Last fall, the White House released a “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights,” outlining several considerations regarding the use of automated decision-making tools and AI in the employment context. And on May 18, the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission released new guidance for employers on the use of artificial intelligence in employment, focusing on adverse impact under Title VII. (Read more here.) 
Needless to say, the regulatory landscape around the use of AI in employment decision-making is rapidly evolving. Stay tuned to the Employer Report as we continue to monitor developments in this space, or contact a member of our team for support drafting policies and requisite notices.

With the advent of ChatGPT, Google Bard, Midjourney and Canva’s magic features, artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming an integral part of our everyday lives, transforming industries and reshaping the way we work, learn and communicate. This rapid technological advancement highlights the importance of incorporating AI education into the curriculum not only to ensure that all students are well-equipped for their academic futures but also for workforce development.
With that in mind, it is crucial to consider underrepresented populations as these students are typically left out of the newest technological advancements.
AI Support for Teaching
AI has the potential to revolutionize the education sector by enhancing learning experiences, supporting teachers and offering more personalized learning opportunities for students. We must equip teachers with the knowledge and strategies they will need to use this new technology to improve and streamline everyday processes as well as classroom implementation.
Some areas in which AI can transform the classroom include personalized learning, ideation, adaptive learning, special needs education, bilingual education, gamification and immersive learning.
Personalized learning involves AI-powered systems that analyze students’ learning styles, strengths and weaknesses to create tailored lesson plans and suggest resources to serve their individual needs.
Adaptive learning platforms can adjust to each student’s progress in real-time, identifying gaps in knowledge, providing immediate feedback, and suggesting targeted interventions to help students master the material. AI can also help teachers automate administrative tasks, enabling them to focus more on instruction and student interaction.
Furthermore, AI-powered virtual tutors can provide round-the-clock support to students, while customized learning solutions can empower students with special needs to reach their full potential. Gamification and immersive learning experiences can make education more engaging, fun and memorable.
AI-driven language translation tools can break down communication barriers, enabling students and educators from different countries or with different languages to collaborate on projects and learn from one another.
All means all. Teaching students about AI is essential for developing digital literacy, critical thinking skills, and preparing students for future academic and career success. A basic understanding of AI systems enables students to engage and ideate with AI technologies safely, responsibly and ethically. Learning about AI also encourages students to analyze and evaluate question structure, complex information, question assumptions and consider the ethical implications of AI technology usage.
Moreover, AI is transforming the job market, with increasing demand for professionals skilled in AI and related fields. Teaching students about AI can help them develop the knowledge and skills needed to pursue careers in technology, data science and other in-demand industries. AI learning can inspire students to generate ideas and solutions, fostering creativity and innovation – essential skills in today’s competitive and evolving job market.
It is particularly important to not exclude AI education from underrepresented student populations. In fact, it is vital to integrate diversity, equity and inclusion within this domain to ensure that a broad perspective of values are embraced to combat digital bias and discrimination.
Providing students with access to AI education can help close opportunity gaps, ensure they have the skills and knowledge to compete in the global workforce, and create a more diverse pool of talent in AI and related fields. This diversity can lead to better problem-solving, creativity and innovation in the development of AI technologies and solutions.
AI education can empower underrepresented communities to leverage technologies for social good and drive positive change in their local and global contexts. Lastly, ensuring underrepresented populations are well-versed in AI positions them to contribute to policymaking and decision-making processes, shaping the rules and regulations governing AI applications.
Risks of Excluding Students from AI Education
Excluding any student group – either deliberately or by neglect – from learning how to leverage artificial intelligence can lead to several negative consequences, both for individuals and society at large. Following are some of the dangers associated with excluding students from AI education.
Digital divide – Excluding students from learning about AI can contribute to the digital divide, as they may not have the knowledge and skills needed to navigate AI-driven technologies in their daily lives. This can hinder their ability to access information, participate in the digital economy and engage with online communities effectively.
Biased AI systems – AI systems often are trained on data collected from human behavior, which can contain biases. For example, facial recognition originally was designed exclusively with white faces because the developers were not diverse. Excluding diverse perspectives from the development and design of AI systems can perpetuate or amplify existing biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes for certain groups of people.
Wider skills gap – As AI becomes increasingly important in various industries, the demand for professional skills in using AI will grow dramatically. Excluding students from AI education can exacerbate the skills gap, making it more difficult for businesses and organizations to find the diverse talent they need to thrive in the AI-driven economy.
Economic inequality – Students who lack AI education may find it more challenging to secure well-paying jobs as many traditional roles may be automated or significantly transformed by AI. This can lead to increased economic inequality and limit social mobility for those who are not adequately prepared for the AI-driven job market.
Loss of creativity and innovation – A diverse workforce in AI and related fields leads to more creative problem-solving and innovative solutions. By excluding certain students from AI education, we risk losing the valuable insights and ideas that they could bring to the development of AI technologies.
Ethical concerns – As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, it is essential to have a diverse group of professionals involved in the development and regulation of AI systems to ensure ethical considerations are taken into account. Excluding students from learning about AI may result in a lack of diverse perspectives, leading to potential ethical issues and unintended consequences. It also leaves students unprepared to navigate ethical dilemmas.
To mitigate these dangers, it is essential to promote equitable access to AI education for all students, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. This will help to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from the advancements in AI and contribute to a more inclusive and just society.

Amid all the talk about AI replacing creative workers in the future, there's perhaps not enough talk about the creative tools it's replacing here in the present: Instagram influencers brainstorming post ideas with group chats, notes apps, crumpled paper and scattered Post-It notes. With AI taking over the role of idea generators, the creative process is evolving rapidly. That's because, for all their weaknesses, when it comes to the tasks associated with the sometimes-brutal work of idea-generation, AI applications have already saved creators from the headache-inducing glare of the dreaded blank page.  Luca Schaefer-Charlton, a Canadian TikToker with 6.7 million followers, Johnny Valentine, an American TikToker with 7.3 million followers, and Essex-born reality TV star Chloe Veitch were all in London for an event when their management decided it'd be a good idea for the three to collaborate. Schaefer-Charlton and Valentine have an online following that Veitch could benefit from, and Veitch has relevancy that Schaefer-Charlton and Valentine could benefit from. ""It just made a ton of sense,"" Jeff Duncan, CEO of the talent agency Ingenuity Live that represents all three of the influencers, told Mashable. He set them up in a WhatsApp chat and suggested that they ""build some content together."" Schaefer-Charlton, Valentine, and Veitch were all down, but they didn't know what kind of content they should make together.

""I sat there in front of the WhatsApp channel for a few minutes, and I was trying to come up with some concepts that made sense,"" Duncan said. But he felt he was wasting time creating these concepts himself — and took it to ChatGPT instead.Duncan gave ChatGPT some context about all three creators and asked the generative AI tech to come up with social media content for the three creators to make, focusing on the results: ""bridging followers from one creator to the next, and creating viral strategies that will have the highest chance of getting the most views."" The 20-or-so ideas ChatGPT sent him — like working with musical buskers to create new TikTok videos or competing in a street art scavenger hunt — were ""awesome."" He sent the ideas to Schaefer-Charlton, Valentine, and Veitch, and the trio used the ChatGPT responses to craft multiple videos for their channels.""That was a perfect example of using AI in order to make the content strategy smarter and give some ideas to them,"" Duncan said. ""If you can give artificial intelligence some level of understanding as to what you're trying to accomplish, the content creators can use it in order to make themselves more effective in what they're trying to do.""Influencers and their teams are already using generative AI — a type of artificial intelligence that produces content, like ChatGPT and Midjourney. It has the potential to revolutionize the creator economy and its two million full-time creators and 46 million amateurs. Generative AI can be an incredibly helpful — and powerful — tool. For now, creators and creator marketers use it predominantly for creative ideation, like Duncan did for his talent. How creators use generative AIThere are two main types of generative AI that are being used online right now: text-focused, and visual-focused. More text-focused generative AI, like ChatGPT, is used exactly for what Duncan did with Schaefer-Charlton, Valentine, and Veitch. Using image generators to create ideas might seem like a less obvious use of AI, but they're actually making a huge impact.

Jordan Harrod, a research scientist, graduate student at Harvard and MIT, and creator who runs a YouTube channel about artificial intelligence, told Mashable that she's been using Midjourney and other visual-focused generative AI tools to help her ideate on an image idea that she doesn't have the ability to draw herself. She doesn't use the entire Midjourney image, but will use it as a starting point. There are also generative AI tools like Opus that will take a longer video — like a YouTube video — and turn it into shorter clips for TikTok or Instagram Reels.

""The thing that I see not being very useful is a lot of the discourse around generating content wholesale. Like 'I'm never going to film a video again because I'm just gonna generate the whole thing using AI and it's gonna go viral,'"" Harrod joked. ""First of all, I haven't seen a lot of tools that are actually good at that. Second of all, if you're going into the creative space, you're doing it because you have ideas and you want to create them, and you're looking for tools that can help you do that. Not because you're trying to just generate as much content time as physically possible.""Dave Wiskus, the founder and CEO of Nebula, a streaming service for creators, told Mashable that this tech has the potential to make content creation more accessible.  Beyond idea creation, Wiskus sees use of ChatGPT and Midjourney to be a set of creative starter tools that will set creators up for success if they have raw talent that may once not have been put to use.  ""Autotune didn't destroy singing: It only made people with a different kind of creativity more likely to find a good way to express that creativity,"" Wiskus said. ""Photoshop didn't ruin photography. It just made it so that more people could get into photography; it made photography more accessible so that we could get better art from more artists. I think that AI, at least as we understand these tools today, will give the same effect.""The simple answer to how generative AI affects the creator economy, or any job, really, is that it saves you time. None of these tools are perfect, yet. That's why Duncan encourages his clients to use it for everything they can — from finding recipes to getting movie recommendations — to get to know what it does well and what it doesn't do well.""For now, my suggestion to every content creator has been: You have to become the master of what currently exists,"" Duncan said. ""Because you don't want to start from ground zero when the new product comes out.""The pitfallsCurrently, generative AI is still pretty stupid. It's not great at producing complex videos, streamlining the process of creator identification, writing anything well on the first go, or even coming up with completely original ideas. And, of course, there are copyright issues. And there's a fear that, because so many creators are being encouraged to use AI, they'll all have the same creative ideas.Rem Darbinyan, who works both in the AI world and the influencer marketing world as the CEO of SmartClick, an AI and machine learning solutions provider, and Viral Mango, a micro- and nano-influencer marketing platform, told Mashable that generative AI is an ""amazing tool"" for creators, but if everyone starts using it in similar ways, it could affect the way creators come up with new ideas.

""I'm expecting that it's gonna be some kind of erosion of human creativity,"" Darbinyan said. He worries that instead of exercising our creative muscles, we'll start using tools like ChatGPT as a crutch. ""Over time, the more we rely on AI, the less creative we're going to become and more we're going to rely on AI to generate ideas.""Darbinyan added that, of course, we don't know for sure. These tools are incredibly new, but creativity is simply something we should consider. Wiskus, for his part, isn't entirely sure that this kind of AI actually will hurt human creativity — it might just change it.""The most likely scenario isn't that AI destroys human creativity,"" Wiskus said. ""It's going to be that humans — creative humans — find new ways to use new tools to express that creativity.""The future of generative AI and the creator economyIt's pretty inarguable that generative AI is having a strong impact on the creator economy today, but it's unclear if its impact will grow stronger or stay stagnant. Generative AI, in the way we know and use it today, is relatively new. ChatGPT was only officially launched on November 30, 2022, the data that powers it is only updated through 2021, and, as OpenAI admits, it has limitations including ""social biases, hallucinations, and adversarial prompts."" With each new update, those limitations will likely decrease.Despite the potential drawbacks, using generative AI saves time, opens up creators to new ideas and approaches, and, at its core, is pretty fun to play around with if you're a creator. Schaefer-Charlton, Valentine, and Veitch told Duncane they had a lot of fun creating the videos ChatGPT helped them ideate on.Duncan said he doesn't know which of the many ChatGPT-fueled concepts the three creators ultimately chose to record, and they haven't posted all of the content they took with each other yet. But he says the process presented a perfect example of how creators can work with AI to ""make themselves more effective in what they're trying to do."" The creators who refuse to use these tools could risk being overtaken by creators who do use AI tools. But it's important to remember that this is new, it's unexplored, and, despite all the fascinating work it can do, AI isn't a replacement for anything truly meaningful yet.""We have no idea what's actually gonna happen,"" Harrod said. ""Five months ago, no one would have predicted what is happening right now. It's just very much a moving target to try to make predictions on these types of things.""For now, Harrod and other creators are just playing around with the tools and seeing what they can create.

Accenture has identified five broad areas where generative AI can be implemented – advising, creating, automation, software creation and protection.Ghosh said that Accenture was working with a global broadcast company to explore how generative AI can help scale the industry through deeper and personalized experiences to drive audience engagement and growth. It is also working with a multinational bank to use generative AI to route large numbers of post-trade processing emails and draft responses with recommended actions to reduce manual effort and risk.Accenture has set up a Generative AI and LLM (large language model) Centre of Excellence (CoE), with 1600 employees, a large part of which is in India. There are another 40,000 employees trained in deep artificial intelligence who work with this team. “It hosts the incubation and scale up engine for capability building, innovation, assets, solutions, and delivery. It is building the talent architecture, assessing the skill sets needed and how we need to shift ourselves to working in the new space. A large part of the COE is in India, and it also includes a Generative AI Academy based in India that is responsible for driving the skilling agenda,” said Ghosh.Ghosh expects generative AI implementation projects to pick up further over the next two-three years. “It will help companies define the new performance frontier with this power of generative AI.

He added that even as Accenture, and its customers, are both excited about the potential of using generative AI, large language models and generative AI cannot be applied to every practice. Internally, the company has identified over 300 use cases where generative AI can have a tangible impact. This is across aspects like service delivery, consulting and technology, taking a foundation model and training it with internal data to create a private model for the company.The company is seeing early adopters in the financial services, retail and government sectors start trial projects, he said and added that cost would also be a factor in determining how fast enterprises would adopt these tools.  The potential to unlock the transformative power of AI ranges from unlocking the power of creativity, driving technology transformation through intelligent automation powered by AI and empowering human and AI collaboration, said Ghosh.     100574814Also read | IT clients push for generative AI-based solutions to drive productivityHowever, given that it’s still early days, one needs to be careful. “There are issues related to hallucinations – sometimes it just gives you the wrong answer,” said Ghosh. “We believe generative AI is not the solution for everything in the enterprise,” he said. Accenture has identified five broad areas where generative AI can be implemented – advising, creating, automation, software creation and protection.Ghosh said that Accenture was working with a global broadcast company to explore how generative AI can help scale the industry through deeper and personalized experiences to drive audience engagement and growth. It is also working with a multinational bank to use generative AI to route large numbers of post-trade processing emails and draft responses with recommended actions to reduce manual effort and risk.Accenture has set up a Generative AI and LLM (large language model) Centre of Excellence (CoE), with 1600 employees, a large part of which is in India. There are another 40,000 employees trained in deep artificial intelligence who work with this team. “It hosts the incubation and scale up engine for capability building, innovation, assets, solutions, and delivery. It is building the talent architecture, assessing the skill sets needed and how we need to shift ourselves to working in the new space. A large part of the COE is in India, and it also includes a Generative AI Academy based in India that is responsible for driving the skilling agenda,” said Ghosh.Ghosh expects generative AI implementation projects to pick up further over the next two-three years. “It will help companies define the new performance frontier with this power of generative AI. It will unlock the creativity of these people, human and AI working together will come to a new level,” he said. What’s needed are responsible AI guidelines, which are extremely important for any company to adopt AI within the organisation.On data privacy concerns, Ghosh said that Accenture has a responsible AI practice where it works with clients on creating an overarching artificial intelligence strategy which is the first step towards having a responsible AI framework.
