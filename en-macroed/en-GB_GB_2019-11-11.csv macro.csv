Just when we thought it was safe to go back in the water, a new threat has emerged to equal employment opportunity as employers base hiring decisions on artificial intelligence powered video and game-based “pre-employment” assessments of job candidates.


The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a public interest research center based in Washington, D.C., recently asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate HireVue, a recruiting company based in Utah that purports to evaluate a job applicant’s job qualifications through online “video interview” and/or “game-based challenge.”

According to its web site, HireVue has more than 700 customers worldwide including over one-third of the Fortune 100 and such leading brands such as Unilever, Hilton, JP Morgan Chase, Delta Air Lines, Vodafone, Carnival Cruise Line, and Goldman Sachs. The company states it has hosted more than ten million on-demand interviews and one million assessments.

PROMOTED
The EPIC complaint follows a wave of lawsuits in recent years charging that employers are using software algorithms to discriminate against older workers by targeting internet job advertisements exclusively to younger workers.

HireVue uses a proprietary algorithm to assess “tens of thousands of data points” from candidate video interviews, including the candidate’s “intonation,” “inflection” and “emotions.” These and other data points are input into “predictive algorithms” that compare candidates with a company’s top performers.

HireVue states its video-based algorithmic assessments provide “excellent insight into attributes like social intelligence (interpersonal skills), communication skills, personality traits, and overall job aptitude.”

EPIC states HireVue’s “business practices produce results that are biased, unprovable and not replicable.”
Video Games And Older Workers
The EPIC complaint focuses upon potential bias against women and minorities but the concept of using video game-based assessments seems particularly suspect with respect to older workers.

The  average age of video game players is in the mid-30s.  Many older workers do not play video games and it is likely that fewer older women than men have done so.  Even if they have, their response would likely be slower than a skilled young gamer.
Loren Larsen, Chief Technology Officer at HireVue, states in a press release that game-based assessments measure ‘emotional IQ” and “build upon the understanding of cognitive ability, enabling hiring managers to understand more about a candidate’s abilities.”
Do Video Interviews Penalize ‘Out of the Box’ Candidates?
EPIC says HireVue “collects facial data from job candidates to evaluate expressions of emotion and personality” It says so-called “facial action units” make up to 29 percent of a candidate’s score.
But how does HireVue’s algorithm assess overweight candidates, those who suffer from depression or non-native English speakers? What about candidates with autism who tend to look at people’s mouths and avoid direct eye contact?
HireVue issued a press release in September announcing it has partnered with Integrate Autism Employment Advisors, a nonprofit organization that helps companies recruit “qualified professionals on the autism spectrum.” The 600 candidates in Integrate Autism’s network will be coached on how to use HireVue’s platform more “efficiently and effectively.” Would such an effort be necessary if HireVue’s algorithm didn’t penalize autistic candidates.
EPIC states the University of Maryland Robert H. Smith School of Business tells students preparing for AI interviews, “Robots compare you against existing success stories; they don’t look for out of-the-box candidates.”
EPIC notes that Amazon abandoned an AI recruiting tool after learning that historical employment data preferred male candidates over women.  In that case, the system penalized resumes that included the word “women’s” and the names of all-women’s colleges. EPIC contends the only way to really tell if a hiring algorithm is non-biased is to  “turn it off and hire someone using other criteria to figure out if they meet or fall short of the same performance standards.”
The Algorithm is Secret
The bottom line is that HireVue’s algorithm is secret so the public has no way of knowing whether it discriminates against older workers, women, the disabled and minorities, etc. EPIC says HireVue refuses to provide job applicants with their assessment score.
EPIC charges that HireVue violates the Federal Trade Communications Act because it lacks a  “reasonable basis” to support its claims and cannot be held accountable for the proper functioning of its secret algorithmic assessments. EPIC also disputes HireVue’s contention that it does not use facial recognition technology for identity recognition purposes, which has been found to be a violation of the FTC Act.
EPIC alleges HireVue’s platform also fails to meet minimal standards for AI-based decision-making set out in AI Principles approved by the 36-member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), including the U.S. These principles say everyone has a right to know the basis for an AI decision that concerns them, AI systems should be deployed only after an adequate evaluation of its risks and institutions must ensure that AI systems do not reflect unfair bias.

The Ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI), an intergovernmental committee set up by Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to examine the feasibility of a legal framework for the development, design and application of artificial intelligence based on the organisation´s standards on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, is holding its first meeting in Strasbourg from 18 to 20 November.
The committee, which brings together representatives from the organisation´s 47 Member States, will have an exchange of views with leading experts on the impact of AI applications on individuals and society, the existing soft law instruments specifically dealing with AI and the existing legally binding international frameworks applicable to AI. It will also examine different national initiatives, policies and strategies, as well as the work undertaken so far by the Council of Europe and other organisations in this field.
In addition, the CAHAI will discuss the content of a feasibility study on a Council of Europe legal framework on AI, which will be completed following broad multi-stakeholder consultations with the private sector and civil society. Important issues which might be addressed by the feasibility study include the need for a common definition of AI, the mapping of the risks and opportunities arising from AI, notably its impact on human rights, rule of law and democracy, as well the opportunity to move towards a binding legal framework.
Deputy Secretary General Gabriella Battaini-Dragoni will deliver a speech at the opening.

13 Mind-Blowing Things Artificial Intelligence Can Already Do TodayAdobe Stock

1.           Read

Is one of your wishes to save time by only having to pay attention to the salient points of communication? Your wish has come true with artificial intelligence-powered SummarizeBot. Whether it's news articles, weblinks, books, emails, legal documents, audio and image files, and more, automatic text summarization by artificial intelligence and machine learning reads communication and reports back the essential information. Currently, SummarizeBot can be used in Facebook Messenger or Slack and relies on natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technologies.

2.           Write

Would you believe that along with professional journalists, news organizations such as The New York Times, Washington Post, Reuters, and more rely on artificial intelligence to write? They do, and although this does include many ""who, what, where, when, and how"" formulaic pieces, AI is able to expand beyond this to more creative writing as well. Many marketers are turning to artificial intelligence to craft their social media posts. Even a novel has even been generated by artificial intelligence that was short-listed for an award.

3.           See
Machine vision is when computers can “see” the world, analyze visual data, and make decisions about it. There are so many amazing ways machine vision is used today, including enabling self-driving cars, facial recognition for police work, payment portals, and more. In manufacturing, the ability for machines to see helps in predictive maintenance and product quality control.

5. Speak
Artificial intelligence can also speak. While it’s helpful (and fun) to have Alexa and Google Maps respond to your queries and give you directions, Google Duplex takes it one step further and uses AI to schedule appointments and complete tasks over the phone in very conversational language. It can respond accurately to the responses given by the humans it’s talking to as well.

6. Smell
There are artificial intelligence researchers who are currently developing AI models that will be able to detect illnesses—just by smelling a human's breath. It can detect chemicals called aldehydes that are associated with human illnesses and stress, including cancer, diabetes, brain injuries, and detecting the ""woody, musky odor"" emitted from Parkinson's disease even before any other symptoms are identified. Artificially intelligent bots could identify gas leaks or other caustic chemicals, as well. IBM is even using AI to develop new perfumes.
7. Touch
Using sensors and cameras, there's a robot that can identify ""supermarket ripe"" raspberries and even pick them and place them into a basket! Its creator says that it will eventually be able to pick one raspberry every 10 seconds for 20 hours a day! The next step for AI tactile development is to link touch with other senses.
8. Move
Artificial intelligence propels all kinds of movement from autonomous vehicles to drones to robots. The Alter 3 production at Tokyo’s New National Theatre features robots that can generate motion autonomously. 
9. Understand emotions
Market research is being aided by AI tools that track a person’s emotions as they watch videos. Artificial emotional intelligence can gather data from a person's facial expressions, body language, and more, analyze it against an emotion database to determine what emotion is likely being expressed, and then determine an action based on that info.  
10. Play games
It's not all serious business with artificial intelligence—it can learn to play games such as chess, Go, and poker (which was an incredible feat)! And, turns out that AI can learn to play these games plus compete and even beat humans at them!
11. Debate
IBM’s Project Debater showed us that artificial intelligence can even be successful at debating humans in complex subjects. Not only is it able to research a topic, but it can also create an engaging point of view and craft rebuttals against a human opponent.
12. Create
Artificial intelligence can even master creative processes, including making visual art, writing poetry, composing music, and taking photographs. Google's AI was even able to create its own AI “child”—that outperformed human-made counterparts.
13.   Read your mind
This is truly mind-boggling—AI that can read your mind! It can interpret brain signals and then create speech. Impressive and life-changing for those with speech impairment, but a little bit unnerving when you consider the mind-reading aspect of the skill. It's no surprise that some of the biggest tech giants, including Facebook and Elon Musk have their own projects underway to capitalize on AI's mind-reading potential.
Now imagine if these 13 mind-blowing skills were all combined into one super artificial intelligence! Frightening or exhilarating? That’s up to you to decide, but I think we can all agree, it would be mind-blowing!

In the past few years it's become something of a buzzy catchword in the industry. And it seems like every website, app, and game is using it. There's a website that uses AI to rate how ""cool"" your selfies are. People ""feed"" AI scripts of popular movies and TV shows to have software spit out a new script based on what it ""learned"" from the source material. Recently, you may have even seen that an AI had ""mastered"" the video game StarCraft II, and performs at a level that's better than 99.8% of human players. But what do people typically mean when they say something is powered by AI? What all does it encompass, and how do you interact with AI on a daily basis? If you're unsure about how all of these pieces fall into place, here's how you can understand the world of artificial intelligence and its various applications. What is artificial intelligence (AI), and what do people typically mean when they say they're using it?In the 1950s, when Marvin Minsky built the first neural network simulator alongside John McCarthy, the pair described artificial intelligence as tasks performed by a program or a machine that you couldn't reasonably determine if a human had performed or not instead. To put it in even simpler terms: ""It’s just another way of writing software. Relax!"" Michael Capps, PhD, former president of Epic Games, and cofounder and CEO of AI startup Diveplane tells Mic. ""Company.com from the 90s became eCompany and then iCompany and then CloudCompany are now Company.ai. Who cares?""So we have two definitions: Artificial intelligence is both the latest ""trendy"" way to write software, so to speak, as well as a way of automating tasks that humans could do in a way that makes it hard to tell if a human or computer performed them. But the most important core component of AI constructs and programs, given that they're modeled after human intelligence, is the fact that they learn. In fact, they'll display some of the same behaviors as humans when they're beginning to understand something. Learning is an important tenet of any artificial intelligence project as well as problem-solving and knowledge. ""There’s really two terms that matter,"" says Capps. ""One is machine learning, or 'ML' — when a machine learns how to do something.  And the other is AI — which basically means, 'I have no idea how the computer did that, whoa.'""The bottom line of determining whether or not you're actually dealing with AI in terms of an app you're using or even an online service is, according to Kishore Rajgopal, founder and CEO of intelligent adapting pricing software firm NextOrbit, is ""the fact that your decisions and your actions change with time, and it [the AI] learns."" Learning is the key point there. ""AI is the hot thing, so just about everybody says AI. 'Oh, my product is AI enabled.' But when you look deeper, what makes it AI? It's all about the rules engine. It's a decision engine. It's a decision tree,"" Rajgopal explains. ""The question really is: does the program learn with time? You must ask this question of something purported to use AI. Does it get better with time? Probably not. The only way it can get better with time is if I, as a programmer, go back and change it.""How does the average person interact with AI on a daily basis?You're likely using AI daily and don't even realize it — that's how ubiquitous the technology has become. It's in such widespread use, even though most individuals aren't quite sure exactly what it even means. Capps says the average person interacts with AI on a ""nonstop"" basis, for example, ""from automated fraud detection on your credit cards, to air conditioning in large buildings, to airplane scheduling, to the sale prices of gold in your Clash of Clans game.""If you unlocked your phone using Face ID, you relied on machine learning to make a call or send some texts. If you then took a photo in the pitch black night and found that your phone automatically lightened it up, you can thank AI for that as well. What's more, that DoorDash customer service agent who helped ensure you got a discount for your missing milkshake? That was probably a bot powered by AI. ""It’s getting harder and harder to discern who is real and who isn’t,"" says Capps. ""Right now it’s chat agents, but that will be voice and then fully generated video soon — it will get harder and harder to tell the real from the virtual, and it may not matter!""How has AI changed over the past few years and what does the future look like?AI has certainly become more ubiquitous over the last few years. It's more than just a buzzword. It's now the core focus of several businesses and a simple fact of life when it comes to innovation. ""Ten years ago, nobody could really afford AI. It was too expensive. It's only in the last two years that it's come out into the open, like using it in commercial software. That's just going to increase. You're going to find that line of programming will become prevalent. It'll no longer be a luxury. It'll just be part of the way [you program.],"" says Rajgopal of the burgeoning AI revolution that's already beginning to take hold. ""In the next five years the exponential curve of technology will continue. You’ll have insanely powerful virtual assistants, automated cars, genetically targeted drugs, and the like. In 10 years, we’ll be like cute house pets for our AI overlords,"" concludes Capps.  What is the key to retaining the human element of AI to avoid any unforeseen mishaps?With machines and programs that are literally created to learn, adapt, and continually improve themselves over time, there are obvious concerns that arise. For instance, what happens if an AI becomes ""too smart,"" or if it ""decides"" that it knows best? ""Today, we’re building “black box” systems, where we don’t know what the system is actually doing,"" Capps says of some of the potential dangers AI has brought forth. ""We’re trusting them at scale, and only later do we realize they might have been trained with biased data. Imagine a residential loan approval algorithm that’s been trained on 60 years of data in the Deep South — what are the chances it might incorporate some racial bias? And we’ve already seen issues with parole determination systems, etc."" We've already seen similar pitfalls of using AI to complete tasks as simple as a smart camera from Facebook's AR/VR team that was meant to focus on one female person of color telling a story that, instead, focused on her ""white, male colleague"" instead. With these potential biases in mind, how do we ensure the programs we're building still retain their human elements? ""Being able to look inside the ‘black box’ is crucial,"" says Capps. ""It’s how we build software, with a debugger so we can see how it’s operating.  AI and machine learning need the same ability to look inside, before we can trust it to make decisions with human lives on the line, or even just decisions that can be impacted by biased data.""The bottom line is that, even if we manage to create super-intelligent software that can perform at the same capacity as humans do, there's still the very real possibility that machines may end up reaching a state of intelligence that's eerily similar to a human's. ""Basically, if we can build a machine that learns like a human, it won’t be long before it’s smarter than a human..."" Capps posited.

It outlines thirteen specific questions, ranging from what happens if an AI creates a copyright-infringing work to if it’s legal to feed an AI copyrighted material.It starts off by asking if output made by AI without any creative involvement from a human should qualify as a work of authorship that’s protectable by US copyright law. If not, then what degree of human involvement “would or should be sufficient so that the work qualifies for copyright protection?”Other questions ask if the company that trains an AI should own the resulting work, and if it’s okay to use copyrighted material to train an AI in the first place. “Should authors be recognized for this type of use of their works?” asks the office. “If so, how?”The office, which, among other things, advises the government on copyright, often seeks public opinion to understand new developments and hear from people who actually deal with them. Earlier this year, the office similarly asked for public opinion on AI and patents.“if it’s really a push button thing, and you get a result, I don’t think there’s any copyright in that.”None of these questions have concrete answers in US law, but people have been debating the potential outcomes for years. The situation might be a little clearer when you’re looking at something like an AI-based app where a user has to make a lot of decisions to shape the end result. “I think what’s protectable is conscious steps made by a person to be involved in authorship,” Zvi S. Rosen, lecturer at the George Washington University School of Law, tells The Verge. But if someone uses an AI that spits out a result with a single click, that could be a different matter. “My opinion is if it’s really a push button thing, and you get a result, I don’t think there’s any copyright in that.”But it’s not always cut and dry. Already, coders have claimed authorship over the “push button” works their AI software creates, which happened earlier this year in a distribution deal Warner Music brokered with the startup Endel. “That’s where it gets more complicated,” Rosen says. “I don’t have a clear answer on that.”As The Verge previously examined, questions like these are at the heart of ongoing discussions around AI and copyright law.

 Machine learning: What is it and how does it work?



 







Machines’ current ability to learn is present in many aspects of everyday life. Machine learning is behind the recommendations for movies we receive on digital platforms, virtual assistants’ ability to recognize speech, or self-driving cars’ ability to see the road. But its origin as a branch of artificial intelligence dates began several decades ago. Why is this technology so important now, and what makes it so revolutionary?

Machine learning, or automated learning, is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows machines to learn without being programmed for this specific purpose. An essential skill to make systems that are not only smart, but autonomous, and capable of identifying patterns in the data to convert them into predictions. This technology is currently present in an endless number of applications, such as the Netflix and Spotify recommendations, Gmail’s smart responses or Alexa and Siri’s natural speech.

Artificial Intelligence: the challenge of turning data into tangible value


Representatives of three leading organizations - Google, Telefónica and BBVA - spoke during the Open Summit event about the different applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the business world and how to extract tangible value from data for people and for society as a whole, at a scale and in a structured way.






“Ultimately, machine learning is a master at pattern recognition, and is able to convert a data sample into a computer program that can extract interferences from new data sets it has not been previously trained for,” explains José Luis Espinoza, data scientist at BBVA Mexico. This ability to learn is also used to improve search engines, robotics, medical diagnosis or even fraud detection for credit cards.
Although now is the time when this discipline is getting headlines thanks to its ability to beat Go players or solve Rubik cubes, its origin dates back to the last century. “Without a doubt, statistics are the fundamental foundation of automated learning, which basically consists of a series of algorithms capable of analyzing large amounts of data to deduct the best result for a certain problem,” adds Espinoza.























 



Old math, new computing
We have to go back to the 19th century to find of the mathematical challenges that set the stage for this technology. For example, Bayes’ theorem (1812) defined the probability of an event occurring based on knowledge of the previous conditions that could be related to this event. Years later, in the 1940s, another group of scientists laid the foundation for computer programming, capable of translating a series of instructions into actions that a computer could execute. These precedents made it possible for the mathematician Alan Turing, in 1950, to ask himself the question of whether it is possible for machines to think. This planted the seed for the creation of computers with artificial intelligence that are capable of autonomously replicating tasks that are typically performed by humans, such as writing or image recognition.
It was a little later, in the 1950s and 1960s, when different scientists started to investigate how to apply the human brain neural network's biology to attempt to create the first smart machines. The idea came from the creation of artificial neural networks, a computing model inspired in the way neurons transmit information to each other through a network of interconnected nodes. One of the first experiments in this regard was conducted by Marvin Minksy and Dean Edmonds, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who managed to create a computer program capable of learning from experience to find its way out of a maze.

""Machine learning is a master at pattern recognition""

This was the first machine capable of learning to accomplish a task on its own, without being explicitly programmed for this purpose. Instead, it did so by learning from examples provided at the outset. The accomplishment represented a paradigm shift from the broader concept of artificial intelligence. “Machine learning’s great milestone was that it made it possible to go from programming through rules to allowing the model to make these rules emerge unassisted thanks to data,” explains Juan Murillo, BBVA’s Data Strategy Manager.
Despite the success of the experiment, the accomplishment also demonstrated the limits that the technology had at the time. The lack of data available and the lack of computing power at the time meant that these systems did not have sufficient capacity to solve complex problems. This led to the arrival of the so-called “first artificial intelligence winter” - several decades when the lack of results and advances led scholars to lose hope for this discipline.
The rebirth of AI
The panorama started to change at the end of the 20th Century with the arrival of the Internet, the massive volumes of data available to train models, and computers’ growing computing power. “Now we can do the same thing as before, but a billion times faster. The algorithms can test the same combination of data 500 billion times to give us the optimal result in a matter of hours or minutes, when it used to take weeks or months,” says Espinoza.
In 1997, a famous milestone marked the rebirth of automated learning: the IBM Deep Blue system, which is trained from watching thousands of successful chess matches, managed to beat the world champion, Garry Kasparov. This accomplishment was possible thanks to deep learning, a subcategory of machine learning described for the first time in 1960, which allows systems to not only learn from experience, but to be capable of training themselves do so better and better using data. This milestone was possible then - and not 30 years before - thanks to the growing availability of data to train the model: “What this system did was statistically calculate which move had more probabilities of winning the game based on thousands of examples of matches previously watched,” adds Espinoza.

“The ability to adapt to changes in the data as they occur in the system was missing from previous techniques”

This technology has advanced exponentially in the past 20 years, and is also responsible for AlphaGo, the program capable of beating any human player at the game Go. And what is even more important: of training itself by constantly playing against itself to continue improving.
The system that AlphaGo uses to do this, in particular, is reinforcement learning, which is one of the three major trends currently used to train these models:

Reinforcement learning takes place when a machine learns through trial and error until it finds the best way to complete a given task. For example, Microsoft uses this technique in game environments like Minecraft to see how “software agents” improve their work. The system learns through them to modify its behavior based on “rewards” for completing the assigned task, without being specifically programmed to do it in a certain way.


Supervised learning occurs when machines are trained with labeled data. For example, photos with descriptions of the things that appear in them. The algorithm the machine uses is able to select these labels in other databases. Therefore, if a group of images has been labeled that show dogs, the machine can identify similar images.


Finally, in the case of unsupervised learning, machines do not identify patterns in labeled databases. Instead, they look for similarities. The algorithms are not programmed to detect a specific type of data, such as images of dogs, but to look for examples that are similar and can be grouped together. This is what occurs, for example, in facial recognition where the algorithm does not look for specific features, but for a series of common patterns that “tell” it that it’s the same face.

Flexibility, adaptation and creativity
Machine learning models, and specifically reinforcement learning, have a characteristic that make them especially useful for the corporate world. “It’s their flexibility and ability to adapt to changes in the data as they occur in the system and learn from the model’s own actions. Therein lies the learning and momentum that was missing from previous techniques,” adds Juan Murillo.
In the case of AlphaGo, this means that the machine adapts based on the opponent's movements and it uses this new information to constantly improve the model. The latest version of this computer called AlphaGo Zero is capable of accumulating thousands of years of human knowledge after working for just a few days. Furthermore, ""AlphaGo Zero also discovered new knowledge, developing unconventional strategies and creative new moves,"" explains DeepMind, the Google subsidiary that is responsible for its development, in an article.






Innovation and Technology
Artificial Intelligence, an ally against climate change


The extinction of species, the rise in temperatures and major natural disasters are some of the consequences of climate change. Countries and industries are aware and work to combat the planet’s accelerating pollution. Are there any viable solutions? According to some researches, using big data and machine learning could help drive energy efficiency, transforms industries such as the agriculture and find new eco-friendly construction materials.






This unprecedented ability to adapt has enormous potential to enhance scientific disciplines as diverse as the creation of synthetic proteins or the design of more efficient antennas. “The industrial applications of this technique include continuously optimizing any type of ‘system’,” explains José Antonio Rodríguez, Senior Data Scientist at BBVA’s AI Factory. In the banking world, deep learning also makes it possible to “create algorithms that can adjust to changes in market and customer behavior in order to balance supply and demand, for example, offering personalized prices,” concludes Rodríguez.
Another example is the improvement in systems like those in self-driving cars, which have made great strides in recent years thanks to deep learning. It allows them to progressively enhance their precision; the more they drive, the more data they can analyze. The possibilities of machine learning are virtually infinite as long as data is available they can use to learn. Some researchers are even testing the limits of what we call creativity, using this technology to create art or write articles.

In 2015, Google had to issue an apology when its photo app mistook a black user for a gorilla—revealing that algorithms are not free of bias, despite their apparent impartiality. The incident brought attention to a problem which had been slowly developing for years. Already in 2009, asiatic users reported that a digital camera was asking them not to blink when they took a photograph with their eyes open. The camera was sold by Nikon, a japanese firm.
It’s not surprising that artificial intelligence (AI) programs have inherited society’s biases, conscious or not, given that they are trained on human decisions and on datasets collected by people. The problem is that algorithms have a sheen of neutrality which can obscure insidious social prejudice. In 2018, for instance, Amazon had to scrap an AI recruiting tool trained on job applications which the company had received over a ten-year period—their program, true to the tech industry’s track record, was showing bias against women.
Many facial recognition programs have a racial bias. Credit: NIST
Gemma Galdon, founder and director of the consulting firm Eticas, recalls a case where one person changed from a male to a female name on InfoJobs, an online job bank. The career site’s algorithm started listing traditionally female jobs with less pay, despite there being no change to the candidate’s qualifications. “All companies are required to follow an equal-opportunity strategy: if they only employ men, they can be sued,” Galdon says: “Why isn’t InfoJobs also forced to check for bias in its algorithm?”
Artificial intelligence already takes decisions (or aids decision-making processes) in finance, in the judicial system, in healthcare and in national security, dealing out unfair treatment to social minorities. Eradicating prejudice baked into these programs has become a matter of urgency. For some digital services, the solution appears straightforward: if a facial recognition algorithm struggles to discern black and asian faces, for instance, the training dataset probably needs greater diversity.
However, problems which run deeper have no clear-cut answers. This year, a study published in the journal Science revealed that an important triage algorithm used in the United States underestimated the medical needs of black patients. Surprisingly, it did this with no prior knowledge of their ethnicity, because it was programed to assign patients risk scores based on their healthcare costs. As it happens, the United States spends less money, on average, on black patients’ health.
Why are robots prejudiced?
In this case, the developers chose healthcare cost because they thought it was a suitable, unbiased proxy for the actual healthcare needs, but they got it wrong. In other words, they had trained the algorithm to correctly solve a poorly defined problem. “There are several reasons why an algorithm may be biased or unfair. First, because it reflects society, reproducing the unfair dynamics which already exist. It could also be that the training data are skewed or the problem has been incorrectly defined. Or it could be that the engineers add in their own prejudice. We have realised that every algorithm with social impact is biased,” says Galdon.

The first challenge is to pinpoint unfair decisions, in order to stop them and to avoid them being repeated in the future. Nicolas Kayser-Bril, a reporter for the non-profit AlgorithmWatch, is an expert at identifying biased tech. “You can recognise them by old-fashioned eye discrimination, but it’s hard to prove bias,” he says. Part of the problem is that AI code is usually inscrutable, like a black box—even its creators aren’t privy to the decision-making process.
“When I know the type of algorithm being used, I know which questions to ask,” says Kayser-Bril. “In the case of machine learning, I want to know which data training set was used”. At this point, his efforts are usually foiled by the lack of transparency from developing companies and institutions. “There is AI designed to detect bias in other AIs, but as long as the algorithm is proprietary, we, the journalists, can’t analyse it,” he explains. For Kayser-Bril, the situation is akin to a sanitary inspection at a restaurant. “You want to find out if the restaurant is being run hygienically, so you can look at the dishes that are being served, but what you really want to do is go into the kitchen to inspect how the dishes are made,” he says.
Nipping bias in the bud
Galdon’s company does visit clients’ “kitchens” to help them solve and avoid bias in their algorithms. “We audit the machine learning, but that only accounts for a small part where we find problems, perhaps 20%,” she says. The remaining 80% is more “substantial” work, Galdon claims, which involves analysing the entire decision chain, from the definition of the problem and the technologists’ assumptions to the specific training provided for end-users, those who will use the algorithm in a job with social outcomes.
Technologists involuntarily perpetuate stereotypes and prejudices of society. Source: MaxPixel
According to the experts, teams developing artificial intelligence must strive for greater social and professional diversity—this will be key to building a fairer future for the field. In the United States, only 2.5% of Google’s workforce is black. Furthermore, technologists rarely work with social scientists to ensure their assumptions are sound before they launch a project. But Galdon says times are changing: “Engineers encounter problems which they are aware they have no training for, and our intervention is always welcome,” she says, referring to her company’s consulting services.
Beyond computer programs which result in outright discrimination, there is an overarching inequity problem in the tech industry. In short, algorithms are only developed for those who can afford them, setting up unequal power dynamics from the get-go. Taryn Southern, director of the neurotechnology film I Am Human, told the online portal Big Think that brain-machine interfaces designed to make us “smarter, better, faster” reflect the “Western bias to favor productivity and efficiency”. Why assume everyone shares those values? “Perhaps in other Eastern cultures they would orient the use of an interface to induce greater states of calm or create more empathy”, Southern suggests.

  With lives at stake, and the clock ticking, mastering disaster may be the ultimate AI challenge.
Teams from Johns Hopkins University, Lockheed Martin, the U.S. Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center and NVIDIA Wednesday outlined how they’re working to put AI to work speeding disaster relief to where it’s needed most.
The teams spoke about their work at GTC DC, the Washington edition of NVIDIA’s GPU Technology Conference, which brought together more than 3,500 registered attendees — policymakers, business leaders and researchers among them — to discuss and learn about the latest in AI and data science.
Their presentations underscored GTC DC’s role as Washington’s premier AI conference. They represent the latest efforts, detailed at the event over the past several years, to put the benefits of AI into the hands of policymakers and first-responders.
Detecting Damage with Satellite Imagery
A team from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and the Joint AI Center (JAIC) spoke about how they’re using GPU-powered deep learning algorithms to track the damage caused by major storms from airborne and satellite imagery data processing.
Speakers included software engineer Beatrice Garcia and senior engineer Gordon Christie, both from the university’s Applied Physics Laboratory, and Captain Dominic Garcia, project lead at JAIC.
While their work hasn’t been deployed — yet — in disaster zones, their goal is to create AI systems that harness satellite and aerial imagery, along with other data, to point first responders and military and government decision-makers and analysts to where the need is greatest.
Such images will help first responders see, at a glance, where to deploy their resources, Christie said, as he showed an AI-enhanced map assessing the damage caused by a tornado that struck Joplin, Mississippi, in 2011.
The lab and JAIC have applied deep learning algorithms to the imagery of a number of severe storms collected from airborne platforms to accelerate detection of flooding and damaged infrastructure.
Based on the algorithms they developed and techniques they learned, the joint team is now creating a scalable environment that would provide these capabilities to any analysts. Users would have access to AI and machine learning algorithms, enabling a faster response to a variety of natural disasters.
Lockheed Prepares with Earthquake Simulation
Andrew Walsh, a senior staff systems engineer at Lockheed Martin, explained how the company is building an open dataset that can be used to train AI for better responses to earthquakes.
Lockheed Martin next explained the work that they’ve done in conjunction with a team from NVIDIA to build an open dataset for multi-platform, multi-sensor machine learning research and development.
The dataset, focused on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, is being developed using a combination of real-world data collection events as well as simulation.  The current emphasis is on earthquake scenarios.
Andrew Walsh, a senior staff systems engineer at Lockheed Martin, joined May Casterline, a senior solutions architect at NVIDIA, to explain how they choreographed a real-world collection event that  included multiple sensors, aircraft, ground vehicles and teams of actors in a series of simulated earthquake scenarios. They also detailed the effort required to spatiotemporally align all the disparate data sources and described the challenges around labeling such a massive dataset.
Their dataset will be used to train AI and machine learning systems to improve responses to real earthquakes.
Disaster Planning with Data Science
Sean Griffin, president of Disaster Intelligence, spoke late Wednesday afternoon about his company’s approach to disaster prevention and response. His D.C.-based firm is working to create a common web platform that collects datasets relevant to natural and manmade disasters, which are then displayed graphically.
Users — from first responders to everyday citizens — can access the data to make more educated choices before and after a disaster.
“We used to share situational awareness by PDF or sharepoint sites,” said Griffin. But high performance computing is making it possible to update larger audiences with more relevant data.
“It’s our objective as a company to have complete saturation across the U.S. to have outage data in our platforms so that not only do we know that the power’s out, but that we can intersect that information with other key points of interest like healthcare facilities or water systems.”
Griffin presented two use cases. The first showed how Disaster Intelligence’s platform can model the consequences, cost and options for different disaster relief strategies. The second addressed how the platform improves coastal evacuations during hurricanes.
Route Planning with RAPIDS
NVIDIA is hosting a webinar on how RAPIDS, the company’s GPU-accelerated data science software stack, can help speed up route replanning for civilian and military disaster response assets. Register for the webinar, taking place Dec. 17 at 10 am PT, here.

Reducing the Risks Posed by Artificial Intelligence
To thrive in the new era, enterprise security needs to reduce the risks posed by AI and make the most of the opportunities it offers.
By Steve Durbin




November 11, 2019













Artificial Intelligence (AI) is creating a new frontier in information security. Systems that independently learn, reason and act will increasingly replicate human behavior. Like humans, they will be flawed, but also capable of achieving great things.AI poses new information risks and makes some existing ones more dangerous. However, it can also be used for good and should become a key part of every organization’s defensive arsenal. Business and information security leaders alike must understand both the risks and opportunities before embracing technologies that will soon become a critically important part of everyday business.Already, AI is finding its way into many mainstream business use cases. Organizations use variations of AI to support processes in areas including customer service, human resources and bank fraud detection. However, the hype can lead to confusion and skepticism over what AI actually is and what it really means for business and security. It is difficult to separate wishful thinking from reality. What Are the Information Risks Posed by AI?As AI systems are adopted by organizations, they will become increasingly critical to day-to-day business operations. Some organizations already have, or will have, business models entirely dependent on AI technology. No matter the function for which an organization uses AI, such systems and the information that supports them have inherent vulnerabilities and are at risk from both accidental and adversarial threats. Compromised AI systems make poor decisions and produce unexpected outcomes.Simultaneously, organizations are beginning to face sophisticated AI-enabled attacks – which have the potential to compromise information and cause severe business impact at a greater speed and scale than ever before. Taking steps both to secure internal AI systems and defend against external AI-enabled threats will become vitally important in reducing information risk.While AI systems adopted by organizations present a tempting target, adversarial attackers are also beginning to use AI for their own purposes. AI is a powerful tool that can be used to enhance attack techniques, or even create entirely new ones. Organizations must be ready to adapt their defenses in order to cope with the scale and sophistication of AI-enabled cyber-attacks. Defensive Opportunities Provided by AISecurity practitioners are always fighting to keep up with the methods used by attackers, and AI systems can provide at least a short-term boost by significantly enhancing a variety of defensive mechanisms. AI can automate numerous tasks, helping understaffed security departments to bridge the specialist skills gap and improve the efficiency of their human practitioners.Protecting against many existing threats, AI can put defenders a step ahead. However, adversaries are not standing still – as AI-enabled threats become more sophisticated, security practitioners will need to use AI-supported defenses simply to keep up.The benefit of AI in terms of response to threats is that it can act independently, taking responsive measures without the need for human oversight and at a much greater speed than a human could. Given the presence of malware that can compromise whole systems almost instantaneously, this is a highly valuable capability.The number of ways in which defensive mechanisms can be significantly enhanced by AI provide grounds for optimism, but as with any new type of technology, it is not a miracle cure. Security practitioners should be aware of the practical challenges involved when deploying defensive AI.Questions and considerations before deploying defensive AI systems have narrow intelligence and are designed to fulfil one type of task. They require sufficient data and inputs in order to complete that task. One single defensive AI system will not be able to enhance all the defensive mechanisms outlined previously – an organization is likely to adopt multiple systems. Before purchasing and deploying defensive AI, security leaders should consider whether an AI system is required to solve the problem, or whether more conventional options would do a similar or better job.Questions to ask include:
Is the problem bounded? (i.e. can it be addressed with one dataset or type of input, or does it require a high understanding of context, which humans are usually better at providing?)
Does the organization have the data required to run and optimize the AI system?
Security leaders also need to consider issues of governance around defensive AI, such as:
How do defensive AI systems fit into organizational security governance structures?
How can the organization provide security assurance for defensive AI systems?
How can defensive AI systems be maintained, backed up, tested and patched?
Does the organization have sufficiently skilled people to provide oversight for defensive AI systems?
AI will not replace the need for skilled security practitioners with technical expertise and an intuitive nose for risk. These security practitioners need to balance the need for human oversight with the confidence to allow AI-supported controls to act autonomously and effectively. Such confidence will take time to develop, especially as stories continue to emerge of AI proving unreliable or making poor or unexpected decisions.AI systems will make mistakes – a beneficial aspect of human oversight is that human practitioners can provide feedback when things go wrong and incorporate it into the AI’s decision-making process. Of course, humans make mistakes too – organizations that adopt defensive AI need to devote time, training and support to help security practitioners learn to work with intelligent systems.Given time to develop and learn together, the combination of human and artificial intelligence should become a valuable component of an organization’s cyber defenses. Preparation Begins NowComputer systems that can independently learn, reason and act herald a new technological era, full of both risk and opportunity. The advances already on display are only the tip of the iceberg – there is a lot more to come. The speed and scale at which AI systems ‘think’ will be increased by growing access to big data, greater computing power and continuous refinement of programming techniques. Such power will have the potential to both make and destroy a business.AI tools and techniques that can be used in defense are also available to malicious actors including criminals, hacktivists and state-sponsored groups. Sooner rather than later these adversaries will find ways to use AI to create completely new threats such as intelligent malware – and at that point, defensive AI will not just be a ‘nice to have’. It will be a necessity. Security practitioners using traditional controls will not be able to cope with the speed, volume and sophistication of attacks.To thrive in the new era, organizations need to reduce the risks posed by AI and make the most of the opportunities it offers. That means securing their own intelligent systems and deploying their own intelligent defenses. AI is no longer a vision of the distant future: the time to start preparing is now.

More than a year after pulling out of a contract with the Pentagon that relied on technologies based on artificial intelligence to sort through drone videos, Google says it is ready to work with the Defense Department on a wide variety of applications that don’t involve weapons.Google’s decision to engage with the Pentagon on non-weapons-related technologies stems from the company’s artificial intelligence principles published last year, said Kent Walker, senior vice president for global affairs at Google.The principles rule out Google’s role in developing technologies that could cause harm or could be used for surveillance in violation of laws.“It’s right that we decided to press the reset button until we had an opportunity to develop our own set of AI principles, our own internal standards and review processes,” Walker said last week at an event organized by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.The decision to stop working with the Pentagon on the drone video contract was a “discrete” one and not indicative of a “broader principle or an unwillingness” to work with the Defense Department, he said.[Lawmakers Pushing Drone Legislation Hear Threat Warnings]The commission was created by Congress in the 2019 Pentagon policy bill to figure out how the Pentagon can harness artificial intelligence and related technologies for national security purposes. The panel is chaired by Eric Schmidt, the former chairman of Google’s parent company Alphabet, where he continues to be an outside adviser.Google is working with the Pentagon on a “number of national mission initiatives,” Walker said, listing cybersecurity, health care, tools to identify deepfake videos, and other AI projects with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, to ensure the “robustness of AI.”“At the end of the day we are a proud American company and we are committed to the defense of the United States, our allies and the safety and security of the world,” Walker said.[jwp-video n=”1″]
Without a close partnership between the government, academia and industry, the Pentagon could never achieve global superiority in artificial intelligence technologies that are likely to be central to military dominance in the future, said Lt. Gen. John N.T. “Jack” Shanahan, director of the Pentagon’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is overseeing the military’s pursuit of such technologies.“Even those for various reasons who view [the Defense Department] with suspicion, and reluctant to accept that we are in a strategic competition with China, would agree that artificial intelligence is key” to the future of national security, Shanahan said.Google’s withdrawal in June 2018 from Project Maven, a Pentagon program that used the company’s artificial intelligence toolkit called TensorFlow to sift through thousands of hours of drone video, sent shockwaves through the national security world, raising fears that other technology companies could follow suit and handicap the Pentagon’s efforts.Google’s decision came after thousands of Google’s engineers had protested its work with the Pentagon and wrote a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai saying that it shouldn’t be “in the business of war.”The Pentagon turned to Google for help in developing AI technologies because it did not want to “reinvent the wheel,” and the company had the best minds working on machine learning algorithms, Shanahan said.Although the Pentagon was “very pleased” with the results of the project and the cooperation it got from Google, “we lost the narrative very quickly,” Shanahan said.Although the project was not aimed at developing a weapon, critics of the effort inside and outside Google labeled it as a weapons program, Shanahan said.When Google withdrew from Project Maven, several top U.S. officials pilloried the company for choosing to withdraw from the Pentagon program while continuing its work in China.The company’s withdrawal could put Americans at risk, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work said at the time. Work is now the vice chairman of the artificial intelligence commission.
Google and China
While Google employees were protesting the company’s engagement with the Pentagon, fearing that they were aiding in the development of potential weapons, the company was working in China on artificial intelligence systems, Work said. Beijing’s military is closely tied with commercial entities, and whatever technologies that are developed for commercial purposes could be used by the People’s Liberation Army, Work said.The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, also echoed fears about Google’s work in China. Any work by U.S. companies in aiding China’s development of artificial intelligence systems would “help an authoritarian government assert control over its own population” and “enable the Chinese military to take advantage” of U.S. technology, Dunford said in March this year. Dunford has since retired.Google’s Walker said the company’s work in China was limited in its scope.In 2010, large-scale cyberattacks from China aimed at Google’s operations within the People’s Republic resulted in loss of the company’s intellectual property, Google said at the time. “We learned a lot from that experience,” Walker said. “While many of our peer companies have significant AI operations in China, we have chosen to scope our operations in China very carefully.”The company’s work in China is limited to “advertising and work supporting an open source platform,” Walker said.Last year, Google engineers leaked details of the company’s work in China to develop a search engine code-named Dragonfly that would have allowed Beijing to censor and monitor its citizens. In July, Google said it had terminated its work on the project.Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to spend $150 billion on artificial intelligence technologies with the goal of becoming a world leader in the field by 2030.

That is exactly what they used to say about computers and mobile phones in the 1990s.It may come as a surprise to many that Nepal has been gaining ground in AI, developing not only software using machine learning algorithms but producing world-class engineers. One company at the forefront is Fusemachines Nepal, which has started using industry experts to train AI students with cutting-edge technology to deliver intelligent solutions.“I wanted to see if I can contribute in bringing the best AI education to Nepal and make Nepal known around the world as one of the best sources of AI talent,” says the Nepali founder of Fusemachines, Sameer Maskey, a professor at Columbia University.All Photos: MONIKA DEUPALA/SONIA AWALEThis is the age of surveillance capitalism, where algorithms determine election outcomes, Siri knows what you want before you do, wearables correctly deduce the state of the heart and Facebook recognises friends.Read also:Natural Intelligence, Duksangh SherpaKathmandu's Silicon Alley and the Law, Sonia AwaleAI simply imitates human thinking by recognising patterns in data, so that repetitive everyday work can be done by machines that learn as they go along.Nepal missed the bus on natural resource processing, manufacturing and information technology. But experts say that training a critical mass of engineers in AI can allow the country’s economy to leapfrog and become globally competitive.    Fusemachines Director of Academic Affairs Bülent Uyaniker, who was in Nepal recently, rejects the notion that Nepal is not ready for artificial intelligence applications. “It is happening already, it is inevitable. If there can be 8.5 million Facebook users in Nepal, then it has the special conditions for AI.”Proof of this is the increasing number of software companies in Nepal using local engineering talent to work on software solutions for customers in North America or Europe. However, most of the engineers and recent graduates need training in AI to keep up with customer requirements. America alone will need 200,000 data scientists in the next five years, and most of these will come from the UK, Finland, Canada, Singapore, China and India.Which is why Fusemachines Nepal is also emphasising education. Says the head of its global operations and strategy, Sumana Shrestha: “You cannot learn AI in a one-day bootcamp, it needs intelligent mathematics, but there is a huge demand versus supply gap for engineers proficient in machine learning or other AI components everywhere.”Read also:It's all about IT, Sahina ShresthaDrones to the rescue, Lucia de VriesNepal established itself as a sought after destination in the past 20 years for outsourcing services such as software and app development, website design and big data management to overseas clients, mostly due to the country’s inexpensive English-speaking workforce.This move from IT to AI will not just create jobs in Nepal, but also allow the country to increase efficiency and productivity in the workplace. General practitioners in rural hospitals will be able to make diagnoses faster so they can spend more time with patients, high-risk individuals can be identified with cancer screening, and targeted advertising and customised itineraries will lure potential tourists during Visit Nepal 2020.Recently, a group of engineering students developed a model to help poultry entrepreneurs understand fowl behaviour and the state of their animals’ health, helping them to raise the farm’s business profile.“With precision livestock farming we can generate patterns to help farmers recognise symptoms before an outbreak of a disease by implementing AI components such as image processing and deep learning,” explained engineering student Sajil Awale at Pulchok Engineering Campus. “This allows for timely intervention to prevent mass deaths and reduce losses.”Read also: Tap and tour, Clara BullockComputer vision (which enables computers to see and process images as humans would) can also help identify rotten fruit swiftly, and prevent misuse of pesticides by identifying areas on the farm that require chemicals, and the amounts needed. AI can also estimate future harvests, allowing farmers time to find markets for produce.Engineers at Fusemachines Nepal are working on Nepal’s first optical character recognition (OCR) system so forms filled out with Nepali handwriting can be digitised and translated into English. This will have huge scope in Nepal’s banking, hospital and government sectors, where pen and paper continues to be the norm.Sixit Bhatta, CEO of ride-sharing startup Tootle, says Nepal is ripe for AI applications: “Our efforts now should be on preparing for a world in which machines perform skills-oriented tasks and for humans to take on the roles that require creativity and empathy. But before that, the government should design policies that allow AI to grow, and not restrict it.”Sumana Shrestha at Fusemachines Nepal says that as long as salaries for clerical staff are low, there is less potential for AI to flourish. But she adds: “The curse of cheap labour means companies will prefer to employ people to do repetitive work. But sooner or later, AI will be here. Nepal needs to develop despite government. And the private sector needs to prepare itself for disruption.”Coming to terms with AI Artificial Intelligence: Ability of computer systems or machines to make a decision like humans, or the ability to perform tasks requiring human intelligenceMachine Learning: A subset of artificial intelligence that provides a system with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed, relying on patterns generated from dataDeep Learning: Machine learning that is applied on a large set of data, also known as deep neural learning that uses deep neural networks to model complicated dataNatural Language Processing: Interaction between computers and human languages, deals with programming computers to process and analyse natural (human) language, this field of AI processes, analyses, interprets and distills information from human languagesComputer Vision: Enables computers to see, identify and process images in the same way that human vision doesImage Processing: Part of computer vision that entails analysis and manipulation to find insights from a digitised imageBig Data: Extremely large data sets on which AI is applied to reveal patterns, trends and associations and make decisionsMaking Nepalis artificially intelligent During a visit to Nepal six years ago, Columbia University professor Sameer Maskey handpicked three students from engineering schools across Kathmandu who were able to solve a mathematical equation. The three went on to become the core of Fusemachines, a global company that aims to democratise artificial intelligence (AI) through education and software solutions.Headquartered in New York, Fusemachines has since opened branches in Canada, UK and the Dominican Republic to develop intelligent software solutions that have transformed brands and businesses around the world. One of its biggest operations is in Nepal, Fusemachines employs 100 top Nepali software engineers who work on projects that use AI applications in fields ranging from telecommunications and banking to hospitals and governance.Unlike other back office companies that work on outsourced software development, Fusemachines is a school in itself, training engineers while coming up with product solutions.“We employ senior engineers and industry experts with PhDs along with upcoming engineers, who work together to solve client-specific problems though AI,” explains Sumana Shrestha who heads Fusemachines’ global operations and strategy. “Such collaborative approach allows young talent to continuously learn and grow.”Following Maskey’s vision, Fusemachines tries to make AI accessible to everyone through education, which is why it initially offered training fellowships and then, to meet the demand for engineers, launched AI Shikshya — a year-long, in-house training program.“With our own proprietary platform and content we have partnered with engineering colleges in Kathmandu to offer AI,” says Shrestha. “The program is a blend of online and on-site, the course material is not too academic, is industry focused and instructors are seasoned engineers up to date with new algorithms.”The company also has its own AI schools, open to professionals who want to grow their business or anyone interested. Fusemachines also offers a foundation course, open to high school graduates. A year-long, micro-degree program consisting of four major courses — including machine learning, deep thinking, natural language processing and computer vision — will be the next step.“In school we were always presented with clean data sets to work on but that is rarely the case on the job. But this year-long training program gets people ready to take on real-life problems and provide AI solutions,” says Rojesh Shikharkar, engineer at Fusemachines Nepal and a post-grad at Pulchok Engineering Campus.Apart from training, Fusemachines has given engineers who would otherwise have migrated to work in the US and Europe an opportunity to find meaningful work in Nepal.Says Shrestha: “If you create opportunities here, people might actually stay, and once we have mass education in artificial intelligence, companies here will start adopting and see the value of AI products, ensuring more opportunities at home.”Sonia AwalewriterSonia Awale is Executive Editor of Nepali Times where she also serves as the health, science and environment correspondent.

Attempts to evade such censorship have turned into a continually escalating race to keep up with ever-changing, increasingly sophisticated internet censorship. Censoring regimes have had the advantage in that race, because researchers must manually search for ways to circumvent censorship, a process that takes considerable time.






New work led by University of Maryland computer scientists could shift the balance of the censorship race. The researchers developed a tool called Geneva (short for Genetic Evasion), which automatically learns how to circumvent censorship. Tested in China, India, and Kazakhstan, Geneva found dozens of ways to circumvent censorship by exploiting gaps in censors’ logic and finding bugs that the researchers say would have been virtually impossible for humans to find manually.  The researchers will introduce Geneva during a peer-reviewed talk at the Association for Computing Machinery’s 26th Conference on Computer and Communications Security in London on November 14, 2019.“With Geneva, we are, for the first time, at a major advantage in the censorship arms race,” said Dave Levin, an assistant professor of computer science at UMD and senior author of the paper. “Geneva represents the first step toward a whole new arms race in which artificial intelligence systems of censors and evaders compete with one another. Ultimately, winning this race means bringing free speech and open communication to millions of users around the world who currently don’t have them.”All information on the internet is broken into data packets by the sender’s computer and reassembled by the receiving computer. One prevalent form of internet censorship used by authoritarian regimes works by monitoring the data packets sent during an internet search. The censor blocks requests that either contain flagged keywords (such as “Tiananmen Square” in China) or prohibited domain names (such as “Wikipedia” in many countries).When Geneva is running on a computer that is sending out web requests through a censor, Geneva modifies how data is broken up and sent, so that the censor does not recognize forbidden content or is unable to censor the connection.Known as a genetic algorithm, Geneva is a biologically inspired type of artificial intelligence that Levin and his team developed to work in the background as a user browses the web from a standard internet browser. Like biological systems, Geneva forms sets of instructions from genetic building blocks. But rather than using DNA as building blocks, Geneva uses small pieces of code. Individually, the bits of code do very little, but when composed into instructions, they can perform sophisticated evasion strategies for breaking up, arranging, or sending data packets.






Geneva evolves its genetic code through successive attempts (or generations). With each generation, Geneva keeps the instructions that work best at evading censorship and kicks out the rest. Geneva mutates and crossbreeds its strategies by randomly removing instructions, adding new instructions, or combining successful instructions and testing the strategy again. Through this evolutionary process, Geneva is able to identify multiple evasion strategies very quickly.“This completely inverts how researchers typically approach the problem of censorship,” said Levin, who holds a joint appointment in the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies. “Ordinarily we identify how a censorship strategy works and then devise strategies to evade it. But now we let Geneva figure out how to evade the censor, and then we learn what censorship strategies are being used by seeing how Geneva defeated them.”The team tested Geneva in the laboratory against mock censors and in the real world against real censors. In the lab, the researchers developed censors that functioned like those known from previous research to be deployed by autocratic regimes. Within days, Geneva identified virtually all the packet-manipulation strategies that had been discovered by previously published work.To demonstrate that Geneva worked in the real world against undiscovered censorship strategies, the team ran Geneva on a computer in China with an unmodified Google Chrome browser installed. By deploying strategies identified by Geneva, the user was able to browse free of keyword censorship. The researchers also successfully evaded censorship in India, which blocks forbidden URLs, and Kazakhstan, which was eavesdropping on certain social media sites at the time. In all cases, Geneva successfully circumvented censorship.“Currently, the evade-detect cycle requires extensive manual measurement, reverse engineering, and creativity to develop new means of censorship evasion,” said Kevin Bock (B.S. ’17, M.S. ’18, computer science), a computer science Ph.D. student at UMD and lead author of the paper. “With this research, Geneva represents an important first step in automating censorship evasion.”The researchers plan to release their data and code in the hopes that it will provide open access to information in countries where the internet is restricted. The team acknowledges that there may be many reasons why individuals living under autocratic regimes might not want or be able to install the tool on their computers. However, they remain undeterred. The researchers are exploring the possibility of deploying Geneva on the computer supplying the blocked content (known as the server) rather than on the computer searching for blocked content (known as the client). That would mean websites such as Wikipedia or the BBC could be available to anyone inside countries that currently block them, such as China and Iran, without requiring the users to configure anything on their computer.






“If Geneva can be deployed on the server side and work as well as it does on the client side, then it could potentially open up communications for millions of people,” Levin said. “That’s an amazing possibility, and it’s a direction we’re pursuing.”###In addition to Levin, Bock and George Hughey (B.S. ’19, computer science) at UMD, Xiao Qiang of UC Berkeley also co-authored the paper. Seven UMD undergraduate students worked on this project as part of Levin’s Breakerspace lab in the UMD Department of Computer Science.Reference: “Geneva: Evolving Censorship Evasion Strategies” by Kevin Bock, George Hughey, Xiao Qian and Dave Levin, 14 November 14, CCS ’19: Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security.

Two paintings up for auction in New York highlight a growing interest in artificial intelligence-created works — a technique that could transform how art is made and viewed but is also stirring up passionate debate.

The art world was stunned last year when an AI painting sold for $432,500, and auctioneers are keen to further test demand for computer-generated works.
“Art is a true reflection of what our society, what our environment responds to,” said Max Moore of Sotheby’s.
“And so it’s just a natural continuation of the progression of art,” he added.
Sotheby’s will put two paintings by the French art collective Obvious up for sale on Thursday, including “Le Baron De Belamy.”

The European classic style portrait is part of the same series as “Portrait of Edmond Belamy”, which sold for more than 60 times the lowest estimate at Christie’s during the 2018 fall auctions.
The paintings were made using a technique called “generative adversarial network,” or GAN.
GAN involves feeding thousands of images of the same style into a computer until the machine concludes that it has created a new portrait that it thinks accurately reflects that style.
“Katsuwaka of the Dawn Lagoon” was created in a Japanese style using the same GAN algorithm.

Auctioneers have put modest prices on the two paintings. “Katsuwaka” has a pre-sale estimate between $8,000 and $12,000, while “Le Baron” has been priced between $20,000 and $30,000.
“We do not expect as big a result as last year,” said Pierre Fautrel, one of the three members of Obvious.
“We just want to see if there are people who are ready to buy around these prices and if the market will continue to build,” he added.
Moore said the sale of “Portrait of Edmond Belamy” showed that there is “a marketplace for this new body of work” but that it’s still “in the very early stages.”

“That will be a good indicator of where the market is,” he said.
In the fledgling artificial intelligence market, Obvious is not the most sought-after group of artists.
Not for everyone
Steven Sacks, owner of the bitforms gallery in New York says his client, the Canadian-Mexican artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer has already made around $600,000 for an AI artwork.
Whereas Obvious’s paintings are fixed, most of Lozano-Hemmer’s works use software to change in real time according to data about each viewer’s perspective.
Other prominent AI artists who are exhibiting their work across the world include Germany’s Mario Klingemann and Turkish-born Refik Anadol.
Klingemann also makes portraits, sometimes tweaking the input data with voluntary glitches to avoid replication. Anadol uses mostly video to produce abstract data-based animations.
Klingemann’s “Memories of Passersby I”, a stream of portraits created by a machine, sold for $40,000 at Sotheby’s in London in March.
Sacks and several other artists AFP spoke to were critical of the “Bellamy” sale last year.
They feel that that painting is not representative of the potential of AI and argue that Obvious is imitating other works whereas they are creating something new.
“For me it was a problem because it wasn’t authentic,” said Sacks, who subscribes to a school of thought that works made by AI should constantly be changing, usually on screens.
Some also criticize Obvious for giving the impression that AI can create works of art without human interference.
“An artist chooses. He lightens, he reinforces. Can a computer do that?” asks French painter Ronan Barrot, who has collaborated with British AI artist Robbie Barrat.
The debate continues to rage. Fautrel of Obvious denies that his collective merely imitates other artworks and sees AI as a “tool” and not an end in itself.
Despite their differences, they all agree the market for AI paintings is growing and that the sale of “Bellamy” has drawn attention to the burgeoning technique.
“I don’t think this new style is for everyone but I think you’re going to start catching the attention of a lot of people that aren’t necessarily art collectors but are very interested in the technology behind AI,” said Sotheby’s Moore.
