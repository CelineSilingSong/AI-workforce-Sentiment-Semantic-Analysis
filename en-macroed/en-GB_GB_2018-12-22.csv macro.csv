This, the forum warned, has huge implications for society as a whole as automation increases.“In an era when human skills are increasingly important and complementary to technology, the world cannot afford to deprive itself of women’s talent in sectors in which talent is already scarce,” it said.OutnumberedIn addition to being outnumbered three to one, the research found that women working in AI are less likely to be positioned in senior roles. The data indicates that women with AI skills tend to be employed in areas such as data analytics, research, information management and teaching, whereas men tend to work in more lucrative and senior positions including as software engineers, heads of engineering or IT, or as chief executives.READ MOREThe Christmas Tech quiz: Test your knowledgeSounds yummy: Heston Blumenthal serves up aural treats in ‘Pod & Chips’Keyword Studios predicts full-year pretax profits of about €37mNo-deal Brexit: New legal structures needed for data transfers across BorderThe forum said given the depth of the problem there is a clear need for proactive measures to prevent a deepening of the gender gap in other industries where AI skills are becoming in demand. These include traditionally male-dominated industries such as manufacturing, hardware and networking as well as software and IT services, as well as traditionally female sectors such as non-profits, healthcare and education.The forum said its findings indicate the need for urgent action with concerns that gender bias could enter the coding process, leading to real-world implications.Reskilling""Industries must proactively hardwire gender parity in the future of work through effective training, reskilling and upskilling interventions and tangible job transition pathways, which will be key to narrowing these emerging gender gaps and reversing the trends we are seeing today.

  Advances in artificial intelligence have led to fears of job losses. This column uses a global survey covering more than 3,000 executives across 14 sectors and ten countries to examine the impact of AI on the demand side of the labour market. Ultimately, the effect on employment will depend on whether companies choose to use current forms of AI for innovation or pure automation, and whether they foresee a return from it.

The computer won the match.Credit...Ahn Young-joon/Associated PressBy Steven StrogatzDec. 26, 2018In early December, researchers at DeepMind, the artificial-intelligence company owned by Google’s parent corporation, Alphabet Inc., filed a dispatch from the frontiers of chess.A year earlier, on Dec. 5, 2017, the team had stunned the chess world with its announcement of AlphaZero, a machine-learning algorithm that had mastered not only chess but shogi, or Japanese chess, and Go. The algorithm started with no knowledge of the games beyond their basic rules. It then played against itself millions of times and learned from its mistakes. In a matter of hours, the algorithm became the best player, human or computer, the world has ever seen.The details of AlphaZero’s achievements and inner workings have now been formally peer-reviewed and published in the journal Science this month. The new paper addresses several serious criticisms of the original claim. (Among other things, it was hard to tell whether AlphaZero was playing its chosen opponent, a computational beast named Stockfish, with total fairness.) Consider those concerns dispelled. AlphaZero has not grown stronger in the past twelve months, but the evidence of its superiority has. It clearly displays a breed of intellect that humans have not seen before, and that we will be mulling over for a long time to come.Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.A version of this article appears in print on Jan. 8, 2019, Section D, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: One Giant Step for a Chess-Playing Machine.

IT InfrastructureGoogle Artificial Intelligence Power Demonstrated in Object-Placing
Due to advancements in object-placing technology, artificial intelligence designers might find the design process flowing easier and more efficiently. December 24, 2018 Jessica Messier Leave a Comment  


In the world of AR, VR and video game design, designers may run into the challenge of inserting certain objects into an image and having it conform to a scene. However, due to new research by Seoul National University, the University of California at Merced, and Google AI, there’s a new system that can make designers’ jobs easier, says Venture Beat.
The new system can learn how to insert an object into an image in a “semantically coherent,” or “convincing” manner; in other words, in a scene depicting a city, pedestrians appear on the sidewalk, and cars appear on the street. The technology, Venture Beat says, can potentially serve as a powerful tool for image editing and scene parsing applications.
Here’s how it works:
The editing technology contains two modules – one determines where certain objects should be in a scene, and the other distinguishes what the objects should look like. These modules leverage two-part neural networks made of generators that produce samples and discriminators that work to determine the created images from real-world images, Venture Beat says.
“Because the system simultaneously models the distribution with respect to an inserted image, it enables both modules to communicate with and optimize each other.” Over time, the system learns different distributions for different categories put in a scene.

Based on Venture Beat’s report, it looks like this solution has been able to outperform the baseline by inserting realistic-looking objects. “When an image recognizer…was applied to images produced by the AI, it was able to detect the synthesized objects with .79 recall. More tellingly, in a survey performed with workers from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, 43 percent thought that the AI-generated objects were real.”
As a result, decision makers in the AR, VR and video game-creation space might consider keeping an eye on this technology, as it might one day make their jobs easier and tighten their work up.
“This shows that our approach is capable of performing the object synthesis and insertion task,” the researchers from Seoul National University, the University of California at Merced and Google AI wrote in their report about the system. “As our method jointly models where and what, it could be used for solving other computer vision problems. One of the interesting future works would be handling occlusions between objects.”

While artificial intelligence in education might appear unnerving for some, the benefits are too great to ignore.
The growth of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Education

There are few spaces in life that haven’t been touched in some form by computer software. Whether it’s shopping, dating, or just keeping up with old friends, everything we do seems to be mediated in some form by computers. 
It shouldn’t surprise us then that how we educate ourselves isn’t immune. 
D2L, a leader in educational software, is the maker of Brightspace Insights, a suite of analytical tools for educators. 
Brightspace is able to capture, aggregate, and analyze data streamed from several different sources, including learning apps, online resources, publishers, and other learning management systems to build a complete model of individual student learning behaviors. 
By pulling this student data into one place, Brightspace can produce reports, predictive data analytics, and visualizations in real time that are fed into an instructor’s workflow. Over time, this can teach the teacher exactly what a student needs to succeed.

“With the previous version of our analytics product, instructors received information on learner success even before they took their first test. But it was only using data based on Brightspace tools,” says Nick Oddson, Senior Vice President of Product development for D2L.
“With the new Brightspace Insights, we can now deliver that same insight, but based on the entire ecosystem of learning tools.”
Until recently, the only way to measure student learning was through tests and assignments, but that only captures a small slice of a student’s education.
Over the course of a student’s educational career, they output an enormous amount of data in the form of papers, exams, and classroom participation that rarely carries over to the next term.
With these new tools, however, student data can be stored an analyzed over time to see what material they engage with more successfully and what educational deficits they may have hidden in their past work that might be inhibiting their future potential.
Personalized Learning: Teaching the Teachers
What all of this data represents is a roadmap for how a student learns. 
By having a fuller understanding of the student on day one, educators are better positioned to utilize their training and skills to address these students’ individual needs from the start, rather than spending weeks or months identifying problems that they’d then have little time to actually address.
According to D2L President John Baker, with software like Brightspace Insights, “we’ve made it easier for instructors to predict and forecast learners at risk, to help them while they’re learning, not just by flagging issues at the end of a term.”
Meanwhile, by having all of a students’ data pulled together and aggregated in advance, these learning management systems help assist the teacher in crafting personalized learning plans for students.
This system works to a student’s strengths rather than approach a classroom full of students and use one approach that works better for some while leaving others behind.

This is one of the most powerful aspects of artificial intelligence in education.
 AIs and machine learning are especially good at identifying patterns that may be opaque to human eyes, so by looking at a student’s educational data, an AI can assist the teacher in identifying the ways individual students comprehend the material. 
Some students thrive by reading assigned materials, while others are inhibited by a wall of text that is more readily understood when presented in a lecture form. 
By identifying these trends in a student’s data, students can be presented material in a more accessible way that won’t leave them behind with a one size fits all approach, creating a personalized learning experience that can improve educational outcomes. 
AI, the Ultimate Teacher Assistant

It might be tempting to think that machine learning and AI can replace classroom instructors, but that misses the essential role that artificial intelligence should play in education, and not just in developing personalized learning plans. 
Machines are dreadful when it comes to tasks requiring emotional intelligence, a skill that is essential for educating a diverse student body. 
Simply putting an AI in front of a classroom is a recipe for disaster as students eager to slough off work learn to game the AI, thereby ruining whatever advantage the AI brings to the wealth of educational data available to it.
Instead, the AI is meant to free the educator from the most time-consuming and monotonous tasks, such as grading exams and checking papers for plagiarism. 
Any teacher will tell you how this work takes up a majority of their time, time that could be better spent using their specialized training to improve the quality of their student’s educations.
By having an AI assisting the teacher, rather than replace them, AI-enhanced education can unleash the educator to fully utilize their training in ways that simply were not possible to earlier generations of educators. 
The Changing Role of the Educator

Naturally, there is some hesitancy when it comes to bringing artificial intelligence into the classroom. 
Teachers over the past couple of decades have been on the receiving end of budget cuts and abuse, leading them to understandably become rather twitchy when someone comes into their classroom with the next big idea that looks an awful lot like a replacement.
But an AI isn’t anywhere close to being capable of doing a skilled educators job, much less outperforming them. Like other industries where artificial intelligence is making inroads and generating anxiety, this is largely a product of a misunderstanding of the underlying technology. 
Proper introduction and teaching the teachers how to harness these new tools in the classroom can go a long way to assuaging the anxieties such technology can create. 
It is vital that we begin to do so. AIs cannot and should not replace teachers, but through personalized learning programs and having AI assist the teacher by eliminating time-consuming paperwork, AIs can be a transformational and liberating innovation in education.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. military is starting to lose a high-tech advantage as China and Russia develop sophisticated artificial intelligence, Pentagon officials are warning Congress.A recent subcommittee hearing on the issue held special significance for Colorado Springs defense subcontractor Polaris Alpha, which last May won a $2.3 million Defense Department contract to develop artificial intelligence systems.If Congress approves more spending on artificial intelligence, Polaris Alpha is likely to be among the winners.The House Armed Services subcommittee on emerging threats and capabilities listened earlier this month as Pentagon officials describe China’s strategic plan for increasing spending on artificial intelligence, or “AI.”Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that develops intelligent machines that work and react like humans, ideally with faster responses and smaller margins for error. Facial recognition technology and self-driving cars are examples.It is used by the Defense Department to identify and respond to military threats and aggression.China spent $12 billion in 2017 on artificial intelligence but plans to increase its budget to at least $70 billion by 2020, according to Defense Department reports. Meanwhile, the U.S. military spent about $7.4 billion for new technology development in fiscal 2017, which included artificial intelligence.“Other nations, particularly China and Russia, are making significant investments in AI for military purposes,” Dana Deasy, the Pentagon’s chief information officer, told the panel.“These investments threaten to erode our technological and operational advantages and destabilize the free and open international order.”The subcommittee called the hearing partly as a response to the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019, which directed the Defense Department to review how artificial intelligence is serving military needs.The measure requires the Pentagon to develop a plan for artificial intelligence. The Polaris Alpha contract is supposed to be one part of the plan.Amber Thompson-Nadler, spokeswoman for Polaris Alpha parent company Parsons, told Colorado Politics that its technology is “enhancing warfighter situational awareness, predicting threats and supporting mission planning.”She added, “AI is an increasingly vital tool in the U.S. military’s arsenal for the simple reason that it provides the warfighter with an asymmetric advantage across the entire spectrum of the modern battlefield.”Colorado Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn is a member of the subcommittee on emerging threats and capabilities. Although he did not speak during the hearing, other members of the Colorado delegation offered strong opinions on military artificial intelligence and Colorado’s role in supporting it.“It’s extremely important we make sure U.S. military technology and capabilities remain ahead of other countries like China and Russia, and Colorado companies can play a major role in this space,” Colorado U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican, said in a statement.Colorado U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican, said, “The United States should aim to lead the world in artificial intelligence research and overall military readiness. It is frightening that the U.S. may have ceded our AI advantage to China, given China’s human rights abuses and aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.”A key component of the Pentagon’s plan is establishment of the Washington-based Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. Announced last summer, it will oversee nearly efforts to develop the technology.Pentagon officials say their first initiative among new artificial intelligence programs is Project Maven.The project uses advanced computer algorithms for “computer vision,” which is a form of machine learning. Analysts can feed data into the system where objects of interest can be automatically extracted, similar to keywords that search and identify information from among billions of data items on Google and other search engines.However, Project Maven more often searches for military threats from among moving or still imagery, such a film footage from airborne drones.
