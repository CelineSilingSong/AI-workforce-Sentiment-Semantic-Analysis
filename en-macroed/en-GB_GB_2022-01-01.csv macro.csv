Has Alexa replaced your kitchen timer? Do you rely on your car’s driver-assist features to regulate your distance from the car in front of you? Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have impacted us all, and the acceleration of digital transformation as a result of the pandemic is expected to continue.
McKinsey’s Global Institute predicts that while AI is being applied to business problems across nearly every sector of the global economy, the effects of AI applications will be felt most in marketing and sales. The research firm notes that AI could unlock as much as $2.6 trillion in business value within the sales and marketing sector.
Starbucks is a good example. Earlier this year, CEO Kevin Johnson, told analysts that the company is relying on AI technology predictions to determine how vaccination rates will impact sales growth.

As retailers like Starbucks begin to feel and assess the impact of AI in the marketplace, so will consumers and, by extension, PR and marketing.
We already use AI-powered tools like Google Analytics and Cision to make our work more efficient and effective. Ideally, technological innovation should reduce the burden of drudgery and elevate people’s work, enabling creativity. AI technologies have the ability to free PR professionals to focus more on creative pursuits like crafting compelling messaging or planning strategic media outreach.
Advances in sentiment analysis, predictive analytics, chatbots and natural language generation (NLG) are already having a direct impact on our industry. According to a recent blog published by Public Relations Today, here are some ways that AI is either helping support public relations activity now or will be in the near future:

Speech-to-text technology – This can assist with media interview transcripts and searching within podcasts or press conferences using speech-to-text technology.
AI-assisted contact recommendations – Though they haven’t been perfected yet, tools exist to proactively identify reporters who are writing about your industry, enabling you to target media most likely to cover your news, rather than manually building traditional media lists on categories and keyword searches.
Predictive analytics – Two PR tech startups focused on predictive analytics offer tools that help you customize story angles for journalists based on interests, past coverage, personalities and trends and predicting the probability of a journalist covering your story.
Video authenticity monitoring – There are even tools that can be used to monitor for “deepfake” videos that could negatively impact your client’s brand reputation.
Natural language generation – As evidenced by the first press release written by AI, machines can produce content using NLG, and translate it into multiple languages for broader distribution. These technologies require refinement, but they are developing quickly.
Sentiment analysis – Tools are also being developed to carry out advanced sentiment analysis on social media posts, media clippings and more.
Attribution for earned media – PR tech tools, like Cision Impact and Onclusive, even promise to attribute sales outcomes to earned media coverage if, for example, a prospective buyer reads an article about your client and then downloads a white paper. This technology is still in its infancy but could be a game changer for an industry hungry for an objective way to prove ROI.

All this potential is wildly exciting, but talk of digital transformation and machine learning inevitably leads to questions of obsolescence: Will AI eventually replace PR pros? A simple mindset shift can alleviate the worry. If we look for the ways technology can make us more effective by freeing us to come up with better ideas and affording us opportunities to explore those ideas, then we will rise with this wave of innovation rather than letting it overpower us.
Is your organization already utilizing AI? How do you plan to incorporate new technologies in the new year?

COMMENT
One Response to “7 ways artificial intelligence will change the game for PR pros”







 Ronald N Levy says: January 5, 2022 at 11:22 am

Artificial Intelligence in PR may never adequately neutralize Genuine Stupidity.
Even ultrabright CEOs can make genuinely stupid assumptions about PR.
ASSUMPTION:  The public’s top interest in Washington controversies about punishing a company is which outcome will be more fair.
PR WISDOM:  The public’s top consideration is likely to be not fairness for the company but which outcome will be better for the public.  If a proposal is to tax a big company more, millions of people may think good, we can use the money.   A proposal to break up a big company is more likely to win if the company allows the advantages of breakup to get more media coverage than “the peril of the alternative,” how the public would suffer.    
ASSUMPTION:  A congressional committee hearing is likely to be an unbiased inquiry.
PR WISDOM:  The majority party prefers an outcome good for that party.  Questions will aim at showing that a company or industry being investigated is guilty and the party in power is heroically trying to protect the public.  Legislators of each party know it’s great for fund-raising and re-election to look like a hero.
ASSUMPTION:  A CEO should feel safe in assuming the media will be satisfied by the answer, “I don’t know but we’re trying to gather the facts.”
PR WISDOM:  “A journalist may skeptically ask “you’re the CEO and you claim you don’t KNOW?”
ASSUMPTION:  A glib CEO is as safe a spokesman as an equally glib PR firm SVP.
PR WISDOM:  When a spokesman blunders as may happen to almost anyone,
it’s easier and often less damaging to fire the PR firm than to fire  the CEO.
ASSUMPTION:  When accused it makes sense to apologize early and emphatically.
PR WISDOM:  Millions of people may see an apology as an admission of guilt
so it may be better to point out that just the opposite is true, that the company is in many ways making things BETTER for the public, not worse.
ASSUMPTION:  The outcome of a controversy will depend mainly on which side makes the more persuasive case to the public.
PR WISDOM:  The outcome will depend largely on the “magnitude of peril” principle of PR—the side likely to win is the side that that credibly forecasts the bigger or sooner damage to the public.  In the coming election, one side may credibly argue which party was more responsible for the January 6th riot.  But if the other party credibly argues “we’re better for your safety, your standard of living and your freedoms,” PR experts can guess which side is more likely to win.  
ASSUMPTION:  The #1 question in PR is “what should we say?”
PR WISDOM:  The #1 question is “what should we BE?”  If you get 100 million or more Americans to see the company correctly as not only beneficial but damn near a blessing to the public, the company is likely to be safer in Washington and to have higher sales.  
“What’s love got to do with it” sang hugely popular Tina Turner.  PR wisdom is “almost everything.”

“Our consciousness is everything. You become what you think about.” Buddha
In the few minutes that you are reading this article, I will tell you about a completely new type of artificial intelligence, I will name the design features and advantages, I will outline the immediate prospects and possible long-term consequences of the introduction of this technology into real life. Together we will touch the future.
This article is the fourth in a series on the nature of human intelligence and the future of artificial intelligence systems. In the previous article, “The secret of human intelligence,” we found out that human intelligence can work as a classical binary system-symbiosis, functioning due to the structural features of transmembrane proteins in ion channels of brain synapses.
At first glance, it might seem that this new and generally extraordinary neurophysiological concept is of interest only to doctors and biologists. But in fact, this idea from the world of neurophysiology opens the opportunity for us to create a very unusual artificial intelligence.

A new type of AI: technological symbiosis against traditional electronic systems
The existing systems of artificial intelligence, with all their features, have one thing in common: they are all built as single vertically controlled electronic complexes that operate using algorithms of varying complexity. Centralized control is an irresistible property of any man-made electronic computing system. We simply do not know how to build otherwise.
But what if we replicate the maneuver of nature and instead of the next modernization of the vertically integrated electronic system, we follow the path of unification to create a technological symbiosis of the human brain and the computer system?
If nature, the creation of our mind went along the path of symbiosis (combining the reflexive and intellectual components). And perhaps this is the shortest and most effective method of modernizing intelligent systems.
New AI system for one user
A new type of artificial intelligence will become a bioelectronic hybrid, in which a living human brain and a machine will work together in a dual complementary system. Both components will complement and reinforce each other, creating something completely new that neither nature nor designers of fully electronic systems have encountered before.
We will get acquainted with a new type of artificial intelligence of an individual type, built around a neurocomputer interface that directly connects the neurons of the human brain and a computer.
The heart of the system, or how will the neurocomputer interface work?
Despite the mesmerizing prospects of this direction, there have been only a few attempts in the world to create an interface connecting the human brain and a computer directly. One of the most famous was Elon Musk’s Neuralink. The weakness of these projects is that they follow the traditional surgical pathway and, as a result, fail to overcome two fundamental obstacles.
The first obstacle is the inaccuracy of individual interpretation of local foci of brain activity. Simply put, the brain of each of us is to a certain extent unique, if we talk about which groups of neurons are responsible for specific functions. But this is still half the trouble. Worse is that, thanks to plasticity, the detailed picture of brain activity is constantly changing.
The second, and truth be told, the main obstacle is the signal crossover point. Basically, this is where the artificial electronic signal becomes a biological nerve impulse and vice versa.
New circuit or how to get rid of wires and surgeons

In the new artificial intelligence system, the transmitting and receiving parts of the neurocomputer interface will be completely separated and, in fact, will be two completely different communication mechanisms.
From biological tissue to computer
The receiving part (responsible for receiving a signal from biological tissue) will be a network of inactive marker objects (ultra-small nano-sized beacons integrated into living tissue) whose state will be remotely monitored by an active external component of the system (scanner). A marker object is a biologically neutral molecular structure (in the field of view of an external scanner), which changes its conformational state in the presence of a nearby weak electrical charge (a neuron at the stage of pulse generation). This technological technique will allow replacing the direct transmission of a signal from living neurons to a computer system for the transmission of information about the existence of such a signal. This will turn the receiving part of the neurocomputer interface into a non-invasive (non-traumatic) mechanism. In such a scheme, there is no need to do expensive surgical procedures, and molecular markers can be injected into the body using a simple intravenous injection.
From machine to biological tissue
The transmitting part (on the way from the computer to the biological tissue) will remotely transmit the signal only to synapses, and not to neurons, as they are trying to do now. The transmitting part of the interface will use marker objects (beacons of the receiving part) as points of orientation in space (addresses of neurons) and sources of feedback.
Interestingly, the signal that will only be transmitted to synapses must be of a non-electrical nature. This will allow us to generate an artificial signal (nerve impulse) in the neurons of the brain that is completely identical to the physiological one. As a result, the neurons of the human brain will experience stimulation of synaptic plasticity and, as a result, they themselves will actively participate in the formation of lines of dynamic interaction with the transmitting part of the neurocomputer interface. The brain tissue itself will build a connection with the transmitting structure of the interface.
In addition, to install such an interface, a person will not need to use the services of highly qualified medical personnel, which will make the system convenient for most users.
What does the movie Matrix have in common with the new AI
It is important to understand that the described scheme will allow controlled excitation and monitoring of the response of a single neuron. This discreteness means that the bandwidth of the interface will be enough to transmit directly to the human brain an artificial reality that is completely indistinguishable from physiological. You will be able not only to see, hear and feel the artificial reality but also actively move in it in the same way as in the real physical world.
Instead of words and letters – only a nervous impulse
Thanks to the new type of neurocomputer interface, the brain and the computer will be able to exchange data directly, without using intermediate communication protocols like sound commands or letter symbols. The brain and the computer will exchange information using a set of impulses of immediate meaning, without symbolic interpretation. As a result, interacting with a machine will feel more like working with intuition than interacting with an electronic device. Mutual adaptation of components (brain and machine) will take quite a long time (from several months to a year), but it will allow ignoring the language barrier and even literacy. Unlike modern computers, even a person who cannot read and write can use the new personal AI system.
Not just an interface
The neurocomputer interface, although the most important part of the complex, is not the only feature of the new artificial intelligence system. When we say a machine or an electronic component of symbiosis, we are talking about a software package that bears little resemblance to traditional artificial intelligence systems.
The core of the electronic part of the new system will be a rather unusual program that works based on direct streaming communication of templates (pre-prepared answers). Since this program will not actually do any calculations, the core of the system will be able to maintain tremendous performance that allows it to create a gigantic volume of data exchange required for synaptic discreteness. Other components of the software package will be enhanced deep learning utilities that do not directly participate in the dialogue with the biological tissue of the brain but provide service and individual adaptation of the core streaming program.
Artificial intelligence of a new type will be individual not only because it will be designed to work with one user, but also because it itself will be the result of direct adaptive interaction of the learning software package with the living brain of a particular person.
In fact, the machine, gradually adopting the behavioral habits of a particular person, will become its artificial reflex (unconscious) part, while the biological brain getting used to the machine (with the help of synaptic plasticity) will increasingly rely on the strength and capabilities of the computer system. In general, thanks to the imperceptible, but constant work of the neurocomputer interface, we will see how a biotechnological neurocomputer symbiosis is formed: a new type of artificial intelligence.
The magic of emergence

Creating artificial intelligence by combining fundamentally different elements (biological tissues and an electronic system), we will be able to achieve the maximum effect of emergence (the birth of new properties that are not inherent in the combined elements separately).
Biotechnological symbiosis will have properties unattainable for a biological brain and a computer system separately.
The human brain is very slow and frankly weak in terms of information processing, an intelligent mechanism, but the biological system has plasticity, creativity, and energy efficiency unattainable for electronic systems. Plus, the living brain is a very experienced tactician who knows very well how the reality of the surrounding three-dimensional space works.
On the other hand, computer systems not only process information faster than us, in fact, in terms of signal transmission speed, they exceed biological tissue by 3 million times! Add to this a digital memory capable of clearly and without failures to manipulate an unimaginable amount of digital data and the ability to easily enter direct communication with any technical device or the Internet.
All this suggests that combining the human brain and computer system into a single complex of artificial intelligence will not only increase their overall efficiency but will create a completely new unusual system: a new type of artificial intelligence.
By combining the brain and the machine, we will see how the real magic of new properties is born: the magic of emergence.
Why is such a system needed right now?
The main reason is the monstrous information explosion. Today, the amount of digital data on the Internet is doubling every 18 months. During the period from 1997 to 2002, mankind produced more information than in the entire previous history.
Now the same amount of data is generated in just a few months. Humanity as a consumer of information is catastrophically lagging itself, and this imbalance is growing literally every minute.
In fact, a person now needs no new information as a product but help in the conditional “digestion” of this product
It is this fact that opens a window of opportunity for new technology. Your personal artificial intelligence system will give you the ability to analyze the entire array of information available on the Internet, and not just what is on the first page of Google search results.
The growing volume of information that humanity creates will make it possible to create millions of IAIs (individual artificial intelligence systems) with ever-increasing performance.
The information consumption of a person equipped with his own AI will be thousands of times greater than the traditional information consumption based on biological (sign or acoustic) communication systems.
Your own artificial intelligence—not only new opportunities for searching the web…
This article is not just about a new system, we are talking about a fundamentally different concept of artificial intelligence (AI). Your individual artificial intelligence system will know you, your personality, your requests, and preferences more accurately and clearly than you, it will be a part of you and at the same time your creation and extension: your digital shadow.
Man will become a living being of a new type
After 5-10 years of coexistence, the complementarity of AI components (brain and computer system) will reach such a level that several complex behavioral and communicative complexes (such as mechanical work or driving a car) can be carried out by the system reflexively (automatically). As a result, a person will be able to perform a huge number of routine actions without straining at all.
The economic business landscape is changing beyond recognition
A personal artificial intelligence system will replace a computer, smartphone, autopilot in a car, and much more. Any human skill and knowledge will become available for purchase or sale in a few minutes on the Internet. The painstaking and exhausting training we are accustomed to will gradually become unnecessary. Most disabilities will lose their limiting component.
Instead of an epilogue
Describing the properties of the new system, I understand that many people find it difficult to believe in the reality of such a technology. But in fact, behind this concept is a huge amount of scientific work done at the end of the last century. Over the past two decades, I have been able to piece together all the details of this extremely complex interdisciplinary project and, based on new data, find solutions for previously unrealizable structural elements.
I understand that the traditional model of neurocomputer interface based on surgical implantation is simpler and more understandable than the idea of ​​using molecular beacons and transmembrane proteins at synapses. But I do not lose hope and continue to look for an opportunity to translate the unthinkable into reality.
Everyone expects a strong AI to be built by an engineer, but in reality, a doctor might be standing at the cradle of real AI.

 Previous articleHow open data servers help optimize performance in fintech?Next articleReinforcement learning for the real world Alex KostikovI am a doctor and an independent researcher. For almost 30 years I have been creating the concept of individual artificial intelligence based on the integration of the human brain and a computer system into a single functional complex united using a scanning-type brain-computer interface. The concept of individual artificial intelligence developed by me is based on the hypothesis of the existence of a dual system of initiation of nerve impulses in the synapses of the human neocortex and the dynamic concept of quantum spin in a new relativistic or high-speed model of our three-dimensional space.
To be honest, I've been doing this all my life.
This is not just a new invention or a new scientific idea. In fact, this is a new reality that is already on our doorstep and will soon change the life of every person.

The tiny android performs when a handler (who must also hold the mic) presses a button, then tells the same jokes in the same order, like a grizzled veteran comic at a down-market Vegas casino.But the robot’s act is more human than it might first appear. Jon is learning how to respond to its audience—it can now vary the timing of its delivery based on the length of the audience’s laughter, and append different responses to jokes based on the level of noise in the room. It can deliver one line if a joke gets a roar of laughter (“Please tell the booking agents how funny that joke was”) and another if there are crickets (“Sorry about that. I think I got caught in a loop. Please tell the booking agents that you like me … that you like me … that you like me”).The prospect of an AI that understands why we are laughing, and that can generate its own genuinely funny material, is sort of a holy grail for a subset of AI researchers. Artificial intelligence can diagnose tumors, read maps and play games, often faster and with more accuracy than humans can.For the moment, however, linguistic humor is still primarily a people thing. Jon can work blue, with a whole bit on robot dating that involves cryptic texts, encrypted text, and the eggplant emoji—but only because a human has written and programmed a set list for it. Finding a way to teach machines to be funny on their own would be a major breakthrough—one that could fundamentally reshape the way we relate to the devices around us. To understand a person’s humor is to know what they like, how they think and how they see the world. An AI that understands all that has the power to do a lot more than just crack jokes.The first step is to attempt to break down the nuts and bolts of human humor. Machines learn by taking vast amounts of data and feeding it through algorithms—in other words, formulas or detailed sets of instructions—in search of patterns or unique features. This process works when it comes to, say, identifying the difference between photos of dogs and photos of cars, but it can effectively destroy a joke, deconstructing it in a painfully unfunny operation. “Explanations are to jokes what autopsies are to bodies: if the subject isn’t already dead, it soon will be,” wrote University College Dublin associate professor Tony Veale in his recent book Your Wit Is My Command: Building AIs With a Sense of Humor.Humans have vast mental libraries of cultural references and linguistic nuances to draw upon when hearing or telling a joke. AI has access only to the information that humans choose to give it, which means that if we want an AI to make us laugh, we have to be clear about the kind of humor we want to teach it.More from TIMETIME Covers of 2021: The Year Inside the Red BorderMore Videos0 seconds of 6 minutes, 44 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9

Live00:0006:4406:44 Read more: An Artificial Intelligence Helped Write This Play. It May Contain RacismOne theory of humor is that the degree to which we find something funny matches the degree to which a joke’s punch line deviates from the listener’s unconscious expectation. Thomas Winters, a doctoral student in artificial intelligence at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, uses this one as a case study: Two fish are in a tank. Says one to the other: “You man the guns, I’ll drive.”“In the beginning, you see this aquarium, this water tank. But then you hear ‘You man the guns, I’ll drive,’ and you’re like, Well, aquariums generally don’t have weaponry or wheels or drivability,” Winters says, in a heroic effort to parse the mechanics of a fish joke. “This mental jump from one interpretation to another one is something that most jokes or things we find funny have.”Jon the Robot and Naomi Fitter perform onstage at the Majestic Theater in Corvallis, Ore., in October 2019Courtesy Naomi FitterFollowing a formula is something AI is exceptionally good at. So are a lot of successful comedy writers.Joe Toplyn broke into comedy in the 1980s, when a friend from the Harvard Lampoon tipped him off that a writing job was opening up at David Letterman’s late-night show. He sent in some jokes—a bit about a periscope–enabled refrigerator made it onto the air—and landed the job. He spent the better part of the next two decades writing for comedy and talk shows, racking up four Emmy awards and head-writer credits at both The Late Show With David Letterman and The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.In 2014 Toplyn published Comedy Writing for Late-Night TV: How to Write Monologue Jokes, Desk Pieces, Sketches, Parodies, Audience Pieces, Remotes, and Other Short-Form Comedy. The book is a distillation of a course he taught in New York City after scrutinizing decades of monologues and reverse engineering the most successful jokes.Toplyn isn’t precious about comedy writing: it’s a job, one that a person can learn to do well if given the right inputs. The jokes that got the biggest laughs for Leno and Letterman follow identifiable formulas populated with “handles”—people, places, things and other references—each with a variety of related associations that can be combined to form a punch line. Given enough time and data, he realized, a computer could potentially learn to make these jokes too.Earlier this year, at the International Conference on Computational Creativity, Toplyn presented a research paper outlining Witscript, a joke–generation system trained on a data set of TV–monologue jokes that detects keywords in entered text and creates a relevant punch line. Unlike other forms of robot comedy, the system—which Toplyn has patented—can generate contextually relevant jokes on the spot in response to a user’s text. A chatbot or voice assistant enabled with the software can respond with humor to users’ queries (when appropriate) without derailing the interaction.Toplyn sees Witscript as an extension of the work he did for decades in late-night TV: making people laugh, and therefore making them feel less alone.“That’s basically the goal,” Toplyn says. “It’s to make chatbots more humanlike, so people will be less lonely.”Very few professionals love the idea that a computer can reliably do their jobs. Comedy writers are no different. When Winters posted a joke—writing software prototype to a Reddit forum for stand-up comics, he got some colorfully worded responses insisting that no machine could replicate the nuance of human comedy.Toplyn counters that critics overlook how much communication follows simple formulas, even the funny kind. “Rodney Dangerfield: ‘I get no respect.’ That’s a formula. Or Jeff Foxworthy: ‘You may be a redneck if.’ There are plenty of formulas in comedy, and some of them are right on the surface,” Toplyn says.There are, obviously, people who do not laugh at the comedy of Jeff Foxworthy, or the light topical banter of a late-night talk show. A separate camp argues that the better use of artificial intelligence in comedy and the arts is as sort of an infinite idea generator freed from the blinders and biases of human thinking, one that can toss up endless themes and potential associations that human writers and performers can run with themselves.Read more: Artificial Intelligence Has a Problem With Gender and Racial Bias. Here’s How to Solve ItPiotr Mirowski was working as a search engineer at Bing when he noticed the similarities between his day job and his personal passion, improv. The principle of search engineering is to teach the computer how to identify the best result for a given query. In improv, Mirowski says, performers are also trained to follow their instincts and do what feels best in that scene. It’s not always perfect, and the results sometimes have a hilarious absurdity, as anyone who has started typing a Google query with the predictive search feature on knows. Mirowski co-founded Improbotics, an international improv troupe that works alongside an AI that tosses out prompts and lines that human performers have to work into the show.“I don’t think it’s really possible to build a true AI-based comedy that relies on understanding the emotions of another person or the context,” he says. “What we can do is to bring that into life ourselves.”Improv comedians often draw upon cues shouted out from the audience. An AI can draw upon ideas from all over the world and across history. The goal isn’t to build a thing that will make the laughs for us, Mirowski says, but instead one that can help humans find new things to laugh about. As with any new technology, its power will come from the way users choose to interact with it, with results that no one may yet have imagined.“I see what we’re doing as kind of like building the electric guitar. It’s not very clear how to play it or what it’s going to do, and it sounds really weird and distorted and there are enough acoustic guitars anyway,” says Kory Mathewson, Improbotics co-founder and cast member and a Montreal-based research scientist with DeepMind. “Then Jimi Hendrix gets an electric guitar, and it’s like, ‘Oh. That’s what this is about.’”On the flip side, of course, a tool with the power to influence and entertain can also be used to exploit. Understanding someone’s sense of humor is a window into how they see the world, what their preferences are, maybe even where they are vulnerable. It’s not a power that people are entirely comfortable with computers having.In one 2019 study, researchers recruited pairs of people who already knew each other as friends, romantic partners or family members. They gave participants a list of jokes and asked them to choose which ones their friend or partner would find funny, based on a limited sample of the person’s responses to other jokes. They had computers guess the same thing, based on the same data, then showed the list to the buddy so that they could verify which gags they liked. The machines predicted people’s favorite jokes more accurately than their friends or partners did.The computers performed better than humans at guessing which jokes a participant would like in a second experiment as well. But in this one, people liked the recommended jokes less if they thought they came from a machine. They didn’t trust them. Other studies have also found that people rate humor as one of the tasks they trust humans with far more than AI, along with writing news articles, composing songs and driving trucks (all of which AI has some success in doing). Jokes are about a shared view of the world, a willingness to violate the same norms and laugh at the same things. We know what it means when a friend sends something along and says, “I thought you’d find this funny.” What’s a robot getting at when it does the same thing? And who ultimately benefits if its humor wins us over?There’s a common saying that robots should do the jobs that are too dirty, dangerous or dull for humans. Comedy can be all of those things, but we still want it for ourselves.As for Jon the Robot, its live appearances have so far been limited to a series of pre-pandemic shows. The act is not at the point where it might threaten the livelihood of Netflix-special-level comedians—yet. Before powering down, Jon always signs off with the same line: “If you like me, please book me and help me take your jobs.”",VideoObject,,TIME Covers of 2021: The Year Inside the Red Border,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/zZq2Xa5Z/poster.jpg?width=720,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6132544/artificial-intelligence-humor/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",2021-12-13T12:52:00.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/zZq2Xa5Z.m3u8,https://time.com/6132544/artificial-intelligence-humor/,PT6M44S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 10 Tech Trends That Will Transform Our WorldAdobe Stock

Trend 1: Ubiquitous computing

These days, computers are all around us: in our pockets, on our wrists, in our cars, even in our household appliances…

As processing power has increased and the size of computer microchips has shrunk, we’ve quickly become used to computers and devices getting smaller, lighter, cheaper, more powerful, and more ubiquitous. (As an example, the average smartphone today is more powerful than the supercomputers of 10 years ago.) Looking ahead, probably the next big leap in computing power will come from quantum computers – computers that are so fast and powerful, they could be used to complete new, previously impossible tasks that traditional computers aren’t capable of.

Trend 2: Connected and smart everything
No doubt you’re familiar with the Internet of Things (IoT) from devices like smart TVs, smartwatches, and smart thermostats. The IoT refers to the increasing number of intelligent, connected devices and objects that are capable of gathering and transmitting data.
In the future, anything that can be connected, will be. Not just in terms of devices and products – although that is obviously a key consideration for businesses – but also the spaces in which we live and work. From smart, connected factories and offices to entire smart cities, the spaces around us will increasingly be equipped with the ability to monitor what’s going on and act accordingly.

Trend 3: The datafication of our world
Ubiquitous computing and the IoT are both huge contributors to the sheer volume of data that’s being generated on a daily basis. But alongside this machine-generated data, we humans are also generating masses of data through our daily activities, and this shows no signs of slowing down.

The good news is businesses can use this data to design better products and services, improve business processes, enhance decision making and even create new revenue sources. But businesses must also be aware of the risks posed by data, particularly around data privacy and security.

Trend 4: Artificial intelligence (AI)
All that data being generated is a core enabler for AI, which has made incredible leaps in the last few years, particularly when it comes to “conversational AI.” In 2020 alone, smart speakers answered 100 billion voice commands – 75 percent more than in 2019 – all thanks to AI.
The takeaway for businesses is that, as our interactions with machines become increasingly intelligent, customers will expect all manner of products and services to feature some sort of AI capability.
Trend 5: Extended Reality (XR)
XR is an umbrella term representing the spectrum of immersive technologies: virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality.
XR was primarily known for immersive gaming, but nowadays, it is deployed across a wide range of industries, where it is being used to create more immersive, personalized experiences for customers and employees. For example, customers can now try out products virtually – such as digitally placing a new sofa in their living room to see how it looks – and employees can learn in immersive, interesting new ways.
In the future, I believe our experience of the world will increasingly take place in this blurred space between the real world and the digital one, and XR is only going to accelerate this shift. Companies must therefore begin to consider how they will accommodate this, and create immersive experiences for their customers and employees.
Trend 6: Digital trust
Digital trust is essentially the confidence users place in organizations to build a secure digital world, where transactions and interactions can take place safely, securely, and easily.
Many – myself included – believe blockchain and distributed ledger technology will play a central role in raising digital trust and making interactions more secure. That said, the technology has some way to go before it’s truly accessible for all types of organizations. For many businesses, the answer may lie in partnering with the many new innovators and entrepreneurs who are making real headway in the blockchain space.
Trend 7: 3D printing
These days, the materials used for 3D printing can be pretty much anything: plastic, metal, powder, concrete, liquid, even chocolate. Entire houses can now be 3D printed.
This has the potential to transform manufacturing. In short, 3D printing gives manufacturers the ability to make things that can’t easily be produced with traditional methods, to streamline the manufacturing process, and create highly personalized products (even completely unique one-offs), all while eliminating waste and reducing costs.
Trend 8: Gene-editing and synthetic biology
Gene editing can have particular advantages when “bad” genes are detected – genes that could endanger the health of an organism or its descendants. Thanks to new gene-editing technology, these harmful characteristics can, in theory, be altered. In this way, gene editing could deliver some drastic leaps forward in the fight against disease – in humans, animals, and crops.
While gene-editing tools can be used to make small changes to DNA, synthetic biology can involve stitching together long strands of DNA and inserting them into an organism. As a result, the organism may behave differently or have entirely new abilities.
What’s this got to do with businesses? I believe synthetic biology and gene editing may drastically alter the way we produce products. Think of exciting new products such as cultured meat, and it’s easy to see how transformative these technologies could be.
Trend 9: Nanotechnology and materials science
Materials science (the discipline of studying and manipulating materials) and nanotechnology (the science of controlling matter on a tiny scale, at the atomic and molecular level) have already given us some incredible advances, from tiny computer chips, smartphone displays, and lithium-ion batteries, to stain-resistant fabrics.
Looking ahead, this trend could deliver major breakthroughs in electric car batteries, make solar energy more affordable, and deliver other advances that will make the world a better place.
Trend 10: New energy solutions
Nuclear fusion is often touted as the clean and potentially inexhaustible energy solution for the future, but there’s a problem – maintaining a fusion reaction takes more energy than it produces! But now, thanks to advances in magnet technology, we may see a nuclear fusion reactor deliver a net power output by 2035.
Another exciting zero-carbon energy solution is green hydrogen (which is different from traditional ""grey hydrogen"" production). With green hydrogen, water is split into hydrogen and water, without creating any byproducts, through a process of electrolysis. Historically, this process took so much electricity; green hydrogen was basically unfeasible. But renewable electricity sources may change this. For example, as excess renewable electricity is becoming available on the grid, that excess energy could, in theory, be used to drive the electrolysis of water.
The key lesson from all these trends is we’re entering an era of continual and rapid evolution, where multiple tech trends combine and feed into each other to deliver huge changes. For businesses, this means the days of incremental tech upgrades are gone forever. Continual change is the way of the future.

Will Artificial Intelligence Take Over Your Job in 2022?







Zia Muhammad


1/01/2022 06:30:00 PM









We have been worried about artificial intelligence (AI) and other kinds of robots taking over our jobs for quite some time now. Techno paranoia is by no means a new phenomenon, and it manifests itself in a wide range of ways including situations where people will be concerned about the impact that automation might have on their careers. With the new year right around the corner, what are the chances that AI might make you unemployed in 2022? People’s opinions on this are quite varied.The group that is perhaps most fearful of losing their jobs to an AI based program is that of college graduates. Over 69% of people that have completed a college degree fear that they might not be able to get a job or that AI will make their job more or less redundant in the coming years since it would more than likely be able to do whatever job they can handle in a much more efficient manner and they would cost a lot less too. If you look at all of the respondents to the survey as a whole, you would notice that the average is around 55% for people that are afraid to losing jobs to AI. Hence, college graduates seem to be disproportionately worried about this sort of thing occurring with all things having been considered and taken into account. However, if we were to break down the responses and sort them out by the category of job that we are looking at, it becomes clear that virtually everyone is fearful of the impact of AI. For example, about 63% of respondents felt that the role of cashiers will be fulfilled by AI in the coming years. This has already started to occur, with Amazon creating stores that you can walk in and out of and your payment will be automatically calculated and deducted from your bank account or some other source of funds. The practicality of such a setup is yet to be tested, but suffice it to say that it already exists in the modern day and many fast food companies are experimenting with this as well. 52% of respondents also said that they felt that the jobs of drivers could be automated and made redundant. This might have something or the other to do with the rise of driverless cars which use a computer program and an algorithm to make it so that you don’t have to take the wheel. While these types of cars still have a long way to go before they can become the global standard, they have been getting better on a regular basis and might make traffic jams less prevalent than they are right now. With all of that having been said and now out of the way, it is important to note that not all of the views that people have about AI are negative. If we were to take the example of the economy, around 45% of respondents felt that AI could do a lot of good in this regard. These respondents felt that if AI were made responsible for things like fiscal policy and the like it could reduce the prevalence of corruption and create a smoother type of system for everyone to enjoy. However, that doesn’t mean that everyone agrees that this is a good idea. 29% of respondents felt that doing so would be disastrous for the economy, but a plurality appear to think otherwise. The fact of the matter is that opinions regarding AI are mixed, but this has absolutely no impact on its growth this year. It will continue to grow in 2022 and the changes that are coming would need to be dealt with as and when they arrive so that people can get accustomed to a new way of living.

Given China’s track record of leveraging AI for mass surveillance, it’s tempting to view these initiatives as little more than a fig leaf to cover widespread abuses of human rights. But that response risks ignoring regulatory changes with major implications for global AI development and national security. Anyone who wants to compete against, cooperate with, or simply understand China’s AI ecosystem must examine these moves closely.
These recent initiatives show the emergence of three different approaches to AI governance, each championed by a different branch of the Chinese bureaucracy, and each at a different level of maturity. Their backers also pack very different bureaucratic punches. It’s worth examining the three approaches and their backers, along with how they will both complement and compete with each other, to better understand where China’s AI governance is heading.



Three Approaches to Chinese AI Governance


Organization
Focus of Approach
Relevant Documents




Cyberspace Administration of China
Rules for online algorithms, with a focus on public opinion
- Internet Information Service Algorithmic Recommendation Management Provisions
			- Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Overall Governance of Internet Information Service Algorithms


China Academy of Information and Communications Technology
Tools for testing and certification of “trustworthy AI” systems
- Trustworthy AI white paper
			- Trustworthy Facial Recognition Applications and Protections Plan


Ministry of Science and Technology
Establishing AI ethics principles and creating tech ethics review boards within companies and research institutions
- Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Ethical Governance of Science and Technology
			- Ethical Norms for New Generation Artificial Intelligence



The strongest and most immediately influential moves in AI governance have been made by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), a relatively new but very powerful regulator that writes the rules governing certain applications of AI. The CAC’s approach is the most mature, the most rule-based, and the most concerned with AI’s role in disseminating information.
The CAC made headlines in August 2021 when it released a draft set of thirty rules for regulating internet recommendation algorithms, the software powering everything from TikTok to news apps and search engines. Some of those rules are China-specific, such as the one stipulating that recommendation algorithms “vigorously disseminate positive energy.” But other provisions break ground in ongoing international debates, such as the requirement that algorithm providers be able to “give an explanation” and “remedy” situations in which algorithms have infringed on user rights and interests. If put into practice, these types of provisions could spur Chinese companies to experiment with new kinds of disclosure and methods for algorithmic interpretability, an emerging but very immature area of machine learning research.
Soon after releasing its recommendation algorithm rules, the CAC came out with a much more ambitious effort: a three-year road map for governing all internet algorithms. Following through on that road map will require input from many of the nine regulators that co-signed the project, including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).
The second approach to AI governance has emerged out of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), an influential think tank under the MIIT. Active in policy formulation and many aspects of technology testing and certification, the CAICT has distinguished its method through a focus on creating the tools for measuring and testing AI systems. This work remains in its infancy, both from technical and regulatory perspectives. But if successful, it could lay the foundations for China’s larger AI governance regime, ensuring that deployed systems are robust, reliable, and controllable.
In July 2021, the CAICT teamed up with a research lab at the Chinese e-commerce giant JD to release the country’s first white paper on “trustworthy AI.” Already popular in European and U.S. discussions, trustworthy AI refers to many of the more technical aspects of AI governance, such as testing systems for robustness, bias, and explainability. The way the CAICT defines trustworthy AI in its core principles looks very similar to the definitions that have come out of U.S. and European institutions, but the paper was notable for how quickly those principles are being converted into concrete action.
The CAICT is working with China’s AI Industry Alliance, a government-sponsored industry body, to test and certify different kinds of AI systems. In November 2021, it issued its first batch of trustworthy AI certifications for facial recognition systems. Depending on the technical rigor of implementation, these types of certifications could help accelerate progress on algorithmic interpretability—or they could simply turn into a form of bureaucratic rent seeking. On policy impact, the CAICT is often viewed as representing the views of the powerful MIIT, but the MIIT’s leadership has yet to issue its own policy documents on trustworthy AI. Whether it does will be a strong indicator of the bureaucratic momentum behind this approach.
Finally, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) has taken the lightest of the three approaches to AI governance. Its highest-profile publications have focused on laying down ethical guidelines, relying on companies and researchers to supervise themselves in applying those principles to their work.
In July 2021, MOST published guidelines that called for universities, labs, and companies to set up internal review committees to oversee and adjudicate technology ethics issues. Two months later, the main AI expert committee operating under MOST released its own set of ethical norms for AI, with a special focus on weaving ethics into the entire life cycle of development. Since then, MOST has been encouraging leading tech companies to establish their own ethics review committees and audit their own products.
MOST’s approach is similar to those of international organizations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which have released AI principles and encouraged countries and companies to adopt them. But in the Chinese context, that tactic feels quite out of step with the country’s increasingly hands-on approach to technology governance, a disconnect that could undermine the impact of MOST’s efforts.
One unanswered question is how these three approaches will fit together. Chinese ministries and administrative bodies are notoriously competitive with one another, constantly jostling to get their pet initiatives in front of the country’s central leadership in hopes that they become the chosen policies of the party-state. In this contest, the CAC’s approach appears to have the clear upper hand: It is the most mature, the most in tune with the regulatory zeitgeist, and it comes from the organization with the most bureaucratic heft. But its approach can’t succeed entirely on its own. The CAC requires that companies be able to explain how their recommendation algorithms function, and the tools or certifications for what constitutes explainable AI are likely to come from the CAICT. In addition, given the sprawling and rapidly evolving nature of the technology, many practical aspects of trustworthy AI will first surface in the MOST-inspired ethics committees of individual companies.
The three-year road map for algorithmic governance offers a glimpse of some bureaucratic collaboration. Though the CAC is clearly the lead author, the document includes new references to algorithms being trustworthy and to companies setting up ethics review committees, additions likely made at the behest of the other two ministries. There may also be substantial shifts in bureaucratic power as AI governance expands to cover many industrial and social applications of AI. The CAC is traditionally an internet-focused regulator, and future regulations for autonomous vehicles or medical AI may create an opening for a ministry like the MIIT to seize the regulatory reins.
The potential impact of these regulatory currents extends far beyond China. If the CAC follows through on certain requirements for algorithmic transparency and explainability, China will be running some of the world’s largest regulatory experiments on topics that European regulators have long debated. Whether Chinese companies are able to meet these new demands could inform analogous debates in Europe over the right to explanation.
On the security side, as AI systems are woven deeper into the fabrics of militaries around the world, governments want to ensure those systems are robust, reliable, and controllable for the sake of international stability. The CAICT’s current experiments in certifying AI systems are likely not game-ready for those kinds of high-stakes deployment decisions. But developing an early understanding of how Chinese institutions and technologists approach these questions could prove valuable for governments who may soon find themselves negotiating over aspects of autonomous weapons and arms controls.
With 2022 marking a major year in the Chinese political calendar, the people and bureaucracies building out Chinese AI governance are likely to continue jostling for position and influence. The results of that jostling warrant close attention from AI experts and China watchers. If China’s attempts to rein in algorithms prove successful, they could imbue these approaches with a kind of technological and regulatory soft power that shapes AI governance regimes around the globe.

In some respects, there's a data-driven beauty gold rush happening. You may remember Proven founder Ming Zhao pitch her bespoke skin care on Shark Tank — products formulated based on environment, diet, age, and dozens of other factors — or heard of Singapore-based Yours skin care, which offers custom products for acne, pigmentation, and many other concerns. Then there are brands, like Curology, which use the expertise of medically-trained providers (doctors, physician assistants), to create unique formulations that target breakouts, fine lines, and other skin concerns. Similarly, there is Docent, which employs medical doctors to assess a makeup-free selfie and vanity shelfie before shipping your skin prescription.AdvertisementMachine learning is even being used to improve the subscription box model. ""We use data to connect customers to products that work and curate high-performing skin-care routines that they never would have assembled on their own,"" says Katrina Moreno Lewis, founder and CEO of Kura Skin, a quarterly subscription box that offers a complete, bespoke routine — from cleanser to sunscreen — that starts at $99 or can be purchased as a one-off.YoursYours Skin Care$75 Shop NowCurologyCurology$20 Shop NowQuickly and effectively calming redness, fading melasma, and beating breakouts with the help of technology sounds like a dream, but this data-driven trend brings up important questions. First, can an at-home quiz really unlock the secret to healthier skin?""Self-reported data has limits,"" says Corey L. Hartman, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist based in Birmingham, Alabama, explaining that the very language we use to describe our skin concerns is up for interpretation. ""There aren't very many specific parameters or criteria for some of these terms that we put a lot of credibility on."" For example, he says the reason why medical papers don’t use the terms ""dry,"" ""oily,"" or ""combination"" is that they mean different things to different people. ""These are things that we talk about in beauty spaces and marketing, but in terms of real scientific data, there's nothing that's tied to that, so what does it really mean?""Another question to consider is how our personal health data is being stored and used. Margaret Foster Riley, a health privacy expert and professor of law at The University of Virginia, raises a few red flags about this growing trend. ""Sometimes you'll see companies will assert that they'll never sell or use your data improperly but what’s unclear is what happens in a succession context,"" she says, noting that your data might not be protected in a bankruptcy or acquisition (both common with startups).Then there are potential long-term risks: ""A lot of people [who willingly provide their data to companies] are young and healthy and not thinking of the impact that might be with health insurance or, even in some contexts, employment,"" Riley adds. ""They go into it willing to share everything, then, later on, they recognize that if things come out they may have an obligation to share it with a long-term care company or a life insurance company and they weren't thinking about that at the time."" It gets more complicated when more-in depth tests are involved, a natural progression of the trend we are undoubtedly going to see increasing.KuraKura$99 Shop NowVeracity SelfcareVeracity Selfcare$149 Shop NowTake Veracity Selfcare, the New York City-based startup's process starts with a $149 mail-in spit test, but unlike genealogy companies like 23andMe that look at DNA, it's checking hormones — like estrogen and testosterone — and pH levels. ""Our test results give women real insights into the state of their hormones and offer solutions that will improve their skin health, from skin-care products and ingredients they should use to diet and lifestyle recommendations tailored to their unique biofactors,"" says founder and CEO Allie Egan. Right now, the tech is geared towards women, but Egan says they plan to expand to men in the future. ""We focus on women because we test estrogen and progesterone, which are female dominant hormones, but have had men take the test,"" she says. ""In the future, we'll be able to provide more customized insight for men.""For example, if Veracity's test shows low estrogen levels, which could mean decreased collagen production, its algorithm would then prompt the website to recommend a collagen-boosting serum or something from its own line of products, like its Bioevolve Serum for $85 or Bioevolve Moisturizer for $75.Most PopularWellnessEach Zodiac Sign's Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellyHairMegan Thee Stallion Has Never Worn This Dreamy, Pastel Hair Color Combo BeforeBy Kara NesvigNailsMegan Fox's New French Manicure Was Traditional Until...By Marci RobinIt sounds great in theory, but Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist Karyn Grossman, M.D., brings up an additional point to consider when submitting bodily fluids. ""Your hormones fluctuate significantly over a month if you are not pregnant and not using hormone-based birth control,"" she says. ""So, calculating 'abnormal' vs 'normal' levels in women between the ages of 12 and 45 may be somewhat difficult.""Furthermore, Dr. Grossman adds that blood tests performed in a doctor's office are more accurate than spit tests and understanding your hormones is very nuanced, so a trip to the derm could end up being a better bet for clearing your skin. Veracity's Egan agrees that these tests shouldn't replace a visit to the doctor. Instead, they're meant to empower a new mindset of better understanding one's body.Another thing to understand is that the level of customization is different for each company. Final skin-care formulations should be tested for safety, stability, efficacy, package compatibility, and more, so it's unlikely a truly custom formula will show up on your door at competitive prices. While each brand is different, Maupin describes Atolla's serum customization process as ""modular"" and says stability testing is done on all components and efficacy testing is performed on the formula's bases. ""It's hard to give an exact number [of formulas we've created] since formulas are being added and removed with the data,"" she says. ""Generally, it's in the thousands!""Of course, if a formula works, does it really matter how custom is custom? Allure spoke to several people who have tried the custom trend and the reviews were mixed. ""It got rid of [my] hormonal acne, [and] I have recommended it to other people with problem skin if they can't get into a dermatologist,"" one woman told us, but another was left disappointed: ""The cleanser also was just so basic and soapy and it came way too often.""Still, the vast majority of users thought it was somewhere in the middle. ""I was pretty bummed because it was kind of expensive,"" one man told us after using a service for six months. ""[It] felt kind of generic and not as customized as they made it sound."" This sentiment was echoed through many interviews: ""I did it for two months and saw zero changes in my skin,"" one woman told us. ""Maybe they just went lighter on the ingredients to be safe, but the quiz was very in-depth so I thought it would be at my skin's level.""Most PopularWellnessEach Zodiac Sign's Unique Personality TraitsBy Aliza KellyHairMegan Thee Stallion Has Never Worn This Dreamy, Pastel Hair Color Combo BeforeBy Kara NesvigNailsMegan Fox's New French Manicure Was Traditional Until...By Marci RobinIf you do decide to partake, our experts suggest treating it as a fresh option, not the holy grail.

Atolla collects its data points through a quiz that covers the participant's skin goals and history, allergies, current product routine, medications, and lifestyle; a mail-in skin test that seeks to measure hydration and sebum levels through a blotting paper-like tool; and a selfie that helps remote aestheticians assess concerns. (Since Atolla's products are over the counter, it employs skin experts to educate the consumer instead of doctors able to treat skin issues, Maupin explains.)
Its algorithm then compares your data to other users who have similar skin concerns — seeing what worked for them — and scans for ingredient conflicts in your routine before generating a customized serum, which it will auto-ship to the customer for $39 a month or bundle with a cleanser and moisturizer for $69 per month. ""For customers with acne or breakouts, we're able to titrate your dosage of active ingredients up or down each month in response to your skin progress,"" Maupin adds.
Atolla is just one of many new companies that understand the monetary value of data, the appeal of bespoke personal-care products, and the power of a subscription model. In some respects, there's a data-driven beauty gold rush happening. You may remember Proven founder Ming Zhao pitch her bespoke skin care on Shark Tank — products formulated based on environment, diet, age, and dozens of other factors — or heard of Singapore-based Yours skin care, which offers custom products for acne, pigmentation, and many other concerns.
Then there are brands, like Curology, which use the expertise of medically-trained providers (doctors, physician assistants), to create unique formulations that target breakouts, fine lines, and other skin concerns. Similarly, there is Docent, which employs medical doctors to assess a makeup-free selfie and vanity shelfie before shipping your skin prescription.
Machine learning is even being used to improve the subscription box model. ""We use data to connect customers to products that work and curate high-performing skin-care routines that they never would have assembled on their own,"" says Katrina Moreno Lewis, founder and CEO of Kura Skin, a quarterly subscription box that offers a complete, bespoke routine — from cleanser to sunscreen — that starts at $99 or can be purchased as a one-off.
Quickly and effectively calming redness, fading melasma, and beating breakouts with the help of technology sounds like a dream, but this data-driven trend brings up important questions. First, can an at-home quiz really unlock the secret to healthier skin?
""Self-reported data has limits,"" says Corey L. Hartman, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist based in Birmingham, Alabama, explaining that the very language we use to describe our skin concerns is up for interpretation. ""There aren't very many specific parameters or criteria for some of these terms that we put a lot of credibility on.""
For example, he says the reason why medical papers don’t use the terms ""dry,"" ""oily,"" or ""combination"" is that they mean different things to different people. ""These are things that we talk about in beauty spaces and marketing, but in terms of real scientific data, there's nothing that's tied to that, so what does it really mean?""
Another question to consider is how our personal health data is being stored and used. Margaret Foster Riley, a health privacy expert and professor of law at The University of Virginia, raises a few red flags about this growing trend. ""Sometimes you'll see companies will assert that they'll never sell or use your data improperly but what’s unclear is what happens in a succession context,"" she says, noting that your data might not be protected in a bankruptcy or acquisition (both common with startups).
Then there are potential long-term risks: ""A lot of people [who willingly provide their data to companies] are young and healthy and not thinking of the impact that might be with health insurance or, even in some contexts, employment,"" Riley adds. ""They go into it willing to share everything, then, later on, they recognize that if things come out they may have an obligation to share it with a long-term care company or a life insurance company and they weren't thinking about that at the time."" It gets more complicated when more-in depth tests are involved, a natural progression of the trend we are undoubtedly going to see increasing.
Take Veracity Selfcare, the New York City-based startup's process starts with a $149 mail-in spit test, but unlike genealogy companies like 23andMe that look at DNA, it's checking hormones — like estrogen and testosterone — and pH levels. ""Our test results give women real insights into the state of their hormones and offer solutions that will improve their skin health, from skin-care products and ingredients they should use to diet and lifestyle recommendations tailored to their unique biofactors,"" says founder and CEO Allie Egan. 

Right now, the tech is geared towards women, but Egan says they plan to expand to men in the future. ""We focus on women because we test estrogen and progesterone, which are female dominant hormones, but have had men take the test,"" she says. ""In the future, we'll be able to provide more customized insight for men.""

For example, if Veracity's test shows low estrogen levels, which could mean decreased collagen production, its algorithm would then prompt the website to recommend a collagen-boosting serum or something from its own line of products, like its Bioevolve Serum for $85 or Bioevolve Moisturizer for $75.
It sounds great in theory, but Los Angeles-based board-certified dermatologist Karyn Grossman, M.D., brings up an additional point to consider when submitting bodily fluids. ""Your hormones fluctuate significantly over a month if you are not pregnant and not using hormone-based birth control,"" she says. ""So, calculating 'abnormal' vs 'normal' levels in women between the ages of 12 and 45 may be somewhat difficult.""
Furthermore, Dr. Grossman adds that blood tests performed in a doctor's office are more accurate than spit tests and understanding your hormones is very nuanced, so a trip to the derm could end up being a better bet for clearing your skin. Veracity's Egan agrees that these tests shouldn't replace a visit to the doctor. Instead, they're meant to empower a new mindset of better understanding one's body.
Another thing to understand is that the level of customization is different for each company. Final skin-care formulations should be tested for safety, stability, efficacy, package compatibility, and more, so it's unlikely a truly custom formula will show up on your door at competitive prices. While each brand is different, Maupin describes Atolla's serum customization process as ""modular"" and says stability testing is done on all components and efficacy testing is performed on the formula's bases. ""It's hard to give an exact number [of formulas we've created] since formulas are being added and removed with the data,"" she says. ""Generally, it's in the thousands!""
Of course, if a formula works, does it really matter how custom is custom? Allure spoke to several people who have tried the custom trend and the reviews were mixed. ""It got rid of [my] hormonal acne, [and] I have recommended it to other people with problem skin if they can't get into a dermatologist,"" one woman told us, but another was left disappointed: ""The cleanser also was just so basic and soapy and it came way too often.""
Still, the vast majority of users thought it was somewhere in the middle. ""I was pretty bummed because it was kind of expensive,"" one man told us after using a service for six months. ""[It] felt kind of generic and not as customized as they made it sound."" This sentiment was echoed through many interviews: ""I did it for two months and saw zero changes in my skin,"" one woman told us. ""Maybe they just went lighter on the ingredients to be safe, but the quiz was very in-depth so I thought it would be at my skin's level.""
If you do decide to partake, our experts suggest treating it as a fresh option, not the holy grail. ""I think these sound fun, and maybe kind of cool and interesting,"" Grossman says. ""But I don't believe that the current trend is much more than marketing.""
If nothing else, we know there's a wave of customized products and alternative care on the horizon — just make sure you read the fine print.

While COVID-19 forced an emergency transformation to online learning at universities, learning how to teach efficiently and effectively online using different platforms and tools is a positive addition to education and is here to stay.
To sustain this beneficial evolution and ensure quality education, universities should focus on supporting faculty to embrace and lead the change. 
The ethical and strategic use of artificial intelligence at centres of teaching and learning, which support faculty in troubleshooting and innovating their online teaching practices, can help with this task. Centres of teaching and learning are responsible for educational technology support, teaching and learning support, as well as instructional design.
Expansive move to online education
Research conducted at 19 centres of teaching and learning and their equivalents from Canada, the United States, Lebanon, the United Kingdom and France published in August 2020 showed that staff in these centres deployed all available resources to support the rapid switch to online education. 
Staff had been working 10- to 14-hour workdays during the first phase of the pandemic to meet the increase in faculty and staff needs. These centres also reported difficulty recruiting and training qualified candidates. 
Used strategically, chatbots could take over repetitive low-level guidance tasks that teaching and learning centres field and help avoid overload. A chatbot, also called a conversational or virtual agent, is a software or computer system designed to communicate with humans using natural language processing.
This communication can be via text messages or voice commands.



Centres for teaching and learning need to be equipped to support faculty with their teaching.


Why a chatbot?
Chatbots offer a viable, win-win solution to teaching and learning centres and to faculty. They are available 24/7, can respond to thousands of simultaneous requests and provide instant and robust service support when needed. 
Using chatbots could free teams for complex inquiries that require human interventions, such as transforming teaching approaches and collaborating to innovate solutions to respond to problems like improving equity and access in online teaching.

A collaboration between the centres’ experts and technology could provide better services and support for faculty to improve the learning experiences they create for students. Chatbots can guide faculty towards appropriate and effective resources and professional development activities, such as how-to articles, tutorials and upcoming workshops. These would be tailored to suit faculties’ individual needs, their varied digital skills levels and backgrounds in designing hybrid learning experiences.
Chatbot systems are already used in educational institutions for teaching and learning, to deliver administrative tasks, to advise students and assist them in research. 
How would it work?
Two options are possible when it comes to chatbots’ AI conversational ability:

Artificial Intelligence Markup Language methodology: Programmers give the AI a library of questions/answers and keyword associations through a database. From there, the chatbot is able to give appropriate answers in a strictly defined frame.
The Natural Language Processing approach: This allows for more flexibility. Once programmers build an initial dataset, the AI-powered tool will then learn from ongoing exchanges to find the best combination of answers to recurring questions asked by faculty members. The AI will then be able to identify keywords in a sentence and understand the context of a question. 

That programmers would need to add data from the conversation to an ongoing dataset building throughout time is expected. When asked a question, the chatbot will respond based on its current knowledge database. If the conversation introduces a concept that it isn’t programmed to understand, the chatbot can state it doesn’t understand the question — or pass the communication to a human operator.
Either way, the chatbot will also learn from this interaction as well as future interactions. Thus, the chatbot will gradually grow in scope and gain relevance.



Chatbot implementation scenario for teaching and learning centres to support faculty.
(Nadia Naffi)


For chatbots’ reliability and trustworthiness to increase, it should be effective in helping these centres supporting their faculty. Implementing and fine tuning chatbots so they are ready for use is important, even if it requires an investment of time and resources.
Ethical framework for AI in education
The Institute for Ethical AI in Education, based at the University of Buckingham in the United Kingdom, and funded by McGraw Hill, Microsoft Corporation, Nord Anglia Education and Pearson PLC, released The Ethical Framework for AI in Education in 2020. The framework argues AI systems should increase the capacity of organizations and the autonomy of learners while respecting human relationships and ensuring human control.
Chatbots in university settings should be ethical by design, meaning that they should be designed to be sensitive to values like security, safety and accountability and transparency. If used in centres of teaching and learning, users should be protected against all forms of harm or abuse. They also need to feel treated fairly and to always be provided the option to reach a human. Faculty members must know they are exchanging with an AI. 
Chatbots can and should be accessible. Tolerating user errors and input variation, being designed for diverse abilities and allowing multilingual texting communication are examples of facilitating accessibility.
Do no harm: privacy
Chatbots should be designed to “do no harm,” as per the UNESCO’s recent recommendations on the ethics of artificial intelligence. When talking about non-maleficence, privacy should be addressed. 
AI-powered tools come with data recording issues. Strong barriers in data collection and storage are needed. Following the European approach to data protection, centres should minimize data collection. Only required information should be stored, such as specific parts of conversations, but not the interlocutors’ identity. 
The transparency-based approach allows for users to agree on which personal data can be shared or not with the centres. This would help keep trust and usability of the tool high. In case of malfunction, faculty members would provide feedback on the problem, and centres would fix it.
Centres should consider anonymization of users, strong encryption of all data stored, and in-house storage when possible or by a trusted contracted third party following similar data privacy rules. 



Data collection should be minimized to protect user privacy.

Addressing bias, environmental impact
The possible bias in the initial database needs to be addressed. Whether it relates to gender, ethnicity, language or other variables, the initial dataset needs to be cleaned and carefully analyzed prior to being used to train the AI, whether AI markup language or NLP methods are deployed. If the latter is applied, ongoing monitoring should be considered.
A green data storage solution needs to be addressed to reduce the CO2 cost of activity on the environment. For example, universities might investigate if water cooling systems could be used in server rooms instead of air conditioning.
The university of the future as anticipated by many scholars and policy makers has already started. Technology, if used ethically and strategically, can support faculty in their mission to prepare their students for the needs of our society and the future of work.

As digital infrastructure’s role in business grows, IT service management (ITSM) has become increasingly crucial. In many cases, this trend has resulted in IT help desks facing more demand than they can efficiently handle. Artificial intelligence (AI) can help.
Many businesses have already realized AI’s potential in this area. As of 2019, 62% of surveyed companiesOpens a new window  were considering implementing AI in ITSM, with 46% actively researching these solutions.
Still, simply knowing that other companies are pursuing this technology is insufficient evidence for its effectiveness. With that in mind, here are four specific ways AI can improve help desk management.
1. Providing 24/7 Support
The most straightforward way to integrate AI into ITSM is through chatbots. With more than 3 billion virtual assistants in use worldwide, these solutions are widely available and largely effective in their roles. Perhaps the greatest advantage of chatbots for help desks is providing around-the-clock support.
Users may encounter an issue at any time, but most IT departments don’t have enough workers to staff the help desk for 24 hours. Chatbots can fill in when human agents are unavailable, providing support whenever a user may need it.
Chatbots today are sophisticated enough to handle many basic issues. So they can resolve many IT service tickets autonomously. If an issue requires the nuance of a human worker, the chatbot can field it and pass it on accordingly.

2. Categorizing and Routing Service Tickets
Another way AI can improve help desk management is by categorizing, prioritizing, and routing tickets. When requests come in, AI can compare them to similar past cases, determine their severity and likely outcome, then route them to the appropriate employee at the right time. Doing this reduces miscommunication and seeks the best help for each ticket, helping resolve issues faster.
The Toronto Pearson International Airport is an excellent example of this use case. The airport deployed an AI ITSM solution to better serve its 50 million annual passengersOpens a new window , and it created impressive results. By learning from past tickets and agent behavior, the system categorized and routed tickets more effectively, decreasing the mean repair time from 2.4 hours to 1.39 hours.
This AI could also provide instant solutions for 30% of repetitive tasks, reducing IT staff workload and further improving their productivity. All of these improvements resulted in a customer satisfaction score of 96.5%.

3. Informing Worker Decision Making
When these AI solutions pass service tickets along to human workers, they can still provide value. By analyzing similar situations, AI can provide the necessary context to help IT staff make the right decisions quickly.
Telecom company Rogers Communications experienced this first-hand when they implemented their ITSM AI. The company uses its system to provide a better picture of each user’s situation, including how long they’ve been a customer, what services they use, their customer journey, and the severity of the issue. All this information helps provide the right help faster.
Rogers Communications saw a 53% decrease in customer complaintsOpens a new window  in a year of using this AI solution. When IT staff have more context to understand a ticket and its potential solutions when they get it, they can solve it more effectively and efficiently.
4. Resolving Minor Infrastructure Issues
AI in ITSM can also make improvements behind the scenes. If the underlying infrastructure of a help desk’s platform or the system they provide help for has issues, it will take more than a customer experience call to fix it. AI can detect and resolve many of these problems while IT staff members focus on other tasks.
Since AI can handle more data faster than humansOpens a new window , it can detect infrastructure or network issues faster. If these problems aren’t overly complex, it can then automatically address them and solve them before they cause further disruption to ITSM services. If they are too complex, AI can alert the appropriate staff so they can fix the issue.
By automating these infrastructure fixes and improvements, IT teams can spend more time addressing users’ immediate needs. These quick patches will likely also reduce incoming tickets by preventing issues before they cause noticeable differences.
IT Help Desks Today Need AI
IT help desks will grow increasingly busy as digital services become more important in daily work and life. As that happens, these teams will need all the resources available to resolve issues quickly. These teams will need AI.
These four improvements illustrate how AI can improve help desk management through virtually every stage of the process. Those that implement AI effectively can see dramatic changes in their customer satisfaction and team productivity.

The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) has exploded just as managers and executives are adapting to hybrid work environments and struggling to oversee remote employees.
A recent report from research firm IDC predicts that by 2024, 80% of Global 2000 companies will use AI/ML-enabled “Digital Managers” to hire, fire, and train workers in jobs measured by continuous improvement — but only one in five companies will get any real value from the move without human engagement.
The ongoing worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has forced many companies to adopt new work models, ranging from fully remote to “hybrid” approaches where individuals and teams work at or across multiple digital and physical locations.











 
 
 
This shift to more distributed workforces has required companies to devise new methods for managing, leading, and organizing enterprises, according to IDC.

In fact, about 41% of companies see the ability to manage a remote and hybrid workforce as a critical skill to hire or develop in-house, according to IDC’s April 2021 Future Enterprise Resiliency and Spending Survey.
Today, digital-management software based on AI/ML is used to scan resumes and cull applicants, determine daily employee performance, recommend additional training, and determine when and how many employees are needed for a job – especially for shift-type work.











 
 
 
Amy Loomis, a research director for IDC’s worldwide Future of Work market research service, said that while the use of AI/ML to hire and fire workers might seem remarkable, “it’s rather widely used in [human resources] circles today to greater or lesser degree.
“Algorithms are often used to stack-rank employees offering recommendations on who would be best fit to hire or targeted to fire,” Loomis said.
Stack-ranking, also known as forced ranking or forced distribution, uses a statistics-based approach to rate employees on job performance in comparison to other team members.











 
 
 
Stack-ranking software can be used to suggest that employees take additional training, push  managers to perform employee remediation, or in some cases prompt the firing of a percentage of employees who fall below performance thresholds. A company, for instance, could choose to fire all employees who fall into the bottom 10% of performers.
Amazon comes under fire
For example, widespread media reports during the past year claimed Amazon uses software algorithms or “bots” to hire and rate employees, “firing millions of people with little or no human oversight.”
Overall, a large percentage of the Amazon workers are terminated for job abandonment. Only a small percentage are terminated for performance issues, according to Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson.











 
 
 
The company, which employs more than 1.4 million workers, denied its algorithms are used solely to fire workers. The company’s workforce management technology supports and enhances the experience of job candidates and employees. It’s not meant to replace managers, but to aid their decision-making with data and information, according to Nantel.
“There’s a distinct difference between a personnel management system flagging someone who has abandoned their jobs — and as a result they’re automatically terminated — versus our performance systems that help give feedback to our managers on where and how our employees are performing and stacking up against one another and giving recommendations and feedback to those who may be struggling,” Nantel said.
“Contextually, it’s easy to say thousands or hundreds of thousands are fired by robots. Well, in some cases that’s true in job abandonment cases, but they’re not fired for performance issues ever,” Nantel continued. “They’re not coached, fire,d or disciplined through any technology.”











 
 
 
Shannon Kalvar, research manager for IDC’s IT Service Management and Client Virtualization Program, said that while companies may not rely entirely on software bots to fire employees, recommendations based on AI/ML weigh heavily in decision making.
“We are human beings who are overworked and over stressed. What is the likelihood you’re going to disagree with a suggestion when it comes through — especially if you’re remote managing somebody?” Kalvar said.
Digital management software was already in use before the pandemic, when it mainly helped  manage trucking fleets, retail workers, service workers, and other “task oriented” jobs. For example, the gig economy enabled flexible hours for delivery services, which enabled same-day delivery for retail products and groceries. Delivery trucks were no longer pre-packed days in advance.











 
 
 
In 2015, for example, Amazon started its gig-style Flex delivery service using contract drivers instead of full-time employees. Contract workers’ performance is closely monitored by software algorithms that track their routes and delivery times.
“A frighteningly large number of organizations have digital managers,” Kalvar said. “We’ve seen a huge uptake in interest in that and it’s already starting to roll out for office workers in addition to everyone else. Today, it’s really a problem in task-oriented jobs, but you have to realize we’re all moving into task-oriented jobs.
“There’s plenty of software that detects problems with process, which is another way of saying, ‘Where are people screwing up and do they need to be remediated?’” Kalvar said.











 
 
 
The issue has become a hot-button one in Europe, where the European Commission is eyeing rules that could force companies to be more transparent about their use of algorithmic management.

Cloud ROI: Getting innovation economics right with FinOps

One major flaw with algorithmic employee management is the disparate nature of applications. Some tools are embedded in ERP system software, others are standalone applications and services. In a large enterprise, there can be many different personnel management and training applications, and many of them do not talk with each other.
That’s a problem at Amazon, which uses various types of software and algorithms. Some track employee time and attendance, others oversee worker performance, while still others keep a record of employee disability leave.











 
 
 
A manual patch the company deployed to enable communications between its time and attendance monitoring algorithm and its employee-leave system failed to integrate the two systems.
“In some cases there have been issues where an individual might have been out on leave and two systems were not talking to each other and the system generated a form email or letter being sent out to an employee saying they’d abandoned their job when, in fact, they were out on leave,” Nantel said. “We’re in the process right now of fully implementing a patch that connects those two systems together.
“We’re not unique to some of those challenges, and when you’re a company as big as Amazon and you’re scaling and growing as fast as we are, we certainly have found some situations where our technology and our systems haven’t kept pace,” she said.











 
 
 
Over the next several years, the use of AI/ML-based management software is only expected to grow. Investors and other analysts have projected that the AI software market will more than double from $150 billion to more than $500 billion in the next five years or so.
For example, IDC predicts the worldwide AI market, including software, hardware, and services, will grow from $327.5 B in 2021 to $554.3B in 2024 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.5%.
Forrester Research has taken a more conservative view, projecting the market will grow to $37 billion by 2025. Forrester explained its numbers in a report supplied to Computerworld, saying most applications add AI functions without monetizing them — and the custom-built AI apps that businesses create don’t generate market revenues.











 
 
 
“AI is fast becoming as fundamental to software as software has become to business. As a result, AI software will increasingly be embedded into existing software products by existing software vendors,” Forrester said in a white paper published last year.
“Companies will find that it makes the most sense to acquire AI functions through these software vendors. At the end of the day, AI will be everywhere in software products, just as analytics, workflow, and data are part of those same software products.”
Forrester draws a distinction between software “Build Platforms” that are general and specialize in enabling users and vendors to use AI to develop AI-infused applications, and “Buy Applications.” The latter are AI-infused software tools designed to help users improve business outcomes.











 
 
 
The prevalence of AI now in various platforms and apps means corporate execs leading a dispersed workforce need more than just new skills — they also need new “mental models” for understanding productivity, leadership, and the relationships between employees, managers, and enterprises, according to IDC’s Kalvar.
In other words, organizations using automated employee management software need to reevaluate their relationship with their workers.
“Today, we’re still very much stuck in an industrial-era mindset. The concept of an office as a factory is not a useful tool, though,” Kalvar said.











 
 
 
Autocratic styles of leadership, which emphasize the benefits of employee work to the managers — and the corporate bottom line — have to give way to human skills of oversight, IDC’s study said. Without human engagement, employees lack a sense of corporate community and don’t feel invested in the outcome of their work.
And without human oversight, companies risk losing out on qualified candidates because resume-scanning algorithms are often not set up properly and, thus, cull resumes of potential hires. Additionally, employees who’ve been fired by a bot — even if they were terminated without a good reason — are rarely rehired, Kalvar said.
“This happens in lower-wage jobs, especially,” Kalvar said. “If you’ve fired all of the qualified people because you didn’t want to keep them around, you’re done, because most companies will not rehire fired employees. The people are still there to hire, but you can’t find them. They’re invisible to you.”
If, for example, a company requires applicants with a college education, even if their work experience qualifies them for the job, algorithms will automatically cut them from a prospective  list of applicants.











 
 
 
“If you have a region with low college attainment and you put all your jobs to require college through your filtering software, you’re going to blow through the existing candidates pretty quick,” Kalvar said. “There may be 30% of the population who could be considered [for an opening], but you’re not going to see them.
“That creates a perception of talent imbalance and shortage,” he added.
Companies are already beginning to take note and change their management culture. For example, at SoftBank (a Japanese financial institution) humans review resumes rejected by AI/ML to ensure promising candidates are not overlooked.
“Honestly, there aren’t any best practices yet. I’d argue figuring this out is the big challenge for humans who manage,” Kalvar said. “We need to figure this out fast. Those who figure this out will have highly engaged, highly loyal communities working together. Those who fail will run highly lean organizations. That’s going to look really good for a couple of quarters.”
But without human intervention, those putative gains might fade away.

By helping to automate the analysis of large data sets and  making it easier to identify trends in data, AI frees up time for supply chain  professionals to engage in value-added activities that only humans can carry  out. For example, even the best technology is no substitute for the uniquely  human relationship-building skills that support listening to stakeholders,  communicating effectively with business partners, innovating and thinking  strategically about how to approach challenges. Through its AI in supply chain research, APQC has found  that there are at least six new skills that supply chain employees need to  develop or enhance as the result of AI adoption. While some of these are  technical skills, most are soft skills that help supply chain professionals to  forge stronger relationships, work more effectively with partners and solve  complex problems. Actively building and strengthening these skills among supply  chain professionals is important in order to leverage AI effectively and  strategically use the time it frees up.AdChoicesADVERTISINGActive listening and communicationActive listening  and communication skills sit at the top of the list. Supply chain employees  must be able to effectively discern the needs of their stakeholders, maintain  positive relationships with partners and convey clear expectations to suppliers  and other service providers.   Creativity and innovationThe business adage  “innovate or die” may sound dramatic, but it also happens to be true in today’s  business climate. In the face of numerous disruptions and other unplanned  challenges, supply chain professionals need to think creatively in order to  find novel solutions that keep the business running.  Technical skills in data science, machine learning and modellingThe need for new  soft skills does not detract from the importance of technical skills. To get the  most out of investments in AI, supply chain professionals need to know how to  leverage the technology effectively in order to derive insights that can lead  to better decisions.  Strategic thinking AI can use data to  model trends and make predictions, but humans still need to discern what the  data means in the context of an organization’s broader goals and strategy.  Supply chain professionals must be able to look at evidence from data and make  the best decision for the business, especially when there is no evident “right”  answer to an emerging trend or challenge.Analytical skills with business acumenSupply chain employees need to be able to translate the  findings of AI in a way that makes sense to organizational leaders and connects  to the priorities they care about. The ability to tell a clear and compelling  story about data that connects to business strategy helps to bridge the gap  between insight and action. Looking forward  The key to  retaining employees who will thrive in future supply chain roles is to ensure  that they have the right mix of skills to support AI and leverage it  strategically. Many organizations have already committed to providing learning  opportunities for supply chain professionals to develop or enhance these critical  skills. For example, APQC has found that organizations are investing a median  of seven days in employee learning per employee to ease the transition to AI.  This training helps to prevent skills shortages and is a smarter investment  than trying to hire new individuals with the necessary skills.Facebook IconLinkedIn IconTwitter X iconLatest in Training/OnboardingNexterus CEO Retiring, Ryan Polakoff Named SuccessorJuly 18, 2024Q4 to See Growth in Workforce in Food and Beverage, E-Commerce VerticalsJuly 16, 2024Elevating Logistics: TMSA's Elevate ConferenceJuly 12, 2024Hyundai Material Handling Announces Director of Dealer Development & National AccountsJuly 11, 2024RecommendedHiringHyundai Material Handling Announces Director of Dealer Development & National AccountsPersonnel updates sees new appointments at Cirba, HeroWear and more.Alexis Mizell-PleasantJuly 11, 2024RetentionPost-Pandemic Supply Chains: An SCN Summit RecapWithout a crystal ball, the best way to solidify operations might be to reflect on previous practices and merge the best qualities with the technologies available to keep up with the market, demands and expectations of tomorrow.Alexis Mizell-PleasantJuly 4, 2024Mentorship ProgramsShattering Glass Ceilings at This Year’s Women in Supply Chain ForumRegister today for this year's Women in Supply Chain Forum, scheduled for Nov. 12-13 in Atlanta.Marina MayerApril 1, 2024",NewsArticle,,6 Skills for AI-Ready Supply Chain Professionals,https://img.sdcexec.com/files/base/acbm/sdce/image/2021/12/STtock_artificial_intelligence.61b81d79a88ed.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&q=70,,,,,,https://www.sdcexec.com/professional-development/training/article/21940918/apqc-6-skills-for-aiready-supply-chain-professionals,['https://img.sdcexec.com/files/base/acbm/sdce/image/2021/12/STtock_artificial_intelligence.61b81d79a88ed.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Marisa Brown'}",,6 Skills for AI-Ready Supply Chain Professionals,2022-01-04T19:29:00.000Z,2021-12-14T04:30:00.000Z,Training/Onboarding,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.sdcexec.com/professional-development/training/article/21940918/apqc-6-skills-for-aiready-supply-chain-professionals'}",,['Marisa Brown']

The prices of properties in various locations of the city are included in the project's dataset. The datasets for this experiment, are available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Aside from the costs of various properties, you'll also obtain statistics on the people's ages, the city's crime rate, and the locations of non-retail companies. It's a terrific assignment for youngsters, to put their knowledge to the test..Chatbot.Developing a chatbot, is one of the top AI-based initiatives. Create a rudimentary customer service chatbot first. The chatbots, which may be found on many websites, can be used as inspiration. After you've made a basic chatbot, you may improve it and make a more complex version. The chatbot's specialty may then be changed and its functions can be enhanced. AI allows you to construct a variety of innovative chatbots..Facial Recognition.This is a popular artificial intelligence project concept. This research aims to build on a ground-breaking current deep Learning application: face emotion identification. The deep Learning face emotion detection and identification system are used to recognise and understand human facial emotions. It can identify happy, sad, angry, terrified, surprised, disgusted, and neutral human emotions in real-time..Stock Price Prediction.This is one of the greatest beginners AI project ideas. The stock market is a favourite of machine learning scientists. Because it is tightly packed with information, this is the case. You may get a variety of data sets and start working on a project right away. This project would be perfect for students interested in working in the financial business, since it may give them significant insight into a variety of elements of the industry..Gesture Controlled Space Game Battle.This is a simple AI-based space combat game, where you just use hand gestures to operate your vessel. PictoBlox, a computer or laptop with a camera or webcam, and an internet connection are all necessary. The foundations of the game are simple: you move your finger around, to control the movement of the spaceship. The game uses artificial intelligence to analyse your hand, and its movements via the camera, which then drives the game's spaceship forward..Gesture Controlled Robot.The next AI and machine learning project for students, are to control a 2-wheel drive robot with hand gestures rather than a computer, smartphone, or joystick. If you haven't made the robot yet or are unsure how to do so, go here. A two-wheeled robot, a camera-equipped laptop or PC, PictoBlox, and an internet connection, are all necessary. You'll use machine learning to teach the model to recognise hand gestures, so it can move forward, turn left and right and stop in this project..AI-based Home Automation.Students may use the speech recognition capability of PictoBlox'sartificial intelligence extension, to operate household appliances in this project. The students will use PictoBlox, to create a room with appliances like lights, a fan, and a radio, then write a script in PictoBlox to operate them using voice commands. After you've completed the project, you may turn it into a real-life room with lights, fans, and radios..Attendance System using Face Detection.Because of the present global scenario and the rise of online classrooms, the conventional attendance method may be difficult or cumbersome. This cutting-edge machine learning project enables your teacher to take class attendance, using facial recognition. It collects sample photographs of your face using machine learning, and the next time the computer scans a face, it uses AI to compare it to the stored samples, marking you as present if there is a match..Plagiarism Checker.You will create a plagiarism detector for a project, that can detect similarities in text copies, and calculate the proportion of plagiarism. Users can register for this software, by generating a valid login id and password. The file will be separated into content and reference links, after the uploads are complete. The checker will next go through the whole document, checking for grammatical problems, visiting each reference link, and scanning the content of all of the links for matches, to your material..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
