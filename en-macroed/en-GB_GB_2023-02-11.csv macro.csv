From AI-generated art to ChatGPT's worryingly coherent output, generative AI has been propelled into the limelight over the past two months – but its role in game development still remains unclear.


For those who have missed the recent conversations, generative AI is a tool that can be used to create something from a written prompt. Ask ChatGPT to write a short summary of something and it will do so. Type a description of a person or place – real or fictional – into Midjourney and it will offer you four different pictures that fit your brief.

We reached out to a range of game makers to get their thoughts on this nascent but increasingly prominent technology. Some declined, stating they do not (yet) understand enough about generative AI and the implications of using it to offer insight, but those who did respond were never far from a historical analogy.


Panivox co-founder and veteran developer Philip Oliver liked generative AI to farmers improving their efficiency by using ploughs and later tractors instead of horses, while Code Is Just author and indie developer Shahid Ahmad drew parallels between machine learning and the introduction of industrial automation.

""[That] removed a lot of manual drudgery from our lives through the use of machinery and, more recently, robots. But video games studios producing content at scale haven't benefited from mechanisation until now,"" he explains. 


""It might at first be jarring to hear of mechanisation with what we often think of as art, but most of the assets produced in video games are craft, and craft, guided by humans, can be mechanised at the level of atoms, so why not with bits?""


Bossa Studio co-founder and creator-in-chief Imre Jele adds: ""Fundamental shifts in technologies can rearrange entire industries. Those kinds of changes always come with inevitable losses: people and companies will be forced to adapt. And when the change is big enough entire economies could be at peril, and societal changes become necessary. AI could be – some say is inevitably going to be – that drastic a change. I believe generative AI certainly has the potential to rock the games industry on a fundamental level.

""However, there are still challenges ahead. For example, the legal framework for training sets is up in the air with some risk and exposure depending on the outcome of some court cases. So there are some big questions one needs to answer before developing a game using these tools.
 
""Ultimately, even though this is a very fast developing space, we only have very few actual production ready tools that a company can depend on. So arguably, we’re still a little while from fundamental changes to how we make games.""



 
Rok Breulj, Proxy Studios


Rok Breulj, founder and owner of Proxy Studios, says AI can ease the process of content creation, which he considers ""the most labour intensive part of video game development."" His own team used AI art tools to generate concept art for elements such as buildings in their upcoming 4X strategy title Zephon, but Breulj believes it will eventually be used on a grander scale.


""AI is undoubtedly going to increase the breadth and scope of games,"" he says. ""We should expect bigger worlds and larger games – something I see players screaming for.""


He continues: ""In some aspects generative AI can be likened to remixing old assets or using asset packs. All of that can be done very tastefully or very distastefully. It’s not inherently bad or good. We shouldn’t be scared of generative AI. Try it out, play with it, explore its limitations and see if it can enhance your workflow.""

Tom Pigott, CEO and founder of Ludo AI – which offers a tool of the same name designed to help developers prototype game concepts from a series of prompts – says generative AI will be most useful in art design, concept ideation, and asset creation. He claims this will limit costs – not in terms of having fewer staff (more on that later), but the amount of man-hours spent on each of these processes.


""Game developers face three primary problems when developing: expenses, time, and effort,"" he says. ""When faced with these problems combined, the failure rate is drastically increased – and most developers cannot afford all of the necessary tools to stay competitive.""


Ahmad emphasises the potential benefits for indies, as using AI will allow smaller studios to ""punch above their weight,"" he says. He points to the example of UK developer Hello Games, which used procedural generation to create No Man's Sky, a game of a scale usually only reached by AAA titles. 

""Generative AI will fundamentally change how and what games we create. The question is: How fast?""

Imre Jele, Bossa Studios

However, he warns that AI's output can look ""boring or incongruous"" if used poorly – one only need to look at the mutated hands produced by AI art tools for proof. Ahmad once again cites Hello Games as an example, stressing that while procedural generation created endless planets and creatures, it was down to human developers to tune their system and select the 'best' output.


Breulj warns that another disadvantage could be that we see the games market ""flooded with generative content that is not well-considered."" Given the rise of 'asset flip' games on Steam, titles that are cobbled together from premade assets, the use of generative AI in this way is perhaps inevitable.


""It could get harder and harder for thoughtful content to rise to the top – potentially redistributing the spend from development into marketing,"" he adds.


Pigott stresses that AI tools should be seen as simply that: a tool. 


""When speaking about generative AI in the games industry more specifically, this is doubly true,"" he adds. ""You shouldn’t just rely on AI tools, because the results may not always be completely accurate – you see this when looking at examples of awry work from services like Dall-E 2 and ChatGPT online.""


Panivox's Philip Oliver expects generative AI to be most useful when planning or in pre-production, saying it can quickly create mood boards and other concept art. He, too, emphasises the need for human guidance to ensure the final game benefits from the use of AI. 



 
The Oliver Twins used AI art to make a narrative game, Roots & Shoots, during Global Game Jame 2023


""Generative AI in games should empower and enhance creativity, not replace it,"" he says. ""AI can speed up game development and enable teams to iterate faster. At this year's Global Game Jam, we produced a 20-minute game assisted by AI tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney – it took us just over 60 man hours, demonstrating the potential of generative AI to dramatically speed up the development process.


""AI is a big disruptor in the games industry, but it's important to be curious and embrace new technologies.""


The biggest concern around generative AI is whether it will result in job losses. If typing words into Midjourney can generate concept art, why would studios need a concept artist? If it can generate 3D assets that can be placed into a game world, like trees or furniture, what happens to the people manually crafting these today?
 
Jele says: ""In most cases I believe AI will be accelerating workers rather than replacing them. That said there are grave and valid concerns of jobs lost.""
 
He goes on to say there will be more subtle issues to address. For example, a member of his team pointed out that AI might remove the need for low skills jobs in art departments. This would prevent young artists from securing the roles and gaining the experience they need to improve their skills, and the result would be fewer trained staff on the market.
 
""At the end of the day I don’t think AI replacing jobs is a fleeting concern, but a fact,"" Jele continues. ""Generative AI will not only change but likely entirely displace many jobs. The only argument is how fast that will happen and how far reaching the effects will be.

""History teaches us that you cannot hold back the march of progress. The best option we have is to very carefully consider and prepare for the inevitable effects in our own teams and industry. Worth saying though that the trajectory of AI development suggests that we will face changes on a societal level, and those matters can ultimately only be addressed by tools on that level: universal living wage and other solutions come to mind.""


Ahmad adds: ""Jobs will change. They've always changed. Decades ago, every team wrote their own graphics engine, and now those jobs are gone. But a lot of drudgery will be taken away. How many chairs need to be modelled? How many tables? Couldn't AI take care of that for us?""


The developers we spoke to say there are also misconceptions around the use of generative AI, ones that are a factor in the rising fear that it will replace jobs. For example, Oliver stresses that no AI tool can create code, art or dialogue on its own.


""Treat AI tools like ChatGPT and Midjounrey as problem-solvers, process accelerators, and creative aids, not replacements for developer creativity,"" he says. ""Game developer tools don't do the work for us, and the same applies to generative AI.""


Pigott adds: ""People often think that generative AI is a magic box and a mind reader, which just is not the case. Generative AI is a type of machine learning where computers can generate original content in response to prompts from the user.
 

""Machine learning cannot predict what kind of game a developer wants to create; that can only be done after the user has input prompts. The most important factor in any generative AI tool is still the user – the human – who is using it.""



 
'An AI developing a video game', Midjourney


As a further example, the headline image of this article (full image to the left) was generated by Midjourney using the prompt: 'An AI developing a video game.' Even Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick assured investors on a recent earnings call that there's no danger of a generative AI tool making a better Grand Theft Auto just because something delivers that prompt.


Ultimately, the developers we spoke to believe AI has the potential to benefit studios of all sizes. AAA developers will be able to create more content with lower costs and become more efficient, while indies will be able to attempt more ambitious projects they would not usually have the resources for.


""The boundaries [between the two] will blur,"" says Ahmad. ""This is a good thing. Eventually, this technology will create a more level playing field provided that AI is accessible, and there's every reason given the history of other tools to believe that this will be the case. Unreal Engine used to cost $500,000 to licence in 2002, and now an indie can use it essentially for free.""


Jele even envisages a world where games themselves are able to use AI tools to produce new content on the fly, and content that is tailored to each player's tastes.


""The 'simple' outcome of making bigger games faster is not only a huge step forward but frankly a necessity considering the ongoing arms race of game content scope and quality,"" he concludes. ""But I hope we will also see better and even stranger games – and not just bigger – because of good AI tools.


""I believe generative AI will fundamentally change how and what games we create. The question is: How fast?""

Since ChatGPT took the world by storm last fall, people have been in a frenzy debating the impact artificial intelligence and other new automated technology will have on America's job market. The ""robots are taking our jobs"" narrative was further boosted by viral videos showing new, ""fully automated"" McDonald's and Taco Bell restaurants.The knee-jerk reaction to these videos is to say that robots are coming for our jobs, but while AI and other kinds of automation have progressed, that doesn't mean they're necessarily eliminating jobs. Instead, the new tech is simply changing how we work and what kinds of jobs exist. Automation technology has ushered in a fleet of secret workers behind screens, machines, and smiling robot faces. The robots and chatbots aren't replacing humans, they're just keeping the people out of sight and out of mind. And while separating the customer from the workers serving them may be good for the companies, there's mounting evidence it's a terrible deal for the employees.

Out of sight, out of mindWhen people start prognosticating about AI coming for our jobs, they love to point to videos of sleek robots and shining screens handling mundane tasks. The McDondald's video shows a machine delivering food at the drive-thru, self-ordering kiosks, and a stark lack of human staffers behind the order counter. At Taco Bell, there are several automated drive-thru lanes. Beyond fast food, impressive-looking robots are working in coffee shops, delivering food, and cleaning floors. On the AI side, tools like ChatGPT have been used to write real articles and take college exams. BuzzFeed recently announced it plans to use AI to help generate content for its site.

But in many cases, these videos and stories — and the fears they drive — lack crucial context. The futuristic McDonald's is an experimental concept store outside Fort Worth, Texas, aiming to improve service speed and accuracy by effectively severing the relationship between its workers and customers. But that doesn't mean there are no humans in the store. If you pay close attention to the video, you can see a worker in the back behind a pane of glass. McDonald's has said the store isn't ""fully automated"" by any means, and it employs a similar number of staff as a traditional store — they're just in the back making the food and keeping things running. And despite the fact most customers will never see a Taco Bell worker at its newfangled store, it has plenty of people working in the kitchen.






                                  Most people won't see the workers at Taco Bell's new store, but they are still in the back making your food.

Even if these tools seem more sophisticated, this isn't the first robot-driven freak-out. Less than 10 years ago, new developments in technology spurred a similar fear that robots were coming for us. A 2014 analysis estimated that automation would wipe out 47% of all jobs by 2034 and that self-driving technology would eliminate the need for human taxi and delivery drivers, while long-haul truckers were thought to be on borrowed time. Nearly a decade later, these cataclysmic forecasts haven't come to pass. Truck drivers are still in high demand, and self-driving technology is nowhere near replacing human jobs. In fact, a more recent 2020 report from the World Economic Forum estimated that while 85 million jobs would be replaced by machines by 2025, an estimated 97 million new jobs would be created to help support this new economy. The human behind the curtainAmid the fear-mongering about a robot takeover, people often miss the degree to which machines still require human workers in order to function. Take customer service: For years, businesses have tried to cut costs by replacing human phone calls with chat-based, automated customer-service bots. But instead of replacing customer-service workers, many of these text-based tools still rely on human backups in complex situations and to make customers feel as if they are talking to a real person. Laura Preston recently wrote about her experience working as one of these ""human fallbacks"" for a real-estate chatbot called Brenda. When a customer wanted to speak to someone about an apartment listing, they would be connected with Brenda, who could answer basic questions about the listing or give details on the apartment itself from the price of rent to the square footage. But many of Brenda's answers came across stilted or the system was simply unable to answer more complex questions, so a ""human fallback"" would step in. Preston and other human workers would take over the conversation and try to help the client, cleaning up stock answers to better address their needs or doing deeper research into housing vouchers and pet policies. According to Preston, employees were trained to use Brenda's ""voice"" in the interactions in an attempt to make the conversation appear seamless. And the push to robotically answer a deluge of questions came with a serious mental toll: ""Months of impersonating Brenda had depleted my emotional resources,"" wrote Preston. ""It occurred to me that I wasn't really training Brenda to think like a human, Brenda was training me to think like a bot, and perhaps that had been the point all along.""

                                  Delivery robots like Kiwibots are often remotely controlled by backup drivers.

Preston was working from the United States, but in many cases, these services are hiding human employees so they can outsource it to places where the labor is cheaper. Take food-delivery robots: While they're presented as being fully autonomous, the reality is that they often have remote backup drivers. Tiny Mile, which runs a service in Toronto called Geoffrey, relies on drivers in the Philippines, while Kiwi's robots, which are used on some US college campuses, have been known to use workers in Colombia making less than $2 an hour to help complete deliveries. Companies claim the remote drivers only take over when the robots can't navigate a situation, but given how prone these robots are to getting stuck and becoming obstacles for sidewalk users, it's not clear how often that happens.

Many of the leading companies developing self-driving vehicles, which have threatened to one day replace a host of driving jobs, also rely on a fleet of hidden workers. Obviously, there are the highly paid engineers in the US who help develop the software and tools used to map and guide the car, but that isn't the full picture. Autonomous-driving tech is reliant on poorly paid workers around the world who label the thousands of data inputs the car's sensors capture. Without that labeling, the computer wouldn't be able to identify what the sensors are picking up, which allows the systems to slowly learn and make decisions on how to navigate the road. For instance, the data labeling is supposed to help the cars distinguish whether an obstruction is a child or a traffic cone — though it doesn't always work out as planned. An MIT Technology Review investigation last April found that self-driving companies, including Tesla, took advantage of the collapse of Venezuela's economy by getting workers in the country to label self-driving data for an average of just over 90 cents an hour. Last year, Tesla laid off 200 US-based workers it directly employed to do this labeling, suggesting it was automating a majority of those tasks instead — a computer teaching another computer. It's not just self-driving tech. A recent Time magazine investigation found that OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, relies on Kenyan workers paid less than $2 an hour who have to view content on a range of disturbing topics, including ""child sexual abuse, bestiality, murder, suicide, torture, self harm, and incest,"" to try to make the tool less toxic. This follows an earlier report about Facebook using the same subcontractor in Kenya for its own content moderation. Other companies have gone so far as to recruit workers in refugee camps, where the opportunities are few and people will accept incredibly low wages, to help train their machine learning and AI tools. Far from the ""set it and forget it"" tools that require just a few genius coders, many of these supposedly autonomous marvels actually rely on an army of low-paid workers around the world.The myth of efficiencyIf you ask the companies, they'll say the automation push is about efficiency and better serving customers. McDonald's claims its concept store will speed up service and lead to fewer wrong orders, while Tesla has claimed that automating data labeling is more efficient. The idea is that these machines or software solutions will allow a job to be done faster or better, making life easier for companies and customers alike. But in reality, these tools aren't more efficient — they just shift the necessary work away from the end consumer and disconnect people from the effort that is required to deliver them a product.

For one thing, it's not even clear that all the newfangled tools that companies have built are actually making the economy more efficient. US labor productivity — the measure of how many worker hours are required to produce a certain amount of economic output — has been growing at below its long-run average since 2005. And despite hope that the forced digital transition would turn it around, productivity growth has only gotten worse since the start of the pandemic.Instead of improving productivity, automation is often focused on increasing the power that employers have over workers. In his book, ""Automation and the Future of Work,"" the economic historian Aaron Benanav explains that companies aren't putting money toward tools to make employees' lives easier, but are pouring money into ""technologies allowing for detailed surveillance of those same workers"" like computer-monitoring software that tracks the keystrokes of employees or Amazon's sophisticated algorithmic management tools that evaluate workers' every movement.






                                  Automation and AI are often used to monitor workers, like in Amazon warehouses.

These technologies are often deployed to de-skill work — jobs are broken down into more specific tasks and can be done with less training. As a result, workers are shifted from employee to contractor status. People who once worked stable, middle-class jobs are thrown into a more precarious world where wages are lower and they have less say over the terms of their employment. The data labelers are the tip of this iceberg: A large (and growing) industry of ""microworkers"" on platforms like Mechanical Turk or Clickworker fuel the supposed automated tech of all these tech companies. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos went so far as to call the use of workers to make a process seem automated ""artificial artificial intelligence."" For those who still hold onto service or warehouse jobs, the specter of automation is wielded like a Sword of Damocles to keep them from pushing for better working conditions or wages. Meanwhile, the technologies that are deployed simply give employers more power to track everything workers do while on the clock — a miserable working reality. Looking at this trend in 2015, the journalist Lauren Smiley wrote that it was creating a world where ""you're either pampered, isolated royalty — or you're a 21st-century servant."" There's no question that some of these technologies provide conveniences for consumers or even free up their time so they can focus on their own work, but that doesn't make the treatment of the workers they depend on acceptable. Technology could be used to empower workers, for example, by giving them more control over their work so they can use their skills to make more informed decisions, but that data is often not shared by companies.

Instead of using this new technology for good, Phil Jones, a researcher and the author of ""Work Without the Worker: Labour in the Age of Platform Capitalism,"" argues that companies simply deploy semi-automated tech to make it seem as if executives or the brand itself deserve all the credit for the end product rather than the human employees who made it possible. ""Workers disappear in the long shadow of the machine,"" Jones writes, and customers and clients don't have to think as much about how the sausage gets made. All the while, the quality of jobs is degraded. New technologies like AI are framed as offering us various forms of empowerment and liberation: We'll be able to work more productively, spend less time doing our chores, and anything we want will be a click or tap away. But those promises never paint an accurate picture of how that tech is transforming the world around us or the true cost of those supposed benefits. Automation may empower some people, but in the process, it's making things a lot harder for the hidden workers keeping everything moving.Paris Marx is a tech writer and host of the Tech Won't Save Us podcast.

In his book, ""Automation and the Future of Work,"" the economic historian Aaron Benanav explains that companies aren't putting money toward tools to make employees' lives easier, but are pouring money into ""technologies allowing for detailed surveillance of those same workers"" like computer-monitoring software that tracks the keystrokes of employees or Amazon's sophisticated algorithmic management tools that evaluate workers' every movement.These technologies are often deployed to de-skill work — jobs are broken down into more specific tasks and can be done with less training. As a result, workers are shifted from employee to contractor status. People who once worked stable, middle-class jobs are thrown into a more precarious world where wages are lower and they have less say over the terms of their employment. The data labelers are the tip of this iceberg: A large (and growing) industry of ""microworkers"" on platforms like Mechanical Turk or Clickworker fuel the supposed automated tech of all these tech companies. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos went so far as to call the use of workers to make a process seem automated ""artificial artificial intelligence."" For those who still hold onto service or warehouse jobs, the specter of automation is wielded like a Sword of Damocles to keep them from pushing for better working conditions or wages. Meanwhile, the technologies that are deployed simply give employers more power to track everything workers do while on the clock — a miserable working reality. Looking at this trend in 2015, the journalist Lauren Smiley wrote that it was creating a world where ""you're either pampered, isolated royalty — or you're a 21st-century servant."" There's no question that some of these technologies provide conveniences for consumers or even free up their time so they can focus on their own work, but that doesn't make the treatment of the workers they depend on acceptable. Technology could be used to empower workers, for example, by giving them more control over their work so they can use their skills to make more informed decisions, but that data is often not shared by companies. Instead of using this new technology for good, Phil Jones, a researcher and the author of ""Work Without the Worker: Labour in the Age of Platform Capitalism,"" argues that companies simply deploy semi-automated tech to make it seem as if executives or the brand itself deserve all the credit for the end product rather than the human employees who made it possible. ""Workers disappear in the long shadow of the machine,"" Jones writes, and customers and clients don't have to think as much about how the sausage gets made. All the while, the quality of jobs is degraded. New technologies like AI are framed as offering us various forms of empowerment and liberation: We'll be able to work more productively, spend less time doing our chores, and anything we want will be a click or tap away. But those promises never paint an accurate picture of how that tech is transforming the world around us or the true cost of those supposed benefits. Automation may empower some people, but in the process, it's making things a lot harder for the hidden workers keeping everything moving.Paris Marx is a tech writer and host of the Tech Won't Save Us podcast.

 Generative AI is all the rage these days. Many useful applications of AI have started to pop up, from art creation to pretty much anything you can think of. There is one specific application that's going big, though. So big, in fact, that Big Tech companies have started to jump on it. 






 We're talking, of course, about AI chats and searching. But what exactly is generative AI search, and which companies are using it? 


 What Is Generative AI Search? 
    

 First off, we need to explain what generative AI search is. You're probably familiar with the concept of generative AI—it's a type of artificial intelligence that can generate content for you, from images to text, to music, and everything in between. It started catching on in late 2021 to early 2022, but it's matured to the point it can do some really amazing—and occasionally creepy—things. 






 But generative AI search is a proposition that, once it matures, can be greatly useful to users. Basically, it's like a search engine that can give you concise answers to questions generated by artificial intelligence based on the pool of knowledge that specific AI has access to. It can parse concise user questions and try to come up with answers that will be useful without necessarily linking to a website or portal. 

 In a way, this is pretty much the same way ChatGPT works. Right now, you can pull up ChatGPT and ask it questions. For example, you can ask it to whip up a recipe with a number of ingredients, or you can ask it for complicated questions about the ins and outs of chemistry. 

 But generative AI search aims to use that kind of output generation to replace all, or most, of the currently searched queries through regular search engines. And it aims to do a lot more. It's, essentially, putting the capabilities of ChatGPT, and all its power, at the fingertips of most regular users. 







 How Is Generative AI Search Different From Regular Search? 
    

 There are a few ways in which generative AI search is vastly different from regular search. 

 Right now, if you pull up Google and enter a search term, it'll return a number of search results of different things it found through the internet matching your search. Search engines in their current state are, essentially, directories of websites. They do the best job possible at indexing billions of websites and looking through each and every one of them to give you the exact one you're looking for. 






 Search engines are neat. They've been improved over the years, so it's even easier to search for specific information, and the results are not just a blank, boring-looking list of websites. For one, if you're asking it a question, it may pull up a quote from a website in an attempt to answer that question. And if you look up a company, place, or celebrity, it'll pull up a side panel with condensed information about what or who it is, and links to find more information. 

 Generative AI search wants to be the next step forward in this direction. Instead of pulling up millions of search results, your query gets fed through an AI that will try to help you the best way it can. If you have a question, it'll pull up information from its pool of knowledge to answer it, and if you want it to help you out with something, it will try and do so to the best of its ability. Basically, it's ChatGPT, except it looks like a browser. 






 It has a few challenges ahead, and it might not replace regular search engines entirely as they will still have their purpose, but it might become a nice compliment that will make them way more useful whenever the technology is mature and released. 



 Which Companies Are Using Generative AI Search? 
    

 Right now, the generative AI search battle is being fought between Google and Microsoft. 

 Microsoft announced the release of ""the new Bing,"" a new version of the company's search engine that will provide you not only with the regular Bing search experience but also with a complimentary, ChatGPT-like window where you can ask ""real questions"" and get ""complete answers."" You can ask it for help with your daily life, or just simple questions that you might or might not find using regular Bing. 





 In addition, ""the new Microsoft Edge"" is a revamped version of Microsoft's browser with this AI technology built in. So instead of heading over to the Bing browser, you can pull up a sidebar in Edge where you can input whatever you want the AI to help you with. It can come in handy if, for example, you're writing an email and struggling to find the right words. 

 Google, on the other hand, is also coming up with new AI features of its own. Google launched its ChatGPT-like chatbot called Bard, but eventually, the company wants to bring AI features into its main products as well. This includes the company's regular search experience, where AI-generated answers will complement, not replace, regular search results. 








 When Will I Be Able to Use Generative AI Search? 
 Right now, you're able to play around with ChatGPT. It's been doing some amazing things, and you can ask it to come up with answers to your questions now. It has a few limitations—it is, of course, a product in testing, its data range is limited to the end of 2021 (at the time of writing), and it might occasionally say inaccurate or false things. But it's a fun product to play around with. 

 As for actual AI-powered search engines, you can now join the waitlist for ""the new Bing"" at Microsoft's website. As for Google, there's no waitlist, but the company might eventually open up its work on AI sometime over the next few months. 



 Generative AI Search is Great 
 Generative AI search still needs work to become truly useful, but it is already a promising prospect. We can't wait to hear more about it as work continues on AI products.

Generative AI has been all the rage in the recent months, but it is typically generic and not specifically focused on the specific needs of any one company.
San Francisco-based startup Jasper is aiming to help make generative AI less generic. The company made a series of announcements today at its Gen AI conference.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



>>Follow VentureBeat’s ongoing generative AI coverage<<
Jasper is a well-funded operation, raising $125 million in October 2022 to help advance its generative AI efforts. All the money is being put to good use, the company says, as it is rolling out new products that expand enterprise functionally and usefulness for Jasper’s generative AI technology.
To date, Jasper’s AI platform has been providing services that help organizations rapidly develop both text- and image-based content.
Now, Jasper is taking the next step for enterprise generative AI with the launch of its Jasper for Business suite. Among the new features is Jasper Brand Voice, which helps organizations customize content creation to match the tone and style of their existing brand. 
The new Jasper Everywhere feature is meant to extend Jasper’s generative AI to run wherever users are working, including in online documents and content management systems (CMSs). 
And, rounding out Jasper’s updates is an API (application programming interface) designed to help organizations extend generative AI to their own application development.
“We’re very focused on how people use generative AI in business settings,” Jasper president Shane Orlich said in a media briefing. “We want generative AI to be the superpower that sits alongside our business users and helps them create better content at work.”
There may be no ‘I’ in teams, but Jasper wants there to be AI
Organizations almost always work in teams with multiple groups of individuals working together to help execute a task.
The Jasper for Teams offering is designed to help support this collaboration workflow. Jeremy Crane, VP of product at Jasper, explained that the tool is an ongoing effort that will encompass a number of features including document collaboration, status updates and analytics. The document sharing and collaboration feature is intended to be similar to tools such as Google Docs, said Crane.
Extending the ability of Jasper’s generative AI to work wherever users are working is another part of the company’s initiative to better support business workflows. Crane noted that Jasper is building out tools that will integrate its generative AI with existing business applications. It’s an effort the company has dubbed Jasper Everywhere. 
The first step in that effort is an updated version of the company’s web browser extension that supports Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
Crane said that the browser extension is designed to be conveniently accessible to users as they perform their tasks. This means that users have access to the tool in the context of other web-based tools without having to switch back to Jasper.
Generative AI doesn’t need to be generic AIadvertisement
Generative AI is built with large language models (LLMs) that are often trained on large, albeit generic, sets of data.
The new Jasper Brand Voice feature is an effort to fine-tune generative AI content creation to meet the specific style and needs for a given organization. With Brand Voice, an organization can provide updated corporate and product information to the AI model to support a higher degree of accuracy for content creation.
Many organizations utilize some form of style guide within their marketing to help provide a consistent message and tone. That style guide approach can now be replicated with Jasper’s Brand Voice.
“Every company has different rules that they use for writing that they want to implement across their team, such as what acronyms they use or don’t use,” said Crane. 
With Brand Voice, he said, Jasper can help anyone with a company create content, in the right tone and style with the latest information about the company and its services.advertisement
All the new capabilities coming to the Jasper for Business offering are developed with a series of different generative AI models at its foundation, including OpenAI.
“Think of Jasper as this application layer that’s sitting on top of many different models, including our own models,” Orlich said. “We’re able to pick and choose which pieces of those models we want to support in order to create the right piece of output for our customers.”

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence that can generate new data, such as text, images, or music, based on the patterns it has learned from existing data. This is achieved through techniques such as deep learning and neural networks. Generative AI has the potential to have a significant impact on the job market in developing countries, both positively and negatively. One example of generative AI is Chat GPT, which has revolutionized the use of AI. In the book, The New Fire War, Peace, and Democracy in the Age of AI, Ben Buchanan and Andrew Imbrue argue that AI is like fire; if we control it, it can become a source of power; otherwise, it can become a source of destruction. It can have both positive and negative impacts. 
According to the World Economic Forum, two-thirds of jobs could be lost due to automation in the developing world. This could have a significant impact on the population and stability of the government in Pakistan. Additionally, Pakistan’s lack of access to education and technology could exacerbate the adverse effects of job loss due to AI automation. It is essential to keep in mind that the impact of generative AI on the job market in Pakistan is likely to be complex and multifaceted and will depend on a variety of factors, such as the specific industries and job types in question as government policies and regulations. This could disproportionately affect low-skilled workers and those without access to education and training in AI-related fields. 
On the positive side, generative AI can help the Pakistani economy by enhancing efficiency and productivity. It can automate specific tasks, such as data analysis and decision-making, and increase efficiency in manufacturing and agriculture. This can lead to increased productivity and economic growth. Moreover, in Pakistan, where unemployment is already high, the use of generative AI in developing countries can create new job opportunities in fields related to AI, such as data analysis, software development, and machine learning. In addition, it can help in improving healthcare. It can be used to analyze large amounts of medical data and improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. This can lead to improved healthcare outcomes and increased access to medical services in developing countries.
Moreover, it can help improve education. It can be used to create personalized learning experiences for students. This can lead to improved educational outcomes and increased access to education in developing countries.
It’s important to note that the positive impact of generative AI in Pakistan will depend on the availability of resources such as electricity, internet access and skilled workforce, and government policies and regulations. Because significant investment in AI is coming from a few countries. Countries which are already developed are taking first mover advantage.
According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, China and the US account for over 75% of global AI venture capital investment. In recent years, China has spent more and more money on AI research. By 2020, the country is expected to have spent between $7 billion and $10 billion on AI. The US government has invested around $1.1 billion in AI research and development through the National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan. Other countries, such as the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, are investing in AI, but their investments are relatively smaller than those of the US and China. 
Hence, Pakistan should make an effort to improve the environment for the implementation of AI. Pakistan’s education system needs to be updated. Millions of children are out of school. It will be difficult for them to find good work in the AI era.
 AI has the potential to significantly impact jobs which will create difficulties in implementing AI in organizations. It will present Pakistan with two types of challenges. If Pakistan is going to implement AI technology, low-skilled people are going to lose their jobs. If we do not implement AI in our organization, we will not be able to compete with the world. Therefore, Pakistan’s policy should invest in science and technology education. We should increase investment in AI. Otherwise, it is going to have long-term implications for our comprehensive security.

Whether you’re looking for a new job, or you’re being sought out by a recruiter to fill an exciting open position, odds are AI is highly influencing the decision-making process. AI helps determine what job opportunities you see on LinkedIn or other job platforms, and it helps recruiting teams streamline everything from posting positions, evaluating candidates, matching skills to jobs, and even interviewing. And it does it lightning fast: what used to take days or weeks for human recruiters now can be performed by AI in a matter of seconds.  

The Evolving Role of AI in Recruitment
Today’s job search platforms like LinkedIn, Monster, Indeed, and others are using AI at an increasing rate to streamline an otherwise tedious manual process for recruiters. The ultimate goal of these sites, of course, is to match qualified candidates with available positions. They do so by employing AI-powered recommendations algorithms (or matching engines) to curate a list of recommendations for each search. Recruiters are said to be able to scan a resume in seconds, but AI can reduce that time to milliseconds. 
AI technologies are being applied in other interesting segments of the recruiting experience. Conducting an interview became a big challenge during the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, leading to a number of companies like Curious Thing to release AI-powered interviews that help engage candidates using voice-based conversational AI. Other hiring companies today might even request a candidate to play dan AI-powered video game that evaluates personality traits to see if you’ll be a good fit for different roles. 
How AI in Recruitment Helps Companies
There is a special nuance to recruiting, so AI will never replace recruiters, of course. But it will improve how fast and how well recruiters can do their job, and that has financial and productivity implications for any hiring organization. Areas that AI can help include:

Lowering Time to Hire: Matching candidates with specific roles can be a tedious task, so AI can help address this critical metric. Up to 40 percent of a recruiter’s time is spent on manual tasks like entering data into an applicant tracking system (ATS) or just reviewing resumes, time that is much better spent on the human aspect of building candidate relationships and improving the hiring experience. 
Improving Quality of Hire: Finding the absolute “right” candidate for any role is of paramount importance, and the devil is in the details. AI plays an important role in instantly searching through a huge data pool to match skills or attributes with jobs. The more a recruiter uses the AI engine, the faster AI learns on what an exact match looks like to improve prospective candidate quality.
Pursuing Passive Candidates: AI is very useful in the recruitment of what’s known as “passive candidates,” or those who are not actively looking for a job. The talent pool is massive for this group (it’s pretty much everyone out there not in the job search), so AI can quickly zoom in on great candidates, whether they’re looking or not.

How LinkedIn Uses AI in Recruitment
LinkedIn in particular has been boosting its development of AI and machine learning to improve the overall experience for its users and customers, including: 

Job Matching: An AI-powered personalization tool that matches jobs and candidates has led to a 30 percent increase in job applications. Members receive highly targeted employment recommendations on their home page, or suggestions on connecting with other professionals in their field.
Better Emails: AI can help improve a recruiter’s ability to reach out and engage a candidate with the right email messaging and content. Each message now sent is twice as likely to become a hire with the help of AI, and the number of two-way conversations (a vital part of recruiting engagement) has doubled. 
Overcoming Bias: It’s an unfortunate phenomenon, but ranked lists produced by an AI algorithm can sometimes inadvertently result in unintended bias, including gender bias. For example, men are more likely to apply for jobs beyond their qualifications, whereas women tend to pursue jobs that directly match the requirements. To address the issue, a new algorithm was developed to counteract recommendations skewed toward a particular group, resulting in a better distribution of users across gender. 
Internal Development: LinkedIn even developed a new AI tool to unify scattered AI workflows for its developers that use many different AI platforms for data analysis and collaboration. The unified tool called “Darwin” (Data science and Artificial intelligence Workbench at LinkedIn) enables data scientists, AI engineers, data analysts, business analysts, and even product managers to work together.

Conclusion: AI in Recruitment Is Just Getting Started
Like many fields, AI is streamlining critical processes in recruiting to improve the speed, quality and satisfaction of both recruiters and job seekers. And at places like LinkedIn, there is a growing demand for AI engineers and data scientists that can put skills to work to build and expand amazing professional networks.

 As artificial intelligence is becoming part of everything we do, the role of an AI analyst is becoming more essential for a range of businesses. This type of analyst relies on machine learning algorithms to monitor, assess, collect, process, and track statistical information from sets of data. 






 The path of an AI analyst is in high demand because of its future direction in many industries, but why is it growing to be more important? Here are some of the responsibilities of an AI analyst, and how they could impact the future of technology. 


 1. Designing or Analyzing Algorithms 

 

 How good are you at remembering patterns? As an AI analyst, you need to be an expert at designing and assessing various algorithm patterns, as this is what the bulk of AI software is built from. These algorithms can be important for designing layout or color, optimizations, speed, customizing user news feeds, or even generating images. 






 An artificial intelligence analyst works with a team of other data scientists and engineers on statistical modeling, natural language processing, and machine learning. For example, you could be working on the next powerful text-to-image generator, like NightCafe Creator. 



 2. Evaluating Software Applications 

 

 Want to ensure software applications are working correctly? Based on machine learning algorithms, AI analysts constantly monitor and assess data on a daily basis. With this job, you would be responsible for analyzing the source code of AI-based software applications, which is vital to any application working properly. 






 This could include any intelligent software capable of learning and problem-solving, such as company chatbots that speak to customers, or Cortana on Windows. With advanced technology such as this, the quality of the software is something you want to be trialed and tested, especially if it is a commercial product for a wider audience. If you're building a virtual assistant, for example, you want it to respond correctly to customer questions. 



 3. Research New AI Technology 

 

 Do you consider yourself a great researcher? AI is always changing, so researching new technologies can help optimize performance and solve problems more quickly. After all, the evolution of AI today is due to constant research. 






 Faced with constant information, organizations or small businesses may need a new type of system that adapts and learns. From natural language generation to speech recognition, robotic processing, or deep learning programs, there are so many ways this technology can assist businesses. Want to learn more about a branch in this career path? Here is how to become an artificial intelligence engineer. 



 4. Testing Prototypes 

 

 How useful are your critical thinking or reasoning skills? A prototype is where all products, whether a mobile app or physical product, always begin. And the quicker they get past these development stages, the more successful they become. AI analysts make this process even easier by testing prototypes. 






 Prototype testing offers valuable feedback that analysts can use to avoid expensive mistakes, so end users can get the best possible outcome. This could be done through user testing, for example, a chat system for customers to use on a new technology website. Another example could be acquiring user feedback on an app in beta mode. It's valuable to any team. 

 AI analysts design data analysis based on machine learning techniques to boost the testing phase. Through testing prototypes over time, AI analysts can uncover a range of hidden opportunities that creators may have missed. 



 5. Writing Computer Code 

 






 Are you amazing at computer languages? AI analysts should be well-versed in writing computer codes, as this is how artificial intelligence is created. In AI, coding boosts the logical and analytical understanding of data, so learning to code allows AI analysts to solve problems related to big data. 

 AI analysts should have a sound knowledge of programming languages like R or SAS to assist in gathering data, analyzing statistics, or visualizing data. By learning to code, analysts can clean data, change it into various formats, understand errors in databases, and bring forth new ideas to introduce more solutions. 



 6. Assisting Business Productivity 

 

 When it comes to business productivity, AI analysts help a business thrive in many ways. With AI being able to predict future analytics, analysts can reduce errors in supply chain networks, for example, making this a much smoother process for businesses that need products pushed quickly. 





 AI analysts boost the productivity of businesses with predictive maintenance, business monitoring, customer experience monitoring, and revenue monitoring. If there are time constraints or numbers needing to be met, an AI analyst knows every part of this process and is incredibly valuable to any team. 



 7. Preparing Reports 

 

 AI analysts in today’s digitized world collaborate with professionals related to data mining, machine learning, cloud computing, and more. With this in mind, you need outstanding communication to be able to prepare reports that are accurate and make sense. 






 Companies need AI analysts to work in cross-functional teams, so if you've always been an organized person, preparing reports may be your favorite responsibility. An AI analyst is responsible for preparing, procuring, and modeling machine learning models, as well as handling all the numbers in terms of products or marketing. 

 These professionals should also know how to prepare reports on research, experimentation, and the development of new approaches. AI analysts can then present their findings, offer suggestions, and assist the company in the future. Looking to practice for an AI role? Here are the best tips to make your project reports stand out! 



 8. Maximizing Business Returns 

 






 Do you thrive on business that can increase its revenue? You wouldn't think it, but an AI analyst adds a huge amount of value to business returns. AI has great potential to make this happen, with the assistance of targeted marketing, customer service, automated workflows, optimizing product pricing, and so much more. 

 By analyzing data properly, analysts can increase and establish a number of their project goals each quarter. On a technology website, for example, AI has the power to personalize ad content depending on past search results. AI can help businesses automate workflows with voice assistants to read emails, for example, or intelligent screenings that can scan for malware. 



 AI Analysts Are Technologically Innovative 
 With AI analytics, automated data analysis, and machine technologies, an AI analyst profession involves data-driven knowledge to help solve previously unsolvable challenges. 






 Making use of AI analytical skills helps in driving customer engagement, improving prototype development, improving reports, and increasing business returns. An AI analyst can ultimately improve the way of the future in the world of business, and as a career path, is guaranteed to grow.
