Human Vs. Artificial Intelligence: Why Finding The Right Balance Is Key To SuccessAdobe Stock

In short, now that we have increasingly capable robots and artificial intelligence (AI) systems – capable of taking on tasks that were previously the sole domain of humans – it’s easier than ever for organizations to leverage intelligent machines. But this leaves employers with some major questions to answer: how do we find the right balance between intelligent machines and human intelligence? What roles should be given over to machines? And which roles are best suited to humans?

The first step: Understanding what machines can do

Particularly in traditional companies, business leaders often aren’t up to speed on the sheer range of tasks that today’s AIs and intelligent robots can take on. (In fact, I spend a lot of time educating executives in this area.) This knowledge is key to finding the right balance between humans and machines in your organization.

PROMOTED
Some of the things AIs and AI-enabled robots can do are pretty mind-blowing. For example, AIs can now read, write, see, speak and even understand emotions. While this sounds impressive, AIs are, for the most part, taking one type of input (be it visual data, written data, or whatever) and generating a particular output, as programmed. Once you understand this basic input-to-output idea, there’s potential to automate all sorts of tasks that follow this same model, such as scanning security videos for suspicious behavior, moderating content online, answering simple customer inquiries, entering data, and maintaining bookkeeping records, and so on.
As Stanford professor Andrew NG puts it, “If a typical person can do a mental task with less than one second of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future.” In other words, human jobs that are built on some sort of input-to-output scenario are very likely to be automated in the future.

So what will happen to human workers?
In light of this incoming wave of automation, the work of humans will be affected in three key ways:

· Displacement of human jobs. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2020, 85 million jobs may be displaced by automation by 2025 – truly a staggering figure. Naturally, this creates a lot of fear around automation. But while many jobs will be displaced, it’s important to note that even more jobs will be augmented or created because of technology adoption. Which brings us to…

· Augmentation of human jobs. Here, many jobs will be changed in some way by automation. According to the WEF, by 2025, the time spent on current tasks at work by humans and machines will be equal. This means employers must find the perfect balance between those tasks done by humans and those done by machines. To put it another way, we need to ensure the work given to machines is best suited to machines, and the work given to humans is best suited to humans (so humans don’t end up feeling like machines).
· Addition of new human jobs. Finally, new jobs will arise that previously did not exist. While the WEF estimates that 85 million jobs may be displaced, it also estimates that 97 million new roles may emerge – roles that are better adapted to the new division of labor between humans and machines. These new human roles are likely to rely on a slightly different set of skills and capabilities, compared to those skills that have traditionally been prioritized in the past.
All this means employers have a responsibility to equip their workforces with the skills needed for the fourth industrial revolution. What sort of skills are we talking about? Well, with machines taking on more of the easily automated input-to-output work, it’s the inherently human skills that will become more and more valuable in the workplace. Things like empathy, creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, communication, and complex decision making, to name just a few.
“Responsible automation” in practice
Stitch Fix is a fashion subscription box that uses AI to pick out clothes that customers will love. But the company doesn’t just rely on AI to do this; it’s the perfect blend of AI and human stylists that makes the service so impressive.
At Stitch Fix, machines do the initial work of crunching through enormous amounts of data and evaluating the likelihood of a customer loving a particular style, based on the customer’s information, preferences and previous choices. Then a human stylist finalizes the selection and writes a personal note advising the client on how to style the items.
For me, this is a fantastic example of getting the best out of both machines and humans, and it’s something many organizations could learn from. This perfect symbiosis between intelligent machines and capable humans is referred to by automation pioneers Faethm as “responsible automation.” Faethm is on a mission to ensure automation is done in a way that doesn’t leave humans behind, and the company’s approach involves breaking jobs down into task fractions to see what can and can’t be automated. Done this way, automation – at least according to Faethm – doesn’t have to result in job losses. Instead, humans transition to more rewarding tasks.
The key takeaway here is that organizations must start to identify the tasks that are better suited to machines so that those tasks can be automated, leaving humans to do the more complex, rewarding work. And on top of this, employers must equip their workforces with the skills that will be essential for success in the 21st century.

As her parents run a local tennis club in Wales, she was immersed in the sport from the age of 14.One aspect she has noticed is the embrace of technology, at all levels of tennis.""Tennis is such a technical sport. These days, anyone I play or coach is into tech, be it video analysis or longest rally stats.""She uses a range of apps and techniques for her own matches and coaching including a smartphone-based video system called SwingVision, which breaks down her performance with details such as forehand errors and backhand winners. ""Personally, I like having the tech to enhance my game. I can see a clearer vision of what I can improve, from my swing to my patterns of play,"" she explains.Data analytics has been around a long time in sport. Perhaps the best known in example of its use is from 2002, when the Oakland Athletics baseball team used statistical analysis to choose their squad, rather than the wisdom of coaches and scouts, and their favoured metrics.Getty ImagesEven Hollywood has taken an interest in data analytics with the movie Moneyball starring Brad Pitt and Jonah HillThat experience was the core of Michael Lewis's 2003 best-selling book Moneyball, which later become a film staring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill.Tennis has also seen this revolution. ""Data blew up our sport,"" says tennis strategist and coach Craig O'Shannessy.For him the 2015 Australian Open was a key moment.As Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray battled on court, powerful computers crunched the data and grouped rally length into three distinct categories, essentially short, medium and long. Getty ImagesIn tennis the 2015 Australian Open final was a big moment for data analysis says Craig O'Shannessy""We discovered 70% of all points were each player hitting the ball into the court a maximum of just twice,"" he says.Mr O'Shannessy, who worked with Novak Djokovic between 2017 to 2019, says that insight made him realise that the way players practice was all wrong.""Ninety percent of practice is focused on consistency, but only 10% of the match court is in rallies of more than 9 points,"" he points out.""This data changed our sport forever,"" he says.Craig O'ShannessyCraig O'Shannessy worked with Novak Djokovic for two yearsThat manipulation of data has been taken to a new level.Coaches now have artificial intelligence (AI), where sophisticated software is fed, or trained, with unimaginable amounts of data. The resulting AI can spot patterns that a human would never be able to see.""AI can sniff out areas of significances. Humans do a very bad job at layering data, whereas AI can do it in seconds,"" says Mr O'Shannessy.So, for example, if Novak Djokovic hits 50 winners from his forehand those shots could be broken down in multiple ways or layers. Perhaps 40 of them came when he was serving and then 35 came on the first shot after the serve.Finding a pattern of play where Novak hits 35 out of 50 winners in exactly same way is a first, according to Mr O'Shannessy.""We've stumbled around for decades trying to bring all this together.""AI requires vast amounts of data to train and build accurate algorithms. Getty ImagesPlayers have access to even more data than ever at this year's French OpenRaghavan Subramanian is the head of the Infosys Tennis Platform and has been working with the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) since 2015 and with The French Open (also known as Roland Garros) for more than three years.He has access to videos and statistics from around 700 matches every year. ""Valuable data that forms the raw material for all our AI and machine learning systems,"" says Mr Subramanian. He said accuracy has improved over the past four years, as more training data has become available.From the player's point of view it means they can analyse a match with more precision. Using the Roland Garros Players App, they can see exactly the placement of key shots, such as winners, errors and serves.InfosysRaghavan Subramanian says the Infosys AI gets more accurate with each tournamentBBC: Live French Open scores and order of play""We saw a 51% jump in the use of the RG Players App in 2021, compared to the previous year, with 1,100 players and coaches using AI-powered videos,"" says Mr Subramanian.The AI is also speeding up media coverage of the tournament. AI is slicing and dicing data to create video content in seconds, a job that would normally take a multimedia team hours to do.""Fans are able to access and analyse match highlights and other smart playlists almost immediately after a match.""

They build cars in factories. They sort goods in Amazon warehouses. Robotic dogs can, allegedly and a little creepily, make us safer by patrolling our streets. But there are some things robots still cannot do – things that sound quite basic in comparison. Like picking an apple from a tree.“It’s a simple thing” for humans, says robotics researcher Joe Davidson. “You and I, we could close our eyes, reach into the tree. We could feel around, touch it, and say ‘hey, that’s an apple and the stem’s up here’. Pull, twist. We could do all that without even looking.”Creating a robotic implement that can simply pick an apple and drop it into a bin without damaging it is a multimillion-dollar effort that has been decades in the making. Teams around the world have tried various approaches. Some have developed vacuum systems to suck fruit off trees. Davidson and his colleagues turned to the human hand for inspiration. They began their efforts by observing professional fruit pickers, and are now working to replicate their skilled movements with robotic fingers.Their work could help to transform agriculture, turning fruit-picking – a backbreaking, time-consuming human task – into one that’s speedy and easier on farm workers.These efforts have gained impetus recently as researchers point to the worsening conditions for farm workers amid the climate crisis, including extreme heat and wildfire smoke, and also a shortage of workers in the wake of the pandemic. The technology could lead to better working conditions and worker safety. But that outcome depends on how robots are deployed in fields, farm workers’ organizations say.While robotic tools for agriculture have made big strides in recent years, those AI-based tools are mostly used for weeding, monitoring soil moisture and other field conditions, or for planting soybeans using remote-controlled tractors. “But when it actually comes to doing physical work like pruning trees or picking fruit, that’s still the realm of people today,” Davidson says.Teaching robots to perform these tasks requires modernized versions of both the orchard and the apple.Traditional orchards, with irregularly shaped trees and giant canopies, are too much of a challenge for algorithms to parse and process. Shifting sunbeams, fog and clouds add to computer vision’s challenges. Tangled, tall old trees are problematic even to human pickers, who end up spending much of their time hauling and positioning ladders, not picking fruit.Now, many growers have transitioned to orchards where trees grow flat against trellises, their trunks and branches at right angles to create a “wall of fruit”, says Scott Jacky, owner of Red Roof Consulting, a group that helps optimize farm technologies. The thinner canopy also lets more sunlight in, encouraging fruits to form.Since the 1990s, breeders have been working to develop apple varieties more resistant to sunburn – a side-effect of those sparser canopies – and less prone to bruising when dropped into bins. All these changes to the trees and the apples themselves make the job easier for robots (and for humans).In orchards with trellised trees, human fruit pickers can cruise through rows of trees in pairs on slowly rolling platforms. One person crouches to reach low-hanging fruit, the other reaches for the higher branches. Professionals working this way take about two seconds to pick one apple.The robot in Davidson’s lab, which is essentially a giant arm mounted on a rolling platform, takes about five seconds to make its moves. At the click of a key, the robotic arm reaches up for the fruit – actually a plastic apple made for testing purposes – with its three-fingered palm. Its fingers are covered in cushiony silicone “skin”, which conceals individual motors wired to tendons that drive its fingers. Thirty sensors under each fingertip track the pressure, speed, angle and other aspects of its grasp to help the robot complete its task.Another keystroke and the fingers tighten, then twist, and the apple – successfully picked – rests in the robot’s palm.The fruit-picking robot has picked an apple successfully about half of the 500 or so times it has tried so far. Still, the robotic arm has cracked some problems that posed hurdles to automation. For instance, it can avoid damaging both fruit and tree limbs in the harvesting process. Rapid improvements in computing make Davidson and others hopeful the robots will work on farms within the next five to 10 years.The US government is placing significant bets on this technology. Last year alone, federal funding agencies granted $20m to support the AgAID institute, a new group that supports several researchers, including Davidson, in efforts to develop artificial intelligence-backed tools for agriculture.Proponents of harvest automation say there will still be jobs for people, such as training and operating the robots. “There are going to be plenty of tasks where the robotic instruments and digital devices will necessarily have to work with humans,” said Ananth Kalyanaraman, professor at Washington State University and director of the AgAID institute. “That’s going to actually empower humans because it gives them new skillsets.”For now, it’s unclear to many farm workers how the robots will affect their livelihood. “If they’re used properly, they can actually be a support system for workers and improve standards at work,” says Reyna Lopez, executive director of PCUN, a Latinx farm workers’ organization in Oregon.But so far, Lopez and others say they have not been involved in conversations about the fruit-picking robots. “Historically, farm workers have not been placed at the center of any of these conversations,” they say. Across various industries, including agriculture, waves of automation have led to job losses and a devaluing of human work. Often in the wake of such shifts, “what happens to low-wage workers is that people lose their jobs,” Lopez says.The emergence of robotic farm workers could even be an opportunity for humans to engage in different – and far less strenuous – work than pruning or harvesting, says Ines Hanrahan, executive director of the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission. “There’s a lot of folks in rural communities who, even if they would like to, physically cannot do these jobs,” she says.“When you take the physical aspect out, these tasks become more accessible to older workers or those less physically capable of lugging ladders and things. It enables more people to be drawn into this work.”Explore more on these topicsOut of sight: the algorithms running our livesArtificial intelligence (AI)AgriculturefeaturesShareReuse this content",,,,,,,

This year, LinkedIn named data scientist specialists and artificial intelligence practitioners among the top jobs that enterprises sought to fill. The salary range for an artificial intelligence practitioner is $124,000 to $150,000. For a data scientist specialist, the salary range is $100,000 to $130,000. Compare this with the average U.S. salary for programmers, which is under $100,000.
If you’re working for a company, you want to make as much money as you can — but you also want to enjoy what you’re doing, and you want the self-confidence and assurance that you’re providing value in your job and that you yourself are valued.

Sometimes an IT professional can feel trapped in a job, with no way out for promotions or a higher salary. Software maintenance programmers often fit into this category. So do non-technical business analysts or IT support persons who have spent so much time managing databases, storage and the help desk that they are recognized as entrenched experts in these areas, which unfortunately can be a career dead-end in IT.
Is it time to try AI?
The requisite skills for a data scientist specialist are knowledge in data visualization, statistical modeling and open-source tools and libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence. For artificial intelligence practitioners, the skill set is machine learning, C++, Python and cloud services such as Amazon Web Services.

Learn AI job-seeking strategies
If you’re an IT employee who wants to transition to AI, what skills will you need and what strategies should you apply?
Check in with yourself
At first blush it might seem very attractive to increase your salary by 30-40% by moving over to AI, but is AI the right fit for you?
A majority of IT professionals like to feel that they are in control. They like the idea of working toward predefined goals and deadlines for deliverables. AI doesn’t offer that.
The machine learning that is part of AI might direct an AI project and its outcomes into entirely different directions than the project initiators thought. Some AI projects fail after many months of effort. Data scientists who come from an academic background are used to this uncertainty, but IT professionals who are accustomed to hard deadlines and results aren’t.
If you can’t live with the uncertainty, then AI probably isn’t a good fit for you.
Evaluate the skills you’ll need
If you’re a database professional, skills in SQL and NoSQL databases are important. You should also plan on acquiring working knowledge of graph databases, which are often used in AI systems.
If you are an application programmer, knowledge of Python, C++, Java, Julia and R are important.
If you’re a business analyst, it’s important to keep your business knowledge up-to-date so you can assist users in formulating use cases and questions for AI, but you should also be conversant in statistical analysis and algorithm development so you can talk with data scientists.
Make your own AI opportunity
In some cases, companies will assist employees in making a career change to AI by providing them with AI project work. In other cases, companies prefer to hire outside talent.
If you are in a company that doesn’t have AI opportunities for existing employees, you can still acquire AI training by attending college or university classes outside of work.
The next step is finding opportunities to work on actual AI projects so you can put these real world projects (and the new skills you are using) on your resume. Networking through your school is a good place to start when it comes to finding actual AI project work.

Companies know all too well how hard it is to find and hire a qualified software engineer, especially in emerging fields like artificial intelligence (AI). Job hunters are also frustrated because they don’t know exactly what companies are looking for.
So, what are the top skills which companies needs and candidate should master to become AI engineers? Here are the top technical skills and soft skills top engineers have:
Technical Skills
The top technical skills for AI engineers include:
Programming Languages
Python is the most widely used programming language for AI and is widely used for machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network connections.
However, Python is just one of the programming languages used. Some of the more popular languages used are:

Prolog
LISP
Java
C++
R

Algebra, Probability, and Statistics
AI engineers must understand the different types of AI models. That requires a firm grasp of linear algebra, probability, and statistics.
Common AI models include:

Linear regression
Logic regression
Decision trees
Linear discriminant analysis
Naïve Bayes classifiers
Support Vector Machines
Learning Vector Quantization
K-nearest Neighbors
Random Forest

Big Data Analysis
AI can incorporate massive data sets. AI engineers must be well-versed in the tools and processes for managing these large data sets. A background in Apache Spark architecture, Hadoop, Cassandra, and MongoDB will help.
Algorithms
Algorithms make many decisions within AI frameworks that are necessary to drive machine learning models. Deep learning algorithms, especially for unstructured data, require a framework for working. AI frameworks include tools such as PyTorch, Theano, TensorFlow, and Caffe.
Soft Skills
Going beyond the technical skills, however, employers are also looking for the soft skills that make AI engineers a fit for the workplace. This includes such skills as

 Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking
Software development is about solving complex problems. 
For AI engineers, the ability to handle problems and solve them is an essential skill. This requires critical as well as creative thinking, and the flexibility to examine different solutions to determine the best path forward.
Communication Skills
AI teams often work both independently and together at different times during development. Communication is an essential function, especially if team members are working remotely. This requires both written and verbal communication skills and, depending on the project and organization, may require interfacing with clients or stakeholders.
Most people that you will be required to communicate with, will not have the technical skills or understanding of AI concepts. So, the AI engineers would be required to break down complex ideas into simplified language that can be understood by team members belonging to non-technical backgrounds.
Interpersonal Skills
An AI engineer is required to be able to work with team members effectively. This means displaying soft skills such as patience and empathy to help create productive interactions. This is especially crucial when AI engineers need to collaborate on projects.
It also means the ability to listen to others’ ideas with judgment and be willing to accept other solutions to problems besides just their own.
Self-Awareness
Self-awareness is the ability to see yourself as others see you. This helps you judge how your actions will affect others and interpret actions, thoughts, and feelings objectively. While self-confidence is an important soft skill, so is the ability to admit a weakness and seek help to fill in missing skills gaps.
Lifelong Learners
A survey by Stack Overflow found that 87% of software engineers responding to its survey had taught themselves a new technology or programming language. Three-quarters of software engineers and developers say they learn new skills every few months or at least once a year.
In emerging tech fields, continuous education is an essential skill. AI developers must be self-motivated and curious to stay on top of emerging trends and learn what’s needed to remain current.
Time Management
AI engineers are working on projects with deadlines and that are time-bound in most cases. Strong time management skills are essential to staying focused to meet milestones for deliverables.
Adaptability
In a rapidly evolving tech environment, the ability to adapt to changes and different ways of doing things can make a big difference. As more knowledge is gained, specifications change, or new tech evolves, AI engineers must be able (and willing) to adapt to new approaches.

And there's a limit to how much quality content a human can produce,"" Mr Mahoney says.""You can get the same quality of content using AI tools. You just get it faster.""How much faster? About three times, he estimates.He still has to check and edit the AI-generated text, but it's less work and he's cut his rates by half.""Every SEO [Search Engine Optimisation] agency that I've spoken with uses AI to some extent."" We asked GPT-3 to write a limerick for the ABC audience. It produced this in less than a second.(ABC Science: James Purtill)In Perth, Sebastian Marks no longer bothers with content agencies at all.About a year ago, he saw an ad for an AI writing assistant and signed up.The AI tool now writes pretty much everything for his company, Moto Dynamics, which sells motorcycles and organises racing events.Its output includes employee bios, marketing copy, social media posts, and business proposals.""Once we'd started feeding data into it and teaching it how to work for us, it became more and more user-friendly,"" he says.""Now we use it essentially as an admin.""Millions of words per minuteThe particular AI writing tool Mr Mahoney uses is called ContentBot, which like many of its competitors was launched early last year.""It was very exciting,"" says Nick Duncan, the co-founder of ContentBot, speaking from Johannesburg.""There was a lot of word of word of mouth with this technology. It just sort of exploded."" Released in April 2022, OpenAI's DALL-E 2 produces high-res conceptual art from text commands.(Supplied: OpenAI)The trigger for this explosion was OpenAI's November 2021 decision to make its GPT-3 AI universally available for developers.It meant anyone could pay to access the AI tool, which had been introduced in May 2020 for a limited number of clients.Dozens of AI writing tools launched in early 2021.LongShot AI is only a year old, but claims to have 12,000 users around the world, including in Australia.""And there are other products that would have ten-fold the number of clients we have,"" says its co-founder, Ankur Pandey, speaking from Mumbai.""Revolutionary changes in AI happened in the fall of 2020. This whole field has completely skyrocketed.""Companies like ContentBot and Longshot pay OpenAI for access to GPT-3: the rate of the most popular model (Davinci) is about $US0.06 per 750 words.In March 2021, GPT-3 was generating an average of 4.5 billion words per day.We don't know the current figure, but it would be much higher given the AI is being more widely used.""It's been a game changer,"" Mr Duncan says.What about student essays?There are dozens of AI writing tools that advertise to students.Among them is Article Forge, a GPT-3 powered tool that claims its essays can pass the plagiarism checkers used by schools and universities.Demand for the product has increased five-fold in two years, chief executive officer Alex Cardinell says.""It's the demand for cheaper content with shorter turnaround times that requires less overall effort to produce.""People do not want AI, they want what AI can do for their business.""Lucinda McKnight, a curriculum expert at Deakin University, confirms that students are early adopters of AI writing tools.""I can tell you without doubt that kids are very widely using these things, especially spinners on the internet.""Spinners are automated tools that rephrase and rewrite content so it won't be flagged for plagiarism.""It can produce in a matter of seconds multiple different copies of the same thing, but worded differently."" A screenshot of OpenAI's list of prices for using GPT-3.(Supplied: OpenAI)These developments are shifting ideas around student authorship. If it becomes impossible to distinguish AI writing from human, what's the point in trying to detect plagiarism?""We should be getting students to acknowledge how they've used AI as another kind of source for their writing,"" Dr McKnight says.""That is the way to move forwards, rather than to punish students for using them.""So, can AI write good?When GPT-3 launched two years ago, word spread of its writing proficiency, but access was limited.Recently, OpenAI has thrown open the doors to anyone with a guest login, which takes a few minutes to acquire.Given the prompt ""Write a news story about AI"", the AI tool burped out three paragraphs. Here's the first:""The world is on the brink of a new era of intelligence. For the first time in history, artificial intelligence (AI) is about to surpass human intelligence. This momentous event is sure to change the course of history, and it is all thanks to the tireless work of AI researchers.""In general, GPT-3 is remarkably good at stringing sentences together, though plays fast and loose with the facts.Asked to write about the 2022 Australian election, it claimed the vote would be held on July 2.But it still managed to sound like it knew what it was talking about:""Whoever wins the election, it is sure to be a close and hard-fought contest.

Facial recognition uses deep learning to ""see"" features like eyes and mouths.(Reuters: Thomas Peter)While working on ways to improve Google Translate, researchers at the company stumbled upon a deep learning model that proved to be good at predicting what word should come next in a sentence.Called Transformer, it's like a supercharged version of text messaging auto-complete.""Transformer is a very, very good statistical guesser,"" says Alan Thompson, an independent AI researcher and consultant.""It wants to know what is coming next in your sentence or phrase or piece of language, or in some cases, piece of music or image or whatever else you've fed to the Transformer.""At the same time, in parallel to Google, an Australian tech entrepreneur and data scientist, Jeremy Howard, was finding new ways to train deep learning models on large datasets. Jeremy Howard sold two successful start-ups before moving to Silicon Valley.Professor Howard, who would go on to become an honorary professor at the University of Queensland, had moved to San Francisco six years earlier, from Melbourne.He proposed feeding Transformer a big chunk of text data and seeing what happened.""So in 2018, the OpenAI team actually took Professor Jeremy Howard's advice and fed the original GPT with a whole bunch of book data into this Transformer model,"" Dr Thompson says.""And they watched as it was able to complete sentences seemingly out of nowhere.""Transformer is the basis for GPT (which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer), as well as other current language models.Professor Howard's contribution is widely recognised in Silicon Valley, but not so much in Australia, to which he recently returned.""In Australia, people will ask what do you do and I'll be like, 'I'm a professor in AI'. And they say, 'Oh well, how about the footy?'"" he says.""It's very, very different.""But how does the AI form sentences?The short answer is that, beyond a certain point, we don't know.AI like GPT-3 are known as ""black boxes"", meaning it's impossible to know the internal process of computation.The AI has trained itself to do a task, but how it actually performs that task is largely a mystery.""We've given it this training data and we've let it kind of macerate that data for months, which is the equivalent of many human years, or decades even,"" Dr Thompson says.""And it can do things that it shouldn't be able to do. It taught itself coding and programming. It can write new programmes that haven't existed.""As you might guess, this inability to understand exactly how the technology works is a problem for driverless cars, which rely on AI to make life-and-death decisions.Meanwhile, new and more powerful AIs are being unveiled almost every week.""I documented one coming out every 3-4 days in March through April,"" Dr Thompson says.""We've now got 30, 40, 50 different large language models [like GPT-3], and sometimes they're being released weekly.""GPT-4 is expected to be unveiled within months. Google this week also launched a text-to-image AI tool, Imagen, that may be better than DALL-E 2.(Supplied: Google Research)This week, Google's DeepMind released its most impressive AI yet, called Gato, which is designed to be good at lots of tasks.Its makers describe it as a precursor to an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is a long-anticipated AI that can understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.In theory, potentially any human occupation could be replaced by an AGI.""We used to say that artificial general intelligence and the replacement of humans would be like 2045,"" Dr Thompson says.""I'm seeing the beginnings of AGI right now.""AI tools performing creative human tasks is no longer the stuff of science fiction, or something that will happen in 10 years' time.For Danny Mahoney in Melbourne, it's already begun.""I think people really underestimate how useful it is at this point,"" he says.""Anybody who spends any significant amount of time on the internet is reading AI content without even realising.""Posted 28 May 202228 May 2022Sat 28 May 2022 at 2:30pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesArtificial intelligence is making decisions that affect us and some of those choices aren't that smartWe asked an AI tool to 'paint' images of Australia.

						New EEOC Guidance: The Use of Artificial Intelligence Can Discriminate Against Employees or Job Applicants with Disabilities

As the use of artificial intelligence wedges its way into every side of business and culture, government regulation is (perhaps too slowly) moving to build legal boundaries around its use.
On May 12, 2022, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a new comprehensive “technical assistance” guidance entitled The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees. The guidance, which covers a number of areas, defines algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI); gives examples of how AI is used by employers; answers the question of employer liability for use of vendor AI tools; requires reasonable accommodation in deploying AI in this context; addresses the “screen out” problem of AI rejecting candidates who would otherwise qualify for the job with reasonable accommodation; requires limitations to avoid asking disability-related and medical questions; promotes “promising practices” for employers, job applicants, and employees alike; and gives many specific examples of disability discrimination pitfalls in using AI tools.
Here are some primary takeaways from the new guidance:
Employers Can Be Exposed to ADA Liability for AI Vendor Software:

Risk Exposure for Vendor Software. Employers who deploy AI-driven decision-making tools to evaluate employees or job applicants may be liable under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for the shortcomings of that technology. Even if the AI tool was developed or administered by a third party vendor, the employer can be on the hook — especially if the employer has “given [the vendor] authority to act on the employer’s behalf.”


On the Test Side and on the Accommodation Side. This means employers need to manage risk from the AI vendor’s action or inaction in administering the evaluation and in granting reasonable accommodations. If an individual requests a reasonable accommodation due to a disability and the vendor denies the request, the employer can be exposed for the vendor’s inaction despite being unaware of the request.


Check the Vendor Agreement. Employers should closely consider indemnity and other liability- limiting and allocating provisions of their AI vendor agreements.

Al Tools Can Unlawfully “Screen Out” Qualified Individuals with Disabilities:

Screen Outs. “Screen outs” in the AI context can occur when a disability lowers an individual’s performance in taking an AI-driven employment test, or prevents a candidate from consideration in the first place, for failure to meet AI-driven threshold criteria. Under the ADA, a screen out is unlawful if the tool screened out an individual who is able to perform the essential functions of the job with a reasonable accommodation.


Examples. AI tools can screen out individuals with limited manual dexterity (to use a keyboard); who are sight, hearing, or speech impaired; who have employment gaps due to past disability issues; or who suffer from PTSD (thus skewing the results, for example, of personality tests or gamified memory tests).

Per the guidance: “A disability could have this [screen out] effect by, for example, reducing the accuracy of the assessment, creating special circumstances that have not been taken into account, or preventing the individual from participating in the assessment altogether.”

Bias Free? Some AI-based decision-making tools are marketed as “validated” to be “bias-free.” It sounds good, but that labelling may not speak to disabilities, as opposed to gender, age, or race. Disabilities — physical, mental, or emotional — cover a broad swath of life, can be highly individualized (including as to necessary accommodation), and as such are less susceptible to bias-free software adjustment. For example, learning disabilities can often go undetected by human observers because their severity and characteristics so widely vary. Employers will need assurances that AI can do better.

AI Screens Can Generate Unlawful Disability and Medical-Related Inquiries:

Unlawful Inquiries. AI-driven tools can generate unlawful “disability-related inquires” or seek information as part of a “medical examination” before approving candidates for conditional offers of employment.

Per the guidance: “An assessment includes ‘disability-related inquiries’ if it asks job applicants or employees questions that are likely to elicit information about a disability or directly asks whether an applicant or employee is an individual with a disability. It qualifies as a “medical examination” if it seeks information about an individual’s physical or mental impairments or health. An algorithmic decision-making tool that could be used to identify an applicant’s medical conditions would violate these restrictions if it were administered prior to a conditional offer of employment.”

Indirect Failure. Not all health-related inquiries by AI tools are considered “disability-related inquires or medical examination.”

Per the guidance: “[E]ven if a request for health-related information does not violate the ADA’s restrictions on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations, it still might violate other parts of the ADA. For example, if a personality test asks questions about optimism, and if someone with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) answers those questions negatively and loses an employment opportunity as a result, the test may ‘screen out’ the applicant because of MDD.”
Best Practices: Robust Notice of What is Being Measured — and that Reasonable Accommodation is Available:
There are a number of best practices employers can follow to manage the risk of using AI tools. The guidance calls them “Promising Practices.” Primary points:

Disclose the Topics and Methodology. As a best practice, regardless of whether a third-party vendor developed the AI software/tool/application, employers (or their vendors) should inform employees or job applicants — in plain, understandable terms — what the evaluation entails. In other words, disclose up front the knowledge, skill, ability, education, experience, quality, or trait that will be measured or screened with the AI tool. In the same vein, disclose up front how testing will conducted and what will required — using a keyboard, verbally answering questions, interacting with a chatbot, or what have you.


Invite Requests for Accommodation. Empowered with that information, an applicant or employee has more of an opportunity to speak up ahead of time if they feel some disability accommodation will be needed. As such, employers should consider asking employees and job applicants if they require a reasonable accommodation using the tool.




Obvious or Known Disability: If an employee or applicant with an obvious or known disability asks for an accommodation, the employer should promptly and appropriately respond to that request.






Otherwise-Concealed Disability: If the disability is otherwise unknown, the employer may ask for medical documentation.




Provide Reasonable Accommodation. Once the claimed disability is confirmed, the employer must provide a reasonable accommodation even if that means providing an alternative testing format. This is where the guidance can truly come in conflict with the use of AI. As such tools become endemic, alternative testing may seem inadequate by comparison, and potential discrimination between AI-tested individuals and old-school tested individuals may arise.

Per the guidance: “Examples of reasonable accommodations may include specialized equipment, alternative tests or testing formats, permission to work in a quiet setting, and exceptions to workplace policies.”

Protect PHI. As always, any medical information obtained in relation to accommodation requests must be kept confidential and stored separately from the employee’s or applicant’s personnel file.

With the increasing reliance on AI in the private employer sector, employers will have to expand their proactive risk management so as to control for the unintended consequences of this technology. The legal standards remain the same, but AI technology may push the envelope of compliance. In addition to making a best effort in that direction, employers should closely review other means of risk management such as vendor contract terms and insurance coverage.

As federal investments in emerging technologies accelerate, community colleges, which have long prepared the “skilled technical STEM workforce” are taking on new roles to align emerging technology with talent development and expand equitable pathways to emerging jobs of the future. This is particularly true in ""innovation economy"" industries like autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence.Beyond the usual challenges associated with creating high-quality workforce programs, colleges must partner strategically with employers, government, and tech-based economic development entities to excel in this expanded role.I sat down with Intel’s Senior Director of AI and Digital Readiness Carlos Contreras to learn more about one major employer’s approach to expanding community college pathways to jobs of the future.How Intel partners with community colleges for AI education and workforce developmentLaunched in 2020, Intel’s AI Workforce program provides over 225 hours of AI content to community colleges, training for faculty, and implementation guidance to develop AI certificates, augment existing courses, or launch full AI associate degree programs for their students. Intel’s pre-packaged courses cover data analytics, AI ethics, natural language processing, AI model training, computer vision, and coding.Intel aims to have AI education at the community college level in all fifty states by 2023.Thirty-one schools in eighteen states have joined the program as of December 2021, and Intel and Dell Technologies have also funded the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) to create an AI community of practice that will expand AI offerings at community colleges to all fifty states by 2023. Later this year, the selected participants will be invited to join AACC's peer network, offered technical assistance, and awarded $40,000 to support their AI programming.“We can’t wait until AI is firmly established to train the workforce. At that point, it might be too late and jobs can go somewhere else. Our community colleges have an opportunity to establish themselves as AI community resources.”- Carlos Contreras, Senior Director for AI and Digital Readiness, Intel







What AI jobs are available to community college students?Contreras described Intel’s approach to the AI labor market as a pyramid, “At the top, you have top researchers, PhDs usually, followed by middle-skill workers, and entry-level workers towards the base of the pyramid.” Community colleges train for the latter two categories.So far, Intel has hired two community college interns, which resulted in Intel creating a new job category – AI engineering technicians. Miami Dade College, one of Intel’s partners, is training for “AI Specialist” roles while Ocean County College lists a number of regional employers and roles for graduates of its associate’s degree program.But it’s not just bachelor’s degree-level education that’s a focus for Intel and others in the tech industry.A report from Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology identified fifty-four occupations that constitute the AI workforce – and a notable share of the AI workforce has less than a bachelor’s degree. The researchers in a follow-on report and panel urged policymakers to support degree and non-degree community college-level AI education and for employers to embrace AI talent that has come up through non-degree pathways.Intel's college partners are only just graduating their first classes of students, so there isn’t outcomes data to report just yet.However, Intel plans to monitor student outcomes. Across their partnerships, some employers have committed internships and work-based learning opportunities and new non-profits like Hack.Diversity are helping to place Black and Latinx students from community colleges in AI jobs.

“The big advantage in having the program at our level is that Maricopa Community College District is a very diverse place and one of the big risks in AI is that if all of the work is done from one perspective, the AI can become bias, so it’s really important to have our diversity of voices participating in this [partnership].""- Chris Zagar - Computer Science Faculty at Estrella Mountain Community CollegeNot all colleges are focused solely on the entry or middle-skill AI workforce. Maricopa Community College District supported Intel’s suppliers with upskilling working professionals with university degrees. Contreras cited the ability of community colleges to be nimble, affordable, and willing to customize training programs, through bootcamps for example, as reasons why they are an ideal partner for upskilling.He also affirmed something I have heard from community college leaders like Antonio Delgado, Vice President of Technology Partnerships at Miami Dade College: Sometimes community colleges play the unexpected role of helping local employers identify opportunities for emerging technologies.“In some instances, community colleges are actually leading the conversation with local small businesses in terms of what capacity they're trying to build, so they're almost like ambassadors of AI technology.""- Carlos Contreras, Senior Director for AI and Digital Readiness, IntelWhen Maricopa Community College District conducted a job market analysis to map the skills included in its AI program with regional needs, they found that many financial sector employers including Wells Fargo and State Farm were seeking the same skills taught in their programs.Other colleges explored regional and sector-specific AI task use cases through new industry advisory boards with representation from the pharmaceutical industry and biotech companies in New Jersey or oil and gas companies in Texas.Based on this feedback, Intel soon hopes to build out new resources for colleges to create credentials and courses relevant to specific geographic and sector needs including in advanced manufacturing and healthcare.Emerging technologies can be infamous for their hype cycles, and community colleges must carefully navigate them when training for new kinds of jobs. In addition to employer partnerships, more colleges are working with tech-based economic development organizations which have a deep understanding of the innovation economy, workforce training needs, and risks.As AI matures over the next ten years, Intel, the AACC, community colleges, and a variety of intermediary partners believe that their programs will address labor market needs while creating paths for a more diverse and broader swath of society to benefit from jobs born out of the innovation economy.

Work on Pakistan’s first Artificial Intelligence lab under CPEC picks momentum

By INP









ISLAMABAD: Seventy-five percent work of Pakistan first high-standard artificial intelligence laboratory under CPEC at National University of Science and Technology (NUST) has been completed while the equipment installation is almost 100% finished, Gwadar Pro reported on Saturday.

At the beginning of this year, the laboratory under CPEC–Qingluan Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was officially established at NUST, with joint efforts of NUST and Guangzhou Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Research, development and customization is currently underway. I would say work is almost finished to 75%.” Muhammad Khubaib Shabbir, Deputy Director of China Study Center of NUST told Gwadar Pro.
The lab has been put into full use, both students and teaching staff are keen on researching Pattern and Facial Recognition algorithms, the reporter learned.
“Currently, Cogniser-V1 intelligent video analysis project-a pilot project with the Government of Pakistan, and a commercial project, namely GymBot are the main projects that are under development.” Muhammad Khubaib Shabbir revealed.
“Ideally, Cognizer-V1 is one of the most sophisticated surveillance equipment, which has the capability of converting ordinary cameras and surveillance equipment into a Smart Equipment, using AI and Computer Vision Algorithms.” Muhammad Khubaib Shabbir said.

“To put it simple, the Cognizer-V1 has the ability to sense the people who are lurking around in certain areas and generate warnings, regarding dangerous behavioral patterns such as suicide, or other suspicious activities.” Muhammad Khubaib Shabbir said.
In the case of Pakistan, the country is blessed with a large number of artificial intelligence application scenarios and a huge market, thanks to its world’s 6th largest population. Moreover, the country is never short on talents.
However, challenges lie in the commercialization of scientific achievements– an important step which can be viewed as one of the sources for innovation.
Due to the backward industrial conditions and obstruction of international exchanges during the epidemic, the progress of commercialization in Pakistani scientific research institutes has been extremely slow.
“Our other key project, ‘GymBot’, can be a perfect example of science commercialization. It is designed to be a deep learning device, using AI and Computer Vision Algorithms and serve as an auxiliary tool under various gym scenarios, monitoring whether the clients’ postures are correct.
Experts in various fields are joining the research team to finalize the product. The core functions have been developed already. Now what the team is doing is developing additional modules to integrate and research new areas to better customize the device.” Muhammad Khubaib Shabbir shared his insights.

“It is important to keep in mind that Guangzhou Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences has shared the source code for ‘GymBot’. This enabled the researchers from Pakistan to get first-hand experience of the latest results on AI developments and offered them a chance to learn from it, enhance it and make it more usable for the local community. This will most definitely open new doors of opportunities for Pakistanis.”
Moving ideas from lab to marketplace is a complicated journey. Researchers and stakeholders need to manage the time-consuming process of moving from academic to commercial contexts, and seek balance between different goals amongst stakeholders and researchers.
CPEC enables the exchanges of advanced concepts, from both technical and management level. Qing Luan lab can be one of the successful examples.
