Where and how will generative AI have its greatest business impact? There is no shortage of speculation and high hopes that AI will shorten innovation cycles, spur new ideas, write and check code, and relieve workers and executives alike of the drudgeries of manual tasks. It could go even deeper, adding the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually.


That’s the word from a recent report out of McKinsey, in which the co-authors observe that “all of us are at the beginning of a journey to understand generative AI’s power, reach, and capabilities.”

Generative AI, the McKinsey team notes, is very good at performing routine tasks, such as reorganizing and classifying data. That’s a logical step in automation. But generative AI opens new doors when it delivers creative output. This is new stuff, and “as a result, a broader set of stakeholders are grappling with generative AI’s impact on business and society but without much context to help them make sense of it.”

PROMOTED
The co-authors predict over the next several years, AI “will take us on a roller-coaster ride featuring fast-paced innovation and technological breakthroughs that force us to recalibrate our understanding of AI’s impact on our work and our lives,” the report states. Generative AI will transform roles and boost performance — especially across functions such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software development.

The transformation of work is where and how generative AI will deliver a lot of value. It will “change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities,” the McKinsey team says. “Current generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb 60 to 70 percent of employees’ time today.” This will likely occur over a period of two decades, they add.

This is a step up from McKinsey’s previous estimate that technology has the potential to automate half of work activities. “The acceleration in the potential for technical automation is largely due to generative AI’s increased ability to understand natural language,” which will help boost knowledge work.

Of course, as the McKinsey authors point out, future realities don’t always cooperate with futuristic technology predictions — and this is definitely the case with AI. “Technology adoption at scale does not occur overnight,” the co-authors caution. Even when a solution is developed, “it might not be economically feasible to use if its costs exceed those of human labor. Additionally, even if economic incentives for deployment exist, it takes time for adoption to spread across the global economy.”

The Generative AI Revolution: A Glimpse Into the Future of Work





										BY Bhaskar Chakravorti, Tufts University
•



July 04, 2023












The explosion of interest in artificial intelligence has drawn attention not only to the astonishing capacity of algorithms to mimic humans but to the reality that these algorithms could displace many humans in their jobs. The economic and societal consequences could be nothing short of dramatic.
The route to this economic transformation is through the workplace. A widely circulated Goldman Sachs study anticipates that about two-thirds of current occupations over the next decade could be affected, and a quarter to a half of the work people do now could be taken over by an algorithm. Up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected. The consulting firm McKinsey released its own study predicting an AI-powered boost of US$4.4 trillion to the global economy every year.
The implications of such gigantic numbers are sobering, but how reliable are these predictions?
I lead a research program called Digital Planet that studies the impact of digital technologies on lives and livelihoods around the world and how this impact changes over time. A look at how previous waves of such digital technologies as personal computers and the internet affected workers offers some insight into AI’s potential impact in the years to come. But if the history of the future of work is any guide, we should be prepared for some surprises.
The IT revolution and the productivity paradox
A key metric for tracking the consequences of technology on the economy is growth in worker productivity – defined as how much output of work an employee can generate per hour. This seemingly dry statistic matters to every working individual because it ties directly to how much a worker can expect to earn for every hour of work. Said another way, higher productivity is expected to lead to higher wages.
Generative AI products are capable of producing written, graphic, and audio content or software programs with minimal human involvement. Professions such as advertising, entertainment, and creative and analytical work could be among the first to feel the effects. Individuals in those fields may worry that companies will use generative AI to do jobs they once did, but economists see great potential to boost productivity of the workforce as a whole.
The Goldman Sachs study predicts productivity will grow by 1.5 percent per year because of the adoption of generative AI alone, which would be nearly double the rate from 2010 and 2018. McKinsey is even more aggressive, saying this technology and other forms of automation will usher in the “next productivity frontier,” pushing it as high as 3.3 percent a year by 2040.
That sort of productivity boost, which would approach rates of previous years, would be welcomed by both economists and, in theory, workers as well.
If we were to trace the 20th-century history of productivity growth in the U.S., it galloped along at about 3 percent annually from 1920 to 1970, lifting real wages and living standards. Interestingly, productivity growth slowed in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the introduction of computers and early digital technologies. This “productivity paradox” was famously captured in a comment from MIT economist Bob Solow: You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.

Digital technology skeptics blamed “unproductive” time spent on social media or shopping and argued that earlier transformations, such as the introductions of electricity or the internal combustion engine, had a bigger role in fundamentally altering the nature of work. Techno-optimists disagreed; they argued that new digital technologies needed time to translate into productivity growth because other complementary changes would need to evolve in parallel. Yet others worried that productivity measures were not adequate in capturing the value of computers.
For a while, it seemed that the optimists would be vindicated. In the second half of the 1990s, around the time the World Wide Web emerged, productivity growth in the U.S. doubled, from 1.5 percent per year in the first half of that decade to 3 percent in the second. Again, there were disagreements about what was really going on, further muddying the waters as to whether the paradox had been resolved. Some argued that, indeed, the investments in digital technologies were finally paying off, while an alternative view was that managerial and technological innovations in a few key industries were the main drivers.
Regardless of the explanation, just as mysteriously as it began, that late 1990s surge was short-lived. So despite massive corporate investment in computers and the internet – changes that transformed the workplace – how much the economy and workers’ wages benefited from technology remained uncertain.
Early 2000s: New slump, new hype, new hopes
While the start of the 21st century coincided with the bursting of the so-called dot-com bubble, the year 2007 was marked by the arrival of another technology revolution: the Apple iPhone, which consumers bought by the millions and which companies deployed in countless ways. Yet labor productivity growth started stalling again in the mid-2000s, ticking up briefly in 2009 during the Great Recession, only to return to a slump from 2010 to 2019.
Throughout this new slump, techno-optimists were anticipating new winds of change. AI and automation were becoming all the rage and were expected to transform work and worker productivity. Beyond traditional industrial automation, drones, and advanced robots, capital and talent were pouring into many would-be game-changing technologies, including autonomous vehicles, automated checkouts in grocery stores, and even pizza-making robots. AI and automation were projected to push productivity growth above 2 percent annually in a decade, up from the 2010-2014 lows of 0.4 percent.
But before we could get there and gauge how these new technologies would ripple through the workplace, a new surprise hit: the COVID-19 pandemic.
The pandemic productivity push – then bust
Devastating as the pandemic was, worker productivity surged after it began in 2020; output per hour worked globally hit 4.9 percent, the highest recorded since data has been available.
Much of this steep rise was facilitated by technology: larger knowledge-intensive companies – inherently the more productive ones – switched to remote work, maintaining continuity through digital technologies such as videoconferencing and communications technologies such as Slack, and saving on commuting time and focusing on well-being.
While it was clear digital technologies helped boost productivity of knowledge workers, there was an accelerated shift to greater automation in many other sectors, as workers had to remain home for their own safety and comply with lockdowns. Companies in industries ranging from meat processing to operations in restaurants, retail, and hospitality invested in automation, such as robots and automated order-processing and customer service, which helped boost their productivity.
But then there was yet another turn in the journey along the technology landscape.
The 2020-2021 surge in investments in the tech sector collapsed, as did the hype about autonomous vehicles and pizza-making robots. Other frothy promises, such as the metaverse’s revolutionizing remote work or training, also seemed to fade into the background.
In parallel, with little warning, “generative AI” burst onto the scene, with an even more direct potential to enhance productivity while affecting jobs – at massive scale. The hype cycle around new technology restarted.
Looking ahead: Social factors on technology’s arc
Given the number of plot twists thus far, what might we expect from here on out? Here are four issues for consideration.
First, the future of work is about more than just raw numbers of workers, the technical tools they use, or the work they do; one should consider how AI affects factors such as workplace diversity and social inequities, which in turn have a profound impact on economic opportunity and workplace culture.
For example, while the broad shift toward remote work could help promote diversity with more flexible hiring, I see the increasing use of AI as likely to have the opposite effect. Black and Hispanic workers are overrepresented in the 30 occupations with the highest exposure to automation and underrepresented in the 30 occupations with the lowest exposure. While AI might help workers get more done in less time, and this increased productivity could increase wages of those employed, it could lead to a severe loss of wages for those whose jobs are displaced. A 2021 paper found that wage inequality tended to increase the most in countries in which companies already relied a lot on robots and that were quick to adopt the latest robotic technologies.
Second, as the post-COVID-19 workplace seeks a balance between in-person and remote working, the effects on productivity – and opinions on the subject – will remain uncertain and fluid. A 2022 study showed improved efficiencies for remote work as companies and employees grew more comfortable with work-from-home arrangements, but according to a separate 2023 study, managers and employees disagree about the impact: The former believe that remote working reduces productivity, while employees believe the opposite.
Third, society’s reaction to the spread of generative AI could greatly affect its course and ultimate impact. Analyses suggest that generative AI can boost worker productivity on specific jobs – for example, one 2023 study found the staggered introduction of a generative AI-based conversational assistant increased productivity of customer service personnel by 14 percent. Yet there are already growing calls to consider generative AI’s most severe risks and to take them seriously. On top of that, recognition of the astronomical computing and environmental costs of generative AI could limit its development and use.
Finally, given how wrong economists and other experts have been in the past, it is safe to say that many of today’s predictions about AI technology’s impact on work and worker productivity will prove to be wrong as well. Numbers such as 300 million jobs affected or $4.4 trillion annual boosts to the global economy are eye-catching, yet I think people tend to give them greater credibility than warranted.
Also, “jobs affected” does not mean jobs lost; it could mean jobs augmented or even a transition to new jobs. It is best to use the analyses, such as Goldman’s or McKinsey’s, to spark our imaginations about the plausible scenarios about the future of work and of workers. It’s better, in my view, to then proactively brainstorm the many factors that could affect which one actually comes to pass, look for early warning signs and prepare accordingly.
The history of the future of work has been full of surprises; don’t be shocked if tomorrow’s technologies are equally confounding.

	Many U.S. entertainment industry workers have strong concerns about if and how generative AI technology will affect their role, company, industry and broader cultural environment, according to an exclusive Variety Intelligence Platform survey conducted by YouGov.

	Over a third (36%) of entertainment workers surveyed in late June were “very” or “somewhat concerned” about the impact gen AI will have on their own jobs. For context, respondent awareness of gen AI is high, with 87% at least aware of tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney, while two-thirds (65%) claim some knowledge of the technology (explored in depth in the recent VIP+ special report Generative AI & Entertainment).






	Among generative AI’s possible negative outcomes for the industry, the majority of professionals were either “very” or “somewhat” concerned about IP infringement across copyright, trademark and right of publicity; job losses due to employers’ use of gen AI; and cybersecurity and data privacy.




	Equally damning, 43% believe the use of generative AI will hurt the quality of the entertainment industry’s creative output, in contrast to 16% who feel it would improve.




	This industry moment is particularly fraught as gen AI’s rise coincides with expiring union contracts and negotiations with the studios, as the WGA, DGA and SAG-AFTRA each respectively demand new contract language that provides clarity, protections and restrictions on the use of generative AI regarding employment terms with writers, directors and actors.

Writers Guild of America: Nine weeks since their previous contract expired, striking WGA writers remain at a standstill with studios on their particular AI demands.

Directors Guild of America: The DGA ratified its new contract June 23, taking effect July 1. The agreement provides some guidance on AI, stating it isn’t a “person,” can’t take over ordinary duties of directors, and that studios can’t use AI without consulting directors.

SAG-AFTRA: The union and the AMPTP extended their current contract to July 12 to allow more time for negotiations. On June 5, guild actors had voted 98% in favor of authorizing a strike if both sides failed to reach an acceptable deal. On June 27, the actors sent an internal letter to union leaders, with over 1,000 signatures including many A-listers, demanding that the negotiations protect actor likenesses and ensure actors are compensated when any of their past work is used to train AI.

SEE ALSO: Studio Transparency Critical in WGA Battle Over AI

	Given the pace of change, a multiyear contract that lays out studios’ permitted AI use in vague or noncomprehensive terms seems likely to age quickly or lose any protective value it might’ve held. 

	Driving some concerns are the number of unknowns surrounding gen AI’s future capabilities, legality and use or misuse. As AI models rapidly improve, so will AI software’s capabilities to produce material at human-level creative skill.

	The future capabilities of generative AI, and when they will reach certain competency levels, are hard to predict. But there is clear and mounting evidence that gen AI is already effective for some uses.

	Asked to select various creative tasks they believed gen AI will be able to accomplish effectively in the next two to three years, entertainment workers were most likely to identify ones these tools are now demonstrably capable of, if not currently used in practice or trial already, including creating realistic sound effects for film, TV or games (58% of workers); autocompleting code to assist game programming (54%); and developing artwork for film, TV or game storyboards (52%).




	Notably, AI still has many flaws and reasons to forestall industry use, including for studios — not least of which includes murkiness around intellectual property law as it pertains to AI training data (input) and generated material (output). But that’s not exactly stopping companies across creative industries in the business of content from contemplating just how these tools might help them create new kinds of efficiencies.

SEE ALSO: How Content, Marketing Execs Can Use AI 'Simulation'

	Of course, not all generative AI uses in the industry need be wholesale disenfranchising for human creatives. Indeed, some presumably stand to benefit human workers in certain roles, such as by automating rote or time-consuming manual VFX tasks to be able to deliver high-quality work faster.

	Entertainment workers are starting to use gen AI tools or expect they or their company will. Nearly a third (30%) of U.S. entertainment industry professionals workers said they, their team or their company are either currently using gen AI (13%) or planned to (17%).




	Some AI misuses impacting industry workers will take legal or regulatory fixes to address and shield against, likely requiring a complicated years-long effort as lawsuits are waged and legal and regulatory frameworks strive to catch up to the technology globally.

	But robust union protections will be a meaningful, likely first, line of defense against damage or labor unfairness that could result from studio employers’ or workplace uses of AI.

AI and the automation of work
ChatGPT and generative AI will change how we work, but how different is 
this to all the other waves of automation of the last 200 years? What does 
it mean for employment? Disruption? Coal consumption?



Pretty much everyone in tech agrees that generative AI, Large Language Models and ChatGPT are a generational change in what we can do with software, and in what we can automate with software. There isn’t much agreement on anything else about LLMs - indeed, we’re still working out what the arguments are - but everyone agrees there’s a lot more automation coming, and entirely new kinds of automation. Automation means jobs, and people. This is also happening very fast: ChatGPT has (apparently) over 100m users after just six months, and this data from Productiv suggests it’s already a top-dozen ‘shadow IT’ app. So, how many jobs is this going to take, how fast, and can there be new jobs to replace them?

We should start by remembering that we’ve been automating work for 200 years. Every time we go through a wave of automation, whole classes of jobs go away, but new classes of jobs get created. There is frictional pain and dislocation in that process, and sometimes the new jobs go to different people in different places, but over time the total number of jobs doesn’t go down, and we have all become more prosperous.

US Census, 1930





When this is happening to your own generation, it seems natural to worry that this time, there aren’t going to be those new jobs. We can see the jobs that are going away, but we can’t predict what the new jobs will be, and often they don’t exist yet. We know (or should know), empirically, that there always have been those new jobs in the past, and that they weren’t predictable either: no-one in 1800 would have predicted that in 1900 a million Americans would work on ‘railways’ and no-one in 1900 would have predicted ‘video post-production’ or ‘software engineer’ as employment categories. But it seems insufficient to take it on faith that this will happen now just because it always has in the past. How do you know it will happen this time? Is this different?At this point, any first-year economics student will tell us that this is answered by, amongst other things, the ‘Lump of Labour’ fallacy. The Lump of Labour fallacy is the misconception that there is a fixed amount of work to be done, and that if some work is taken by a machine then there will be less work for people. But if it becomes cheaper to use a machine to make, say, a pair of shoes, then the shoes are cheaper, more people can buy shoes and they have more money to spend on other things besides, and we discover new things we need or want, and new jobs. The efficiency gain isn’t confined to the shoe: generally, it ripples outward through the economy and creates new prosperity and new jobs. So, we don’t know what the new jobs will be, but we have a model that says, not just that there always have been new jobs, but why that is inherent in the process. Don’t worry about AI!The most fundamental challenge to this model today, I think, is to say that no, what’s really been happening for the last 200 years of automation is that we’ve been moving up the scale of human capability.

‘Barge haulers on the Volga’, Ilya Repin, 1870-73. (Note the steam boat on the horizon.)





We began with humans as beasts of burden and moved up: we automated legs, then arms, then fingers, and now brains. We went from farm work to blue-collar work to white-collar work, and now we’ll automate the white-collar work as well and there’ll be nothing left. Factories were replaced by call centres, but if we automate the call centres, what else is there? Here, I think it’s useful to look at another piece of economic and tech history: the Jevons Paradox. In the 19th century the British navy ran on coal. Britain had a lot of coal (it was the Saudi Arabia of the steam age) but people worried what would happen when the coal ran out. Ah, said the engineers: don’t worry, because steam engines keep getting more efficient, so we’ll use less coal. No, said Jevons: if we make steam engines more efficient, then they will be cheaper to run, and we will use more of them and use them for new and different things, and so we will use more coal. Innovation can connect to price elasticity. We’ve been applying the Jevons Paradox to white collar work for 150 years.

It’s hard to imagine jobs of the future that don’t exist yet, but it’s also hard to imagine some of the jobs of the past that have already been automated away. Gogol’s downtrodden clerks in 1830s St Petersburg spent their entire adult lives copying out documents, one at a time, by hand. They were human Xeroxes. By the 1880s, typewriters produced perfect text at twice the words-per-minute, and carbons gave half-a-dozen free copies as well. Typewriters meant a clerk could produce more than 10 times the output. A few decades later, adding machines from companies like Burroughs did the same for book-keeping and accounting: instead of adding up columns with a pen, the machine does it for you, five time faster, with no mistakes. What did that do to clerical employment? People hired far more clerks. Automation plus the Jevons Paradox meant more jobs. If one clerk with a machine can do the work of 10, then you might have fewer clerks, but you might also do far more with them. If, Jevons tells us, it becomes much cheaper and more efficient to do something, you might do more of it - you might do more analysis or manage more inventory. You might build a different and more efficient business that is only possible because you can automate its administration with typewriters and adding machines. This process keeps repeating. This is Jack Lemmon as CC Baxter in The Apartment in 1960, using an electro-mechanical adding machine from Friden fifty years after adding machines were new and exciting. 













Everyone in that shot is a cell in a spreadsheet, and the whole building is a spreadsheet. Once a week someone on the top floor presses F9 and they recalculate. But they already had computers, and in 1965 or 1970 they bought a mainframe, and scrapped all the adding machines. Did white collar employment collapse? Or, as IBM advertised, did a computer give you 150 extra engineers? 25 years later, what did the PC revolution, and the accounting department in a box, do to accounting?

Dan Bricklin invented the computer spreadsheet in 1979: until then, ‘spreadsheets’ were paper (you can still buy them on Amazon). He has some entertaining stories about early use: ‘People would tell me, “I was doing all this work, and coworkers thought I was amazing. But I was really goofing off because it only took an hour and then I took the the rest of the day off. People thought I was a wunderkind but I was using this tool.”’ So, what did Excel and the PC do to accounting employment? It went up.

40 years later, do spreadsheets mean you can goof off early? Not really.  

Younger people may not believe this but before spreadsheets investment bankers worked really long hours. It's only thanks to Excel that Goldman Sachs associates can get everything done and leave the office at 3pm on Fridays. Now LLMs mean they'll only have to work one day a week!— Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) May 5, 2023


New technology generally makes it cheaper and easier to do something, but that might mean you do the same with fewer people, or you might do much more with the same people. It also tends to mean that you change what you do. To begin with, we make the new tool fit the old way of working, but over time, we change how we work to fit the tool. When CC Baxter’s company bought a mainframe, they began by automating the way they already did things, but over time, new ways to run the business became possible. So, all of this is to say that by default, we should expect LLMs to destroy, displace, create, accelerate and multiply jobs just as SAP, Excel, Mainframes or typewriters did. It’s just more automation. The machine lets a person do 10x the work, but you need the person. I think there are two counter-arguments to this. The first is to say that yes, perhaps this is indeed just more of the same kind of change that we saw with the internet, PCs or computers, and perhaps again it will have no long-term effect on net employment, but this time it will happen much faster, and so that frictional pain will be much greater and it will be much harder to adjust. LLMs and ChatGPT certainly are happening a lot faster than things like iPhones or the Internet, or indeed PCs. The Apple II shipped in 1977, the IBM PC in 1981 and the Mac in 1984, but it took until the early 1990s before  there were 100m PCs in use: there are 100m ChatGPT users today after just six months. You don’t need to wait for telcos to build broadband networks, or consumers to buy new devices, and generative AI sits on top of the whole existing stack of cloud, distributed computing and indeed a lot of the machine learning stack itself that was built over the last decade. To a user, it’s just a website.However, your expectations might be different if you think about the implications of these charts, from Productiv again and from Okta (with a different methodology). They report that their typical customer now has hundreds of different software applications, and enterprise customers have almost 500.

And yet, enterprise cloud adoption is still barely a quarter of workflows.

What does that mean for generative AI in the workplace? Whatever you think will happen, it will take years, not weeks. The tools that people use to do their jobs, and the tasks that might now get a new layer of automation, are complicated and very specialised, and embody a lot of work and institutional knowledge. A lot of people are experimenting with ChatGPT, and seeing what it will do. If you’re reading this, you probably have too. That doesn’t mean that ChatGPT has replaced their existing workflows yet, and replacing or automating any of those tools and tasks is not trivial. There’s a huge difference between an amazing demo of a transformative technology and something that a big complicated company holding other people’s business can use. You can rarely go to a law firm and sell them an API key to GCP’s translation or sentiment analysis: you need to wrap it in control, security, versioning, management, client privilege and a whole bunch of other things that only legal software companies know about (there’s a graveyard of machine learning companies that learnt this in the last decade). Companies generally can’t buy ‘technology’.  Everlaw doesn’t sell translation and People.ai doesn’t sell sentiment analysis - they sell tools and products, and often the AI is only one part of that. I don’t think a text prompt, a ‘go’ button and a black-box, general purpose text generation engine make up a product, and product takes time.  Meanwhile, buying tools that manage big complicated things takes time even once the tool is built and has product-market fit. One of the most basic challenges in building an enterprise software startup is that startups run on an 18 month funding cycle and a lot of enterprises run on an 18 month decision cycle. SaaS itself accelerated this because you don’t need to get into the enterprise datacenter deployment schedule, but you still need purchase, integration and training, and companies with millions of customers and tens or hundreds of thousands of employees have very good reasons not to change things suddenly. The future takes a while, and the world outside Silicon Valley is complicated. The second counter-argument is that part of the paradigm shift of ChatGPT and LLMs is a shift in the layer of abstraction: this looks like a much more general purpose technology. Indeed, that’s why it’s exciting. It can answer anything, we are told. So, you could look at that chart of 473 enterprise SaaS apps and say that ChatGPT will disrupt that and collapse many those vertical apps into one prompt box. That would mean it would move faster, and also automate much more. I think that misunderstands the problem. If a partner at a law firm wants a first draft of a paper, they want to be able to shape the parameters in completely different ways to a salesperson at an insurance company challenging a claim, probably with a different training set and certainly with a bunch of different tooling. Excel is ‘general purpose’ too, and so is SQL, but how many different kinds of ‘database’ are there? This is one reason I think the future of LLMs is to move from prompt boxes to GUIs and buttons - I think ‘prompt engineering’ and ‘natural language’ are mutually contradictory. But either way, even if you can run everything as a thin wrapper on top of one giant foundational model (and there is very little agreement or clarity about this yet), even those wrappers will take time.Indeed, while one could suggest that LLMs will subsume many apps on one axis, I think it’s equally likely that they will enable a whole new wave of unbundling on other axes, as startups peel off dozens more use cases from Word, Salesforce and SAP, and build a whole bunch more big companies by solving problems that no-one had realised were problems until LLMs let you solve them. That’s the process that explains why big companies already have 400 SaaS apps today, after all. More fundamental, of course, there is the error rate. ChatGPT can try to answer ‘anything’ but the answer might be wrong. People call this hallucinations, making things up, lying or bullshitting - it’s the ‘overconfident undergraduate’ problem. I think these are all unhelpful framings: I think the best way to understand this is that when you type something into a prompt, you’re not actually asking it to answer a question at all. Rather, you’re asking it “what sort of answers would people be likely to produce to questions that look like this?” You’re asking it to match a pattern. Hence, if I ask ChatGPT4 to write a biography of myself, and then ask it again, it gives different answers. It suggests I went to Cambridge, Oxford or the LSE; my first job was in equity research, consulting or financial journalism. These are always the right pattern: it’s the right kind of university and the right kind of job (it never says MIT and then catering management). It is giving 100% correct answers to the question “what kinds of degrees and jobs are people like Benedict likely to have done?” It’s not doing a database lookup: it’s making a pattern. You can see something similar in this image I got from MidJourney. The prompt was “A photograph of advertising people discussing creativity on stage in a panel on a beach at Cannes Lions.”













It’s matched the pattern almost perfectly - that looks like the beach at Cannes, these people are dressed like advertising people, and they even have the right haircuts. But it doesn’t know anything, and so it doesn’t know that people never have three legs, only that it’s unlikely. This isn’t ‘lying’ or ‘making things up’ - it’s matching a pattern, imperfectly. Whatever you call it, if you don’t understand this, you can get into trouble, as happened to this unfortunate lawyer, who did not understand that when he asked for precedents, he was actually asking for things that looked like precedents. He duly got things that looked like precedents, but weren’t. It’s not a database. If you do understand this, then you have to ask, well, where are LLMs useful? Where is it useful to have automated undergraduates, or automated interns, who can repeat a pattern, that you might have to check? The last wave of machine learning gave you infinite interns who could read anything for you, but you had to check, and now we have infinite interns that can write anything for you, but you have to check. So where is it useful to have infinite interns? Ask Dan Bricklin - we’re back to the Jevons Paradox. This takes me, obviously, to AGI. The really fundamental objection to everything I’ve just said is to ask what would happen if we had a system that didn’t have an error rate, didn’t hallucinate, and really could do anything that people can do. If we had that, then you might not have one accountant using Excel to get the output of ten accountants: you might just have the machine. This time, it really would be be different. Where previous waves of automation meant one person could do more, now you don’t need the person.  Like a lot of AGI questions, though, this can become circular if you’re not careful. ‘If we had a machine that could do anything people do, without any of these limitations, could it do anything people can do, without these limitations?’Well, indeed, and if so we might have bigger problems than middle-class employment, but is that close? You can spend weeks of your life watching three hour YouTube videos of computer scientists arguing about this, and conclude only that they don’t really know either. You might also suggest that the idea this one magic piece of software will change everything, and override all the complexity of real people, real companies and the real economy, and can now be deployed in weeks instead of years, sounds like classic tech solutionism, but turned from utopia to dystopia. As an analyst, though, I tend to prefer Hume’s empiricism over Descartes - I can only analyse what we can know. We don’t have AGI, and without that, we have only another wave of automation, and we don’t seem to have any a priori reason why this must be more or less painful than all the others.

Generative AI is potentially the most transformative new technology since the introduction of the public internet, and it already has many exciting applications within enterprise service management (ESM). AI is known for enabling intelligent chatbots, predictive capabilities in ticket management, and the ability to identify emerging service issues long before they become problems. Generative AI promises an entirely new level of innovation. 
With generative AI, ESM platforms could not only understand the context of a user request in natural language but also comb through multiple knowledge bases to provide much more than links to information. Generative AI could deliver a clear solution that summarizes the most relevant and current information across multiple languages.
In fact, it could go well beyond simply providing information — it could automate the solution. If numerous employees are logging tickets about problems logging into the VPN, HelixGPT can analyze that data, determine a restart of the VPN is required, and kick that process off automatically. And regarding those knowledge bases, generative AI could automate much of their maintenance, eliminating outdated content and incorporating new information.
Despite the intense hype around ChatGPT, that instance of large language model (LLM) technology would not be appropriate for enterprise use. One of the biggest challenges with ChatGPT is controlling its output. Organizations want to make sure that the generative AI properly understands the tasks at hand to prevent incorrect responses and limit “hallucinations” or false information.
BMC Software addresses these limitations with HelixGPT, which enables the world described above through AI Service Management. LLMs like ChatGPT are built from publicly available knowledge, but enterprises operate within a specific domain and need generative AI to prioritize enterprise knowledge over world knowledge. Each company, for example, has its own policy for employee password renewal, making it difficult to nail down a universal standard.
Additionally, BMC enables HelixGPT to tune itself to enterprise-specific information with additional layers that prevent hallucinations. Of course, HelixGPT will not be limited to enterprise-specific information — if the query requires outside, public information, it will be able to draw on it.
“When it comes to generative AI and ESM, we see the potential for innovations everywhere,” said Ajoy Kumar, Chief AI Scientist, Service Management at BMC Software. “Users will see better search, better answers, and a more human-like virtual agent. And they won’t just get pointers to solutions. HelixGPT will provide action.”

As such, a company’s comprehensive knowledge is often unaccounted for and difficult to organize and deploy where needed in an effective or efficient way.",N/A,https://schema.org,WebSite,https://hbr.org/,,,,,,,,,,,Technology and analytics,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hbr.org/search?term={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which refers to the ability of artificial intelligence to create content and make decisions on its own, is having a significant impact on talent management. Susan Gunn and John Hazan, leaders of the Bain Chief People Officer Forum, recently conducted a session with chief human resource officers (CHROs) and chief people officers (CPOs) from different parts of the world to discuss this influence. Here is a summary of their conversation:
Recent developments in generative AI
We can attribute the rapid advancement of generative AI to recent breakthroughs, such as improved performance of graphic processing units (GPUs), new model designs, and the availability of large public data sets. In the future, generative AI will go beyond producing content and will be capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting independently in various situations. Organizations that actively engage with and embrace these emerging capabilities will have a strong advantage in achieving exceptional organizational performance and success.
According to a recent poll by Bain, 80% of CHROs agreed that generative AI has the potential to revolutionize talent management practices. However, there is a wide range of attitudes toward investing in generative AI. About 61% of respondents are neutral or unlikely to invest in the near future, while 39% report that they are likely to invest. This diversity of opinions indicates the need for further education and exploration of the opportunities and challenges that generative AI presents in the field of talent management.
Generative AI’s impact on talent
Generative AI’s versatile capabilities will potentially affect numerous aspects of talent and have a significant impact on white-collar jobs. We believe that the impact on talent practices can be grouped into three categories: job design, HR practices and jobs, and talent management practices.
Automation of repetitive tasks and the enhancement of human capabilities by generative AI may lead to more efficient and fulfilling roles for employees. However, it will also replace certain jobs, improve others, and create new ones, such as AI researchers and software engineers. Organizations will have the opportunity to completely rethink their operations and reshape their team structures, focusing more on cross-functional collaboration and agile work models.
With the integration of generative AI into various talent processes and tasks, new roles will emerge within HR practices. HR professionals will need to actively engage with and embrace the capabilities of this technology to stay ahead and utilize insights, predict trends, and make data-driven decisions. This will require them to become more strategic and proactive.
Generative AI offers significant opportunities to enhance the employee experience throughout the stages of their journey. By providing personalized and contextually relevant solutions, organizations can create a more engaging and growth-oriented work environment that fosters talent and drives success. With the potential to revolutionize talent management practices, generative AI can create employee copilots to provide personalized career paths. These sample prompts demonstrate how generative AI can be used as part of each phase of an employee’s development:

Onboarding: “Create a syllabus for me of useful materials to get up to speed.”
Engagement: “Which colleagues would be useful connections for me?”
Growth: “Identify available career opportunities in line with my development plan.”
Recognition: “Propose a team activity to celebrate our latest milestone.”
Support: “Suggest interesting benefits and wellness activities within the company.”
Transition: ""Recommend resources to help me prepare for my next move.""

Ensuring responsible use of generative AI and establishing governance
Assessing and managing the ethical risks associated with AI use can be addressed by developing guidelines and best practices to identify ethical dilemmas and make certain that generative AI aligns with organizational values and societal norms. Adherence to data privacy regulations, such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is necessary to maintain security and privacy standards and to protect the personal and sensitive data processed by AI systems. 
To fully harness the potential of generative AI in talent management, it is essential to establish a strong governance framework. Clear explanations of how AI systems work, make decisions, and derive insights, as well as defining who holds responsibility for AI’s actions, will provide transparency and accountability. Auditing AI algorithms, training data sets, and use cases can create a foundation from which to develop and implement strategies to minimize biases in AI models and decisions. Ensuring that the data used to train and refine AI models is accurate, representative, and up to date will also help to minimize bias while guaranteeing reliable and effective AI outcomes.
The chief people officer’s role in generative AI governance
The CPO will play a pivotal role in the ethical and responsible deployment of generative AI. They will contribute to the development of governance frameworks, promote transparency and fairness, and foster a culture of responsible AI use within the organization. Collaboration with other stakeholders and ongoing monitoring will be essential to effectively navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by generative AI in talent management.
The CPO will provide leadership and guidance to HR practitioners, ensuring generative AI’s appropriate and effective use within the HR function and among stakeholders. This includes planning for the future workforce, identifying new and important roles that may emerge due to generative AI, and assessing the impact on existing jobs. The CPO will also be responsible for providing employees the necessary development opportunities so they can adapt to their roles’ changing demands in the context of generative AI.

LamasDr. Lamas, a contributing Opinion writer, is a pulmonary and critical-care physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.When faced with a particularly tough question on rounds during my intern year, I would run straight to the bathroom. There, I would flip through the medical reference book I carried in my pocket, find the answer and return to the group, ready to respond.At the time, I believed that my job was to memorize, to know the most arcane of medical eponyms by heart. Surely an excellent clinician would not need to consult a book or a computer to diagnose a patient. Or so I thought then.Not even two decades later, we find ourselves at the dawn of what many believe to be a new era in medicine, one in which artificial intelligence promises to write our notes, to communicate with patients, to offer diagnoses. The potential is dazzling. But as these systems improve and are integrated into our practice in the coming years, we will face complicated questions: Where does specialized expertise live? If the thought process to arrive at a diagnosis can be done by a computer “co-pilot,” how does that change the practice of medicine, for doctors and for patients?Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.Read 853 CommentsShare full article853Read in appAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTComments 853There’s One Hard Question My Fellow Doctors and I Will Need to Answer SoonSkip to CommentsThe comments section is closed.

In an email shared with staff last week, editorial director Merrill Brown described the venture as a limited trial, which will produce only a handful of stories for the publishers AV Club, Gizmodo, The Takeout and Deadspin.



The company bills the technology as a means of generating the kinds of content its staff disliked producing in the first place, such as a rote list of the best sandwiches in every state. At least initially, the articles will not appear on sites’ home pages and are primarily intended to net search traffic.



One early product of the technology, an article titled A Chronological List of Star Wars Movies &amp; TV Shows published on tech website Gizmodo on Wednesday, received immediate criticism from its deputy editor, James Whitbrook, on Twitter.



One Year After Removing Its Paywall, Quartz’s Traffic Continues to Drop



The article, whose byline attributes the piece to Gizmodo Bot, contained a number of factual errors, such as messing up the chronology of the franchise.



“This is an early, modest test,” Brown said in the memo. “These will all be designed to complement our journalism and give our editorial teams new tools to serve our audiences.”



A representative for G/O Media confirmed the trial, though they wouldn't share specifics on the volume of content generated or whether any editorial roles will be impacted.&nbsp;



The GMG Union issued a response condemning the use of generative AI.



""The hard work of journalists cannot be replaced by unreliable AI programs notorious for creating falsehoods and plagiarizing the work of writers,"" the union said in a statement.



The experiment comes as the media industry attempts to reckon with the transformative potential of AI. Some publishers, such as BuzzFeed Inc., have used the technology to supplement their writers’ work, while others, such as Red Ventures property CNET, have used it to produce standalone articles.

After launch of ChatGPT, swift reappraisal by investors

Generative artificial intelligence like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, not only generates text, images and code, but it also has the power to transform company valuations — rapidly, dramatically and in ways both predictable and surprising.
NVDA data by YCharts
Nvidia, maker of chips to power AI, gained 150% since ChatGPT’s release on Nov. 30, 2022. Meta, Facebook’s parent, came out of its long slump and rose 142%. Other big tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Apple gained, too. Even Google’s parent Alphabet, initially considered a potential loser from the spread of generative AI, joined the party, as did Tesla. Combined, these huge market-cap stocks have pulled the overall market up against strong economic headwinds.

In a working paper, UCLA Anderson’s Andrea L. Eisfeldt and Gregor Schubert and USC’s Miao Ben Zhang establish a measure of generative AI exposure across industries and firms, based on the mix of occupations held by each firm’s workforce, and then measured firm-level market reaction since the launch of ChapGPT. Portfolios based on their work outperformed by 9% in the initial four months following the ChatGPT debut. 
The researchers suggest that ChatGPT has had a large, positive effect on the firms most exposed to generative AI and that firms with the highest generative A. exposure scores outperform those with the lowest scores with an excess return of more than 0.4% per day in the two weeks following ChatGPT’s release.
Who Is at Risk?
The researchers propose that firms that score higher for exposure to generative AI are able to use AI to help their employees accomplish tasks faster. This allows them to save on costs and increase their free cash flow. 
One surprising finding was that the jobs most impacted are not the routine, monotonous tasks that past innovations in information technology affected, but those performing nonroutine, mentally challenging tasks. Examples are analyzing problems, recognizing patterns and drawing inferences, comprehending text, etc. As expected, jobs involving manual labor are the least impacted while tasks requiring communication between people fall somewhere in the middle. The table below shows the researchers’ calculated exposure scores for jobs with the highest and lowest exposures to generative AI.

In terms of industry sectors, the table below shows those most and least exposed to generative AI.

The researchers found that, in general, jobs with higher salaries are more exposed to AI. 

As a result, some larger firms are seeing the ranks of workers dwindle. On May 2, 2023, IBM announced it would stop hiring for 7,800 back-office roles that could be replaced by AI. This represents 30% of IBM’s back-office jobs. 
Schubert, from the research team, believes that such announcements will be an ongoing trend in the future. “A large impact will be on freelancing via platforms and international business service outsourcing, so the employment impact at big U.S. companies might be muted in the beginning,” Schubert suggests in an email exchange. He believes much of this will take place in the form of slower employment growth in some occupations, as firms simply stop replacing employees as they leave, rather than firing existing employees — but there is also a potential for accelerated employment growth in occupations that complement the new technologies.
Given this news, perhaps it makes sense that IBM ranked as the firm most exposed to generative AI when the researchers calculated exposure scores for each firm listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Below are the 15 firms with the highest exposure scores and the 15 with the lowest scores. 

Using ChatGPT to Research ChatGPT
Deriving the generative AI exposure scores began with a monstrous data task made a bit simpler by employing ChatGPT to do some of the work. The O*NET database, which lists jobs by their standard occupational classification as assigned by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, was the first stop for data. Job titles in the database are broken down by the tasks performed by that occupation. The researchers used ChatGPT to label these job tasks. The labels indicated whether ChatGPT or a future version of the software would be able to perform the tasks. With these labels, a final score for a job’s exposure to generative AI was produced based on the number of its tasks that could be handled by ChatGPT. 
The next step was to add firm-level and industry-level exposure scores using the job-level scores just calculated. For this, the researchers turned to Revelio Labs, which gathers data from employee profiles on LinkedIn and through other resources. This information enabled the researchers to see all of the job titles that make up the workforce at a particular firm. They gathered this data for each firm listed on the NYSE. Once they had the breakdown of jobs at a particular firm, they were able to map the job-level scores they previously calculated to those jobs and develop a score for the entire firm. The data was rolled up one more level by using the firm scores to also calculate industry-level scores.
The measure of firm-level generative AI exposure captures the relative degree to which tasks in a firm can be made more productive by advances in large language models. The researchers believe they are the first to develop such a measure with a focus on firms.
Eisfeldt, Schubert and Zhang tested their measures of firm AI exposure by examining 2023 earnings call transcripts. They contend they found a strong relationship between firms with high exposure scores and those discussing the topic of AI more frequently. In fact, they suggest that a 10 percentage point increase in generative AI exposure is associated with a 7.6 percentage point increase in the likelihood of mentioning the generative AI topic. This positive relationship held even when IT-related firms were removed from the data.
Buy the Winners, Short the Losers
With the generative AI exposure scores in place, the researchers sought to document the changes in valuation for firms after ChatGPT was released using daily stock returns from Nov.  15, 2022, to March 31, 2023.
Firms were sorted in order of their generative AI exposure and then broken into five equal value-weighted groups, or quintiles. The researchers looked at the performance of each quintile but were especially interested in the quintiles holding the firms with the highest and lowest exposures. 
A portfolio called “Artificial Minus Human” was created by buying the firms in the quintile with the highest exposure and selling short (making a bet they will go lower) the firms in the lowest exposure quintile, after adjusting each portfolio’s returns for its sensitivity to overall market returns. The returns of the AMH portfolio represented the difference in returns between the firms with the highest and lowest AI exposures. This portfolio had a 9.4% return from ChatGPT’s release to March 31, 2023.
Similarly, within-industry and industry-neutral portfolios were created. All firms were grouped by their respective industries, then sorted by AI exposure scores and grouped into five equal value-weighted quintiles within each industry. Next, the returns of the quintiles of the within-industry portfolios were market-capitalization-weighted and averaged across the industries to form the industry-neutral portfolios. This created portfolios that were useful for seeing the difference in AI’s impact on firms with high or low exposure levels relative to other firms in the same industry. Below, the industry-neutral portfolios and the AMH portfolio excess returns are shown for the two weeks following ChatGPT’s debut and over the Nov. 15, 2022, to March 31, 2023, period.
There were some sizable differences in performance even in these “industry-neutral” portfolios. The high exposure quintiles had excess returns up to more than 0.4% per day and the lowest exposure quintiles had excess returns as low as -0.25% per day. These differences illustrate that AI can have quite a difference in impact on firm valuations given the makeup of their workforce.

The ChatGPT announcement was a major shock, the researchers believe. Then reaction cooled. And more recently, as seen in the stock chart atop this article, investors again bid up company shares based on AI exposure.
Some Highly Exposed Companies Could be in Trouble
Within some industries, firms highly exposed to AI significantly outperform the returns of firms with low exposure to AI. These industries include: 

finance, 
manufacturing, 
administrative support and 
waste management



On the other hand, in the real estate, rental and leasing industries, highly exposed firms significantly underperform firms with lower exposures. This negative effect suggests that incumbent firms could be displaced by new entrants using generative AI.
What Might Dull the Impact of Generative AI?
Previous technology advances, such as the personal computer and the internet, held out the hope of big productivity leaps and then disappointed. Eisfeldt, Schubert and Zhang note that events could transpire that would change the course, or hamper the progress, of valuations of firms highly exposed to generative AI. Fears about the potential creation of artificial general intelligence  or privacy laws could cause government regulation that would halt or slow the productivity potential of AI.
Additionally, there’s the fact that generative AI models sometimes produce nonfactual statements, and firms will likely need to keep humans in the loop to control its outputs. This will dilute some of the cost savings from employing AI. And in the short run, companies might also need to spend on retooling and infrastructure in order to employ AI. This too may limit near-term gains for these firms.

(This article is part of a series on Artificial Intelligence for Board Members and Senior Executives.)


A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that generative AI like ChatGPT can increase workforce productivity by an average of 14%. Some companies are already reporting productivity increases of up to 400% as a result of generative AI. And Mckinsey says that Generative AI could add up to $4.4 trillion worth of output annually.

As a C-level manager or board director, you want your company to take advantage of this potential. But how? Where are the biggest opportunities to do more with less, reduce costs, and boost profit?

PROMOTED
In other words—What should you do with all that productivity?

Here’s how you can take advantage of the productivity benefits of AI now, without a multi-year project and tens of millions of dollars of investment:

Artificial Intelligence is Already Displacing Human Jobs
According to Goldman Sachs research, two of every three American occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI. Worldwide, 300 million jobs may be eligible for replacement in part or in whole by automation, potentially saving employers trillions of dollars.
That is not something that will come years down the road. A recent Challenger job report revealed that 3,900 jobs were eliminated by artificial intelligence in May, 2023. IBM froze hiring in the same period for 7,800 jobs it said could be replaced in AI in the coming years. And British Telecom announced that more than 10% of its team would be replaced by AI before 2030. (See “Using AI For Layoffs: 5 Benefits For Decision Making”)

While the productivity advantages differ for every organization, there are four key areas in most large companies where you can expect to see immediate disruption:
1. Customer operations:


1/1

Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE
McKinsey predicts that generative AI has the potential to increase productivity in customer care by as much as 45%. Much of that gain comes from the ability of AI to understand customer intent and sentiment, and give personnel—even new trainees—the information they need to resolve problems quickly. It can also offload low-level customer service demands to chatbots that are far more functional and human-like than ever before. That not only translates into better service provision, it also results in teams who feel less overwhelmed and therefore more cheerful and loyal. Some of the players leading the charge here are Qualtrics, Ultimate.ai, and Intercom.
2. Sales & Marketing:
Generative AI can analyze prospect behavior so that sales and marketing teams can optimize their strategic approach far more efficiently than ever before. But because of the specialized abilities of the technology, generative AI can also help create customized emails, social media posts, advertising artwork, product descriptions, landing pages, and so much more. Even small marketing and sales operations can now easily customize and personalize their efforts. Shortly after ChatGPT went live, Microsoft and Salesforce respectively introduced Viva Sales and Einstein GPT which put generative AI to work in sales. Phrasee, Persado, and Albert are just a few of the many solutions that are putting generative AI to work in digital marketing.
3. Software Development:
88% of software coders report increased productivity when using generative AI. The technology can execute repetitive tasks like inserting boilerplate code snippets. It can review human-generated code for bugs and security flaws. And it can create software documentation, eliminating the need for a human coder to spend time on what is considered a low-level task. GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, and Snyk are just a few of the many solutions that have emerged to increase productivity in software development
4. Research & Development:
A list of ways that generative AI can help in the wide-ranging field of R&D would consume the entirety of this article. From drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry to information analysis in virtually any research field, to industrial design in manufacturing, generative AI is a true game changer. (See How AI is Bringing back American Manufacturing)
Here’s how you can boost your productivity with generative AI
That just scratches the surface of how AI is already changing the productivity game in business. But from a business management point of view, how can you align your organization to get moving?
1. Adopt and adapt—now:
Assume that your competitors are using generative AI right now. You need to get on board before they are so far ahead that you can’t catch up. (See The AI Threat: Winner Takes All.) Assume that your own team is experimenting with generative AI as well, whether it is part of your formal strategy or not. When human beings see a way to get their jobs done more easily, with less work—they take advantage of it. So you need to lean in and decide where, how, and when you want to implement this technology. Rapid adoption and adaptation is the name of the game.
2. Keep a human in the loop:
While it may be tempting to believe that you can simply offload work to generative AI, given the technology’s impressive performance, that would be a mistake. While integrating this technology, you should always retain “adult supervision” to make sure that the output meets the quality standards and brand image of your organization. Whether it is marketing content, product design, or software code, output needs to have a human review to ensure accuracy, avoid bias and other ethical issues, and spot other problems that only humans can understand today.
3. Engage with your team:
In response to the productivity boost afforded by generative AI, you may choose to let people go or make fewer new hires. However, you may also discover that your customers expect more from you than ever before, and that you need every available body to help increase output. Either way, you must take a hard look at your organizational chart and immediately engage with your team on this subject. Instead of having people worry about losing their jobs, help them to adapt. Some roles will be eliminated, others will expand, while still others will remain unaffected. Communicate with your team, let them know what is expected of them, support them with retraining and change management. And make sure that old and new teams alike are ready to embrace generative AI as a copilot.
4. Lead from the top
The CEO, the senior executive team, and the board of directors can not be on the trailing end of this change. The changes that generative AI is driving within your organization and industry will make the last decade of digital transformation look positively quaint. You need to lead your organization’s internal AI revolution. That does not mean that every senior executive needs to become an expert in AI themselves. However, they do need to champion its use and become very adept at implementing it throughout the organization.
If you care about how AI is determining the winners and losers in business, how you can leverage AI for the benefit of your organization, and how you can manage AI risk, I encourage you to stay tuned.

         — 
    


            Many have raised alarms about the potential for artificial intelligence to displace jobs in the years ahead, but it’s already causing upheaval in one industry where workers once seemed invincible: tech.
    

            A small but growing number of tech firms have cited AI as a reason for laying off workers and rethinking new hires in recent months, as Silicon Valley races to adapt to rapid advances in the technology being developed in its own backyard. 
    

            Chegg, an education technology company, disclosed in a regulatory filing last month that it was cutting 4% of its workforce, or about 80 employees, “to better position the Company to execute against its AI strategy and to create long-term, sustainable value for its students and investors.”

            IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in an interview with Bloomberg in May that the company expects to pause hiring for roles it thinks could be replaced with AI in the coming years. (In a subsequent interview with Barrons, however, Krishna said that he felt his earlier comments were taken out of context and stressed that “AI is going to create more jobs than it takes away.”)

            And in late April, file-storage service Dropbox said that it was cutting about 16% of its workforce, or about 500 people, also citing AI.

Forget about the AI apocalypse. The real dangers are already here




            In its most-recent layoffs report, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said 3,900 people were laid off in May due to AI, marking its first time breaking out job cuts based on that factor. All of those cuts occurred in the tech sector, according to the firm.
    

            With these moves, Silicon Valley may not only be leading the charge in developing AI but also offering an early glimpse into how businesses may adapt to those tools. Rather than render entire skill sets obsolete overnight, as some might fear, the more immediate impact of a new crop of AI tools appears to be forcing companies to shift resources to better take advantage of the technology — and placing a premium on workers with AI expertise.
    

            “Over the last few months, AI has captured the world’s collective imagination, expanding the potential market for our next generation of AI-powered products more rapidly than any of us could have anticipated,” Dropbox CEO Drew Houston wrote in a note to staff announcing the job cuts. “Our next stage of growth requires a different mix of skill sets, particularly in AI and early-stage product development.” 
    

            In response to a request for comment on how its realignment around AI is playing out, Dropbox directed CNN to its careers page, where it is currently hiring for multiple roles focused on “New AI Initiatives.”
    

            Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School, told CNN that AI “will cause organizations to restructure,” but also doesn’t see it playing out as machines replacing humans just yet.

            “AI, as far as I see it, doesn’t necessarily replace humans, but rather enhances the work of humans,” Wang said. “I think that the kind of competition that we all should be thinking more about is that human specialists will be replaced by human specialists who can take advantage of AI tools.”
    

        A tale of two Silicon Valleys


            The AI-driven tech layoffs come amid broader cuts in the industry. Many tech companies have been readjusting to an uncertain economic environment and waning levels of demand for digital services more than three years into the pandemic.
    

            Some 212,294 workers in the tech industry have been laid off in 2023 alone, according to data tracked by Layoffs.fyi, already surpassing the 164,709 recorded in 2022. 
    

            But in the shadow of those mass layoffs, the tech industry has also been gripped by an AI fervor and invested heavily in AI talent and tech. 
    

            In January, just days after Microsoft announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees as part of broader cost-cutting measures, the company also confirmed it was making a “multibillion dollar” investment into OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. And in March, in the same letter to staff Mark Zuckerberg used to announce plans to lay off another 10,000 workers (after cutting 11,000 positions last November), the Meta CEO also outlined plans for investing heavily in AI.
    

            Even software engineers in Silicon Valley who once seemed uniquely in demand now appear to be at risk of losing their jobs, or losing out on salary gains to those with more AI expertise. 
    

            Roger Lee, a startup founder who has been tracking tech industry layoffs via his website Layoffs.fyi, also runs Comprehensive.io, which examines job listings and compensation data across some 3,000 tech companies. 
    

            Lee told CNN that a recent analysis of data from Comprehensive.io shows the average salary for a senior software engineer specializing in artificial intelligence or machine learning is 12% higher than for those who don’t specialize in that area, a data point he dubs “the AI premium.” The average salary for a senior software engineer specializing in AI or machine learning has also increased by some 4% since the beginning of the year, whereas the average salary for senior software engineers as a whole has stayed flat, he said.
    

            Lee noted Dropbox as an example of a company offering notably high pay for AI roles, citing a base salary listing of $276,300 to $373,800 for a Principal Machine Learning Engineer role. (By comparison, Comprehensive.io’s data puts the current average salary for a senior software engineer at $171,895.)
    

            Those looking to thrive in the tech industry and beyond may need to brush up on their AI skills.
    

            Wang, the professor at Columbia Business School, told CNN that starting this past spring semester, he began requiring his students to familiarize themselves with the new crop of generative AI tools on the market. “That type of exposure I think is absolutely critical for setting themselves up for success and once they graduate,” Wang said.
    

            It’s not that everyone needs to become AI specialists, Wang added, but rather that workers should know how to use AI tools to become more efficient at whatever they’re doing. 
    

            “That’s where the kind of a battleground for talent is really shifting,” Wang said, “as differentiation in terms of talent comes from creative and effective ways to integrate AI into daily tasks.”

Rather than render entire skill sets obsolete overnight, as some might fear, the more immediate impact of a new crop of AI tools appears to be forcing companies to shift resources to better take advantage of the technology — and placing a premium on workers with AI expertise. “Over the last few months, AI has captured the world’s collective imagination, expanding the potential market for our next generation of AI-powered products more rapidly than any of us could have anticipated,” Dropbox CEO Drew Houston wrote in a note to staff announcing the job cuts. “Our next stage of growth requires a different mix of skill sets, particularly in AI and early-stage product development.”  In response to a request for comment on how its realignment around AI is playing out, Dropbox directed CNN to its careers page, where it is currently hiring for multiple roles focused on “New AI Initiatives.” Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School, told CNN that AI “will cause organizations to restructure,” but also doesn’t see it playing out as machines replacing humans just yet. “AI, as far as I see it, doesn’t necessarily replace humans, but rather enhances the work of humans,” Wang said. “I think that the kind of competition that we all should be thinking more about is that human specialists will be replaced by human specialists who can take advantage of AI tools.” A tale of two Silicon Valleys The AI-driven tech layoffs come amid broader cuts in the industry. Many tech companies have been readjusting to an uncertain economic environment and waning levels of demand for digital services more than three years into the pandemic. Some 212,294 workers in the tech industry have been laid off in 2023 alone, according to data tracked by Layoffs.fyi, already surpassing the 164,709 recorded in 2022.  But in the shadow of those mass layoffs, the tech industry has also been gripped by an AI fervor and invested heavily in AI talent and tech.  In January, just days after Microsoft announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees as part of broader cost-cutting measures, the company also confirmed it was making a “multibillion dollar” investment into OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. And in March, in the same letter to staff Mark Zuckerberg used to announce plans to lay off another 10,000 workers (after cutting 11,000 positions last November), the Meta CEO also outlined plans for investing heavily in AI. Even software engineers in Silicon Valley who once seemed uniquely in demand now appear to be at risk of losing their jobs, or losing out on salary gains to those with more AI expertise.  Roger Lee, a startup founder who has been tracking tech industry layoffs via his website Layoffs.fyi, also runs Comprehensive.io, which examines job listings and compensation data across some 3,000 tech companies.  Lee told CNN that a recent analysis of data from Comprehensive.io shows the average salary for a senior software engineer specializing in artificial intelligence or machine learning is 12% higher than for those who don’t specialize in that area, a data point he dubs “the AI premium.” The average salary for a senior software engineer specializing in AI or machine learning has also increased by some 4% since the beginning of the year, whereas the average salary for senior software engineers as a whole has stayed flat, he said. Lee noted Dropbox as an example of a company offering notably high pay for AI roles, citing a base salary listing of $276,300 to $373,800 for a Principal Machine Learning Engineer role. (By comparison, Comprehensive.io’s data puts the current average salary for a senior software engineer at $171,895.) Those looking to thrive in the tech industry and beyond may need to brush up on their AI skills. Wang, the professor at Columbia Business School, told CNN that starting this past spring semester, he began requiring his students to familiarize themselves with the new crop of generative AI tools on the market. “That type of exposure I think is absolutely critical for setting themselves up for success and once they graduate,” Wang said. It’s not that everyone needs to become AI specialists, Wang added, but rather that workers should know how to use AI tools to become more efficient at whatever they’re doing.  “That’s where the kind of a battleground for talent is really shifting,” Wang said, “as differentiation in terms of talent comes from creative and effective ways to integrate AI into daily tasks.”","{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.article__content'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,1020.0,,,,https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230703141339-ai-tech-layoffs-stock-restricted.jpg?c=original,P0Y0M0DT0H4M32S,,,,,,,,,,,,

Will artificial intelligence replace physicians?

Andrew Wilner, MD



Tech




      July 6, 2023    





ShareTweetShareA recent Goldman Sachs report determined that artificial intelligence (AI) may wipe out 300 million jobs. Jobs that require advanced education, like mine, are particularly vulnerable. This isn’t welcome news for those of us who have invested a lifetime mastering our crafts and must work for a living.
Until recently, the primary goal of medical students has been to master the science of medicine. Students spend thousands of hours learning anatomy, biochemistry, histology, pathology, pharmacology, physiology, and much more. That knowledge is essential for the effective practice of medicine.

However, AI can memorize and regurgitate facts faster and more accurately than any student. Even a lifetime of study can’t compete with AI’s gigabytes of memory and archives of algorithms. Artificial intelligence will win memory contests every time. Now that AI is here, medical students must focus more than ever on the art of medicine.
An expert weighs in





For an upcoming podcast episode, I asked AI expert Manuj Aggarwal whether I would lose my job. Is it really time to buff up my LinkedIn profile?
A magnificent tool





Manuj’s answer was reassuring. AI will perform the grunt work that consumes much of the current patient/physician encounter. Artificial intelligence will summarize medical records, codify comorbidities, quantify adherence, compare therapeutic options, highlight medication side effects, calculate drug dosages, estimate treatment risk-benefit ratios, and provide prognosis-all in the blink of an eye. Artificial intelligence can already accomplish all these tasks.
I can easily imagine AI performing delicate brain tumor surgery with robotic arms. To follow up, AI prescribes the latest combination of evidence-based chemotherapy and radiation at appropriate doses for the patient’s body mass index, liver and renal function. AI calculates the patient’s 5-year survival based on the tumor’s pathological grade, molecular genetics, and the patient’s overall health. To conclude, AI summarizes its work and prints out a detailed bill complete with ICD-10 codes. Neurosurgeons would still direct therapy, but expert AI assistants would do the heavy lifting.
Harnessed properly, AI could free up time for physicians to develop deeper relationships with their patients. Physicians could enjoy greater job satisfaction, and patients would benefit from improved outcomes.
Limitations of artificial intelligence





For all its wonder, AI suffers from limitations. For example, I recently followed instructions from my car’s navigation system (a rudimentary form of AI) for the shortest route to my destination. The AI worked fine, but recent construction had transformed the preferred road into a dead-end street. A missed software update on my GPS is one thing, but out-of-date information could be catastrophic during a neurosurgical procedure.
Further, AI cannot apply the art of medicine to an individual patient. Can AI parse a patient’s responses to separate fact from fiction? Can AI ask the right question in the right way at the right time? Can AI distinguish what patients want from what they really need? Can AI approach each patient in a culturally sensitive way? Can AI navigate a patient’s fear? Perhaps someday AI will accomplish all of these tasks but not today and probably never.
Physicians must form a “therapeutic alliance” with each patient to obtain optimal results. The key to such a relationship is trust. No matter how sophisticated, a silicon chip is less likely to inspire confidence than a warm handshake and eye contact with a fellow human being. A human physician has another attribute AI can probably never achieve: compassion.





Conclusion
As AI integrates into routine medical care, it may replace health care providers who rush patient encounters and rely only on diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms. After all, algorithms are AI’s specialty. However, those who care for each patient with compassion, insight, and respect will never need to look for another job. Artificial intelligence can’t compete with physicians who practice the art of medicine.

The fear is that this transition could temporarily reverse the trend and potentially impede further advancements.While AI adoption may result in job losses for some, it also presents numerous new employment opportunities for everyone. The gender disparities highlighted in the study can be attributed to the varying composition of professions. Is AI putting your job at risk? (credit: PEXELS)Office-based jobs, which are more easily replaceable by AI systems, are predominantly held by women. In contrast, occupations involving physical tasks are less susceptible to automation. Although women&#x27;s representation in these fields has increased in recent years, they still remain largely male-dominated.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of working women aged 25 to 54 in the United States had reached a historic high of 77%. However, the outbreak and subsequent layoffs disproportionately affected women, leading to a decline in their share to 73.5%.While there has been a partial recovery since then, the rise of AI now threatens to hinder progress once again.

New York employers must now tell applicants when they encounter AI

AI job interviews becoming more common 











AI job interviews are becoming more common. Here's how to ace them.
05:02

Starting today, job-hunters in New York City will be let in on a formerly hidden part of the application process, learning whether — and how — artificial intelligence is being used to make hiring decisions. The city's automated employment decision tools law, enacted in 2021 and scheduled to be enforced beginning July 5, positions New York City as a leader in regulating the use of AI in hiring. Other cities and states expected to gradually follow suit. The narrowly tailored law is designed to offset potential misuses of AI in ways that could substantially affect workers' livelihoods. Specifically, it requires companies that lean on AI tools to make hiring decisions to disclose this fact to candidates. It also mandates that employers conduct annual third-party ""bias audits"" of the technology or software they use, in order to make public the ways in which the AI could be discriminating against certain types of candidates.  






""If in fact the employers are using an automated employment decision tool (AEDT), then the employer has to commission an independent audit, publish a summary, tell applicants and employees they're using it, and give applicants the opportunity to have an accommodation and pursue an alternative selection process,"" Domenique Camacho Moran, an employment attorney at Farrell Fritz, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""We are only talking about those tools that take the place of human people making decisions.""Amazon is using AI to summarize customer product reviewsFather of ChatGPT: AI could ""go quite wrong""The audits are meant to keep tabs on sometimes-controversial tools that companies themselves don't always understand. AI screening tools can save companies time — but automated decision-making has also been criticized for replicating stereotypes and disadvantaging women and people of color in some contexts.


""That's the risk in all of this, that left unchecked, humans sometimes can't even explain what data points the algorithm is picking up on. That's what was largely behind this legislation,"" said John Hausknecht, a professor of human resources at Cornell University's school of Industrial and Labor Relations. ""It's saying let's track it, collect data, analyze it and report it, so over time, we can make changes to the regulations.""But if potential hires don't like being judged by AI, their ability to opt out is limited. The law specifies that, while an AI screening disclosure ""must include instructions for how an individual can request an alternative selection process or a reasonable accommodation under other laws, if available,"" the hiring company isn't required to actually use a different screening process.

Replacing human decisionsThe law penalizes firms that fail to comply with it. First violations are subject to a $500 fine, with subsequent offenses carrying up to $1,500 fines.Importantly, the scope of the law is very narrow. 


""It's the very first law that's specifically calling out automated decision employment tools and regulating those specifically,"" Littler Mendelson employment attorney Niloy Ray told CBS MoneyWatch. ""This is narrowly focused on the use of AI in hiring or promoting employees but not any other employment lifecycle decisions.Just using an AI tool isn't enough to mandate disclosure: It must have a direct effect on hiring outcomes in order for the law to apply.""We are only talking about those tools that take the place of humans making decisions,"" Camacho Moran said. ""If you have an AI tool that runs through 1,000 applications and says, 'these are the top 20 candidates,' that is clearly a tool that falls within the definition of an AEDT.""She continued, ""if, on the other hand, the AI is designed to put people into buckets, like these candidates have relevant experience, these have relevant education – pick your criteria – that's not a tool that would fall within the AEDT definition.""In other words, if the AI flags candidates with relevant experience, but a human being views all of the applications and remains the ultimate decision-maker, the law likely wouldn't apply, according to Camacho Moran.

A hurdle for small businesses? Some critics of the law argue that its punitive nature — and the requirement of a bias audit — is burdensome, particularly to small and midsize employers experimenting with using AI to streamline and improve hiring processes. ""This requirement just adds one more cost to the process of hiring and promoting within New York City and it is a cumbersome one,"" said Ray, of Littler Mendelson. ""So it creates a certain amount of risk of somehow not complying because it wasn't crystal clear what you needed to do to comply and certainly there's the cost of compliance.""   


For one, Society of Human Resource Management chief of staff and head of public affairs Emily M. Dickens, objects to the fines. ""It was a good faith attempt to try to assign some regulatory guardrails around the issue that could impact some people adversely if it's not used correctly,"" she said. ""But we should assume good intent until we see something very egregious. It's the first law of its kind and is likely to be replicated in other jurisdictions and you don't want to start with penalizing people for trying to do the right thing.""She supports the responsible use of AI in hiring processes given that many employers still struggle to recruit diverse workforces and that qualified candidates have fallen through the cracks under the human-centric approach.""This process has been human-run for many years and we still have not solved the problem of creating more inclusive workplaces or accessing different talent and meeting the needs of firms struggling to find talent,"" Dickens said. ""We need guardrails but we don't need overregulation at the cost of workforce innovation.""
