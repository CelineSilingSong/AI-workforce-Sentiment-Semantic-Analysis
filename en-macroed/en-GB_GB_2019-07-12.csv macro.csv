Amid the headlines exclaiming the predicted loss of jobs due to automation and other changes brought by artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and autonomous systems, it’s clear that the way we work and live is transforming. This evolution can be unnerving. Since we know change is inevitable, let’s look at how work will likely change and some ideas for how to prepare for it.








The Future Of Work: 5 Important Ways Jobs Will Change In The 4th Industrial Revolution

5 Ways Work Will Change in the Future
At least 30% of the activities associated with the majority of occupations in the United States could be automated, which includes even knowledge tasks that were previously thought to be safe according to a McKinsey Global Institute report. This echoes what executives see as well and prompted Rick Jensen, Chief Talent Officer at Intuit to say, “The workforce is changing massively.” Here are just a few of the ways:
1. Fluid gigs
Within an organization, positions will be more fluid, and a strict organizational chart will likely be tossed in favor of more project-based teams. This is especially appealing to Generation Z employees since 75% of Generation Z employees would be interested in having multiple roles in one place of employment. The “gig” economy will continue to expand where professionals sign on as contractors or freelancers and then move on to the next gig.
PROMOTED
2. Decentralized workforces
Thanks to mobile technology and readily available internet access, remote workers are already common. Employees won’t need to be in the same location. This will make it easier for the next generation workers to choose to live anywhere, rather than find a job and then move to a city with that job.

3. Motivation to work
People will need something more than a paycheck as a motivation to work. Many want to work for an organization with a mission and purpose they believe in. They will also want different incentives such as personal development opportunities, the latest tech gadgets to facilitate their work-from-anywhere ambitions, and more.
4. Lifelong learning
Not only will employees want to learn throughout their career, but they will also need to learn new skills. Technology will continue to evolve the role humans play in the workforce, so everyone will be required to adapt their skills throughout their working lives.
5. Technology will augment human’s jobs
Artificial intelligence algorithms and intelligent machines will be co-workers to humans. The human workforce will need to develop a level of comfort and acceptance for how man and machine can collaborate using the best that both bring to the workplace.
How to Prepare for the Future of Work
Even though we can’t predict all the changes that will occur in the future, we do have a fair amount of certainty that there are some things people can do to prepare for it.
Rather than succumb to the doomsday predictions that “robots will take over all the jobs,” a more optimistic outlook is one where humans get the opportunity to do work that demands their creativity, imagination, social and emotional intelligence, and passion.
Individuals will need to act and engage in lifelong learning, so they are adaptable when the changes happen. The lifespan for any given skill set is shrinking, so it will be imperative for individuals to continue to invest in acquiring new skills. The shift to lifelong learning needs to happen now because the changes are already happening.
In addition, employees will need to shape their own career path. Gone are the days when a career trajectory is outlined at one company with predictable climbs up the corporate ladder. Therefore, employees should pursue a diverse set of work experiences and take the initiative to shape their own career paths.
Individuals will need to step into the opportunity that pursuing your passion provides rather than shrink back to what had resulted in success in the past. This shift in work opens the possibility to achieve more of our potential. We need to begin to think of work as more than a paycheck.
Employers need to think differently about how they recruit and hire new employees. Companies need to review a prospective employee’s potential and assess skills that are less likely to be automated any time soon, including emotional intelligence, critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.





Another way employers will need to adjust operations is to create a structure and culture that honors lifelong learning, and that celebrates creativity. It's time for employers to assess their benefit and incentive programs to ensure they are providing the motivation the next generation of employees will want in order to attract the best talent.
While nothing is certain, it's important for every human to begin taking steps in the direction to prepare for a future where machines become colleagues. If we don't begin to adapt to the changes today, it will be challenging to catch up later.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",http://schema.org,BreadcrumbList,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/07/15/the-future-of-work-5-important-ways-jobs-will-change-in-the-4th-industrial-revolution/,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/bernardmarr/files/2019/07/AdobeStock_239827592-1200x675.jpeg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', 'width': 542.79, 'height': 304.6}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Bernard Marr', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/', 'description': 'Bernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing Business and Society.

This describes a situation where unaided machines are able to complete tasks more effectively and cheaper than human employees, which includes activities such as designing clothes and other creative functions. On average, Asian machine-learning researchers predict the arrival of HLMI within 30 years, compared with 74 years for North Americans. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs 2018 report, lists AI, machine learning and the spread of new technologies as key drivers of change in the global labour market. As self-learning algorithms become more sophisticated and integrate further with our work and social lives, they could have greater capacity to undertake jobs requiring artistic interpretation and creativity.

This week, multiple companies have advanced their AI programming.  The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is almost commonplace in the biotech and pharma industry as multiple companies are harnessing the power to aid in drug discovery and development. This week more companies have announced advancements in their AI programming. This morning, San Francisco-based Notable Labs announced it secured $40 million in a Series B funding round to use its artificial intelligence platform to advance cancer drug development. The company’s approach is aimed at predicting which types of patients are most likely to respond to a drug in as little as five days. The process is designed to help physicians make more informed decisions about which clinical trials will be effective with patients and can also benefit the likelihood of a trial’s success by matching the right patients to the right trial. Notable noted that in a recent clinical trial, its process achieved an 84% overall accuracy rate in predicting patient response to drugs or drug combinations. Notable Labs was founded by De Silva, a former analyst at noted biotech investor Peter Thiel’s Clarium Capital, nearly five years ago. De Silva said the concept for the company came out of his experiences caring for his father, who was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme. None of the approved medications benefitted the elder De Silva and his father was not eligible to participate in any clinical trial due to the advanced form of the disease. De Silva said that all of the treatment solutions for his father were sort of a “one-size-fits-all” approach. He wanted to find a way to focus on personalized treatment for individual cancer patients, and Notable Labs was born. De Silva said the company is ready to scale the results Notable has so far generated to expand its AI platform to other cancer types. “Patients with aggressive cancers are in a race against time, but if we can use technology to identify the best drug or drug combination at the time of diagnosis, there is a much better chance those therapies will work,” he said in a statement. Notable’s funding round was supported by B Capital Group and LifeForce Capital, along with Industry Ventures. This round brings Notable’s total funding to more than $55 million. Iframe Embed Notable isn’t the only AI-focused company advancing its programs. Computational pathology-focused Paige published an article in Nature Medicine describing an AI system for computational pathology that achieves clinical-grade accuracy levels. The paper outlines how a series of novel algorithms created using datasets ten times larger than those that have been manually curated performed better and also are more generalizable. In its announcement, Paige said the significance of this development hinges on the fact that curating datasets can be prohibitively expensive and time-intensive. By eliminating the need to curate datasets, Paige can now develop many more highly accurate algorithms that can be built into clinical decision support products to help pathologists around the world drive better patient care. GlaxoSmithKline has also made a move this week to support its AI program. Bloomberg reported that the U.K. pharma giant poached Genentech veteran Kim Branson to oversee the use of AI in the finding of novel targets for potential medicines. GSK first turned to the use of AI in 2017 with a strategic drug discovery collaboration with Exscientia. Under the terms of that particular collaboration, Exscientia is using its AI capabilities and combining them with GSK’s drug discovery expertise in order to discover novel and selective small molecules for up to 10 disease-related targets. In the interview with Bloomberg, GSK Chief Executive Officer Emma Walmsley said harnessing the big data capabilities of AI will enable the company to predict better targets for potential drugs and which patients are more suited to those drugs in clinical trials, much like Notable indicated. Walmsley said the AI capabilities boos the chance of “improving the productivity of an R&D organization.” Last week, AI startup Kyndi secured $20 million in Series B funding that will be used to expand the company’s engineering and sales teams to meet growing customer demand in government, financial services and life sciences. Kyndi is developing the first “Explainable AI platform.” Unlike traditional “black box” AI solutions, the Kyndi platform scores the provenance and origin of each document it processes, while helping organizations quickly find difficult-to-locate information within collections of documents – without requiring large, labeled data sets to train the system, the company said in its announcement. ideal-employer-email-banner.jpg"", 'articleSection': 'Business, News', 'author': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/alex-keown/#person', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/alex-keown/'}, 'name': 'Alex Keown', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/alex-keown'}], 'copyrightYear': '2024', 'datePublished': '2019-07-16T12:22:53.000Z', 'dateModified': '2019-07-16T15:15:05.000Z', 'headline': 'Artificial Intelligence-Focused Companies Advance Programming', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#article', 'image': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 350, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/15c57a8/2147483647/strip/false/crop/625x350+0+0/resize/625x350!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF1CD5DB8-1C04-4B47-9D00-78EE50357799.jpg', 'height': 625}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/10b161f/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF1CD5DB8-1C04-4B47-9D00-78EE50357799.jpg', 'height': 1200}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#webpage'}, 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#webpage'}}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Website', 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'WebPage', 'potentialAction': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming'}], 'breadcrumb': {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'itemListElement': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/news', 'name': 'News', 'position': 1}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/business', 'name': 'Business', 'position': 2}]}, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#webpage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#primaryimage'}, 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence-Focused Companies Advance Programming', 'datePublished': '2019-07-16T12:22:53.000Z', 'dateModified': '2019-07-16T15:15:05.000Z', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/ai-roundup-artificial-intelligence-focused-companies-advance-programming/#primaryimage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/10b161f/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FF1CD5DB8-1C04-4B47-9D00-78EE50357799.jpg', 'height': 1200}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly all Fortune 500 companies – more than 98 percent – plus an increasing number of smaller businesses filter resumes using an applicant tracking system before they ever make it to a human hiring manager, according to a 2018 analysis of job listings by resume optimization service Jobscan. “And it’s only a matter of time before AI-enabled tools become even more prevalent,” says Lisa Rangel, former recruiter and managing director of Chameleon Resumes. “Many larger companies are already using AI-candidate screening tools that focus on the whole candidate and not just a resume. As these tools become more mainstream and affordable, they will become more widely used.”
AI is infiltrating many processes related to recruiting and hiring, according to Al Smith, CTO with talent acquisition software provider iCIMS. “This includes screening candidate resumes in comparison to job descriptions and using AI-powered chatbots to streamline communications and schedule interviews,” Smith says. “Organizations are recognizing that machines can be incredibly efficient in identifying the most qualified individuals in the candidate pool, thereby giving recruiters the chance to focus their time on more meaningful tasks and building relationships with best-fit candidates.”

But what does that mean for the candidate on the other side of these machine-driven hiring efforts? IT leaders can take steps to make sure their resumes are optimized to use this AI screening to their advantage – and avoid some common mistakes. Consider these do’s and don’ts:
1. Do spell out acronyms
This is true, both figuratively and literally. “Candidates should highlight all their skills that are relevant to a particular role on their application or resume,” says Smith. “Applicant tracking systems match keywords from job descriptions with resumes to find candidates that are the best fit for the role. Many AI tools also have semantic and synonym capabilities, so they can align similar language between job descriptions and resumes.”
Include any special projects, skill sets, and certifications, and the full name of relevant systems and software. It’s important to be accurate, Smith says, and define acronyms to avoid being filtered out of the pool.

2. Don’t try to game the system
“It is incredibly important to be honest,” Smith says. “Some candidates apply to several jobs at an organization with a slight change to their email address or name. Applicant tracking systems are designed to match similar profiles, so the technology will catch and flag this, potentially reflecting badly on the submitted resume and impacting the candidate’s potential.”
Smith has seen some job hunters overload their resumes with keywords they think will get them in the door or sneak some in a white font readable only by machine. “While one may have the ability to trick an AI system to a certain degree, eventually a phone screening or live meeting with a hiring manager will bring to light that the applicant may not be as qualified as they claim.” 
3. Do differentiate yourself
Many job seekers assume that 100 percent compliance [with] the perfect keywords will get them past the screens, says Rangel. That’s not the case. Instead, candidates should focus on their achievements and differentiators in their resumes. In fact, Smith says, “they should avoid overloading their resume with the exact keywords from the job description, as advanced applicant tracking systems can recognize this and it may have potential to reflect poorly on the application.”
You may want to rethink overused words like innovation or transformation as well.
You may want to rethink overused words like innovation or transformation as well, advises Pat Ryan, executive vice president of enterprise architecture at SPR. “If a company is sifting through a collection of documents it will likely filter out words used by many people or that are filler words. If everyone wrote the words ‘innovative’ or ‘leadership’, then the algorithm might filter those words out, even if these words are individually important to the text being analyzed.”
4. Don't limit your job hunting to online submissions
“Realize that if you want a human to reach out to you, reach out to a human,” says Rangel. “Use the job posting to research the job.” Do some research using LinkedIn to get close to the hiring manager, and contact him or her directly or through a connection.
5. Do continue to network with human beings
“Networking [employee referrals, social media connections, and personal contacts] is still the best way to land quality jobs,” says Rangel. “There will always be a new tool or application that can make the job landing process smoother for some. Try it, but if the new shiny hiring tool doesn’t seem to work for you, know there is nothing wrong with you, but instead you might need to use a more traditional tactic that has been tried and true for years.”
6. Don’t wait for an opening to enter the resume tracking system
“Candidates should join talent pools for companies of interest, even if there isn’t a current role open,” says Smith. “When a relevant role opens, those in the talent pool will be among the first to know and could give them a competitive edge. “
7. Do consider the upside of AI in job hunting

While bot-enabled recruiting is new and imperfect, it has potential benefits not just for the hiring companies, but for IT leaders trying to land their next job. “AI can help eliminate human error by always ensuring that employers see the resumes of those who are truly qualified for the role,” Smith points out. “Without AI, a recruiter may miss a qualified candidate’s resume by simple mistake, or their own bias may get in the way of advancing a candidate to the next stage. AI screening systems also make it much easier for qualified candidates to be elevated for hiring manager review more quickly, as those who are not qualified are weeded out earlier the process.”

Artificial intelligence, which is predicted to grow to an $89.8 billion industry(link is external) by 2025, is already having a profound effect on consumers—but it will also significantly impact real estate professionals. From chatbots that handle clients’ needs to smarter ad campaigns that produce high-quality leads, AI is changing the way agents work.
Here’s how the technology will impact the buying and selling process for agents and brokers.
Provide accurate property valuations.
Determining property value can be challenging. You must evaluate as many factors as possible to give a fair price. However, the assessment no longer has to be done manually.
Automated valuation models, or AVMs, use regression analysis to estimate the market value of a property accurately by looking at similar properties that recently sold in the market. You can leverage machine learning software to analyze vital information, such as changes in the local neighborhood, schools, public transportation, and other factors, to assess property values. This enables you to dig deeper beyond the previous sale price to provide a more precise property value.
AI software can also streamline the negotiation process by predicting where a price compromise is likely to happen. You can prevent business losses that may result from giving a property price that’s too low or too high. With AI, you can be assured that an initial offer is well within the market price and that you have the data to back it up.
Create better ad campaigns for lead generation.
AI is improving how ads target consumers(link is external) so you can get in front of more people. Instead of spending time and resources to set up an ad campaign manually, you can let AI do the hard work for you.
From ad creation and targeting to custom video listings, AI is a powerful tool that can help increase lead generation. AI-based software can automatically generate suggested ad campaigns by detecting your new listings and upcoming open houses in the MLS. With every new lead, the system then notifies you via a text message and email. You’ll also be able to access detailed reporting that shows ad performance and specific insights about who the ad has reached. This helps you save time to focus on other meaningful business tasks.
Engage clients and increase lead conversions.
You aren’t available to speak to potential clients around the clock. However, chatbots are ready to interact 24/7 with online leads that come to you via your website. Sixty-nine percent of consumers prefer chatbots for quick communication with brands, according to The 2018 State of Chatbots Report(link is external).
Chatbots can prompt customers to ask questions and instantly respond to queries about a property, such as those related to square footage, lot size, number of bedrooms, and any other details. Using machine learning, you can discover more about a client’s home search and preferences and then respond to more complex questions over time. Chatbots can also make personalized offerings based on a specific user’s preferences.
While chatbots will not replace you entirely, they make it easier for you to qualify online leads and increase transactions. Many agents have managed to increase property closings by using chatbots and personal assistants.
Streamline data management.
You deal with massive amounts of data involving legal papers, appraisal reports, zoning regulations, and other crucial documents. Although documents have become digital, humans must still sift through all of the data. However, AI makes it possible to manage data faster and more thoroughly without the human eye.
AI-based tools can spot inaccuracies in data by continually analyzing it. These tools can send notifications to you in the event of any inconsistencies, such as empty MLS fields, missing signatures, legal mistakes, and invalid characters.
You can use AI-powered software to conduct demographic market research and financial and environmental analysis. Software that uses machine learning can recognize patterns in the data to generate actionable insights. For example, with enough relevant data, AI can predict when a particular type of property will increase in popularity.
Much of AI has yet to enter the real estate industry. However, it’s gaining traction quickly. Agents that are prepared to embrace AI-based technologies will take their business to new heights and remain competitive in a changing landscape.

July 16, 2019 — Computational pathology company Paige announced the publication of an article in Nature Medicine describing an artificial intelligence (AI) system for computational pathology that achieves clinical-grade accuracy levels. The paper provides further scientific evidence that pathologists’ work in diagnosing and treating cancer can be complemented and aided through the deployment of computational decision-support systems to improve patient care.
The team of scientists responsible for the work described in the article developed specially-designed deep learning algorithms to build a system that can detect prostate cancer, skin cancer and breast cancer with near-perfect accuracy. These algorithms are based on a vast dataset of nearly 45,000 de-identified, digitized slide images from more than 15,000 cancer patients from 44 countries.
The paper outlines how a series of novel algorithms, created using datasets 10 times larger than those that have been manually curated, performed better and also are more generalizable. The significance of this new development hinges on the fact that curating datasets can be prohibitively expensive and time intensive. By eliminating the need to curate datasets, Paige can now develop many more highly accurate algorithms that can be built into clinical decision support products to help pathologists around the world drive better patient care.
Paige plans to commercialize several of these solutions to address the most pressing needs in pathology to improve patient care. The company has already built on the academic work described in Nature Medicine to develop a clinical product, based on technology currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a designated Breakthrough Device, for an intended indication different than the one described in the article.
All data collection, research and analysis for this research was conducted exclusively at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) in New York City. The publication of the study’s findings was the result of collaboration between numerous researchers and clinicians, and made possible by Paige’s partnership with MSK. All data were de-identified and did not contain any protected health information or label text.

July 16, 2019 by Twain Taylor 1 Comment Artificial intelligence (AI) is making all the difference between innovators and laggards in the global marketplace. Yet, implementing a state-of-the-art DataOps operation involves a long-term commitment to putting in place the right people, processes and tools that will deliver results.In this post, we look at three organizations that are doing cutting-edge work in the field of DataOps. We look at the specific strategies they use and the results they’ve seen as they navigate the uncharted waters of DataOps.Uber: End-to-End DataOpsUber is very vocal about the way it leverages AI across its apps and services globally. The company runs all its machine learning (ML) models on a platform called Michelangelo and use many other proprietary tools such as Manifold, Horovod and Piper to optimize and scale these operations.



Michelangelo helps manage DataOps in a way similar to DevOps by encouraging iterative development of models and democratizing the access to data and tools across teams. On top of this platform, Uber uses other tools to help data teams.Uber ran its models in Tensorflow and realized model training was taking too long because of the large data sets it was dealing with. Taking a page from Facebook’s data team, the company realized the power of distributed training. This would enable Uber to run data operations in parallel on hundreds of distributed GPUs, rather than on a few GPUs. Yet, managing all this would be a challenge, which is why Uber built a tool called Horovod. Now under the auspices of The Linux Foundation’s Deep Learning community, Horovod supports additional frameworks such as PySpark, Petastorm and Apache MXNet. Additionally, using mixed precision training, Horovod is able to optimize the use of memory when running models, and in doing so, it enables running larger data models or running numerous mini-batches of data in parallel.

Manifold is a visualization tool that helps to gauge the performance of various models against each other. Rather than use a simplistic, two-dimensional axis to plot performance data, Manifold groups large quantities of model performance data into subsets that avoid duplicating the important indicators of performance. This reduces noise and helps speed analysis of the data. The lesson: Look beyond the trees to view the entire forest when it comes to metrics.By adopting an end-to-end approach to DataOps and leveraging specialized tools at every step of the pipeline, Uber is pioneering the use of AI in its large-scale consumer applications.Netflix: Offline First, Then OnlineContent recommendation is key to the user experience in the Netflix app. Highly relevant content makes the experience personal and drives higher engagement. However, making this happen behind the scenes involves working with large quantities of data and overcoming obstacles every step of the way.Netflix uses Spark to power content personalization. While the company has existing models in production, it always is testing new models and hypotheses to improve on existing ones. However, every new model needs to be tested against an older model and should be proven to be better before being implemented. Netflix does this model testing offline rather than online in the live app. The company makes a copy of historical data and performs offline feature generation on this data. The features are stored in a Hive store in AWS S3, and subsequent feature generation and model training is done in Spark. Once a new model is ready, it is run in parallel with a live model and, if it performs better, it is deployed.Key to the success of this operation is the logging of historical facts from online to offline. This includes Netflix-specific facts such as video, user and computation facts. Once this historical data is stored, a data worker is able to run simulation tests against it using the newly developed models. These simulation tests are a great way to test models without breaking things and save time by failing fast. Once tested and compared with live models, Netflix goes on to establish different SLAs for different microservice apps that these models serve. All this effort results in a highly relevant recommendation engine and a very personalized experience for Netflix users.Airbnb: Tapping Into Related Data StoresAirbnb uses AI to improve the search rankings and relevance of its “AirBnB experiences” offering. The company started simply, only recording users’ daily searches, clicks and bookings. Soon, it created features on top of this raw data, including features such as experience duration, price of experience and user reviews, which would help build models. Airbnb used a ranking model to give weight to experiences that had a better conversion rate, better user reviews and a lower price than those with just a higher booking volume. This improved experience bookings by 13%.Going further, Airbnb tapped into the other user data it had—homes booked by Airbnb users—to further personalize the ranking of experiences. This is where things get interesting, as AirBnB is able to show experiences that are more likely to match a user’s interests. This is only possible by looking beyond a single data store and looking for relevant data that may exist elsewhere in the organization. This personalization further improved experience booking by 7.9%.Similar to Uber, Airbnb uses a combination of offline and online scoring for models. While the historical data is great to get started with and run basic simulation tests, online scoring unlocks additional features such as user location, search filters and login status that wouldn’t otherwise be available offline.ConclusionAI is changing everything, and DataOps is no exception. By helping companies to make sense of their data more quickly and with less reliance on human effort, AI drives faster, more consistent results.The good news for most of us is you don’t need to be a major tech company such as Uber, Netflix or Airbnb to take advantage of AI-driven DataOps. Tools such as Unravel are making AI-powered data insights practical for organizations everywhere, without requiring them to build bespoke DataOps solutions.This sponsored article was written on behalf of Unravel.— Twain Taylor

Britain Honors Computer Scientist Alan Turing As The Face of Their New Bank Note

Humans16 July 2019By Karla Adam, The Washington Post 

 
(Public Domain) 



Alan Turing, a founding father of computer science and artificial intelligence, was revealed Monday as the face of Britain's new 50-pound bank note.Turing was also famed as a World War II codebreaker whose work was widely credited with hastening the end of the war and saving thousands of lives. But at the time, his achievements were overshadowed following his conviction of engaging in homosexual activity - then a criminal offense in Britain.



Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said that ""as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, as well as [a] war hero, Alan Turing's contributions were far-ranging and pathbreaking."" He called Turing ""a giant on whose shoulders so many now stand.""



Carney made the announcement Monday at Manchester's Science and Industry Museum, which will also feature an exhibition of the 12 finalists who were considered for the note, including theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking.



During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, where he helped to develop a machine that cracked the Enigma code used by Nazi Germany.



His work also laid the groundwork for the modern computer and artificial intelligence. His famous ""Turing test"" is still used as a benchmark for examining whether a machine can be considered to be thinking.



After the war, Turing pleaded guilty to a charge of ""indecency"" related to his homosexuality and was sentenced to chemical castration. In 1954 - at age 41 - he died after apparently poisoning himself with cyanide. A bitten apple was found by his bedside.



British Prime Minister Theresa May tweeted Monday that Turing's ""pioneering work"" played a ""crucial part"" in ending World War II. ""It is only fitting that we remember his legacy and the brilliant contribution LGBT people have made to our country"" on the new 50-pound note, she wrote.



Dermot Turing, Alan Turing's nephew, said in an emailed statement that the entire family was ""delighted."" He also praised the Bank of England for focusing on his uncle's work in computer development and computer science.



""It reminds us that this was what he was best known for during his own lifetime and - I think - what he would most wish to be remembered for today,"" he said.The Oscar-winning 2014 biopic ""The Imitation Game,"" starring Benedict Cumberbatch, brought further attention to the complex math genius and his team's role in the defeat of Adolf Hitler. On Monday, Cumberbatch told the BBC that he ""couldn't think of a more deserving candidate."" Turing was an ""extraordinary human being, a unique mind, and he suffered a great deal in an intolerant time,"" he said.



Kim Sanders, a spokeswoman for Stonewall, a gay rights charity, said in a statement: ""It's important that we remember and recognize the impact of LGBT figures throughout history, so it's great that Alan Turing will be the face on the new £50 bank note. It's vital that we celebrate LGBT history, which is often less visible, and make sure that we represent the diversity of those who paved the way before us.""



She added: ""The world we live in now is very different to Turing's time, and LGBT rights have come a long way. But the fight for true equality is far from over.""



In 2013, after a lengthy campaign, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a royal pardon for his ""crime"" of homosexuality. In 2017, under legislation that became known as ""Turing's law,"" Britain granted pardons to thousands of gay and bisexual men who were convicted of offenses related to their sexuality.



The new note, expected to enter circulation at the end of 2021, will include an image of Turing, ticker tape of his birth date in binary code, and a table and formula from a 1936 paper that introduced the concept of how computers could operate.



It will also include a quote from Turing about the ascent of computers, given to the Times of London newspaper in 1949 but perhaps just as apt today: ""This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be.""

Researchers set out to detect bias in AI using an AI tool and found it. (NicoElNino/iStockPhoto)
Researchers have developed a tool using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect unfair bias in protected areas such as race or gender. The tool could be used in finding bias in AI systems or even bias by human decisions makers, according to the researchers at Penn State and Columbia University.“Artificial intelligence systems—such as those involved in selecting candidates for a job or for admission to a university—are trained on large amounts of data, but if these data are biased, they can affect the recommendations of the AI systems,” said Vasant Honavar, professor of information sciences and technology at Penn State in a statement.If a company has never hired a woman for a particular job, an AI system trained on such historical data wouldn’t likely recommend a woman for a new job at the company.Honavar said in that example that there would be nothing wrong with the machine learning in the software program itself. “It’s doing what it’s supposed to do, which is to identify good job candidates…but since it was training on historical, biased data it has the potential to make unfair recommendations.”The researchers created an AI tool to detect bias by human or AI systems that is based on causality, or cause and effect.The question, “Is there gender-based discrimination in salaries?” can be restated as “Does gender have a causal effect on salary?” or “Would a woman be paid more if she was a man?” To know that answer directly, the researchers used counterfactual inference algorithms to arrive at a best guess. One way of arriving at a best guess for a fair salary for a female would be to find a male with similar qualifications, productivity and experience. “We can minimize gender-based discrimination in salary if we ensure that similar men and women receive similar salaries,” said Aria Khademi, a grad student in information sciences and technology at Penn State.Researchers used income data from the U.S. Census Bureau to spot gender-based discrimination in salaries and New York City police department data for findings of bias against people of color arrested after stop-and-frisk arrests. With incomes, the teams used data on 50,000 people and found evidence of gender discrimination in salary, specifically that the odds of a woman having a salary greater than $50,000 a year is only one-third that of a man. For the possible racial bias, the researchers revealed evidence of possible racial bias against Hispanics and African-Americans, but found no evidence of discrimination against them on average as a group.Honavar said the tool the researchers built can help organizations avoid becoming instruments of discrimination and threats to unfairness. “You cannot correct for a problem if you don’t know that the problem exists…Our tool can help with that,” he said. The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation.RELATED: ""AI chips advance with Intel's Pohoiki Beach""

Preventing unfair treatment of individuals on the basis of race, gender or ethnicity, for example, has been a long-standing concern of civilised societies.   However, detecting such discrimination resulting from decisions, whether by human decision makers or automated AI systems, can be extremely challenging.   'Artificial intelligence systems—such as those involved in selecting candidates for a job or for admission to a university—are trained on large amounts of data,' said Vasant Honavar, a professor at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in the US.   'But if these data are biased, they can affect the recommendations of AI systems,' Honavar said.

The researchers tested their method using various types of available data, such as income data from the US Census Bureau to determine whether there is gender-based discrimination in salaries.   They also tested their method using the New York City Police Department's stop-and-frisk programme data to determine whether there is discrimination against people of colour in arrests made after stops.   'We analysed an adult income data set containing salary, demographic and employment-related information for close to 50,000 individuals,' said Honavar.   'We found evidence of gender-based discrimination in salary. Specifically, we found that the odds of a woman having a salary greater than USD 50,000 per year is only one-third that for a man.   'This would suggest that employers should look for and correct, when appropriate, gender bias in salaries,' he said.   Although the team's analysis of the New York stop-and-frisk dataset—which contains demographic and other information about drivers stopped by the New York City police force—revealed evidence of possible racial bias against Hispanics and African American individuals, it found no evidence of discrimination against them on average as a group.   'You cannot correct for a problem if you don't know that the problem exists,' said Honavar.   'To avoid discrimination on the basis of race, gender or other attributes you need effective tools for detecting discrimination. Our tool can help with that,' he said. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How advanced is AI today? 











Facial and emotional recognition; how one man is advancing artificial intelligence
12:54

Despite what you hear about artificial intelligence, machines still can't think like a human, but in the last few years they have become capable of learning. And suddenly, our devices have opened their eyes and ears and cars have taken the wheel. Today, artificial intelligence is not as good as you hope and not as bad as you fear, but humanity is accelerating into a future that few can predict. That's why so many people are desperate to meet Kai-Fu Lee, the oracle of AI.Kai-Fu Lee is in there, somewhere, in a selfie scrum at a Beijing Internet Conference. His 50 million social media followers want to be seen in the same frame because of his talent for engineering and genius for wealth.60 Minutes Overtime: China's greatest natural resource may be its dataScott Pelley:  I wonder, do you think people around the world have any idea what's coming in artificial intelligence? 






Kai-Fu Lee: I think most people have no idea, and many people have the wrong idea.Scott Pelley: But you do believe it's going to change the world?


Kai-Fu Lee: I believe it's going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. More than electricity.Lee believes the best place to be an AI capitalist is communist China. His Beijing venture capital firm manufactures billionaires.
Kai-Fu Lee in a scrum of selfie seekers
Kai-Fu Lee: These are the entrepreneurs that we have funded.He's funded more than 50 AI start-ups.


Kai-Fu Lee: We have about ten billion-dollar-companies here.Scott Pelley: Ten, $1 billion-companies that you funded?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes, including a few $10 billion-companies.In 2017, China attracted half of all AI capital in the world. One of Lee's investments is Face++, not affiliated with Facebook. Its visual recognition system smothered me to guess my age. It settled on 61 which was wrong. I wouldn't be 61 for days. On the street, Face++ nailed everything that moved. It's a kind of artificial intelligence that has been made possible by three innovations: super fast computer chips, all the world's data now available online, and a revolution in programming called ""deep learning."" Computers used to be given rigid instructions. Now they're programmed to learn on their own.Kai-Fu Lee: In early days of AI, people try to program the AI with how people think. So, I would write a program to say, ""Measure the size of the eyes and their distance. Measure the size of the nose. Measure the shape of the face. And then, if these things match, then this is Larry and that's John."" But today, you just take all the pictures of Larry and John and you tell the system, ""Go at it. You figure out what separates Larry from John.""Let's say you want the computer to be able to pick men out of a crowd and describe their clothing? Well, you simply show the computer ten million pictures of men in various kinds of dress. That's what they mean by deep learning. It's not intelligence so much. It's just the brute force of data having ten million examples to choose from.So, Face++ tagged me as male, short hair, black long sleeves, black long pants. It's wrong about my gray suit and this is exactly how it learns. When engineers discover that error, they'll show the computer a million gray suits and it won't make that mistake again. 


Another recognition system we saw, or saw us, is learning not just who you are but how you feel.Scott Pelley: Now what are all the dots on the screen? The dots over our eyes and our mouths?Songfan Yang: The computer keeps track of all the feature points on the face.Songfan Yang developed this for TAL Education Group, which tutors 5 million Chinese students. 

Scott Pelley: Well let's look at what we are seeing here now. According to the computer, I'm confused, which is generally the case. But when I laughed I was happy. That's amazing.Songfan Yang: Exactly.The machine notices concentration or distraction to pick out for the teacher those students who are struggling or gifted.


Scott Pelley: It can tell when the child is excited about math?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes.Scott Pelley: Or the other child is excited about poetry?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes. Scott Pelley: Could these AI systems pick out geniuses from the countryside?Kai-Fu Lee: That's possible in the future. It can also create a student profile and know where the student got stuck so the teacher can personalize the areas in which the student needs help.""AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.""We found Kai-Fu Lee's personal passion in this spare Beijing studio. He's projecting top teachers into China's poorest schools. This English teacher is connected to a class 1,000 miles away in a village called Duh-Fang.


Many students in Duh-Fang are called 'left behinds' because their parents left them with family when they moved to the cities for work. Most 'left behinds' don't get past ninth grade. Lee is counting on AI to deliver for them the same opportunity he had when he immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a boy.Kai-Fu Lee: When I arrived in Tennessee, my principal took every lunch to teach me English. And that is the kind of attention that I've not been used to growing up in Asia. And I felt that the American classrooms are smaller, encouraged individual thinking, critical thinking. And I felt it was the best thing that ever happened to me.And, 'the best thing that ever happened' to most of the engineers we met at Lee's firm – they too are alumni of America – with a dream for China.

Scott Pelley: You have written that Silicon Valley's edge is not all it's cracked up to be. What do you mean by that?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, Silicon Valley has been the single epicenter of the world technology innovation when it comes to computers, internet, mobile and AI. But in the recent five years, we are seeing that Chinese AI is getting to be almost as good as Silicon Valley AI. And I think Silicon Valley is not quite aware of it yet.China's advantage is in the amount of data it collects. The more data, the better the AI. Just like the more you know, the smarter you are. China has four times more people than the United States who are doing nearly everything online.Scott Pelley: I just don't see any Chinese without a phone in their hand.


College student Monica Sun showed us how more than a billion chinese are using their phones to buy everything, find anything and connect with everyone. In America, when personal information leaks, we have congressional hearings. Not in China.Scott Pelley: Do you ever worry about the information that's being collected about you where you go what you buy who you're with?Monica Sun: I never think about it.Scott Pelley: Do you think most Chinese worry about their privacy?Monica Sun: Not that much.Scott Pelley: Not that much.With a pliant public, the leader of the Communist Party has made a national priority of achieving AI dominance in ten years. This is where Kai-Fu Lee becomes uncharacteristically shy. Even though he's a former Apple, Microsoft and Google executive, he knows who's boss in China. 






Why China is the ""Saudi Arabia"" of data
01:30

Scott Pelley: President Xi has called technology the sharp weapon of the modern state. What does he mean by that?


Kai-Fu Lee: I am not an expert in interpreting his thoughts. I don't know.Scott Pelley: There are those, particularly people in the west who worry about this AI technology as being something that governments will use to control their people and to crush dissent.Kai-Fu Lee: As a venture capitalist, we don't invest in this area, and we're not studying deeply this particular problem.Scott Pelley: But governments do.Kai-Fu Lee: It's certainly possible for governments to use the technologies, just like companies.Lee is much more talkative about another threat posed by AI. He explores the coming destruction of jobs in his latest book, ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order.""Kai-Fu Lee: AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.


Scott Pelley: What sort of jobs would be lost to AI?Kai-Fu Lee: Basically chauffeurs, truck drivers anyone who does driving for a living their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 20 year time frame and many jobs that seem a little bit complex, chef, waiter, a lot of things will become automated we'll have automated stores, automated restaurants, and all together in 15 years, that's going to displace about 40% of the jobs in the world.Scott Pelley: 40% of the jobs in the world will be displaced by technology?Kai-Fu Lee: I would say displaceable.Scott Pelley: What does that do to the fabric of society?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, in some sense there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technology revolutions. The invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. And we've gotten over it. The challenge of AI is this 40%, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions.

There's a lot of hype about artificial intelligence, and it's important to understand this is not general intelligence like that of a human. This system can read faces and grade papers but it has no idea why these children are in this room or what the goal of education is. A typical AI system can do one thing well, but can't adapt what it knows to any other task. So for now, it may be that calling this ""intelligence,"" isn't very smart.


Scott Pelley: When will we know that a machine can actually think like a human?Kai-Fu Lee: Back when I was a grad student, people said, ""If machine can drive a car by itself, that's intelligence."" Now we say that's not enough. So, the bar keeps moving higher. I think that's, I guess, more motivation for us to work harder. But if you're talking about AGI, artificial general intelligence, I would say not within the next 30 years, and possibly never.Scott Pelley: Possibly never? What's so insurmountable?Kai-Fu Lee: Because I believe in the sanctity of our soul. I believe there is a lot of things about us that we don't understand. I believe there's a lot of love and compassion that is not explainable in terms of neural networks and computation algorithms. And I currently see no way of solving them. Obviously, unsolved problems have been solved in the past. But it would be irresponsible for me to predict that these will be solved by a certain timeframe.Scott Pelley: We may just be more than our bits?Kai-Fu Lee: We may.Produced by Guy Campanile and Andrew Bast

And suddenly, our devices have opened their eyes and ears and cars have taken the wheel. Today, artificial intelligence is not as good as you hope and not as bad as you fear, but humanity is accelerating into a future that few can predict. That's why so many people are desperate to meet Kai-Fu Lee, the oracle of AI.Kai-Fu Lee is in there, somewhere, in a selfie scrum at a Beijing Internet Conference. His 50 million social media followers want to be seen in the same frame because of his talent for engineering and genius for wealth.60 Minutes Overtime: China's greatest natural resource may be its dataScott Pelley:  I wonder, do you think people around the world have any idea what's coming in artificial intelligence?Kai-Fu Lee: I think most people have no idea, and many people have the wrong idea.Scott Pelley: But you do believe it's going to change the world?Kai-Fu Lee: I believe it's going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. More than electricity.Lee believes the best place to be an AI capitalist is communist China. His Beijing venture capital firm manufactures billionaires.Kai-Fu Lee: These are the entrepreneurs that we have funded.He's funded more than 50 AI start-ups.Kai-Fu Lee: We have about ten billion-dollar-companies here.Scott Pelley: Ten, $1 billion-companies that you funded?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes, including a few $10 billion-companies.In 2017, China attracted half of all AI capital in the world. One of Lee's investments is Face++, not affiliated with Facebook. Its visual recognition system smothered me to guess my age. It settled on 61 which was wrong. I wouldn't be 61 for days. On the street, Face++ nailed everything that moved. It's a kind of artificial intelligence that has been made possible by three innovations: super fast computer chips, all the world's data now available online, and a revolution in programming called ""deep learning."" Computers used to be given rigid instructions. Now they're programmed to learn on their own.Kai-Fu Lee: In early days of AI, people try to program the AI with how people think. So, I would write a program to say, ""Measure the size of the eyes and their distance. Measure the size of the nose. Measure the shape of the face. And then, if these things match, then this is Larry and that's John."" But today, you just take all the pictures of Larry and John and you tell the system, ""Go at it. You figure out what separates Larry from John.""Let's say you want the computer to be able to pick men out of a crowd and describe their clothing? Well, you simply show the computer ten million pictures of men in various kinds of dress. That's what they mean by deep learning. It's not intelligence so much. It's just the brute force of data having ten million examples to choose from.So, Face++ tagged me as male, short hair, black long sleeves, black long pants. It's wrong about my gray suit and this is exactly how it learns. When engineers discover that error, they'll show the computer a million gray suits and it won't make that mistake again. Another recognition system we saw, or saw us, is learning not just who you are but how you feel.Scott Pelley: Now what are all the dots on the screen? The dots over our eyes and our mouths?Songfan Yang: The computer keeps track of all the feature points on the face.Songfan Yang developed this for TAL Education Group, which tutors 5 million Chinese students. Scott Pelley: Well let's look at what we are seeing here now. According to the computer, I'm confused, which is generally the case. But when I laughed I was happy. That's amazing.Songfan Yang: Exactly.The machine notices concentration or distraction to pick out for the teacher those students who are struggling or gifted.Scott Pelley: It can tell when the child is excited about math?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes.Scott Pelley: Or the other child is excited about poetry?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes. Scott Pelley: Could these AI systems pick out geniuses from the countryside?Kai-Fu Lee: That's possible in the future. It can also create a student profile and know where the student got stuck so the teacher can personalize the areas in which the student needs help.""AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.""We found Kai-Fu Lee's personal passion in this spare Beijing studio. He's projecting top teachers into China's poorest schools. This English teacher is connected to a class 1,000 miles away in a village called Duh-Fang.Many students in Duh-Fang are called 'left behinds' because their parents left them with family when they moved to the cities for work. Most 'left behinds' don't get past ninth grade. Lee is counting on AI to deliver for them the same opportunity he had when he immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a boy.Kai-Fu Lee: When I arrived in Tennessee, my principal took every lunch to teach me English. And that is the kind of attention that I've not been used to growing up in Asia. And I felt that the American classrooms are smaller, encouraged individual thinking, critical thinking. And I felt it was the best thing that ever happened to me.And, 'the best thing that ever happened' to most of the engineers we met at Lee's firm – they too are alumni of America – with a dream for China.Scott Pelley: You have written that Silicon Valley's edge is not all it's cracked up to be. What do you mean by that?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, Silicon Valley has been the single epicenter of the world technology innovation when it comes to computers, internet, mobile and AI. But in the recent five years, we are seeing that Chinese AI is getting to be almost as good as Silicon Valley AI. And I think Silicon Valley is not quite aware of it yet.China's advantage is in the amount of data it collects. The more data, the better the AI. Just like the more you know, the smarter you are. China has four times more people than the United States who are doing nearly everything online.Scott Pelley: I just don't see any Chinese without a phone in their hand.College student Monica Sun showed us how more than a billion chinese are using their phones to buy everything, find anything and connect with everyone. In America, when personal information leaks, we have congressional hearings. Not in China.Scott Pelley: Do you ever worry about the information that's being collected about you where you go what you buy who you're with?Monica Sun: I never think about it.Scott Pelley: Do you think most Chinese worry about their privacy?Monica Sun: Not that much.Scott Pelley: Not that much.With a pliant public, the leader of the Communist Party has made a national priority of achieving AI dominance in ten years. This is where Kai-Fu Lee becomes uncharacteristically shy. Even though he's a former Apple, Microsoft and Google executive, he knows who's boss in China. Scott Pelley: President Xi has called technology the sharp weapon of the modern state. What does he mean by that?Kai-Fu Lee: I am not an expert in interpreting his thoughts. I don't know.Scott Pelley: There are those, particularly people in the west who worry about this AI technology as being something that governments will use to control their people and to crush dissent.Kai-Fu Lee: As a venture capitalist, we don't invest in this area, and we're not studying deeply this particular problem.Scott Pelley: But governments do.Kai-Fu Lee: It's certainly possible for governments to use the technologies, just like companies.Lee is much more talkative about another threat posed by AI. He explores the coming destruction of jobs in his latest book, ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order.""Kai-Fu Lee: AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.Scott Pelley: What sort of jobs would be lost to AI?Kai-Fu Lee: Basically chauffeurs, truck drivers anyone who does driving for a living their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 20 year time frame and many jobs that seem a little bit complex, chef, waiter, a lot of things will become automated we'll have automated stores, automated restaurants, and all together in 15 years, that's going to displace about 40% of the jobs in the world.Scott Pelley: 40% of the jobs in the world will be displaced by technology?Kai-Fu Lee: I would say displaceable.Scott Pelley: What does that do to the fabric of society?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, in some sense there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technology revolutions.
