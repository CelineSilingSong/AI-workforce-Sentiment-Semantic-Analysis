We’ve been hearing for years the warning that a robot might take over our job. More recently, a report by Goldman Sachs suggested that artificial intelligence (AI) could replace a staggering 300 million full time jobs. Yet for many people, work has seemed to mostly chug along as normal.


Is it all just hype? Or are we finally hitting the inflection point with recent advances in AI? And will AI replace us, or actually make us better and faster at what we do?

I sat down with leading experts and investors to get their take on how AI will change the future of work. These soundbites paint a good picture of how they perceive AI affecting our jobs, and where they see the biggest opportunities ahead.

#1: Expect a role reversal: we'll soon be the ones assisting machines, not vice versa

“I believe we will see a paradigm shift from machines assisting humans to humans assisting machines in the next decade.”
PROMOTED
Joanne Chen, General Partner at Foundation Capital
#2: AI's impact will be as big as the Industrial Revolution, empowering one to do the work of many
“AI is a force multiplier for human intelligence and productivity. Like the Industrial Revolution brought with machines and factories, AI is a means of production that will empower one to do the work of many. It’s hard to imagine change on that scale, yet it’s likely bigger than what we anticipate. AI won’t just boost efficiency for coding, marketing, legal or healthcare admin work — but entirely evolve how businesses and organizations of all types are built and run.”

“As investors, we see the potential for AI to automate, personalize and fine-tune thousands of processes in industries as widespread as healthcare, education, infrastructure and professional services.”

#4: White collar job functions, from coding to financial services to legal, will become vastly more efficient
“Job functions are already starting to profoundly change with the adoption of AI. One million developers already use Github copilot to generate code, forever altering the code creation process. In areas like financial services and legal, the days of manual research are numbered as the collaboration between professionals and AI-native applications will streamline (and in some cases eliminate) job functions to create previously unimaginable efficiencies.”
Lars Albright, General Partner at Unusual Ventures
#5: AI is already reducing the number of junior and mid-level software developers needed to ship new products
""One immediate impact of large language models (LLMs) is that they are significantly reducing the number of software developers needed to build and ship new digital products. My own portfolio startups are replacing coders with co-pilots. Although they still very much rely on their generals (such as chief technology officers and heads of AI), they are finding they need fewer and fewer soldiers (such as coders and data scientists).""
John Spindler, General Partner at Twin Path Ventures
#6: As GenAI disrupts traditional roles, professionals will lean on AI-powered peer-to-peer channels to learn, up-skill and navigate new career paths.
""Generative AI will accelerate personalized and applied learning both inside and outside of the workplace. As courses and books become quickly outdated, so will linear career pathways, giving way to a surge in both machine-driven and peer-to-peer learning. Similar to how YouTube, Instagram and TikTok leveraged the rise of smartphones and allowed people to share their lives through stories, we think that learning and upskilling will evolve as a result of GenAI.
Dinika Mahtani, Principal at Cherry Ventures
#7: AI transforms the way organizations make critical decisions
“AI is radically changing the way in which organizations make critical decisions. It powers simulations that feed insights and proposals into commercial decisions like exploring pricing schemes, operational ones like optimizing routing and logistics and even those in more complex domains like finding design and engineering solutions to a detailed brief. Increasingly AI can fully make and automate these decisions, such as with autonomous commercial negotiations or closed-loop manufacturing optimization systems.
Longer term, I see an opportunity for complete digital representations of business with sophisticated AIs that can make decisions on these. Imagine being able to “hire” an AI COO — or even a fully “autonomous business” that generates profit without requiring any input at all.”
Ben Blume, Partner at Atomico
#8: The category-defining AI businesses will be the ones with defensibility and distribution
“Historically, we have seen that for software startups, ease of use or proprietary data alone are not enough to build a category-leading business. The same is true with AI. Founders must look for defensibility and distribution, in addition to the many avenues for value creation enabled by AI.
Defensibility in AI can be elusive when core models are not proprietary and open-source models haven’t sufficiently matured. Implementing features that incentivize user interaction and lead to data generation is one way to create data network effects.”
Parul Singh, Partner at Initialized Capital
#9: The infrastructure and research layer of generative AI is where the sustainable business models lie
""Generative AI is going to usher in massive productivity gains and improved cost structures for businesses of all types. Employees will be not only dramatically more effective and productive, but also freed to achieve new levels of creativity and innovation.
The question in my mind is how to help companies attain these benefits in a cost-effective manner, given the extraordinarily high costs involved in training and running today’s AI models. That’s why I’m focusing my energies on the infrastructure and research layer of generative AI. This area will be the key to shifting AI from hype to reality as it unlocks new, sustainable business models that positively transform the world of work for both employers and employees alike.""
Jill Chase, Partner at CapitalG
#10: AI is making it harder than ever to identify substance amidst all the noise
“Great innovation can be obtained by these disruptor trends (AI machine learning, automation, etc.). The newest generation of large language models have advanced so quickly, but as an investor, it will become increasingly important to navigate through the noise and identify substance. We are excited about tech solutions that introduce automation, but also hybrid solutions that can accelerate productivity globally for organizations to grow in a sustainable manner.”
Wilfred Fianko, General Partner at Cornerstone VC
#11: Large language models are not just hype
""It is apparent to everyone that large language models are a once-in-a-generation technology. Any startup or VC that believes they are just hype, and therefore can be ignored, has their head in the sand.""
John Spindler, General Partner at Twin Path Ventures
#12: AI will impact our day-to-day work, first gradually, and then suddenly
“In the 1920s, Ernest Hemingway coined a now-iconic term for how one goes bankrupt: first gradually, then suddenly. The same is true of how technology disrupts work. Jobs don't disappear overnight. First there's a slow culling, with intermediate steps like offshoring. Eventually technology reaches enough maturity, and business processes change sufficiently, resulting in a rapid decline. We've seen this transition with back-office work, and we're about to see it in even more unexpected areas like software development.”
Ramy Adeeb, Founder & General Partner at 1984 Ventures

Twelve hot-takes on AI that all point in the same direction. We may not all be out of a job tomorrow — or ever — but the entire world of work will evolve due to the current tipping point we’re experiencing, as well as future AI advancements, of which there are sure to be many.
Personally, I have yet to meet someone whose job has been replaced by AI. But almost everyone I speak with has been touched by it in some way recently. Particularly for knowledge workers, it’s time to embrace the potential inherent in AI.

Accounting professionals ‘cautiously optimistic’ about generative AI

Thomson Reuters has published new research on generative AI that gauged the sentiment of professionals across legal, tax, and accounting firms in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The research sought to better understand how the technology is perceived and applied within the professional services industry. The report uncovered a mix of optimism and caution in the adoption of generative AI. 
Commenting on this, Thomson Reuters president and CEO, Steve Hasker, said: “Generative AI has the capacity to disrupt and redefine the professional landscape, but it is clear from our findings that there is a trust gap with professionals.
“The future of professional work is set to be revolutionised by generative AI, and as an industry, we need to work together to find the right balance between the benefits of technology and any unintended consequences. We believe this will help our customers to first trust the transformative power of generative AI, and then harness the opportunity to shape the future of their professions.” 
Amongst the professionals surveyed, the potential of generative AI is undeniably recognised; 78% of respondents believe generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can enhance legal or accounting work, with the proportion slightly higher for legal (82%) than for tax (73%). Furthermore, about half (52%) of all respondents believe that generative AI should be used for legal and tax work.  
However, despite the research sharing strong feelings about generative AI’s potential utility, many within the legal and tax fields are still weighing their options before adopting the technology. Only 4% of respondents are currently using generative AI in their operations, with an additional 5% planning to do so. Interestingly, tax and accounting firms are more open to the idea, with a 15% adoption or planned adoption rate. 
Among those who have adopted or are planning to adopt generative AI technologies, research was the primary use case cited by respondents; about two-thirds of those in corporate legal and 80% of those in tax identified it as the most compelling use. Knowledge management, back-office functions, and question answering services were also cited as use cases of interest.

Risk perception seems to be the major stumbling block in the adoption of generative AI tools. A significant 69% of respondents expressed risk concerns, suggesting that fear may be holding back a more widespread adoption. While the potential of generative AI tools is recognised, there is an air of uncertainty, underlining the need for establishing trust, as well as furthering education and strategic planning in its implementation. 
Despite concerns around the risks to privacy, security, and accuracy, very few organisations are actively taking steps to limit the use of generative AI among employees. Twenty percent of respondents said their firm or company has warned employees against the unauthorised use of generative AI at work. Only 9% of all respondents, meanwhile, reported their organisation had banned the unauthorised use of generative AI.

As organizations increase their use of artificial intelligence technologies within their operations, they're reaping tangible benefits that are expected to deliver significant financial value.







Eighty-seven percent of organizations believe AI and machine learning will help them grow revenue, boost operational efficiency and improve customer experiences, according to research firm Frost & Sullivan's ""Global State of AI, 2022"" report.
Those are only a few of the benefits AI can deliver.
Here are 12 advantages the technology brings to organizations across various industry sectors.

1. Better decisions
Organizations increasingly use AI to gain insights into their data or, in the business lingo of today, to make ""data-driven decisions."" As they do that, they're finding they do indeed make better, more accurate decisions instead of ones based on individual instincts or intuition tainted by personal biases and preferences.
As an example, Kavita Ganesan, an AI adviser, strategist and founder of the consultancy Opinosis Analytics, pointed to one company that used AI to help it sort through the survey responses of its 42,000 employees. The technology analyzed narrative responses and presented summarized findings -- an approach that let company officials effectively understand what workers wanted most rather than offering them options to rank via check-the-box choices.

2. Efficiency and productivity gains
Efficiency and productivity gains are two other big benefits that organizations get from using AI, said Adnan Masood, chief AI architect at UST, a digital transformation solutions company.
Masood said AI lets organizations handle tasks at a volume and velocity that's simply not possible for humans to match -- whether they're using AI for search or to analyze data for insights, create software code or execute specific business processes.
AI not only works at a scale beyond human capacity, Masood noted, but it removes time-consuming manual tasks from workers -- a productivity gain that lets workers perform higher-level tasks that only humans can do. He pointed to the use of AI in software development as a case in point, highlighting the fact that AI can create test data to check code, freeing up developers to focus on more engaging work.
This lets organizations minimize the costs associated with performing mundane, repeatable tasks that can be performed by technology while maximizing the talent of their human capital.



Here are the key benefits AI brings to businesses.







3. Improved speed of business
As fast as business moves in this digital age, AI helps it move even faster, said Seth Earley, author of The AI-Powered Enterprise and CEO of Earley Information Science. ""It's all about speeding up the clock of the enterprise,"" he said. AI essentially enables shorter cycles and cuts the time it takes to move from one stage to the next -- such as from design to commercialization -- and that shortened timeline, in turn, delivers better and more immediate ROI.


4. New capabilities and business model expansion
Executives can use AI for business model expansion, experts said, noting that organizations are seeing new opportunities as they deploy data, analytics and intelligence into the enterprise.
For example, autonomous vehicle companies could use the reams of data they're collecting to identify new revenue streams related to insurance, while an insurance company could apply AI to its vast data stores to get into fleet management.


5. Personalized customer services and experiences
AI analyzes and learns from data to create highly personalized and customized experiences and services, said Brian Jackson, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group.
He said the most visible examples of this come from the consumer world, as streaming services, such as Netflix, and retailers use intelligent systems to study buying patterns, individual consumer data and larger data sets to determine what each customer prefers at any given time to suit their personal style, interests and needs.
However, AI delivers that personalization in numerous other areas, such as in healthcare, where it customizes treatments, and in work environments to support an employee's individual requirements.








6. Improved services
AI creates interactions with technology that are easier, more intuitive, more accurate and, thus, better all around, said Mike Mason, chief AI officer with consultancy Thoughtworks.
He cited a real estate site that employs generative AI so users can refine their property listing searches through conversational queries rather than clicking through boxes.
""The AI understands an unstructured query, and it understands unstructured data,"" Mason explained. In other words, the technology can analyze a user's request even when it's given in plain, conversational language; analyze all the descriptive elements within each listing, including narrative notes added by real estate agents; and present the user with a finely tuned and highly accurate list of properties that meets their requirements.


7. Improved monitoring
AI's capacity to take in and process massive amounts of data in real time means organizations can implement near-instantaneous monitoring capabilities to alert them to issues, recommend actions and, in some cases, initiate a response, according to experts.
For example, AI can use information gathered by devices on factory equipment to identify problems and predict needed maintenance. This prevents disruptive breakdowns and costly maintenance work performed because it's needed rather than scheduled.
AI's monitoring capabilities can be effective in other areas, such as in enterprise cybersecurity operations where large amounts of data need to be analyzed and understood.


8. Better quality and reduction of human error
Organizations can expect a reduction of errors and stronger adherence to established standards when they add AI technologies to processes. Furthermore, when AI and machine learning are integrated with a technology such as robotic process automation, which automates repetitive, rules-based tasks, the combination not only speeds up processes and reduces errors, but can also be trained to improve upon itself and take on broader tasks.
As a result of that error reducing and higher quality, ""AI improves the value prop[osition],"" Earley said.
The use of AI in financial reconciliation, for example, delivers nearly always error-free results, whereas that same reconciliation when handled, even in part, by human employees is prone to mistakes.

9. Better talent management
Companies are using AI to improve many aspects of talent management, from streamlining the hiring process to rooting out bias in corporate communications. Moreover, AI-enabled processes not only save companies in hiring costs, but also can affect workforce productivity by successfully sourcing, screening and identifying top-tier candidates. As natural language processing tools have improved, companies are also using chatbots to provide job candidates with a personalized experience and to mentor employees. Additionally, AI tools can gauge employee sentiment, identify and retain high performers, determine equitable pay, and deliver more personalized and engaging workplace experiences with less requirements on boring, repetitive tasks.


10. More innovation
As workers at all levels become more comfortable and confident working with AI, experts said they're starting to use AI tools to help them be more creative and more innovative.
In her book, Ganesan described how a restaurant chain used the technology to power a mobile app that enables customers to craft their own cocktails based on their mood and food choices, with the tool concocting the recipe and then sending it to a human bartender to mix and serve.
Other industries use AI to support R&D activities, such as in the healthcare space for drug discovery work and the consumer product goods sector for new product creation.


11. Increased profitability
As they use AI in more areas of the enterprise -- from personalizing services to aiding in risk management to supporting innovation -- organizations will see improved productivity, reduced costs, higher efficiency and possibly new growth opportunities.
Taken together, that can deliver higher profitability, said Sreekar Krishna, U.S. leader of AI at professional services firm KPMG. ""On the revenue side, it's potential is exponential: You can keep growing as long as you're bringing value to customers.""


12. Industry-specific improvements
In addition to the benefits listed above, AI can fuel the following industry-specific improvements:

Retailers can use AI to better target their marketing efforts, develop a more efficient supply chain and better calculate pricing for optimal returns. At retail companies, AI helps predict customer requirements and appropriate staffing levels.
The pharmaceutical sector can use the technology to perform drug discovery data analysis and predictions that can't be done with conventional technologies.
The financial industry can use AI to strengthen its fraud detection efforts.

It's important to remember that, as companies find ways to use AI for competitive advantage, they're also grappling with challenges. Concerns include AI bias, government regulation of AI, management of the data required for machine learning projects and talent shortages. In addition, financial gains can be elusive if the talent and infrastructure for implementing AI aren't in place.

Some were East Asian, a few were Indian, and a few were women. But the vast majority were white men. More than 5,500 people attended the meeting, five years ago in Barcelona, Spain.Timnit Gebru, then a graduate student at Stanford University, remembers counting only six Black people other than herself, all of whom she knew, all of whom were men.The homogeneous crowd crystallized for her a glaring issue. The big thinkers of tech say A.I. is the future. It will underpin everything from search engines and email to the software that drives our cars, directs the policing of our streets and helps create our vaccines.But it is being built in a way that replicates the biases of the almost entirely male, predominantly white work force making it.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn the nearly 10 years I’ve written about artificial intelligence, two things have remained a constant: The technology relentlessly improves in fits and sudden, great leaps forward. And bias is a thread that subtly weaves through that work in a way that tech companies are reluctant to acknowledge.On her first night home in Menlo Park, Calif., after the Barcelona conference, sitting cross-​legged on the couch with her laptop, Dr. Gebru described the A.I. work force conundrum in a Facebook post.“I’m not worried about machines taking over the world. I’m worried about groupthink, insularity and arrogance in the A.I. community — especially with the current hype and demand for people in the field,” she wrote. “The people creating the technology are a big part of the system. If many are actively excluded from its creation, this technology will benefit a few while harming a great many.”The A.I. community buzzed about the mini-manifesto. Soon after, Dr. Gebru helped create a new organization, Black in A.I. After finishing her Ph.D., she was hired by Google.She teamed with Margaret Mitchell, who was building a group inside Google dedicated to “ethical A.I.” Dr. Mitchell had previously worked in the research lab at Microsoft. She had grabbed attention when she told Bloomberg News in 2016 that A.I. suffered from a “sea of dudes” problem. She estimated that she had worked with hundreds of men over the previous five years and about 10 women.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTTheir work was hailed as groundbreaking. The nascent A.I. industry, it had become clear, needed minders and people with different perspectives.About six years ago, A.I. in a Google online photo service organized photos of Black people into a folder called “gorillas.” Four years ago, a researcher at a New York start-up noticed that the A.I. system she was working on was egregiously biased against Black people. Not long after, a Black researcher in Boston discovered that an A.I. system couldn’t identify her face — until she put on a white mask.In 2018, when I told Google’s public relations staff that I was working on a book about artificial intelligence, it arranged a long talk with Dr. Mitchell to discuss her work. As she described how she built the company’s Ethical A.I. team — and brought Dr. Gebru into the fold — it was refreshing to hear from someone so closely focused on the bias problem.But nearly three years later, Dr. Gebru was pushed out of the company without a clear explanation. She said she had been fired after criticizing Google’s approach to minority hiring and, with a research paper, highlighting the harmful biases in the A.I. systems that underpin Google’s search engine and other services.“Your life starts getting worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people,” Dr. Gebru said in an email before her firing. “You start making the other leaders upset.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAs Dr. Mitchell defended Dr. Gebru, the company removed her, too. She had searched through her own Google email account for material that would support their position and forwarded emails to another account, which somehow got her into trouble. Google declined to comment for this article.Their departure became a point of contention for A.I. researchers and other tech workers. Some saw a giant company no longer willing to listen, too eager to get technology out the door without considering its implications. I saw an old problem — part technological and part sociological — finally breaking into the open.80 Mistagged PhotosImageArtificial intelligence technology will eventually find its way into almost everything Google does.Credit...Cody O'Loughlin for The New York TimesIt should have been a wake-up call.In June 2015, a friend sent Jacky Alciné, a 22-year-old software engineer living in Brooklyn, an internet link for snapshots the friend had posted to the new Google Photos service. Google Photos could analyze snapshots and automatically sort them into digital folders based on what was pictured. One folder might be “dogs,” another “birthday party.”When Mr. Alciné clicked on the link, he noticed one of the folders was labeled “gorillas.” That made no sense to him, so he opened the folder. He found more than 80 photos he had taken nearly a year earlier of a friend during a concert in nearby Prospect Park. That friend was Black.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHe might have let it go if Google had mistakenly tagged just one photo. But 80? He posted a screenshot on Twitter. “Google Photos, y’all,” messed up, he wrote, using much saltier language. “My friend is not a gorilla.”Like facial recognition services, talking digital assistants and conversational “chatbots,” Google Photos relied on an A.I. system that learned its skills by analyzing enormous amounts of digital data.Called a “neural network,” this mathematical system could learn tasks that engineers could never code into a machine on their own. By analyzing thousands of photos of gorillas, it could learn to recognize a gorilla. It was also capable of egregious mistakes. The onus was on engineers to choose the right data when training these mathematical systems. (In this case, the easiest fix was to eliminate “gorilla” as a photo category.)As a software engineer, Mr. Alciné understood the problem. He compared it to making lasagna. “If you mess up the lasagna ingredients early, the whole thing is ruined,” he said. “It is the same thing with A.I. You have to be very intentional about what you put into it. Otherwise, it is very difficult to undo.”The Porn ProblemIn 2017, Deborah Raji, a 21-​year-​old Black woman from Ottawa, sat at a desk inside the New York offices of Clarifai, the start-up where she was working. The company built technology that could automatically recognize objects in digital images and planned to sell it to businesses, police departments and government agencies.She stared at a screen filled with faces — images the company used to train its facial recognition software.As she scrolled through page after page of these faces, she realized that most — more than 80 percent — were of white people. More than 70 percent of those white people were male. When Clarifai trained its system on this data, it might do a decent job of recognizing white people, Ms. Raji thought, but it would fail miserably with people of color, and probably women, too.ImageDeborah Raji realized that a company’s technology wasn’t getting the input it needed to properly recognize people of color.Credit...Jaime Hogge for The New York TimesClarifai was also building a “content moderation system,” a tool that could automatically identify and remove pornography from images people posted to social networks. The company trained this system on two sets of data: thousands of photos pulled from online pornography sites, and thousands of G‑rated images bought from stock photo services.The system was supposed to learn the difference between the pornographic and the anodyne. The problem was that the G‑rated images were dominated by white people, and the pornography was not. The system was learning to identify Black people as pornographic.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The data we use to train these systems matters,” Ms. Raji said. “We can’t just blindly pick our sources.”This was obvious to her, but to the rest of the company it was not. Because the people choosing the training data were mostly white men, they didn’t realize their data was biased.“The issue of bias in facial recognition technologies is an evolving and important topic,” Clarifai’s chief executive, Matt Zeiler, said in a statement. Measuring bias, he said, “is an important step.”‘Black Skin, White Masks’Before joining Google, Dr. Gebru collaborated on a study with a young computer scientist, Joy Buolamwini. A graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ms. Buolamwini, who is Black, came from a family of academics. Her grandfather specialized in medicinal chemistry, and so did her father.She gravitated toward facial recognition technology. Other researchers believed it was reaching maturity, but when she used it, she knew it wasn’t.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn October 2016, a friend invited her for a night out in Boston with several other women. “We’ll do masks,” the friend said. Her friend meant skin care masks at a spa, but Ms. Buolamwini assumed Halloween masks. So she carried a white plastic Halloween mask to her office that morning.It was still sitting on her desk a few days later as she struggled to finish a project for one of her classes. She was trying to get a detection system to track her face. No matter what she did, she couldn’t quite get it to work.In her frustration, she picked up the white mask from her desk and pulled it over her head. Before it was all the way on, the system recognized her face — or, at least, it recognized the mask.“Black Skin, White Masks,” she said in an interview, nodding to the 1952 critique of historical racism from the psychiatrist Frantz Fanon. “The metaphor becomes the truth. You have to fit a norm, and that norm is not you.”Ms. Buolamwini started exploring commercial services designed to analyze faces and identify characteristics like age and sex, including tools from Microsoft and IBM.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTShe found that when the services read photos of lighter-​skinned men, they misidentified sex about 1 percent of the time. But the darker the skin in the photo, the larger the error rate. It rose particularly high with images of women with dark skin. Microsoft’s error rate was about 21 percent. IBM’s was 35.Published in the winter of 2018, the study drove a backlash against facial recognition technology and, particularly, its use in law enforcement. Microsoft’s chief legal officer said the company had turned down sales to law enforcement when there was concern the technology could unreasonably infringe on people’s rights, and he made a public call for government regulation.Twelve months later, Microsoft backed a bill in Washington State that would require notices to be posted in public places using facial recognition and ensure that government agencies obtained a court order when looking for specific people. The bill passed, and it takes effect later this year. The company, which did not respond to a request for comment for this article, did not back other legislation that would have provided stronger protections.Ms. Buolamwini began to collaborate with Ms. Raji, who moved to M.I.T. They started testing facial recognition technology from a third American tech giant: Amazon. The company had started to market its technology to police departments and government agencies under the name Amazon Rekognition.Ms. Buolamwini and Ms. Raji published a study showing that an Amazon face service also had trouble identifying the sex of female and darker-​skinned faces. According to the study, the service mistook women for men 19 percent of the time and misidentified darker-​skinned women for men 31 percent of the time. For lighter-​skinned males, the error rate was zero.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAmazon called for government regulation of facial recognition. It also attacked the researchers in private emails and public blog posts.“The answer to anxieties over new technology is not to run ‘tests’ inconsistent with how the service is designed to be used, and to amplify the test’s false and misleading conclusions through the news media,” an Amazon executive, Matt Wood, wrote in a blog post that disputed the study and a New York Times article that described it.In an open letter, Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Gebru rejected Amazon’s argument and called on it to stop selling to law enforcement. The letter was signed by 25 artificial intelligence researchers from Google, Microsoft and academia.Last June, Amazon backed down. It announced that it would not let the police use its technology for at least a year, saying it wanted to give Congress time to create rules for the ethical use of the technology. Congress has yet to take up the issue. Amazon declined to comment for this article.The End at GoogleDr. Gebru and Dr. Mitchell had less success fighting for change inside their own company. Corporate gatekeepers at Google were heading them off with a new review system that had lawyers and even communications staff vetting research papers.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDr. Gebru’s dismissal in December stemmed, she said, from the company’s treatment of a research paper she wrote alongside six other researchers, including Dr. Mitchell and three others at Google. The paper discussed ways that a new type of language technology, including a system built by Google that underpins its search engine, can show bias against women and people of color.After she submitted the paper to an academic conference, Dr. Gebru said, a Google manager demanded that she either retract the paper or remove the names of Google employees. She said she would resign if the company could not tell her why it wanted her to retract the paper and answer other concerns.The response: Her resignation was accepted immediately, and Google revoked her access to company email and other services. A month later, it removed Dr. Mitchell’s access after she searched through her own email in an effort to defend Dr. Gebru.In a Google staff meeting last month, just after the company fired Dr. Mitchell, the head of the Google A.I. lab, Jeff Dean, said the company would create strict rules meant to limit its review of sensitive research papers. He also defended the reviews. He declined to discuss the details of Dr. Mitchell’s dismissal but said she had violated the company’s code of conduct and security policies.One of Mr. Dean’s new lieutenants, Zoubin Ghahramani, said the company must be willing to tackle hard issues. There are “uncomfortable things that responsible A.I. will inevitably bring up,” he said. “We need to be comfortable with that discomfort.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut it will be difficult for Google to regain trust — both inside the company and out.“They think they can get away with firing these people and it will not hurt them in the end, but they are absolutely shooting themselves in the foot,” said Alex Hanna, a longtime part of Google’s 10-member Ethical A.I. team. “What they have done is incredibly myopic.”Cade Metz is a technology correspondent at The Times and the author of “Genius Makers: The Mavericks Who Brought A.I. to Google, Facebook, and the World,” from which this article is adapted.Cade Metz is a technology reporter and the author of “Genius Makers: The Mavericks Who Brought A.I. to Google, Facebook, and The World.” He covers artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas.

BYOAI Is Here — Make The Right Moves To Benefit From Generative AI At Work 



John Brand, VP, Advisor                            

                                Anna Synakh                              


                        Jun 23 2023                      











 



Back in May, Samsung banned the use of generative AI platforms in the workplace after news of a security leak caused by misuse of ChatGPT. While employees did not revolt against the ban, chances are that many of the employees continued using AI. With generative AI solutions growing exponentially, it will be nearly impossible to limit employee usage — think back to the early days of mobile phones.
Over the past few years, many of you have been assessing generative AI at work and its potential in reducing company costs, enhancing efficiency, and improving overall performance. Most likely, you have adopted automated tools/AI to support your hiring process, like 99% of Fortune 500 companies. You are aware of the risks of implementing AI into your workspace but also see immense potential. What you may have missed while focusing on the big picture is the fact that your employees have desires to achieve the same goals at a personal level. They, too, strive to increase efficiency and to improve performance, and now they have (more) tools to do so.
An MIT study shows that using artificial intelligence can increase productivity by anywhere from 20% to 70%. And Forrester’s research shows that when employees see an opportunity to increase their own productivity, they will gladly take it, even if it goes against company procedures. The reality is simple: Your employees are using generative AI at work. They are using it in your corporate office. They are using it while working remotely. They are using it with or without your permission. BYOAI — or, “bring your own AI” — is already the reality, and it is now your job to help your company and employees optimize the value of AI while ensuring that it is being used safely and appropriately by putting guardrails, not stop signs, in place.
BYOAI has the potential to be one of your top opportunities this year, which is why Forrester is releasing two reports to help you navigate the issue. We released BYOAI: Policies And Guidelines Optimize AI Opportunities In The Enterprise today. This report will help you learn more about the challenges BYOAI may bring to your organization, how not to address them, and how to properly communicate new policies and procedures with your employees.
Also, look out for an upcoming report that will provide a deeper dive into the actual policies that you should consider implementing to maximize the benefits of BYOAI while minimizing the risks.
If you want to learn more, feel free to set up an analyst inquiry or guidance session.

Was that Pope Francis wearing a white puffer jacket inspired by luxury fashion brand Balenciaga? Did former President Donald Trump fall to the street while being arrested by police? The answer is no. Photos that appear to depict those events aren’t real; they are the product of generative artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, has existed for years. But generative AI, a subset of the field, recently has propelled the technology into public view. Generative AI has had the fastest acceptance and usage growth of any new technology, even surpassing the iPhone, said Tom Davenport, a Babson College information technology and management professor. Recent investment and advances in the technology have led to better-quality tools that can create realistic images from text prompts, or write a poem or essay on par with what humans can produce. Generative AI exploded onto the scene in late 2022 when OpenAI, a San Francisco-based tech company, released Dall-E, an image generator, and ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, that allowed anyone to use them to create art or text. Competitors responded in kind, flooding the market with similar products. The technology is likely to change the way we live and work, and it’s expected to transform a number of industries as companies incorporate it. Here’s what to know about generative AI and how it’s used. What is generative AI? Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that focuses on training computer systems to use a process or set of rules, called algorithms, to perform tasks normally performed by humans. We interact with the technology when using personal assistants like Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa, or when we see predictive text offered as we type a search query on Google. Generative AI  is a broad term that describes when computers create new content — such as text, photos, videos, music, code, audio and art — by identifying patterns in existing data. “It’s AI that creates new content based on past content. It predicts what is most likely to be next in a sequence of words or images or music or anything sequential using machine learning models,” Davenport said. How it works Several types of generative AI tools are in use today, including text-to-text generators such as ChatGPT, text-to-image generators such as Dall-E, and others used to generate code or audio. Valerie Wirtschafter, a senior data analyst in the Brookings Institution’s Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies Initiative, said most generative AI tasks rely on deep learning. That’s a method of artificial intelligence where computers are trained to use neural networks — a set of algorithms designed to mimic neurons in the human brain — to generate complex associations between patterns to create text, images or other content. There are different types of deep learning models used to train generative AI tools, but the most widely used are transformers and generative adversarial networks, known as GANs. Transformers, first described in a 2017 paper by Google researchers, are networks designed to more naturally process language. ChatGPT was built using a transformer-based large language model, a deep learning model trained on massive amounts of data. GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. Transformers are also used in other text creation software, including Google’s Bard. Davenport said transformers help AI better predict text in context, because they help identify the relationships between all the words in a sentence. For example, transformer-based models made it possible to distinguish between words that have more than one meaning, such as “bank,” based on the context in which they were used, he said. GANs, introduced in 2014, are mostly used for image and multimedia generation. They have two neural networks: a generator that creates an image based on data, and a discriminator that uses machine learning to predict whether the generated image is real or fake, said V.S. Subrahmanian, a Northwestern University computer science professor. The first one or two generated images may not be good, but the discriminator can easily determine they are fake. Subrahmanian said that with each failure, the generator learns from its mistakes and produces better, more realistic images. “Generative adversarial networks turned the scales,” Subrahmanian said, because they generate new realistic looking images and videos.   What’s behind the recent surge in interest? Although generative AI had been around for a while before its recent ascendence, the technology was in its infancy and its use was limited, Subrahmanian said. “The rise of generative AI is due to a trifecta of factors,” he said, including advances in deep learning such as generative adversarial networks; much more available data available to train models; and more powerful graphics processing unit computers that help accelerate the training. As a result, models can “generate high-quality images much faster than would have been otherwise possible,” he said. When companies such as OpenAI made products available to the general public, it was transformative, experts said. In September 2022, OpenAI made Dall-E 2 available to anyone, after initially offering it only to users on a waiting list that had grown to more than 1 million people. Competitors launched similar products, including Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. Interest spiked again in November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, allowing anyone to sign up for free to test it and provide feedback during a research preview. In April, the site had more than 206 million unique visitors, according to data analytics company Similarweb, which noted that growth had flattened since its initial launch. “It was really only when ChatGPT was announced in November that the rest of the world really woke up to it,” said Davenport. Helen Toner, director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said ChatGPT was a more accessible and better-behaved chatbot than most users had experienced, explaining the massive surge in public use. Along with 2022 improvements in image generation capabilities, the release of OpenAI’s latest language model “sparked the current wave of public interest,” Toner said. ChatGPT, Midjourney and Dall-E are among the most popular generative AI platforms in use, Subrahmanian said. ChatGPT and Dall-E were both created by OpenAI, while Midjourney comes from a research lab bearing the same name. Their rapid adoption has spurred an arms race, with several new companies and products seeking to enter the space. Who is using it, and what is its potential? “Generative AI has the power to help ordinary people overcome their weaknesses, and excel in ways they had not previously imagined,” Subrahmanian said. He cited examples such as:  A non-native English speaker who needs to write a report in English, writes it in her own words and then asks ChatGPT to rephrase it; An injured cartoonist could use an image generator to produce work in his style; A widow could use the technology to hear her deceased husband’s voice say, “I love you,” again.  Toner said large language models can be used for tasks including summarization, translation and chat, Toner said. Image generators can be used for video game design, graphic design and animation. “We are still in the early stages of exploring where these systems can and cannot be useful,” she said. Wirtschafter, of the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said the scope of use for text generators such as ChatGPT is vast across education and the workplace. Students and teachers are embracing it, and professionals can use it “as a means of generating new ideas and speeding up work,” she said. She described text generators as acting like “Google on steroids.” “People use it for speeches, talking points, generating code output, identifying citations, summarizing documents, generating event and article titles, and so on,” she said. Businesses are also very interested in the technology, Davenport said. Kraft Heinz Co. in August released an AI-generated ketchup ad. Coca-Cola Co. in May released an ad that used generative AI, along with live action and other digital effects, to show a Coca-Cola bottle traveling through an art museum.  Other companies are using text generators to manage their internal knowledge, he said. He cited Morgan Stanley, which has been training GPT using 100,000 company documents to help address questions its financial advisors may have. Concerns about the technology Academic and industry leaders have expressed concern about AI’s potential downsides, including large-scale job loss, the rise of misinformation, the ensuing threat to democracy and the potential for AI to outsmart humans. Nearly three-quarters of companies plan to integrate current and future AI systems into their functioning, leading to valid concerns about the impacts of AI on job security across sectors. “Existing models are already capable of replacing or augmenting a decent portion of modern-day intellectual labor,” a spokesperson for the Center for AI Safety, a San Francisco-based research nonprofit, said. Future models “will likely be completely capable of doing various white-collar intellectual tasks.” Though AI threatens certain sectors, the World Economic Forum estimates that it will have a net positive impact on job growth, predicting several million new jobs in education, agriculture and digital commerce and trade, and will increase demand for AI specialists. “Generative AI is a double-edged sword,” Subrahmanian said. “If ChatGPT can perform a task currently performed by humans faster, better and cheaper, then those individuals’ jobs are at risk. But ChatGPT has already created new jobs such as ones based on prompt engineering. And it can enable people to overcome deficits and qualify for jobs that they did not qualify for before.” Generative AI could be detrimental because of its lack of accuracy, as PolitiFact found when it put ChatGPT to a fact-checking test. OpenAI recognizes that its technology “still is not fully reliable,” can be “confidently wrong in its predictions,” and may “hallucinate facts and make reasoning errors.” Not only can generative AI contribute to the proliferation of misinformation, but internal reports indicate that ChatGPT can also create it convincingly.   Some AI experts are also concerned about the dangers posed by future iterations of the technology — a superintelligent “rogue AI” that supersedes human control. Major tech executives and industry leaders such as Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Andrew Yang and Rachel Bronson were among thousands of signatories on a March letter asking AI labs to pause development for six months on AI systems to improve safety and oversight of the technology. The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) also wrote an April open letter, highlighting AI technology’s social value, while recognizing several key concerns that need addressing through transparency, safety, and engagement in ethics discussions. But not all experts share these concerns. One of the “grandfathers” of AI, Yann LeCun, recently told BBC News that although AI will change certain aspects of the world, statements about AI threatening humanity are “preposterous.” At a Senate hearing in May, Sam Altman, the OpenAI’s CEO, urged legislators to regulate the industry. “I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong. And we want to be vocal about that,” Altman said. “We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.” This fact check was originally published by PolitiFact, which is part of the Poynter Institute.

Corporate law and tax professionals as well as their outside firms believe generative AI tools like ChatGPT can and should be used for work; but the sectors differ in potential use cases and how they’re approaching risk mitigation policies

As generative AI tools such as ChatGPT continue to take hold in the public consciousness, those in the legal and tax professions are beginning to consider and plan for how these innovative technologies could be used in their own work and how to overcome the risks that generative AI presents.
A new report comparing legal and tax approaches to generative AI, as well as the difference between corporate and outside professionals, reveals how attitudes and adoption of generative AI are developing in the tool’s early days. Although there are some slight differences in the strength of their opinions — for example, more legal professionals than tax professionals believe generative AI can be applied to their work — respondents from all segments said they feel positively that the technology can apply to their daily work product.
The Future of Professionals: ChatGPT and Generative AI in
Legal, Corporate & Tax Markets report comes from a series of surveys conducted between March and May by the Thomson Reuters Institute of more than 1,800 legal and tax professionals in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The survey was accompanied with assorted interviews conducted by the Institute, painting a picture of professional services industries that are still weighing their options for adopting the technology even as they eye potential use cases for when they feel the technology is ready.
Some segments are already moving: 15% of tax & accounting firm respondents and 10% of corporate law department respondents, for instance, report already adopting generative AI tools or having made clear plans to do so. Others are still waiting out the technology, however: respondents from 73% of corporate tax departments said they have no plans to adopt generative AI technologies at this time, 13 percentage points higher than any other segment.

Other important findings in the report include:
Most respondents said they feel these technologies can and should be used for work — More than three-quarters (78%) of respondents believe ChatGPT or generative AI can be used for legal or tax work, and about half (52%) of all respondents believe that it should be used. Corporate law and corporate tax departments answered affirmatively at a slightly higher rate — 3 to 4 percentage points higher — than their outside law firm and tax & accounting firm counterparts.
Many are still considering potential adoption — Despite strong feelings about the tools’ potential utility, many within the legal and tax professions are still weighing their options before actually adopting the technology. Just 4% of all respondents said they were already using generative AI or ChatGPT for firm or department operations, and 5% said they were actively making plans to do so. Those numbers were largely consistent across geographies and the type of practice, although tax & accounting firms in particular had a higher rate of adoption or planned adoption (15%) than other types of respondents.
A focus on risk — More than two-thirds (69%) of respondents said their organization has risk concerns around the use of generative AI or ChatGPT, while just 8% said their organization did not have risk concerns. Almost one-fourth (23%) said they did not know. Despite these warnings, however, very few organizations are taking active steps to limit generative AI or ChatGPT usage: Just 20% of respondents said their firm or company has warned employees against unauthorized generative AI or ChatGPT usage, and 9% of all respondents said their organization had banned the unauthorized use of generative AI or ChatGPT.
There is a distinct potential for this technology to change not only how legal and tax professionals work on a daily basis, but how corporate departments interact with their outside firms. As Wei Zhao, General Counsel of Segway, noted: “I think this technology has the potential to replace a lot of entry-level lawyers and allow far fewer lawyers to get the same amount of work done.”

Generative AI Could Add $4.4 Trillion a Year to the Global Economy, McKinsey Finds



By Vanessa Bates Ramirez
June 22, 2023 







There’s been concern about artificial intelligence taking away jobs for years, and with the recent boom in generative AI, those fears have grown. The ability to generate realistic and accurate text, images, or audio based on a prompt could make plenty of jobs obsolete (including, ahem, journalism and writing). But a new study says the doomsday predictions are misguided, because generative AI is far more likely to do just the opposite of canceling out jobs.
Last week, McKinsey published a report called The Economic Potential of Generative AI: The Next Productivity Frontier. It’s the result of a study involving 850 different job roles and 2,100 tasks across occupations in 47 countries. Researchers considered what portion of each existing job or task can be taken over by generative AI, as well as new occupations and responsibilities likely to be created by the technology. Their conclusion? Generative AI has the potential to create up to $4.4 trillion worth of annual value in the global economy.
$4.4 trillion is the high end of a range, with the lower bound sitting at $2.6 trillion. Even if the value created were to fall on the low end, it would still approximate the GDP of the United Kingdom, which was $3.1 trillion in 2021.
How will that happen? Mostly by automating and accelerating work that’s currently done by humans, allowing humans to do more work in the same amount of time. That makes both us and AIs sound like nothing more than workhorses, but here’s an example.
A study released in April detailed how generative AI impacted the work of customer service agents at a software firm. The AI monitored agent interactions with customers in real time and gave them suggestions for what to say. The agents who used the AI resolved 13.8 percent more issues per hour than they’d been able to without it; they got through calls more quickly, resolved more complaints successfully, and could even handle multiple calls at once. The AI also cut down the time managers had to spend training new employees, enabling them to take on bigger teams—and ultimately allowing the company to hire more employees and do more business.
McKinsey’s study found that generative AI and other technologies could automate work activities that currently take up 60 to 70 percent of employees’ time. That’s a complicated projection, though; the report acknowledges that some significant reskilling will be needed, and companies and governments will have to invest in supporting worker transitions and managing the other risks that such a momentous shift will bring. “If worker transitions and other risks can be managed, generative AI could contribute substantively to economic growth and support a more sustainable, inclusive world,” the authors wrote. It’s a pretty big “if,” one deserving several equivalent reports of its own to contemplate exactly how it’s all going to work.
According to the report, generative AI’s value add will be mostly concentrated in four categories of jobs: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development. The customer service example above illustrates the first category; AI can assist with or completely take over customer interactions, and to some extent it’s already done so—when was the last time you got an actual human on the phone after calling a corporate customer service number?
For marketing and sales, AI can generate creative content (like the millions a day being generated by OpenAI’s DALL-E), including content that’s more personalized than what we see today. Software engineers are already using AI to write computer code based on natural-language prompts. In the research and development arena, AI is not only modeling proteins incredibly rapidly, it’s building protein complexes tailored to specific biological responses and helping design artificial protein drugs. It’s no surprise, then, that life sciences is one of the industries predicted to see the most revenue growth from generative AI (along with banking and high-tech).
It seems clear that generative AI is poised to revolutionize the way we work, and eventually even the way we live. But outside of generating economic value, will it generate well-being and a higher quality of life for the average person? Perhaps that’s the question we should really be focusing on.
AI will continue to proliferate and find new applications across various sectors of the economy. For now though, humans are still an essential piece of the equation to complete most tasks—including McKinsey’s generative AI report. While the data for it was retrieved and analyzed by AI, the report itself was written completely by humans.

theGist announced today an AI-powered hub for work applications, helping knowledge workers focus on what’s most important. This unified workspace aims to address two of the biggest challenges for employees at the office: constant context switching and not focusing on the most important, valuable and productive tasks.

The platform offered by theGist forms personalized knowledge graphs, connecting projects, people, and topics. This helps amplify focus and enhance the productivity of knowledge workers by delivering actionable insights and streamlined workflows.

PROMOTED
The announcement today follows the successful launch of theGist for Slack late last year, which currently serves thousands of companies and was one of the first products to demonstrate the need to incorporate AI tools in existing work apps and across apps. The new work hub offered by theGist covers the entire digital workspace of the specific employee, including related items, insights, tasks, daily focus, generative text, summaries, and actions.

Founded in 2022 with the mission of ”You can finally stop sifting through endless conversations and just get theGist of it,” the startup is developing a future-of-work platform that integrates all work applications into a single, cohesive workspace. “Our founding team believes in the popular Da Vinci quote ‘Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,’ says Itzik Ben-Bassat, co-founder and CEO of theGist. “As such, we called the company theGist because our goal is to create radical focus and extreme performance by allowing AI to sort out all the noise and laser focus you on what’s truly important.”

With all the distractions pervading and proliferating in the modern office, focusing on what’s truly important has become extremely difficult. A recent survey found that eight out of 10 workers are suffering from information overload, up from 60% of those surveyed 2 years before. To get the information they need to perform their job, 27% say they must access eleven or more accounts, resources, tools and apps on a daily basis, up from 15% in the previous survey. 47% of workers report that they spend more than one hour of every working day searching for files or specific data to be able to do their job and 42% say the information they need is hard to find as it is scattered across multiple sites, files and apps.

This chaotic information environment at work has a serious negative impact. 76% of respondents say that information overload contributes to their daily stress. Another 35% said this overload is having a detrimental effect on their work performance, with 30% reporting it is affecting their overall job satisfaction.

Without adequate technological solutions, information overload promises to significantly increase in the future, given the rapid growth of information. When IDC analysts reported for the first time the amount of information created and replicated annually, they estimated that 161 exabytes of data were created in 2006. Last year, IDC estimated that 101,000 exabytes were created and projected this amount will more than double in size to 221,000 exabytes in 2026.
In a reversal from past trends, it is enterprises, not consumers, that are now the major contributors to information growth—and information overload. ""The Enterprise DataSphere will grow more than twice as fast as the Consumer DataSphere over the next five years, putting even more pressure on enterprise organizations to manage and protect the world's data while creating opportunities to activate data for business and societal benefits,” said last year John Rydning, research vice president of IDC's Global DataSphere.
The scale of the information overload challenge and the opportunity to increase the usefulness and value of enterprise data has ignited a race to apply generative AI to office applications. In recent months, it has been primarily a competition between Microsoft and Google (otherwise known as the “Satya v. Sundar Show”), but other established players such as Salesforce have joined the fray, emphasizing “trust” as the main necessary ingredient in the success of enterprise-ready generative AI.
Startups such as theGist are also enterprise-ready: “What differentiates theGist and enables our AI models to be accurate is the focus on personalization, which eliminates the hallucination problem of LLMs,” says Ben-Bassat.

The use of artificial intelligence in business is now mainstream, with many organizations using AI as a standalone technology for specialized use cases or embedding it within common enterprise software systems that handle core business processes.







And recent surveys speak to the growing number of companies experimenting with AI. For example, an April 2023 pulse poll of 254 technology leaders by professional services firm EY found that 90% of respondents are exploring AI platforms such as ChatGPT and Bing Chat. And 80% are planning to increase their investments in AI in the upcoming year.
Executives have indicated to EY researchers and others that they're looking at AI to increase efficiencies, boost productivity, lower costs, create competitive advantages and meet rapidly changing market expectations. They've also credited advances in AI tools for making the technology more accessible to organizations.
Enterprise leaders said data security, process automation and customer care are the top areas where their companies have been applying AI. Natural language processing (NLP) is at the forefront of AI adoption.

However, executives also said their use of AI is moving out from those early areas of adoption and into nearly every part of the enterprise.
Here are 15 top applications of artificial intelligence in the enterprise.

1. AI-enabled innovations, products and services
Although organizations are only beginning to harness the potential of artificial intelligence, some are already using the technology to fuel innovation and create new products and services.
Amazon Alexa and other similar virtual assistants are some of the most well-known examples, but experts said companies across industries are finding ways to incorporate AI into their wares or use AI to develop new offerings.

Seth Earley

As an example, Seth Earley, author of The AI-Powered Enterprise and founder and CEO of Earley Information Science, pointed to a company using AI to improve its telecommunications platform. The organization is also employing machine learning and other AI technologies to improve the quality of the speaker's voice and image and to keep the images of others participating from becoming distorted on screen.
Brian Jackson, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, highlighted a retailer that's collaborating with artists to feature their designs on clothing, using AI to develop the art and manufacturing merchandise to order.


2. Automating routine cognitive work
Organizations for years have used AI to automate many manual tasks, such as data entry. Now they're using next-generation intelligence such as generative AI to handle cognitive tasks such as summarizing reports and drafting communications.
""AI is now tackling some of the grind work,"" said Nicholas Napp, a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, noting that this use of AI could affect many jobs. ""Much of our jobs is grind versus special experience, and AI is really good at that grind.""


3. AI for leveling up workers
Even when tasks can't be automated, experts said AI can still aid workers by offering advice and guidance that helps them level up their performance.
Kavita Ganesan, an AI adviser, strategist and founder of consultancy Opinosis Analytics, cited Grammarly and similar services that use AI to not only catch misspellings in text but to correct grammar and offer preferred phrasings to improve a user's writing.
Others noted that generative AI brings even more aid to workers, who with little or no experience can use the tool to write software code, design a logo or craft a marketing strategy.
Such AI applications ""help level up the skills of a more junior person in the company and help them perform at a more senior level, and it helps experts really shine,"" said Mike Mason, chief AI officer at consultancy Thoughtworks. ""It's an enabler that allows people to do things they otherwise wouldn't have been able to do.""


4. AI as a creative force
Artificial intelligence is now capable of creating compositions of all kinds, including visual art, music, poetry and prose, and computer code.
Some have questioned whether AI-generated works are derivative in either the legal or artist sense (or both), as the technology works by analyzing and learning from the data it's given for training. Regardless of the answer, AI is being used by organizations to create a range of works.
Napp, who is also co-founder of Xmark Labs, tested OpenAI with a Moby Dick-inspired query -- ""As Captain Ahab, can you pretend to be a teenage TikTok influencer and tell me about your quest for the whale?"" -- and received an original three-graph narrative in response.
Napp also said he and a math teacher used ChatGPT to create real-world examples of a mathematical concept in action to inspire students, and worked with one of his children to create an adventure for the fantasy game Dungeons & Dragons.



Here are 15 top applications of AI in business, plus industry-specific examples of AI use.







5. Accessing and organizing knowledge via AI
Accessing and organizing knowledge is another area where AI -- in particular, generative AI -- is demonstrating its potential to organizations and their workers.
The technology lets workers not only search through reams of information, such as institutional files or industry-specific data, to find relevant elements, it organizes and summarizes those elements.
Although this application of AI is potentially transformative, Earley warned that the technology isn't reliable enough to use without human oversight or review. AI systems, such as ChatGPT, don't always have all the data sets needed to reach accurate and complete conclusions, he explained, and they often make assumptions that aren't correct.
Case in point: Two lawyers in early 2023 submitted a court brief created using ChatGPT only to find the technology had fabricated some of the cases cited in the legal document.


6. AI for optimization
Optimization is another AI use case, and it's one that stretches across industries and business functions.
AI-based business applications can use algorithms and modeling to turn data into actionable insights on how organizations can optimize a range of functions and business processes -- from worker schedules to production product pricing. AI systems can use data, identify bottlenecks and offer optimized options to implement.
""Organizations can benefit using AI for the automation of repetitive tasks, which reduces manual efforts and increases accuracy,"" said Moe Asgharnia, CIO at accounting and consulting firm BPM.


7. Higher productivity and more efficient operations
Another top reason organizations are adopting AI is to boost productivity and generate more efficiencies, said Sreekar Krishna, U.S. leader of AI at professional services firm KPMG.
He said AI can be plugged into many processes that require human labor and then either fully or partially perform that process --- faster, more accurately and at a higher volume than any human could.


8. More effective learning and training through AI
Many organizations are using or exploring how to use intelligence software to improve how people learn.
Intelligent tools can be used to customize educational plans to each worker's learning needs and understanding levels based on their experience and knowledge. Asgharnia said that lets organizations implement more effective training programs.


9. AI as coach and monitor
In a related application, organizations are deploying AI-powered systems that coach employees as they work. The technology, experts explained, has the capability to monitor and analyze actions in near real time and provide feedback, thereby coaching or guiding workers through the process.
For example, many logistics and transportation companies use systems featuring cameras, eye-tracking technology and other AI algorithms to monitor for distracted driving, alerting workers to the problematic behavior and offering corrective actions.


10. Decision support
A similar application of AI in the enterprise is the use of an intelligent decision support system (DSS). These systems sort and analyze data and, based on that analysis, offer suggestions and guidance to humans as they make decisions.
Doctors, accountants and researchers are among the professionals who use such software, Asgharnia said. As an example, he pointed to a DSS that helps accountants wade through tax laws to identify the most beneficial tax strategies for their clients.


11. AI-enabled quality control and quality assurance
Manufacturers have been using machine vision, a form of AI, for decades. They're now advancing such uses by adding quality control software with deep learning capabilities to improve the speed and accuracy of their quality control functions while keeping costs in check.
These systems deliver a more precise, and ever-improving, quality assurance function, as deep learning models create their own rules to determine what defines quality.


12. AI for personalized customer services, experiences and support
Delivering personalized customer services and experiences is one of the most prevalent enterprise use cases for AI.
""It's using identifiers about customers and consolidating signals from multiple systems to understand who they are, what describes them, [and] what motivates them to create a personalized experience,"" Earley explained .
Although the use of AI for such a purpose is widespread, Earley said companies could be more effective. ""I think personalization isn't being done well today, or not at the level it can be,"" he said.


13. Safer operations
AI is being used by a multitude of industries to improve safety.
Construction companies, utilities, farms, mining interests and other entities working in outside locales or in spacious geographical areas are gathering data from endpoint devices such as cameras, thermometers, motion detectors and weather sensors. Organizations then feed that data into intelligent systems that identify problematic behaviors, dangerous conditions or business opportunities, and make recommendations or even take preventative or corrective actions.
Other industries are making similar use of AI-enabled software applications to monitor safety conditions. For example, manufacturers are using AI software and computer vision to monitor workers' behaviors to ensure they're following safety protocols.
Organizations of all kinds can use AI to process data gathered from on-site IoT ecosystems to monitor facilities or workers. In such cases, the intelligent systems watch for and alert companies to hazardous conditions such as distracted driving in delivery trucks.


14. AI for functional area improvements
The functional areas within the typical enterprise are also putting AI to good use for their own specific needs.

Customer service uses chatbots powered by machine learning algorithms and NLP to understand customer requests and respond both faster and cheaper than human workers can. AI also powers recommendation functions, which use customer data and analytics to suggest products customers are most likely to need or want and therefore buy. Intelligent systems can help employees better serve customers by drawing on analytics, like those used in chatbots and recommendation engines, to give workers suggestions as they tend to customers.
Marketing uses intelligent systems to understand users and their buying patterns, so they can create targeted marketing campaigns with a higher success rate than their generic counterparts. Some organizations are also combining intelligent technologies -- including facial recognition, geospatial software and analytics -- to identify in-store customers and promote products, services or sales that match their personal preferences.
The supply-chain function uses algorithms to forecast what will be needed when and the optimal time to move supplies. In this use case, AI helps business leaders create more efficient, cost-effective supply chains by minimizing and even possibly eliminating overstocking and the risk of running short of in-demand products.
The HR function uses AI-powered systems to help write more interesting and accurate job postings, identify and screen potential candidates, and create personalized training and development programs for employees.
Cybersecurity uses AI to more efficiently and effectively monitor the enterprise IT environment to detect anomalies that could indicate a cyberthreat.
IT can use AI systems to write and document code.
The C-suite and the board can use AI to identify, analyze and rate risk, helping them to create better risk management strategies.



15. AI for addressing industry-specific needs
Although many AI applications span industry sectors, other use cases are specific to individual industry needs. Here are some examples:

Healthcare. The healthcare industry employs artificial intelligence and machine learning products to analyze the vast troves of data collected over recent decades to uncover patterns and insights that humans aren't able to find on their own. Algorithms in diagnostic tools are helping clinicians make more accurate diagnoses earlier in a disease's progression. Other intelligent tools help clinicians develop more individualized treatment plans designed for maximum efficiency for each patient.
Financial services. The financial services sector uses AI and machine learning for fraud detection, digital and data security, and to analyze historical and real-time data to make near-instantaneous decisions about the legitimacy of individual transactions. Financial services firms also use AI for more niche applications, such as wealth management, loan approvals and trading decisions.
Industrial maintenance. The industrial sector uses AI for predictive machine maintenance to identify the most probable time equipment will need service and to optimize the scheduling of maintenance work. AI is also used in factories to increase efficiency.
Transportation. AI is enabling a growing fleet of self-driving vehicles that are becoming smarter as they gain navigation experience. AI is also being used for smarter traffic management operations and transportation logistics.

            Business executives keep talking about it. Teachers are struggling with what to do about it. And artists like Drake seem angry about it. 
    

            Love it or hate it, everyone is paying attention to artificial intelligence right now. Almost overnight, a new crop of AI tools has found its way into products used by billions of people, changing the way we work, shop, create and communicate with each other.
    

            AI advocates tout the technology’s potential to supercharge our productivity, creating a new era of better jobs, better education and better treatments for diseases. AI skeptics have raised concerns about the technology’s potential to disrupt jobs, mislead people and possibly bring about the end of humanity as we know it. Confusingly, some execs in Silicon Valley seem to hold both sets of views at once.

            What’s clear, however, is that AI is not going away, but it is changing very fast. Here’s everything you need to know to keep up.
    

        What is AI? 


            In the public consciousness, “artificial intelligence” may conjure up images of murderous machines eager to overtake humans, and capable of doing so. But in the tech industry, it’s a broad term that refers to different tools that are trained to perform a wide range of complex tasks that might previously have required some input from an actual person. 
    
close dialogAdvertisementclose dialog
            If you use the internet, then you almost certainly use services that rely on AI to sort data, filter content and make suggestions, among other tasks. 
    

            It’s the technology that allows Netflix to recommend movies and that helps remove spam, hate speech and other inappropriate content from your social media feeds. It helps power everything from autocorrect features and Google Translate to facial recognition services, the last of which uses AI that, in Microsoft’s words, “mimics a human capability to recognize human faces.”
    

            AI can also be successful in developing techniques for solving a wide range of real world problems, such as adjusting traffic signals in real time to manage congestion issues or helping medical professionals analyze images to make a diagnosis. AI is also central to developing self-driving cars by processing tremendous amounts of visual data so the vehicles can understand their surroundings.
    

        So why is everyone talking about AI now? 


            The short answer: ChatGPT.
    

            For years, AI has largely operated in the background of services we use every day. That changed following the November launch of ChatGPT, a viral chatbot that put the power of AI front and center.
    

            People have already used ChatGPT, a tool created by OpenAI, to draft lawsuits, write song lyrics and create research paper abstracts so good they’ve even fooled some scientists. The tool has even passed standardized exams. And ChatGPT has sparked an intense competition among tech companies to develop and deploy similar tools.

            Microsoft and Google have each introduced features powered by generative AI, the technology underpinning ChatGPT, into their most widely used productivity tools. Meta, Amazon and Alibaba have said they’re working on generative AI tools, too. And numerous other businesses also want in on the action.

            It’s rare to see a cutting-edge technology become so ubiquitous almost overnight. Now businesses, educators and lawmakers are all racing to adapt.
    

        How exactly does generative AI work? 


            Generative AI enables tools to create written work, images and even audio in response to prompts from users.
    

            To get those responses, several Big Tech companies have developed their own large language models trained on vast amounts of online data. The scope and purpose of these data sets can vary. For example, the version of ChatGPT that went public last year was only trained on data up until 2021 (it’s now more up to date). 
    

            These models work through a method called deep learning, which learns patterns and relationships between words, so it can make predictive responses and generate relevant outputs to user prompts.
    

        How is generative AI different from AGI?


            As impressive as some generative AI services may seem, they essentially just do pattern matching. These tools can mimic the writing of others or make predictions about what words might be relevant in their responses based on all the data they’ve previously been trained on.
    

            AGI, on the other hand, promises something more ambitious — and scary.
    

            AGI — short for artificial general intelligence — refers to technology that can perform intelligent tasks such as learning, reasoning and adapting to new situations in the way that humans do. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has teased the possibility of a superintelligent AGI that could go on to change the world or perhaps backfire and end humanity.
    

            For the moment, however, AGI remains purely a hypothetical, so don’t worry too much about it.
    

        How much of the AI gold rush is just hype?


            Anytime there’s an excess of buzz around a technology, it’s good to be skeptical — and there is certainly a lot of that here. Investor fascination with AI has helped push Wall Street back into a bull market, despite lingering economic uncertainty. 
    

            Not all AI tools are equally useful and many companies will certainly tout AI features and strategies simply to tap into the current hype cycle. But even in just the past six months, AI has already shown potential to change how people do numerous everyday tasks.
    

            One of the biggest selling points around AI chatbots, for example, is their ability to make people more productive. Earlier this year, some real estate agents told CNN that ChatGPT saved them hours of work not only by writing listings for homes for sale but also looking up the permitted uses for certain land and calculating what mortgage payments or the return on investment might be for a client, which typically involve formulas and mortgage calculators.
    

            Artificial intelligence is also much broader than ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. Even if you think AI chatbots are annoying or might be a fad, the underlying technology will continue to power meaningful advances in products and services for years to come.
    

        Will it steal my job? 


            The fear is AI will eliminate millions of jobs. The hope is it will help improve how millions do their jobs. The current reality is somewhere in between.
    

            Companies will likely need new workers to help them implement and manage AI tools. Employment of data analysts and scientists, machine learning specialists and cybersecurity experts is forecast to grow 30% on average by 2027, according to one recent estimate from the World Economic Forum.
    

            But the proliferation of AI will also likely put many roles at risk eventually. There could be 26 million fewer record-keeping and administrative jobs by 2027, the WEF predicted. Data entry clerks and executive secretaries are expected to see the steepest losses.
    

            For now, there are clearly limits to how well AI can do the job of a human on its own. After media outlet CNET experimented with using AI to write articles, tech website Futurism uncovered factual errors and in some cases, plagiarism, in various pieces. Likewise, a lawyer in May made headlines for citing false court cases to a judge provided to him by ChatGPT. In an affidavit, the lawyer said he had never used ChatGPT as a legal research tool before and “was unaware of the possibility that its content could be false.”

        Is AI dangerous?


            Top AI executives have warned that AI could potentially bring about human extinction. But these same executives are also racing to deploy the technology into their products. 
    

            Some experts say that focusing on far-off doomsday scenarios may distract from the more immediate harms that AI can cause, such as spreading misinformation, perpetuating biases that exist in training data, and enabling discrimination.
    

            For example, generative AI could be used to create deepfakes to spread propaganda during an election or enable a frightening new era of scams. Some AI models have also been criticized for what the industry calls “hallucinations,” or making up information. 
    

            Even before the rise of ChatGPT, there were concerns about AI acting as a gatekeeper that can determine who does and does not move forward in a hiring process, for example. AI-powered facial recognition systems have also resulted in some wrongful arrests, and research has shown these systems are drastically more prone to error when trying to match the faces of darker skinned people.
    

            The more AI tools are incorporated into core parts of society, the more potential there is for unintended consequences.
    

        Where does AI go from here?


            Regulators in the United States and Europe are pushing for legislation to help put guardrails in place for AI, which could ultimately impact how the technology develops. But it’s unclear if lawmakers can keep pace with the rapid advances in AI. 
    

            Experts believe in the months ahead, generative AI will go on to create even more realistic images, videos, and audio that could further disrupt media, entertainment, tech and other industries. The technology will likely become increasingly conversational and personalized.
    

            In March, OpenAI unveiled GPT-4, the next-generation version of the technology that powers ChatGPT. According to the company and early tests, GPT-4 is able to provide more detailed and accurate written responses, pass academic tests with high marks and build a working website from a hand-drawn sketch. (Altman has previously said OpenAI is not yet training GPT-5.) 


            AI will almost certainly be infused into many more products and services in the coming months. That means we’ll all have to learn how to live with it.
    

            As ChatGPT put it in response to a prompt from CNN, “AI has the potential to transform our lives … but it’s crucial for companies and individuals to be mindful of the accompanying risks and responsibly address concerns.”

         — 
    


            More prime working age women are employed in the United States now than ever before. 
    

            The labor force participation rate for women between 25 and 54 years old set a record high in April and then again in May, rebounding from the pandemic “she-cession” and returning to its pre-pandemic form of making progressively historic labor market gains. 
    

            That could all change with AI.

Generative artificial intelligence technologies like ChatGPT have the potential to transform the labor market, exposing the majority of the nation’s jobs to automation, Goldman Sachs economists have projected. The technology can create new content — such as text, images, audio, video, and code — from training data that includes examples of that desired output. 
    

            However, recent research shows that although outnumbered by men in the US workforce, women could be disproportionately affected by businesses’ adoption of generative AI: One recent analysis estimates that 79% of working women (nearly 59 million) are in occupations susceptible to disruption and automation. That’s compared to 58% of working men, according to research from the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School.
    

            Estimates that nearly eight out of 10 women workers could be affected “are just staggering,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist with online job marketplace ZipRecruiter. “That said, and I think intuitively many of us appreciate that, it’ll be easier to automate some of these office jobs than it will be to automate carpenter jobs and electrician jobs and pest removal jobs — many of these manual services and production jobs that are far more male-heavy.”

            She added: “I think there are legitimate reasons to be worried that some of the gains that women made could be eroded, at least temporarily.” However, she also noted that “these technologies will also surely create many, many opportunities.”
    

            A higher percentage of working women are employed in white-collar jobs, whereas for men it’s more of a 50-50 split between white- and blue-collar occupations, said Mark McNeilly, professor of the practice of marketing at the Kenan-Flagler school and lead author of the AI research. Some of the most AI-exposed occupations with a majority-female employee base are office and administrative support; healthcare practitioners and technical; education, training and library; health care support; and community and social services, according to the UNC Kenan-Flagler research. 
    

            “It’s not always going to relate to ‘I’m losing my job,’” McNeilly told CNN. “I think it’s really a matter of if there’s something that the person can do to add value.”
    

        Pre-pandemic runup


            In the years leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, women’s labor force participation rates were rising faster than that of their male counterparts, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. 
    

            A confluence of several factors were behind those gains, Pollak said. Notably: Female-dominated industries, such as health care and caregiving, were among the fastest-growing industries; educational attainment for women rose substantially; and women also made greater inroads into traditionally male-dominated fields such as construction, agriculture, and repair and maintenance.

            By February of 2020, the labor force participation rate for prime working-age women was 77% — just shy of the record 77.3% set during the dot-com era, BLS data shows.
    

            But by April 2020, that rate plummeted to 73.5% as the pandemic froze the US economy, forcing more than 20 million people out of their jobs. As the nation recovered in the coming months, however, women didn’t return at the same levels as men. 
    

            The pandemic walloped the leisure and hospitality and education and health services sectors, where women make up the majority of the workforce. Additionally, job losses and a lackluster employment recovery in the child care sector hampered workers’ ability to return to the labor market; and since caregiving responsibilities often fall to women, they were held back more as school became home-based.
    

            The tide eventually turned.
    

        A historic bounce back


            Three key drivers for women entering the workforce are access to child care, market wage and flexibility, said Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board, a business research and membership organization.
    

            And the pandemic recovery kicked those catalysts into hyperdrive.
    

            Jobs, by and large, became less rigid: Telecommuting grew more commonplace, and home-based work allowed for more flexibility in hours. That helped improve access to child care with schedules that allowed for easier drop-offs and pick-ups as well as companies that offered on-site child care. And labor shortages — largely related to the acceleration of ongoing demographic trends of Baby Boomers leaving the workforce, long Covid and health-related concerns — help to lift wages, especially for low-paying jobs. 
    

            “Some of these things are becoming more prevalent, and that’s supportive of more women in the labor market,” she said. 
    

            Additionally, women-centric sectors, such as health care and leisure and hospitality, are continuing to see some of the most robust job gains during the past two years.
    

            “That’s where a lot of the hiring is happening, and that’s also where a lot of the wage increases are happening,” Peterson said. “So, if you have more job openings and higher wages and these are areas that women tend to predominate, then it makes sense that women are going to gravitate toward those sectors and be more willing to work.”
    

            Last month, the labor force participation rate for 25- to 54-year-old women set a fresh high of 77.6%, ticking up from the previous record of 77.5% set the month before, according to BLS data.
    

        Along comes AI


            Revelio Labs, which specializes in the collection and analysis of publicly available workforce data, recently identified the most AI-exposed occupations and the gender and ethnicity distributions among them. Revelio’s analysis showed that the AI-exposed positions with the highest percentage of women included bill and account collectors (82.9%), payroll and timekeeping clerks (79.7%), executive secretaries (74.3%), word processors and typists (65.4%) and bookkeeping, accounting and auditing clerks (65%).
    

            In the most AI-exposed occupations, women make up 71% of employees, said Ben Zweig, Revelio’s chief executive officer.
    

            “Sometimes in the AI conversation, we take a perspective, which I think is a false perspective, that the task composition of a job is static — that a job is a job and it has fixed responsibilities,” said Ben Zweig, chief executive  “But that’s not really the case. Jobs transform all the time.”
    

            AI represents an opportunity and a threat all at once, and it really depends on the industry, Peterson said.

            Generative AI might not have the capacity now to turn a patient over or insert an IV, but it could prove helpful in poring through billions of pieces of imaging data to diagnose a condition. 
    

            On the other hand, AI could prove harmful and threatening for any role that is highly “automatable,” Peterson said. 
    

            “The thing about AI is that it’s not perfect; it’s generating new content from existing content,” she said. “It still needs a human to create some existing content for it to pull from. And whatever it’s generating, it doesn’t mean it’s right — you still need someone to look at it and see if it makes sense.”
    

            For businesses, there are legitimate risks, including ensuring that the applications are used responsibly and potential concerns around bias and ethics are fully understood and addressed, she noted. 
    

            “Over time, it will replace some jobs, but as with every other type of technological advancement that we’ve had, people have always figured out something else to do,” she said. “Yes, it may destroy jobs in the short run, but it also creates new jobs and different opportunities. It helps people to become more productive in their existing jobs.”
    

        ‘Cannot be replaced by a machine’


            At Montana State University, Dr. Sara Mannheimer, who received her Ph.D. in library and information science, is working under a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services and leading a team of researchers to explore how AI could be used ethically in libraries and archives. 
    

            “Librarians think a lot about evaluating information and thinking about sources and trustworthy sources,” she said, noting that the data often feeding into AI is from the internet. “ChatGPT uses Reddit data and Wikipedia data and who knows what else, and [those are] known to be predominantly used by, edited by and participated in by men, and mostly white men. So the information that is coming out of [these technologies] is biased, and it’s not always accurate.”

            While the AI project doesn’t specifically address labor market implications, especially for library workers, Mannheimer is cognizant of what this technology could mean for her and others in her field.
    

            “The library cannot be replaced by a machine, there will always be work that a human needs to do,” she said, adding that if AI could handle rote tasks, “I think there’s plenty of work for librarians and library staff to do that requires critical thinking.”
    

            Meredith Nudo, a freelance writer and voice actress based in Houston, is staying sharply aware of the potential disruption from AI to her jobs, specifically the voiceover work.
    

            Voice actors such as Nudo are pushing back on attempts to have AI-created voices replace them. Organizations like the National Association of Voice Actors has developed guidelines and a campaign to educate the industry and supporters around the topic.    
    

            Nudo has a clause in her standard voice work contract stating that her work cannot be used to train AI and is starting to include a similar clause for her writing, especially after being recruited with job opportunities to teach AI to write or edit more effectively.
    

            “It was a really strange, surreal experience to be asked to train what was basically my replacement, and it was like saying you’re not good enough to hire [for] the job that you have experience in and trained for,” she said.
    

            Nudo said she sees the opportunities in working with AI for certain duties, such as note-taking and transcription, which could free up time and space for other tasks that require more legwork, creativity and critical thinking.
    

            “If we didn’t have to worry about meeting our own basic needs, I think we would probably see a lot more people be amenable to the technology,” she said.

The labor force participation rate for women between 25 and 54 years old set a record high in April and then again in May, rebounding from the pandemic “she-cession” and returning to its pre-pandemic form of making progressively historic labor market gains.  That could all change with AI. Generative artificial intelligence technologies like ChatGPT have the potential to transform the labor market, exposing the majority of the nation’s jobs to automation, Goldman Sachs economists have projected. The technology can create new content — such as text, images, audio, video, and code — from training data that includes examples of that desired output.  However, recent research shows that although outnumbered by men in the US workforce, women could be disproportionately affected by businesses’ adoption of generative AI: One recent analysis estimates that 79% of working women (nearly 59 million) are in occupations susceptible to disruption and automation. That’s compared to 58% of working men, according to research from the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School. Estimates that nearly eight out of 10 women workers could be affected “are just staggering,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist with online job marketplace ZipRecruiter. “That said, and I think intuitively many of us appreciate that, it’ll be easier to automate some of these office jobs than it will be to automate carpenter jobs and electrician jobs and pest removal jobs — many of these manual services and production jobs that are far more male-heavy.”  She added: “I think there are legitimate reasons to be worried that some of the gains that women made could be eroded, at least temporarily.” However, she also noted that “these technologies will also surely create many, many opportunities.” A higher percentage of working women are employed in white-collar jobs, whereas for men it’s more of a 50-50 split between white- and blue-collar occupations, said Mark McNeilly, professor of the practice of marketing at the Kenan-Flagler school and lead author of the AI research. Some of the most AI-exposed occupations with a majority-female employee base are office and administrative support; healthcare practitioners and technical; education, training and library; health care support; and community and social services, according to the UNC Kenan-Flagler research.  “It’s not always going to relate to ‘I’m losing my job,’” McNeilly told CNN. “I think it’s really a matter of if there’s something that the person can do to add value.” Pre-pandemic runup In the years leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, women’s labor force participation rates were rising faster than that of their male counterparts, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.  A confluence of several factors were behind those gains, Pollak said. Notably: Female-dominated industries, such as health care and caregiving, were among the fastest-growing industries; educational attainment for women rose substantially; and women also made greater inroads into traditionally male-dominated fields such as construction, agriculture, and repair and maintenance. By February of 2020, the labor force participation rate for prime working-age women was 77% — just shy of the record 77.3% set during the dot-com era, BLS data shows. But by April 2020, that rate plummeted to 73.5% as the pandemic froze the US economy, forcing more than 20 million people out of their jobs. As the nation recovered in the coming months, however, women didn’t return at the same levels as men.  The pandemic walloped the leisure and hospitality and education and health services sectors, where women make up the majority of the workforce. Additionally, job losses and a lackluster employment recovery in the child care sector hampered workers’ ability to return to the labor market; and since caregiving responsibilities often fall to women, they were held back more as school became home-based. The tide eventually turned. A historic bounce back Three key drivers for women entering the workforce are access to child care, market wage and flexibility, said Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board, a business research and membership organization. And the pandemic recovery kicked those catalysts into hyperdrive. Jobs, by and large, became less rigid: Telecommuting grew more commonplace, and home-based work allowed for more flexibility in hours. That helped improve access to child care with schedules that allowed for easier drop-offs and pick-ups as well as companies that offered on-site child care. And labor shortages — largely related to the acceleration of ongoing demographic trends of Baby Boomers leaving the workforce, long Covid and health-related concerns — help to lift wages, especially for low-paying jobs.  “Some of these things are becoming more prevalent, and that’s supportive of more women in the labor market,” she said.  Additionally, women-centric sectors, such as health care and leisure and hospitality, are continuing to see some of the most robust job gains during the past two years. “That’s where a lot of the hiring is happening, and that’s also where a lot of the wage increases are happening,” Peterson said. “So, if you have more job openings and higher wages and these are areas that women tend to predominate, then it makes sense that women are going to gravitate toward those sectors and be more willing to work.” Last month, the labor force participation rate for 25- to 54-year-old women set a fresh high of 77.6%, ticking up from the previous record of 77.5% set the month before, according to BLS data.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is introducing a public working group that seeks to address the challenges and opportunities related to artificial intelligence that can generate text, images, code, videos and other content.
The Public Working Group on Generative AI will help NIST come up with guidance to assist organizations in addressing the risks associated with the technology, the Department of Commerce said Thursday.
“The recently released NIST AI Risk Management Framework can help minimize the potential for harm from generative AI technologies,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.
“Building on the framework, this new Public Working Group will help provide essential guidance for those organizations that are developing, deploying, and using generative AI, and who have a responsibility to ensure its trustworthiness,” Raimondo added.
The team will support NIST’s testing and evaluation work related to generative AI, help create the generative AI profile for the NIST AI Risk Management Profile and explore opportunities to ensure that generative AI technologies could be used productively to address challenges related to health, climate change and the environment, among other areas.
Interested stakeholders have until July 9 to sign up for the public working group.

  How AI Can Augment Human Creativity with Efficiency
  
    Generative AI platforms are revolutionizing the PR industry by automating the job's most tedious tasks, allowing PR professionals to work more efficiently and effectively. And as long as it's supervised by humans, AI implementation can lead to more compelling PR campaigns, with AI performing the majority of the work and humans adding the final touches to achieve the most optimal results.

As the co-founder and CEO of Propel PRM, a public relations management (PRM) platform, I have had firsthand the transformative impact of AI-driven technology on the PR industry. Indeed, one of the most exciting developments in the past few months has been the rise of generative AI platforms enabling PR professionals to work more efficiently and more effectively.People in communications are quickly adapting to the use of generative AI, and the technology seems to portend a major shift in how corporate communications will be done going forward.Related: Why Are So Many Companies Afraid of Generative AI?



What does it do?At its core, generative AI enables machine learning algorithms to generate new content based on existing data sets. In PR, this means that AI is used to create first drafts of press releases and pitches and importantly for people in communications, media list building. This is because media list building requires in-depth knowledge of the journalistic landscape to understand who to pitch to, but it also takes up the vast majority of a person in PR's day.Generative AI trained on large language models (LLMs) can automate these core communications tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data and information from across the internet within seconds, identifying patterns and trends that human comms professionals might miss. By being able to tell people in PR, with near pin-point accuracy, how they will be able to create the most impact for their organizations, using these generative AI tools ultimately leads to more effective and targeted PR campaigns.


How is it used today?The datasets being leveraged to enable generative AI to alleviate the work of PR pros varies depending on the needs of the PR campaign. For example, AI might analyze social media data to identify trending topics and create tailored content, look through previous articles to understand what a journalist is most likely to write about and whether they would be a good fit for a particular media list, find similar journalists who would be interested in receiving a particular pitch or press release, or simply look at data from successful pitches to understand the most effective way to structure a pitch for maximum effect.Of course, as with any new technology, there are concerns about how these algorithms will change the PR industry. One is that AI-generated content might lack the creativity and nuance of content created by humans, make mistakes, or create inappropriate or offensive content. While these are valid concerns, they can be mitigated by ensuring that AI models are trained adequately on good datasets and, most importantly, that the results are curated and edited by living, breathing human PR professionals.Related: How to Leverage Artificial Intelligence in Public RelationsPeople have the powerOne of the best ways to work with AI and ensure that the communications professional gets the best results is by treating any created outputs as a first draft. Anyone using this technology must understand the risks of using it and therefore needs to edit any output they receive from an AI-powered generator. And yet, despite this need for editing, I've found that AI can still get 70% of the legwork done when it comes to creating content. However, that remaining human-driven 30% really turns a good first draft into a strong, compelling final product.


Another worry is that AI might replace human PR professionals altogether. While it's true that technology can automate many of the more mundane tasks in communications, humans will always be required for the strategic work and relationship-building inherent to the job. Therefore, I believe that human expertise and intuition will always be essential in the PR industry, but AI will enable PR professionals to work more efficiently and effectively.Of course, AI models will become more sophisticated and better at analyzing complex data sets as development continues, and they will be able to generate more targeted, nuanced and effective content in achieving PR goals. At the same time, human PR professionals will continue to play the critical role of crafting the messaging and strategy, building relationships and providing strategic guidance.Ultimately, the successful integration of generative AI into the average PR professional's workflow will depend heavily on the collaboration and partnership between human communications professionals and AI algorithms. Only by working together can PR people leverage AI's power to achieve their goals while ensuring that the content they create is ethical, practical, and aligned with their values and objectives. I'm excited about the opportunities that generative AI presents, and I believe that by embracing this technology, we can create more successful PR campaigns that benefit our clients and society.
