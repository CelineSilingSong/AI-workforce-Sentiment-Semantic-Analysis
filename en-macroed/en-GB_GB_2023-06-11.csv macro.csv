It can produce a variety of novel content, such as images, video, music, speech, text, software code and product designs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Generative AI uses a number of techniques that continue to evolve. Foremost are AI foundation models, which are trained on a broad set of unlabeled data that can be used for different tasks, with additional fine-tuning.&nbsp;Complex math and enormous computing power are required to create these trained models, but they are, in essence, prediction algorithms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Today, generative AI most commonly creates content in response to natural language requests — it doesn’t require knowledge of or entering code — but the <a href=""/content/gartner/en/information-technology/topics/ai-strategy-for-business.html"">enterprise use cases</a> are numerous and include innovations in drug and chip design and material science development.

But generative AI only hit mainstream headlines in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of very human-seeming interactions.</p>\r\n<p><a href=""/content/gartner/en/articles/your-7-biggest-chatgpt-questions-answered.html"">ChatGPT</a>, launched by OpenAI, became wildly popular overnight and galvanized public attention. (OpenAI’s DALL·E 2 tool similarly generates images from text in a related generative AI innovation.)</p>\r\n<p>Gartner sees generative AI becoming a general-purpose technology with an impact similar to that of the steam engine, electricity and the internet. The hype will subside as the reality of implementation sets in, but the impact of generative AI will grow as people and enterprises discover more innovative applications for the technology in daily work and life.</p>\r\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What are the benefits and applications of generative AI?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '<p>Foundation models, including generative pretrained transformers (which drives ChatGPT), are among the AI architecture innovations that can be used to automate, augment humans or machines, and autonomously execute business and IT processes.\xa0</p>\r\n<p>The benefits of generative AI include faster product development, enhanced customer experience and improved employee productivity, but the specifics depend on the use case. End users should be realistic about the value they are looking to achieve, especially when using a service as is, which has major limitations. Generative AI creates artifacts that can be inaccurate or biased, making human validation essential and potentially limiting the time it saves workers. Gartner recommends connecting use cases to KPIs to ensure that any project either improves operational efficiency or creates net new revenue or better experiences.</p>\r\n<p>In a recent Gartner webinar poll of more than 2,500 executives, 38% indicated that customer experience and retention is the primary purpose of their generative AI investments. This was followed by revenue growth (26%), cost optimization (17%) and business continuity (7%).</p>\r\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What are the risks of generative AI?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '<p>The risks associated with generative AI are significant and rapidly evolving. A wide array of threat actors have already used the technology to create “deep fakes” or copies of products, and generate artifacts to support increasingly complex scams.</p>\r\n<p>ChatGPT and other tools like it are trained on large amounts of publicly available data. They are not designed to be compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other copyright laws, so it’s imperative to pay close attention to your enterprises’ uses of the platforms.\xa0</p>\r\n<p>Oversight risks to monitor include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><strong>Lack of transparency.</strong> Generative AI and ChatGPT models are unpredictable, and not even the companies behind them always understand everything about how they work.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Accuracy.</strong> Generative AI systems sometimes produce inaccurate and fabricated answers. Assess all outputs for accuracy, appropriateness and actual usefulness before relying on or publicly distributing information.\xa0</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Bias.</strong> You need policies or controls in place to detect biased outputs and deal with them in a manner consistent with company policy and any relevant legal requirements.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Intellectual property (IP) and copyright.</strong> There are currently no verifiable data governance and protection assurances regarding confidential enterprise information. Users should assume that any data or queries they enter into the ChatGPT and its competitors will become public information, and we advise enterprises to put in place controls to avoid inadvertently exposing IP.\xa0</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><strong>Cybersecurity and fraud.</strong> Enterprises must prepare for malicious actors’ use of generative AI systems for cyber and fraud attacks, such as those that use deep fakes for social engineering of personnel, and ensure mitigating controls are put in place. Confer with your cyber-insurance provider to verify the degree to which your existing policy covers AI-related breaches.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Sustainability.</strong> Generative AI uses significant amounts of electricity. Choose vendors that reduce power consumption and leverage high-quality renewable energy to mitigate the impact on your sustainability goals.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Gartner also recommends considering the following questions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>Who defines responsible use of generative AI, especially as cultural norms evolve and social engineering approaches vary across geographies? Who ensures compliance? What are the consequences for irresponsible use?\u200b</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>In the event something goes wrong, how can individuals take action?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>How do users give and remove consent (opt in or opt out)? What can be learned from the privacy debate?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Will using generative AI help or hurt trust in your organization — and institutions overall?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>How can we ensure that content creators and owners keep control of their IP and are compensated fairly? What should new economic models look like?\xa0</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Who will ensure proper functioning throughout the entire life cycle, and how will they do so? Do boards need an AI ethics lead, for example?</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Finally, it’s important to continually monitor regulatory developments and litigation regarding generative AI. China and Singapore have already put in place new regulations regarding the use of generative AI, while Italy temporarily. The U.S., Canada, India, the U.K. and the EU are currently shaping their regulatory environments.</p>\r\n<p>Also see, “<a href=""#q7"">What are the best practices for using generative AI?</a>” and “<a href=""#q9"">Should I craft a usage policy for generative AI?</a>”</p>\r\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'What are some practical uses of generative AI today?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '<p>The field of generative AI will progress rapidly in both scientific discovery and technology commercialization, but use cases are emerging quickly in creative content, content improvement, synthetic data, generative engineering and generative design.\xa0</p>\r\n<p>In-use, high-level practical applications today include the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p><strong>Written content augmentation and creation:</strong> Producing a “draft” output of text in a desired style and length</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Question answering and discovery:</strong> Enabling users to locate answers to input, based on data and prompt information</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Tone:</strong> Text manipulation, to soften language or professionalize text</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Summarization:</strong> Offering shortened versions of conversations, articles, emails and webpages</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Simplification:</strong> Breaking down titles, creating outlines and extracting key content</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Classification of content for specific use cases:</strong> Sorting by sentiment, topic, etc.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Chatbot performance improvement:</strong> Bettering “sentity” extraction, whole-conversation sentiment classification and generation of journey flows from general descriptions</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Software coding:</strong> Code generation, translation, explanation and verification</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Emerging use cases with long-term impacts include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>Creating medical images that show the future development of a disease\u200b</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Synthetic data helping augment scarce data, mitigate bias, preserve data privacy and simulate future scenarios</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Applications proactively suggesting additional actions to users and providing them with information</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Legacy code modernization</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'How will generative AI contribute business value?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '<p>Generative AI provides new and disruptive opportunities to increase revenue, reduce costs, improve productivity and better manage risk.

These may include new drugs, less toxic household cleaners, novel flavors and fragrances, new alloys, and faster and better diagnoses.</p>\r\n<p><strong>New revenue channels:</strong> Gartner research shows that enterprises with greater levels of AI maturity will gain greater benefits to their revenue.</p>\r\n<h4>Cost and productivity opportunities</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Worker augmentation:</strong> Generative AI can augment workers’ ability to draft and edit text, images and other media. It can also summarize, simplify and classify content; generate, translate and verify software code; and improve chatbot performance. At this stage, the technology is highly proficient at creating a wide range of artifacts quickly and at scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Long-term talent optimization:</strong> Employees will be distinguished by their ability to conceive, execute and refine ideas, projects, processes, services and relationships in partnership with AI. This symbiotic relationship will accelerate time to proficiency and greatly extend the range and competency of workers across the board.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Process improvement:</strong> Generative AI can derive real, in-context value from vast stores of content, which until now may have gone largely unexploited. This will change workflows.</p>\r\n<h4>Risk opportunities</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Risk mitigation:</strong> Generative AI’s ability to analyze and provide broader and deeper visibility of data, such as customer transactions and potentially faulty software code, enhances pattern recognition and the ability to identify potential risks to the enterprise more quickly.\xa0</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Generative AI may help enterprises comply with <a href=""/content/gartner/en/insights/sustainable-business.html"">sustainability</a> regulations, mitigate the risk of stranded assets, and embed sustainability into decision making, product design and processes.</p>\r\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Which industries are most impacted by generative AI?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '<p>Generative AI will affect the pharmaceutical, manufacturing, media, architecture, interior design, engineering, automotive, aerospace, defense, medical, electronics and energy industries by augmenting core processes with AI models.

You don’t want hallucinations to harm your business.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Prize transparency.</strong> Be forthcoming with people, whether they be staff, customers or citizens, about the fact that they are interacting with a machine by clearly labeling any conversation multiple times throughout.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Do your due diligence.</strong> Set up processes and guardrails to track biases and other issues of trustworthiness. Do so by validating results and continually testing for the model going off course.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Address privacy and security concerns.</strong> Ensure that sensitive data is neither input nor derived. Confirm with the model provider that this data won’t be used for machine learning beyond your organization.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Take it slow.</strong> Keep functionality in beta for an extended period of time.

Generative AI will significantly alter their jobs, whether it be by creating text, images, hardware designs, music, video or something else. In response, workers will need to become content editors, which requires a different set of skills than content creation.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the way the workforce interacts with applications will change as applications become conversational, proactive and interactive, requiring a redesigned user experience. In the near term, generative AI models will move beyond responding to natural language queries and begin suggesting things you didn’t ask for. For example, your request for a data-driven bar chart might be answered with alternative graphics the model suspects you could use. In theory at least, this will increase worker productivity, but it also challenges conventional thinking about the need for humans to take the lead on developing strategy.</p>\r\n<p>The net change in the workforce will vary dramatically depending on such factors as industry, location, size and offerings of the enterprise.</p>\r\n'}}, {'@type': 'Question', 'name': 'Where should I start with generative AI?', 'acceptedAnswer': {'@type': 'Answer', 'text': '<p>Many enterprises have generative AI pilots for code generation, text generation or visual design underway. To establish a pilot, you can take one of three routes:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><p><strong>Off-the-shelf.</strong> Use an existing foundational model directly by inputting prompts. You might, for example, ask the model to create a job description for a software engineer or suggest alternative subject lines for marketing emails.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p><strong>Prompt engineering.</strong> Program and connect software to and leverage a foundational model. This technique, which is the most common of the three, allows you to use public services while protecting IP and leveraging private data to create more precise, specific and useful responses. Building an HR benefits chatbot that answers employee questions about company-specific policies is an example of prompt engineering.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Custom.</strong> Building a new foundational model goes beyond the reach of most companies, but it’s possible to tune a model.

Small and midsize enterprises may derive significant business value from the free versions of public, openly hosted applications, such as ChatGPT, or by paying low subscription fees. For example, OpenAI is currently $20 per user per month. However, free and low-cost options come with minimal protection of enterprise data and associated output risks.</p>\r\n<p>Larger enterprises and those that desire greater analysis or use of their own enterprise data with higher levels of security and IP and privacy protections will need to invest in a range of custom services. This can include building licensed, customizable and proprietary models with data and machine learning platforms, and will require working with vendors and partners. In this instance, costs can be in the millions of dollars.</p>\r\n<p>It’s also worth noting that generative AI capabilities will increasingly be built into the software products you likely use everyday, like Bing, Office 365, Microsoft 365 Copilot and Google Workspace.

What might take a human copywriter between 60 and 90 minutes to write, the AI could do in 10 minutes or less.Around four months after the AI was introduced, Mr Meadowcroft's four-strong team was laid off.Mr Meadowcroft can't be certain, but he's pretty sure the AI replaced them.""I did laugh-off the idea of AI replacing writers, or affecting my job, until it did,"" he said.The latest wave of AI hit late last year when OpenAI launched ChatGPT.Backed by Microsoft, ChatGPT can give human-like responses to questions and can, in minutes, generate essays, speeches, even recipes.Other tech giants are scrambling to launch their own systems - Google launched Bard in March.While not perfect, such systems are trained on the ocean of data available on the internet - an amount of information impossible for even a team of humans to digest.So that's left many wondering which jobs might be at risk.More technology of business:Can Amsterdam make the circular economy work?The 'exploding' demand for giant heat pumpsThe chip maker that became an AI superpowerWhy car parks are the hottest space in solar powerProtein's power is being uncovered and unleashedEarlier this year, a report from Goldman Sachs said that AI could potentially replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.Any job losses would not fall equally across the economy. According to the report, 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated, but only 6% in construction and 4% in maintenance.The report also points out that the introduction of AI could boost productivity and growth and might create new jobs.There is some evidence of that already. Getty ImagesIKEA has retrained thousands of call centre workers as design advisersThis month IKEA said that, since 2021, it has retrained 8,500 staff who worked in its call centres as design advisers.The furniture giant says that 47% of customer calls are now handled by an AI called Billie. While IKEA does not see any job losses resulting from its use of AI, such developments are making many people worried.A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which polled 12,000 workers from around the world, found that a third were worried that they would be replaced at work by AI, with frontline staff more concerned than managers. Jessica Apotheker from BCG says that's partly due to fear of the unknown. ""When you look at leaders and managers, we have more than 80% of them that use AI at least on a weekly basis. When you look at frontline staff, that number drops to 20% so with the lack of familiarity with the tech comes much more anxiety and concern on the outcomes for them.""But perhaps there is good reason to be anxious.Alejandro GraueAlejandro Graue lost voiceover work to an AI systemFor three months last year, Alejandro Graue had been doing voiceover work for a popular YouTube channel.It seemed to be a promising line of work, a whole YouTube channel in English had to be re-voiced in Spanish. Mr Graue went on holiday late last year confident that there would be work when he returned.""I was expecting to have that money to live with - I have two daughters, so I need the money,"" he says.But to his surprise, before he returned to work, the YouTube channel uploaded a new video in Spanish - one he had not worked on.""When I clicked on it, what I heard was not my voice, but an AI generated voice - a very badly synced voiceover. It was terrible. And I was like, What is this? Is this like going to be my new partner in crime like the channel? Or is this going to replace me?"" he says.A phone call to the studio he worked for confirmed the worst. The client wanted to experiment with AI because it was cheaper and faster.That experiment turned out to be a failure. Viewers complained about the quality of the voiceover and eventually the channel took down the videos that featured the AI-generated voice.But Mr Graue did not find that very comforting. He thinks the technology will only improve and wonders where that will leave voiceover artists like him.""If this starts to happen in every job that I have, what should I do? Should I buy a farm? I don't know.  What other job could I look for that is not going to be replaced as well in the future? It's very complicated,"" he says.If AI is not coming for your job then it is likely you might have to start working with one in some way.After a few months of freelance work, former copywriter Dean Meadowcroft took a new direction.He now works for an employee assistance provider, which gives wellbeing and mental health advice to staff. Working with AI is now part of his job.""I think that is where the future is for AI, giving quick access to human-led content, as opposed to completely eliminating that human aspect,"" he says.You can see the full interviews with Dean Meadowcroft and Alejandro Graue on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst on BBC News.Viewers in the UK can watch on BBC iPlayer from 11:30 on Saturday.

The consultancy analyzed 63 use cases for the technology and ultimately estimated the tech could add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion to the global economy.These types of figures should of course be taken with a grain of salt; research reports predicted a multitrillion-dollar metaverse market before tech and media giants began divesting from the space more recently.Nevertheless, here are some of the ways that McKinsey’s report predicts generative AI might transform the economy and workplace.Workplace automation: The report estimates that generative AI, in addition to existing types of machine learning and other technologies, could automate tasks that take up between 60% to 70% of a typical worker’s day. Currently, around 25% of “total work time” consists of natural language-related tasks that might be handled by generative AI, according to the report.Because of its increasing ability to handle language-related tasks, the report’s authors suggest that the tech will have a greater impact on “more-educated workers,” compared with previous waves of automation, which tended to hit occupations in the middle-wage distribution hardest.Customer service is key: The report found that about three-quarters of generative AI’s value will be concentrated in four areas: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D. That means uses like helping customer service reps address problems, generating creative material for advertisements, and turning natural language commands into computer code.The report’s authors wrote that the ability to instantaneously produce personalized answers to complex customer questions with a consistent brand voice and pull up relevant data about an individual are some of the ways AI could “transform” customer service.Key use cases for banking: As an industry already transformed by predictive and analytical AI, banking stands to see changes from this next generation of automation across customer service, marketing, and risk model documentation, according to the report. Other industries ripe for transformation include retail and consumer packaged goods, where generative AI might “draft playbooks for negotiating with suppliers”; and pharmaceuticals and medical products, where the tech could help with new drug formulations and drafting legal documents, the report said.CopyYou might also like...AILexisNexis taps news outlet deals for AI business research toolPatrick Kulp / 07.18.2024Future of TravelWhy US auto regulators are turning to tech to help reduce traffic fatalitiesJordyn Grzelewski / 07.17.2024Future of TravelMercedes-Benz and Starbucks team up to expand EV fast chargingJordyn Grzelewski / 07.17.2024Keep up with the innovative tech transforming businessTech Brew keeps business leaders up-to-date on the latest innovations, automation advances, policy shifts, and more, so they can make informed decisions about tech.Try it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s an understandable nervousness among any workforce when you start talking about automation. It’s actually been 10 years since Oxford University academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne released their seminal paper entitled The Future of Employment which contained a list of occupations with an automation probability score. It was the paper that launched a spate of headlines claiming robots were coming for our jobs.
For field services teams, this has been a slow burn. As the paper suggests, “the manual tasks of service occupations are less susceptible to computerisation, as they require a higher degree of flexibility and physical adaptability.” And yet, the workforce is under pressure, not so much from automation but from the fact that it is ageing. To compound the problem, not enough millennials and Gen Zers are seeing the profession as an attractive career option.
According to recent research into the future of field service, almost three-quarters of companies (73%) identify an ageing workforce as a potential threat to their field service operations. Meanwhile, over two-thirds (67%) of companies feel that technology plays a key role in attracting new talent to a field service organization. The challenge is which technologies and to what extent an organization commits.
What is becoming increasingly clear is that AI and automation are going to play a significant role in field service operations. Generative AI is going to be at the heart of this. US-based organization OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, believes it has the ability “to limit the impact of a shrinking and ageing field service workforce in several ways.”
Next-generation workforce
Field service has a major workforce recruitment and retention problem. The majority of the workforce is nearing retirement which means that we are losing their expertise, their knowledge and their ability to complete work. It also leaves a void that is not being filled by new entrants who are not as interested in the type of work being done in field service. This is where the capabilities of ChatGPT can be transformational. But the outgoing workforce isn’t really where the potential lies. The real value lies in the next-generation workforce.
ChatGPT can help organizations capture and organize the unstructured knowledge and experience of the experienced workforce and make it accessible in a format that is desirable for the next generation of workers. As opposed to viewing paper manuals, calling a friend, and completing countless forms to close out a service job, consider an experience where an engineer has access to relevant and contextual information via a query, with work instructions overlayed visually via Augmented Reality, and work summarized and documented via generative AI.
While it might seem futuristic, it’s the type of vision for field service that organizations must have to create a marketable product for the next generation workforce. These potential entrants are digitally native, they’ve grown up on the tools of today and are constantly tinkering with the likes of ChatGPT.
Organizations must be able to provide these technologically-savant workers with the tools, information, and working models that they are already familiar with to make the profession of field service more relevant. If organizations can provide them with a way to engage with the experience and knowledge of former generations to become more proficient in the craft, open up new opportunities for learning and growth, and create working opportunities that could be remote-first or data-focused, then it changes the profile of what a career in field service looks like.
Role of technology
The point is that automation can enable field engineers to do their jobs more efficiently and effectively. Of course, organizations must be diligent about where and how generative AI is used, as it can give confidently wrong answers. Although humans are no different in that regard, it is important to install guardrails against generative AI introducing inaccuracies into the content it generates. By automating mundane tasks and improving asset intelligence, field service teams can optimize work schedules, parts ordering and parts delivery times. This reduces unnecessary truck rolls and improves customer satisfaction through more accurate and efficient maintenance work. Collaboration between support teams and engineers on a common platform and using real-time asset data also helps to identify opportunities for new contracts or device upgrades.
There are, of course, some things technology cannot replace, such as engineer experience, but this is about how to use technology to manage skills gaps, attract new engineers and even unretire some of the older ones. The technology is there to make the job easier and more effective. Regardless of age, that has to be a good thing.

AbstractArtificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and data science models may hold potential for enabling an understanding of global health inequities and support decision-making related toward possible interventions. However, AI inputs should not perpetuate the biases and structural issues within our global societies that have created various health inequities. We need AI to be able to ‘see’ the full context of what it is meant to learn. AI trained with biased data produces biased outputs and providing health workforce training with such outputs further contributes to the buildup of biases and structural inequities. The accelerating and intricately evolving technology and digitalization will influence the education and practice of health care workers. Before we invest in utilizing AI in health workforce training globally, it is important to make sure that multiple stakeholders from the global arena are included in the conversation to address the need for training in ‘AI and the role of AI in training’. This is a daunting task for any one entity and a multi-sectorial interactions and solutions are needed. We believe that partnerships among various national, regional, and global stakeholders involved directly or indirectly with health workforce training ranging to name a few, from public health & clinical science training institutions, computer science, learning design, data science, technology companies, social scientists, law, and AI ethicists, need to be developed in ways that enable the formation of an equitable and sustainable Communities of Practice (CoP) to address the use of AI for global health workforce training. This paper has laid out a framework for such CoP.


Peer Review reports

IntroductionIn 1950, the English mathematician Alan Turing wrote a landmark paper titled “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” posing the question: “Can machines think?” This led to further exploration of the use of machines to support human decision-making with a 1956 workshop, organized by John McCarthy, an American mathematician, that focused on the “study of artificial intelligence.” [1] The field was born. Yet, more than a half-century later, we are still struggling with a definition; artificial intelligence (AI) is most often being defined more in “what its capabilities are rather than strictly defining what it is.” [2] In this commentary, we will use McCarthy’s definition that describes AI as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, through algorithms or a set of rules, which the machine follows to mimic human cognitive functions, such as learning and problem solving” [3] as this definition provides a blend of both its capabilities and what it is. Within healthcare, AI applications such as image processing for improved cancer detection, that have been created are being refined using computer science techniques such as machine learning. Machine learning (ML) uses mathematical data models or algorithms to “mimic” human reasoning and therefore relies on multiple algorithmic approaches such as neural networks, deep learning, natural language processing, and others. [4]This commentary is a call to action for engaging in a global community of discourse and innovation to address health workforce training so that AI technology is not the driver but rather the support for human decision-making. We need AI to be able to ‘see’ the full context of what it is meant to learn. AI trained with biased data produces biased outputs and providing health workforce training with such outputs further contributes to the buildup of biases and structural inequities. AI-based tools have “the potential to worsen health inequities if implemented without deliberate action to ensure fairness and there is a need for all clinicians to understand the social, ethical, legal, and regulatory issues that will determine whether AI-based tools will narrow or widen health disparities and health care gaps.” [5] The pandemic left the world without much choice in the adoption of new technologies; however, given that now there is a choice, it is imperative that we consider the adoption of technologies in global health workforce training, especially AI, with care and ask, ‘who are we leaving behind?’ and ‘what can we do about it to mitigate the risk of widening health disparities?’ As Alondra Nelson at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University, stated, “We need to be honest about the past and how science and technology have harmed some communities, left out communities, and left people out of doing the work of science and technology."" [6] Before we invest in utilizing AI in health workforce training globally it is important to make sure that multiple stakeholders from the global arena are included in the conversation to address “the need for training in AI and the role of AI in training.”[7]Why is a collaboration among various stakeholders needed in the use of Artificial Intelligence for global health workforce training?The accelerating and intricately evolving AI technology and digitalization has and will influence the education and practice of health care workers. Therefore, there is the urgency of need to organize and collaborate among the various local, regional, national, and global stakeholders involved directly or indirectly with health workforce training.When addressing AI for global health workforce training, we seek to provide a framework that enables the global health workforce to enter into the conversation on the use of AI in supporting human decision-making. The proposed framework addresses “the duality that health professions educators must consider now: the need for training in AI and the role of AI in training.” [7] We believe that partnerships among local, regional, national, and global stakeholders involved directly or indirectly with health workforce training, ranging to name a few, from public health & clinical science training institutions, computer science, learning design, data science, technology companies, social scientists, law, and AI ethicists, need to be developed in ways that enable the formation of equitable and sustainable Communities of Practice (CoP). CoPs are “groups of people who share a concern or an interest for something they do and, as they regularly interact, they learn to do it better.” [8]Given that AI advances influence most disciplines, it is important to ensure that a CoP brings the diversity of voices for peer-to-peer learning to be meaningful. Having an established CoP could address crosscutting challenges. For example, if a medical school wanted to explore how to introduce AI into the medical education curriculum, the research team could include computer scientists, ethicists, medical education specialists, healthcare practitioners, students, and others. Through such collaboration, the team could research ways that AI could be taught in medical school to develop decision-making skills related to AI-supported applications.Another team might be interested to examine human bias in machine learning in relation to the use of AI in healthcare. Instead of only having data science-focused discussions, a transdisciplinary team could be formed from the CoP members that bring data scientists, ethicists, social scientists, clinicians, and other stakeholders together to examine the sources of bias in datasets and AI systems through societal, structural, and technical perspectives so as to identify harm and impact. This would allow for an elevated discussion on how to design, use, and/or question the AI-powered systems with an equity lens ideally before adoption of AI in health workforce education.CoP at the local, national, regional, and global levels across the professions is needed. We believe that the proposed CoP model, when applied with intentionality, can enhance knowledge about AI and allow voices from across the globe to guide the conversation based on their own contextual needs.An equitable and sustainable community of practice framework to address the use of Artificial Intelligence for global health workforce trainingBased on our experience in developing global health workforce-related CoPs [9], we envision that a sustainable and equitable CoP needs to address five structural pillars: governance, project management, partnership, stakeholder engagement, and outreach to enhance cross-fertilization of AI knowledge and adaptations of new AI knowledge among local, national, regional, and global stakeholders. The following seven components need to be in place to ensure that the pillars remain standing: (1) building and interconnecting interdisciplinary, stakeholder-initiated Technical Working-Learning Groups (TWLGs); (2) nurturing in-depth Exchanges of key stakeholders; (3) hosting an Annual Event for cross-fertilization of ideas among stakeholders; (4) promoting scholarship and partnerships with leading journals; (5) developing a website, to serve as a ‘digital town center’ of the CoP; (6) producing and distributing a Newsletter, and (7) hosting monthly transdisciplinary webinars and workshops that address AI-related topics that inform and educate from basic to advanced topics in relation to AI and health workforce training to ultimately support health equity. Figure 1 shows the connections among the broader context, the pillars, and the components.Fig. 1Framework of CoP: context, pillars, and componentsFull size imageThe following descriptions provide a brief explanation as to the need for each pillar. In addition, we propose a set of components that could be conducted to advance the knowledge about AI within the health workforce training space. We are sharing this level of detail as part of our call to action to note that it is critical to formalize such an effort so as to demonstrate the breadth and depth of the reach of the CoP’s activities. Intentionality in designing the interactions across all CoP components among all stakeholders is key to the collaborative nature of the proposed effort.

1.
Governance: includes recruiting, coordinating, and establishing a consortium of institutions and organizations that have a core mission to develop an equitable and sustainable AI CoP to advance knowledge of AI for informing health workforce training and also that aims to include under-represented or underserved groups impacted by health disparities. To enable smooth coordination and communication across the CoP, we propose an agreed upon timeline governance meeting that will aid in establishing an organizational structure for the CoP. At the local, national, regional, and global levels, there is a need for the presence of a coordinating entity that will carry out the duties of the governance pillar. This coordinating center can be situated within the Ministries of Health and Education, or in an international, regional, and local health and education governance entity.


2.
Project management: The aim of this pillar is to address the overall goal of the CoP, to establish an organizational and project management structure, and to create a system that is visible for tracking the CoP activities across all input activities, output areas, and coordinating efforts. This system will help streamline and track the various milestones. Regular reporting of the status of activities across all CoP efforts would need to be shared. It is essential to maintain an agile approach in project planning and implementation to be responsive to external and internal requests, as needed. The project management team would coordinate and manage the integration of the CoP work activities among CoP participants and leverage the strengths and synergies of the CoP.


3.
Partnerships: The aims of this pillar are multiple.

To establish trusted relationships with health disparities groups, educators, computer, and data scientists to examine the data used in AI research and applications as well as how machine learning models are constructed.


To build capacity among partners for seizing opportunities that catalyze rapid advancements in AI capabilities within their own contexts.


To ensure coordination among the different activities, many of which will be interdependent, while at the same time balancing the need for a deliberate and strategic approach to building lasting partnerships and infrastructure.




To address the partnership goals, we have integrated three components: an Annual Symposium, a Site Visit Exchange, and a capacity-building program on Algorithmic Literacy that offers continuing education credits.


Annual symposium
Conducting an annual symposium will be highly valuable for fostering partnership among all CoP stakeholders. This will be a venue where the stakeholders will present findings, share ideas, learn from each other, and expand their knowledge. A steering committee that includes a CoP representative of each stakeholder will set the theme and components of the annual symposium. The role of the steering committee will be to provide balance and transparency to the various participant groups while building a substantive program.


Site visit exchange
CoP members need to conduct site visit exchanges to connect with peers among the institutions involved in the CoP. These sites visit exchanges aim to cross-fertilize ideas, and identify gap areas for research to move the pendulum for equitable and sustainable AI in global health workforce training toward tangible positive outcomes.


Algorithmic literacy program
This could be an online program that offers those taking it the opportunity for continuing education credits. It would be designed with a storytelling approach to help those participating explore AI in relation to healthcare applications. Topics could include, but are not limited to, human bias and AI, human and machine learning. CoP members could form a transdisciplinary team to develop each topic.



4.
Stakeholder engagement: The aim of this pillar area is to establish and sustain meaningful virtual and in-person learning opportunities to engage all CoP stakeholders, ensuring coordination among the different activities, many of which will be interdependent, and building lasting relationships among stakeholders that can serve as a sustainable CoP. We have integrated three components: Town-Center (website), Technical Working-Learning Groups (TWLGs), and Monthly Webinars and Workshops.



Town-center (CoP website)
The CoP website serves as a “digital town square” for the full CoP community and for potential collaborators and stakeholders. Its home page could feature among many things “Noteworthy News” and “Noteworthy Events,” video clips of CoP stories. CoP webinars will also be featured. It could contain a library page (repository) on AI in health workforce education, AI ethics, data science, and other relevant topics based on an initial survey and needs of the CoP stakeholders.





Technical Working-Learning Groups (TWLGs)

By working collaboratively across all CoP stakeholders, the aim is for the CoP, to identify and establish TWLGs that can meet and dig deeper into a pertinent topic area such as AI Ethics, Health Equity, Data Research Techniques, AI applications, and others. The TWLGS will be led by members from the CoP who have an interest in that specific area. Each of the TWLG activities is determined by TWLG members.





Hosting regular webinars and workshops

After identifying the learning gaps of the CoP, there will be a need to conduct regular webinars and workshops with synchronous and asynchronous discussion led by peers.




5.
Outreach: The aim of this pillar is to enhance connections among CoP stakeholders and to welcome new ones by sharing the work that CoP members are doing more broadly. This is a critical pillar as it is a path toward sustainability of efforts and reach. We have integrated two components: a Newsletter and a Special Journal Supplement as well as provisions for presentations at research conferences. In addition to these two components, the annual symposium also plays a key role in bringing in other vital stakeholders.





CoP newsletter

One of the mandates of the CoP is to construct a communication platform to facilitate engagement among the CoP consortium. A steering committee composed of the various CoP members could outline the contents and dissemination of the Newsletter. The newsletter could highlight a topic tackled by the CoP consortium members, serves the TWLGs for the sharing of tools, literature, and best practices, and also highlights articles that show the breadth and depth of the CoP efforts. This is a space where all voices can be included.





CoP-wide publication in a leading journal as a journal supplement

This component expands the work of the CoP members into scholarship. It would disseminate the knowledge created through CoP efforts focusing on the transdisciplinary nature of the work. It is customary for various disciplines to publish papers in journals that cater to the outputs of their respective disciplines. Since this CoP is an amalgamation of various disciplines, creating sustainable and equitable opportunities for sharing will need to traverse many discipline areas. Thus, this gives an opportunity to publish in various discipline journals such as suggested are IEEE, Human Resources for Health, Health Equity journal, etc., but the exact journal will be decided collaboratively with the CoP members.


The following table (Table 1) can be used as a checklist for those interested in supporting such efforts for advancing knowledge of AI for global health workforce training. It includes key outcomes based on the five pillars and is shared here as an example of how operations and outcomes can be used as a way to make the process transparent among key stakeholders.Table 1 Example of operational blueprint of outcomes for structuring CoPsFull size tableThe CoP framework described in this commentary offers us a way to humanize artificial intelligence and machine learning by understanding what is behind the scenes of an application or a set of recommendations. This allows us to put those we serve in front. A transdisciplinary CoP has the potential to offer a stable foundation to address health equity issues within and across boundaries and borders. The links formed across the CoP members will strengthen the recruitment of new members and we believe will serve to promote transdisciplinary research teams. To ensure visibility of the efforts across the various connections, we recommend using Social Network Mapping and Analysis to show and understand the connections that will be forming across the various activities. Figure 2 shows an example of how such a diagram could serve both as a research and a communication tool.Fig. 2Example of Social Network Mapping of how we can represent the CoP members.

Currently, across the national, regional, and global arenas, the need for capacity building among health workforce education entities to address the risks and opportunities related to the advancement of AI technologies is palpable. Therefore, there is the urgency of need to organize and collaborate among the various local, regional, national, and global stakeholders involved directly or indirectly with health workforce training.We have offered a framework for the creation of a transdisciplinary community of practice (CoPs) that focuses on artificial intelligence in health workforce training. The CoP framework offers us the opportunity to tackle this challenge from various disciplinary lenses. It enables us to learn to speak each other’s language. We might find that algorithmic literacy is not simply a continuing education approach but a core competency across all disciplines. The proposed CoP framework we propose has been tested within medical education and it works because of its simplicity and above all because of its inclusivity.Artificial intelligence is propagating and, if embraced, it can be useful within health and public health workforce expertise areas; however, if we, as experts in health and education systems, do not partner with those working on the creation of AI tools, then we run into allowing AI to drive human decision-making rather than guiding it. Understanding what recommendations we get from AI, how these recommendations were formulated, and whether or not to implement them within the context of global health workforce training is no longer a nice to have task, but a must-have.

Accenture will invest $3bn over three years in its data and artificial intelligence (AI) practice, which will include adding 40,000 AI experts to the workforce, making acquisitions and training existing staff.
AI-skilled staff will be added through hiring, training and acquisition, said Accenture.
The IT services giant said it would use the data and AI practice to develop services for 19 specific industry sectors based on AI to take advantage of what it described as the generative AI “megatrend” in its recent technology vision report.
Following the $3bn investment announcement, Paul Daugherty, group chief executive at Accenture Technology, said: “Over the next decade, AI will be a megatrend, transforming industries, companies, and the way we live and work, as generative AI transforms 40% of all working hours.
“Our expanded data and AI practice brings together the full power and breadth of Accenture in creating industry-specific solutions that will help our clients harness AI’s full potential to reshape their strategy, technology and ways of working, driving innovation and value responsibly and faster than ever before.”







As part of the investment, Accenture said it would double its AI talent pool to 80,000.
Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said: “Companies that build a strong foundation of AI by adopting and scaling it now, where the technology is mature and delivers clear value, will be better positioned to reinvent, compete and achieve new levels of performance. Our clients have complex environments, and at a time when the technology is changing rapidly, our deep understanding of ecosystem solutions allows us to help them navigate quickly and cost-effectively to make smart decisions.”
Accenture has already established a company-wide team, the generative AI and large language lodel (LLM) center of excellence. It has also published its A new era of generative AI for everyone study of generative AI/LLM, advising businesses on the use of the technology.
In March, when announcing its annual tech vision, Accenture said the distance between digital and physical worlds would “collapse” over the next 10 years, with the adoption of generative AI accelerating change.
A study of nearly 5,000 senior executives across the globe, which was part of Accenture’s tech vision report, When atoms meet bits: The foundations of our new reality, revealed 96% believe the convergence of the digital and physical worlds will transform business in the next 10 years.

Now, with the acceleration wrought by generative AI as well as other emerging technologies tech leaders must build long-term strategies to address the growing demands on the technology organization. While many tech leaders had hoped that last year’s wave of tech layoffs would lead to opportunities in the marketplace, they instead have seen the number of open tech roles continue to rise, and the tech unemployment hovers around 2%. And, many of those laid-off tech workers went straight back to tech industry jobs, preferring to take their chances with a start-up or smaller tech company, rather than join a non-tech company. Thus, tech execs must take short- and long-term action to address their tech talent gaps.

AI Gives Technology Leaders More Control Over Tech Talent Supply

The demand for tech is big and growing. There isn’t much you can do about that. But you can do something about tech talent supply. Technology leaders will be able to narrow capacity gaps using AI-driven technology, enabling tech execs to scale up innovation as they build capacity. Tech leaders are turning to the following technologies to take control of their technology supply challenges:





TuringBots support developers in designing, developing, testing, and deploying code. This results in faster development times and improved quality.
Low-code platforms turn everyone into a citizen engineer, embedding development capabilities across the business, both enabling the business to take on more accountability in developing solutions and freeing up highly skilled developers to focus on more complex challenges.
Automation makes us work smarter, as organizations use process mining to design human-centric, highly automated workflows to replace traditional processes. Highly skilled technology talent can spend less time on highly predictable work and more time focused on creating high-value customer experiences.
Widespread generative AI tools will change the nature of administrative and creative work. We will spend less time collecting and analyzing information and more time focused on how we can create and deliver enhanced experiences for customers.


Build Emerging Technology Impact In Your Technology Talent Strategy Now
These emerging technologies will change how technology organizations deliver. As TuringBots develop higher and higher quality code, developers will spend more time editing, fine-tuning, and solving more complex challenges. Generative-AI-enabled virtual assistants will mean that project managers will spend more time managing stakeholder relationships and driving alignment to customer needs. These shifts in how work is done impact your organizational talent and skills profile. Leading organizations will look not only be looking for highly sought-after AI specialists who can build and apply advanced AI-driven models that will transform how we do work, but will also be seeking out or upskilling individuals who are able to creatively apply emerging technology solutions such as GenAI to deliver work, and who are confident in both applying technology and effectively managing its risks. Skills such as organizational change management, problem-solving, and creative thinking, all become even more valuable, as we increasingly use technology to create outputs. Having access to these skills, and being able to scale them across the organization to take advantage of these technology advantages, will be a key differentiator for technology organizations, so technology leaders must plan ahead to develop their approach to upskilling and skill acquisition.

In 2022, an AI-generated work of art won the Colorado State Fair’s art competition. The artist, Jason Allen, had used Midjourney – a generative AI system trained on art scraped from the internet – to create the piece. The process was far from fully automated: Allen went through some 900 iterations over 80 hours to create and refine his submission. 
Yet his use of AI to win the art competition triggered a heated backlash online, with one Twitter user claiming, “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes.”

As generative AI art tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion have been thrust into the limelight, so too have questions about ownership and authorship. 
These tools’ generative ability is the result of training them with scores of prior artworks, from which the AI learns how to create artistic outputs.
Should the artists whose art was scraped to train the models be compensated? Who owns the images that AI systems produce? Is the process of fine-tuning prompts for generative AI a form of authentic creative expression? 
On one hand, technophiles rave over work like Allen’s. But on the other, many working artists consider the use of their art to train AI to be exploitative.
We’re part of a team of 14 experts across disciplines that just published a paper on generative AI in Science magazine. In it, we explore how advances in AI will affect creative work, aesthetics and the media. One of the key questions that emerged has to do with U.S. copyright laws, and whether they can adequately deal with the unique challenges of generative AI.
Copyright laws were created to promote the arts and creative thinking. But the rise of generative AI has complicated existing notions of authorship.
Photography serves as a helpful lens
Generative AI might seem unprecedented, but history can act as a guide. 
Take the emergence of photography in the 1800s. Before its invention, artists could only try to portray the world through drawing, painting or sculpture. Suddenly, reality could be captured in a flash using a camera and chemicals. 
As with generative AI, many argued that photography lacked artistic merit. In 1884, the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in on the issue and found that cameras served as tools that an artist could use to give an idea visible form; the “masterminds” behind the cameras, the court ruled, should own the photographs they create. 
From then on, photography evolved into its own art form and even sparked new abstract artistic movements. 
AI can’t own outputs
Unlike inanimate cameras, AI possesses capabilities – like the ability to convert basic instructions into impressive artistic works – that make it prone to anthropomorphization. Even the term “artificial intelligence” encourages people to think that these systems have humanlike intent or even self-awareness.
This led some people to wonder whether AI systems can be “owners.” But the U.S. Copyright Office has stated unequivocally that only humans can hold copyrights.
So who can claim ownership of images produced by AI? Is it the artists whose images were used to train the systems? The users who type in prompts to create images? Or the people who build the AI systems?
Infringement or fair use?
While artists draw obliquely from past works that have educated and inspired them in order to create, generative AI relies on training data to produce outputs. 
This training data consists of prior artworks, many of which are protected by copyright law and which have been collected without artists’ knowledge or consent. Using art in this way might violate copyright law even before the AI generates a new work.

For Jason Allen to create his award-winning art, Midjourney was trained on 100 million prior works.
Was that a form of infringement? Or was it a new form of “fair use,” a legal doctrine that permits the unlicensed use of protected works if they’re sufficiently transformed into something new? 
While AI systems do not contain literal copies of the training data, they do sometimes manage to recreate works from the training data, complicating this legal analysis. 
Will contemporary copyright law favor end users and companies over the artists whose content is in the training data? 
To mitigate this concern, some scholars propose new regulations to protect and compensate artists whose work is used for training. These proposals include a right for artists to opt out of their data’s being used for generative AI or a way to automatically compensate artists when their work is used to train an AI.
Muddled ownership
Training data, however, is only part of the process. Frequently, artists who use generative AI tools go through many rounds of revision to refine their prompts, which suggests a degree of originality.
Answering the question of who should own the outputs requires looking into the contributions of all those involved in the generative AI supply chain.
The legal analysis is easier when an output is different from works in the training data. In this case, whoever prompted the AI to produce the output appears to be the default owner. 
However, copyright law requires meaningful creative input – a standard satisfied by clicking the shutter button on a camera. It remains unclear how courts will decide what this means for the use of generative AI. Is composing and refining a prompt enough? 
Matters are more complicated when outputs resemble works in the training data. If the resemblance is based only on general style or content, it is unlikely to violate copyright, because style is not copyrightable. 
The illustrator Hollie Mengert encountered this issue firsthand when her unique style was mimicked by generative AI engines in a way that did not capture what, in her eyes, made her work unique. Meanwhile, the singer Grimes embraced the tech, “open-sourcing” her voice and encouraging fans to create songs in her style using generative AI.
If an output contains major elements from a work in the training data, it might infringe on that work’s copyright. Recently, the Supreme Court ruled that Andy Warhol’s drawing of a photograph was not permitted by fair use. That means that using AI to just change the style of a work – say, from a photo to an illustration – is not enough to claim ownership over the modified output. 
While copyright law tends to favor an all-or-nothing approach, scholars at Harvard Law School have proposed new models of joint ownership that allow artists to gain some rights in outputs that resemble their works.
In many ways, generative AI is yet another creative tool that allows a new group of people access to image-making, just like cameras, paintbrushes or Adobe Photoshop. But a key difference is this new set of tools relies explicitly on training data, and therefore creative contributions cannot easily be traced back to a single artist. 
The ways in which existing laws are interpreted or reformed – and whether generative AI is appropriately treated as the tool it is – will have real consequences for the future of creative expression.

We cannot afford to make the same mistake again.”The Labour leader – who will offer his own vision for how to address fast-paced changes at a tech conference on Tuesday – said AI could be “both a tool and a threat”.RecommendedBoris Johnson: Sunak’s ‘talking rubbish’ – I didn’t ask PM to bend honours rulesLabour and Lib Dem cooperation key to defeating Tories at by-elections, top polling guru saysHumza Yousaf rejects calls to suspend Nicola Sturgeon from SNP following her arrestRishi Sunak’s AI adviser Matt Clifford has warned that AI it could become powerful enough to “kill many humans” in only two years’ time.Despite fears the fast-changing tech could run out of control, Sir Keir insisted that AI can still be “steered in the direction of prosperity, security and safety”.He vowed that Labour would offer “an active, mission-driven government, steering the development of AI to ensure it benefits working people”.The Labour leader noted that Goldman Sachs have forecast that around 24 million UK jobs will be exposed to automation even with existing technology.Rishi Sunak has warned against the risks posed by AI (PA Wire)“The risks are very real that we end up widening the gap between those with the skills to take advantage and those without, who lose their jobs or have their jobs drastically changed,” he said. “One thing is clear, we will need a revolution in learning and training in the UK, and it will need to begin in our schools immediately.”Mr Sunak used a trip to the US last week to announce that the UK will host the first global summit on AI safety in the autumn. But experts have warned that Britain is lagging behind the field.The Tory PM told the London Tech Conference on Monday that the “extraordinary” possibility of AI advances must be carried out “safely” as he again positioned Britain as a potential home of a global regulator.However, Sir Keir accused the government of playing “catch up” on major developments in AI, arguing its white paper on the subject was already out of date.“As well as protecting against the worst, regulation is about attracting the best,” he wrote – saying it was vital for government to “close gaps” in their Tory white paper by introducing proper oversight.RecommendedAI could ‘kill many humans’ within two years, warns Sunak adviser“Having a trusted and well understood playing field where businesses feel they can grow with the right rules in place, helps innovation and attracts entrepreneurs and investment to the UK,” said Sir Keir.The Labour leader added: “A hands-off approach in the formative years of AI would be the surest route to disaster.

Is AI The Cause Of Job Cuts This Year? Keerthi VedantamJune 14, 2023

When ChatGPT was launched on the last day of November, it punctuated what was, at the time, the largest layoff month of 2022. More people were laid off in November than in every other month of the year combined — more than 44,000 people, according to Crunchbase data.
Perhaps November’s numbers were a harbinger of trying times ahead. Since then, companies have continued layoffs at the same brutal pace. While funding dried up elsewhere, leading to layoffs, venture firms were pouring money into the generative AI movement, where language models were poised to be the next big cash cow.
Indeed, according to Crunchbase data, funding to AI startups made up about 10% of global startup funding. Venture’s dramatic shift in funding priorities has rocked every industry from the art world to health care. And whenever a new piece of technology promises to disrupt an industry, the first worry is that it will replace workers.

“[We’re] pitching the opposite,” said Healy Jones, an executive at the startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting. “AI startups are the only ones really raising big rounds. That’s not to say that AI layoffs aren’t happening, and that some development work isn’t changing. But I haven’t seen the impact.”
AI spurs layoffs in tech
While few — if any — tech startups are actively conducting layoffs to offload work onto AI, the tech industry is quickly embracing artificial intelligence. According to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which looks at layoffs across every industry, around 5% of May’s job cuts were directly related to artificial intelligence.
“We do believe AI will cause more job loss, though we are surprised how quickly the technology was cited as a reason,” Andy Challenger told Fortune. “It is incredible the speed the technology is evolving and being adapted.”
IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said the company is planning to pause hiring for roles that AI can reasonably do. Positions in human resources, or jobs that aren’t customer-facing, would be on the chopping block. That means 26,000 jobs at IBM could be in part or in whole replaced by AI. The company and its subsidiary Red Hat have laid off around 4,660 people so far in 2023.
On Monday, the homework helper platform Chegg announced it will lay off 4% of the company, or 80 positions, in order to begin deploying its AI strategy. Students have quickly adopted OpenAI tools and ChatGPT to get their homework done, impacting Chegg’s revenue. In the span of three months, the company introduced its own education platform powered by generative AI called CheggMate to rival the open-source tools.
The dangers of AI
But the rapid adoption of AI is likely to require more jobs to babysit the technology.
As of March, U.S.-based jobs on LinkedIn that mentioned GPT increased nearly 80% year over year. And, according to Crunchbase data, startups focused on AI are quickly joining The Crunchbase Unicorn Board as funding to the category speeds up.
Yossi Sheffi, an engineering professor at MIT, said that if anything, AI may, in a way, be a job creator. Workers will need to manage the technology through different, industrywide regulatory frameworks.
“Even if the invention is good and can be adopted, there are a lot of things that inhibit fast adoption,” he said. “How will they be regulated to make sure they aren’t harmful?”
Already, we’re starting to see some changes in the way companies are making staff changes to experiment with AI. At the National Eating Disorders Association, executives fired a slew of support line staffers after they attempted to unionize. The company quietly launched a chatbot, Tessa, to take over those duties. It was quickly pulled after it gave those with eating disorders bad advice — an argument those in the health care industry have used to stave off adopting AI.
“This is scary and there’s no precedent, and no one really knows what’s going on,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners focused on automation.

A new report estimated that half of all work will be automated in the next 10 to 40 years as artificial intelligence advances.Credit...Axel Heimken/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Yiwen LuYiwen Lu is a tech reporter in San Francisco.June 14, 2023“Generative artificial intelligence” is set to add up to $4.4 trillion of value to the global economy annually, according to a report from McKinsey Global Institute, in what is one of the rosier predictions about the economic effects of the rapidly evolving technology.Generative A.I., which includes chatbots such as ChatGPT that can generate text in response to prompts, can potentially boost productivity by saving 60 to 70 percent of workers’ time through automation of their work, according to the 68-page report, which was published early Wednesday. Half of all work will be automated between 2030 and 2060, the report said.McKinsey had previously predicted that A.I. would automate half of all work between 2035 and 2075, but the power of generative A.I. tools — which exploded onto the tech scene late last year — accelerated the company’s forecast.“Generative A.I. has the potential to change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities,” the report said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMcKinsey’s report is one of the few so far to quantify the long-term impact of generative A.I. on the economy. The report arrives as Silicon Valley has been gripped by a fervor over generative A.I. tools like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, with tech companies and venture capitalists investing billions of dollars in the technology.Get the best of The Times in your inboxSign up for The Evening:Catch up on the biggest news, and wind down to end your day.Sign up for Opinion Today:Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning. Sign up for The Morning:Make sense of the news, every day, with David Leonhardt.The tools — some of which can also generate images and video, and carry on a conversation — have started a debate over how they will affect jobs and the world economy. Some experts have predicted that the A.I. will displace people from their work, while others have said the tools can augment individual productivity.Last week, Goldman Sachs released a report warning that A.I. could lead to worker disruption and that some companies would benefit more from the technology than others. In April, a Stanford researcher and researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology released a study showing that generative A.I. could boost the productivity of inexperienced call center operators by 35 percent.Any conclusions about the technology’s effects may be premature. David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T. cautioned that generative A.I. was “not going to be as miraculous as people claim.”“We are really, really in the early stage,” he added.For the most part, economic studies of generative A.I. do not take into account other risks from the technology, such as whether it might spread misinformation and eventually escape the realm of human control.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe vast majority of generative A.I.’s economic value will most likely come from helping workers automate tasks in customer operations, sales, software engineering, and research and development, according to McKinsey’s report. Generative A.I. can create “superpowers” for high-skilled workers, said Lareina Yee, a McKinsey partner and an author of the report, because the technology can summarize and edit content.“The most profound change we are going to see is the change to people, and that’s going to require far more innovation and leadership than the technology,” she said.The report also outlined challenges that industry leaders and regulators would need to address with A.I., including concerns that the content generated by the tools can be misleading and inaccurate.Ms. Yee acknowledged that the report was making prognostications about A.I.’s effects, but that “if you could capture even a third” of what the technology’s potential is, “it is pretty remarkable over the next five to 10 years.”A version of this article appears in print on June 14, 2023, Section B, Page 6 of the New York edition with the headline: A.I.

Artificial intelligence - friend or foe?


AI can and will be a force for good - but we need a global conversation about its regulation to make sure the benefits of the technology outweigh the risks

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is not only a topical point of discussion, but a contentious one too. In recent weeks, some of the “Godfathers of AI” have turned their attention away from the positive potential of the technology and instead towards the potential of armageddon. Warnings have been plastered across national newspapers debating whether or not humanity is driving itself towards extinction. Others, however, have continued to dismiss any notion that these advancements are dystopian or apocalyptic.







If there is one point of consensus, it’s that the path ahead is still not clear. And whether AI will help or hinder us remains somewhat undetermined.
The deeply polarising nature of this debate prompted us at Here East to explore this question in depth, and we recently gathered leaders from business, technology, the creative industries, law and academia to drill down into the question: is AI a friend or foe? Ultimately, there is one answer to the hypothesis: AI will either be a friend or a foe, depending on how we harness it.
From aiding in medical research and optimising the workplace to reducing waste and pollution, we have already witnessed some of the many benefits AI can bring when used for good. Recently, we saw AI help a paralysed man to walk again with a device that was able to read his brain waves and send instructions to his muscles. An AI-based decoder is being developed that can translate brain activity into text, pioneering a non-invasive way to restore speech in those who have lost it due to motor neurone disease or a stroke.
AI tools will also be instrumental in helping to solve our climate crisis, with the capacity to collate and interpret large datasets, make informed predictions, and generate impactful solutions.

Immeasurable benefits
By employing the technology in this way, we will reap immeasurable benefits and witness both short- and long-term improvements to society. Rather than becoming a malevolent or resistant force, AI should be viewed as a partner or ally, automating repetitive tasks, enhancing productivity, driving economic growth, and helping emerging nations rapidly industrialise. Rather than replacing us, it can assist us, offering us a helping hand.
As Microsoft has suggested, AI is a copilot, sitting alongside us but not flying the plane.
To reap AI’s rewards, we have to educate and train people – particularly the younger generation – not only how to use the technology responsibly, but effectively. Schools should be considering how to integrate AI into the syllabus, with frameworks that will keep our children safe as well as teach them the skills necessary for our future.
We are seeing this in higher education already. As universities are starting to recognise the value of incorporating technology-focused studies into the curriculum, offering courses – including on AI – designed to close the digital skills gap and prepare their students for the AI future. It is imperative that schools keep pace and recognise the role that AI skills will play in driving productivity and innovation. This training and education is crucial in getting the technology to work for us, rather than us to work for it.


Read more about the regulation of AI

How AI ethics is coming to the fore with generative AI - The hype around ChatGPT and other large language models is driving more interest in AI and putting ethical considerations surrounding their use to the fore.
Government and industry figures meet to discuss AI regulation - Tech industry figures are broadly supportive of the need for artificial intelligence to be regulated, but despite growing consensus there is still disagreement over what effective AI regulation looks like.
AI interview: Dan McQuillan, critical computing expert - Critical computing expert Dan McQuillan speaks to Computer Weekly about the top-down imposition of artificial intelligence on society.



Of course, creating policies and parameters around artificial intelligence is a necessary and important step. With AI already permeating everything we do, it is vital that global leaders come together to discuss the blueprint for success – and that these conversations occur at an international level.
Fortunately, governments are beginning to engage in discussions about what a regulatory environment looks like, with news that the UK is set to host the first global summit on AI regulation this autumn. It is exciting to see the UK at the forefront of these discussions, and I hope that as these conferences begin, we will focus our attention on creating responsible citizens - remembering that where we go from here, and how we apply the technology, is up to us.
Indeed, holding these conversations on a global level is likely to temper the doomsday talk around AI. Discussion around AI should not be used to give rise to scaremongering, but to identify the risks and dangers of the technology, and monitor them accordingly. We are facing a new industrial revolution. And while the advancements in AI may currently be creating more questions than answers, the debate must be welcomed as a step towards truly integrating this technology into our lives in the safest and most beneficial way possible for humanity.


Unanswered questions
AI exists not only for our convenience, but to help us perform better, speeding up processes and in turn leaving us with more time for high-value work, and perhaps even a better work-life balance.
While we must take the warnings around AI seriously, we should also be embracing and therefore refining the abundant ways in which it can enhance our lives. There are still many unanswered questions that need addressing, including the crucial question of global accessibility and bias in AI databases. The world is having these discussions in small rooms and behind tall walls, and we must urgently expand and open up these conversations at scale.
When I look ahead to our future world, I see medical and scientific breakthroughs, enhanced education systems, and economic growth.
Artificial intelligence can be a positive force if we keep a close eye on how we use it. It is there to work with us, not against us. And if we harness it in the right way, ensuring that humans are in the driving seat, it will open the door to opportunities we have never had before.

			From generating realistic images and videos to enhancing customer experiences, generative AI has proven to be a versatile tool across various industries. Here are 10 ways businesses are utilizing this game-changing technology to transform their operations and drive growth. 		


Technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, and businesses are seeking innovative ways to maintain a competitive edge. Nowhere is this truer than in the realms of generative AI. From generating realistic images and videos to enhancing customer experiences, generative AI has proven to be a versatile tool across various industries. In this article, we explore 10 ways businesses are utilizing this game-changing technology to transform their operations and drive growth.

Content creation and design: Effective content creation and design are crucial for attracting and engaging customers.Generative AI enables businesses to create visually appealing and impactful content quickly and efficiently, helping them stand out in a crowded marketplace. Generative AI has revolutionized content creation by generating high-quality images, videos, and graphics. From designing logos and product visuals to creating engaging social media content, businesses are using generative AI algorithms to automate the creative process—saving time and resources.The company Typeface ingests information about the brand, including style guidelines, images, and product details. Then, with just a few clicks, customers can generate an assortment of suggested images and text—pre-defined in templates for different use cases—that employees can select and customize for use in an online campaign, marketing email, blog post, or anywhere the company wants to use it.
Accelerated automation: Automating IT tasks improves employee experiences, enhances customer interactions, and drives more efficiency within a company’s developer community.Providing employees with reliable automated support leads to increased efficiency, improved work life, and reduced operational costs.AT&T is using Azure OpenAI Service to enable IT professionals to request resources like additional virtual machines; migrate legacy code into modern code; and empower employees to complete common human resources tasks, such as changing withholdings, adding a dependent to an insurance plan, or requisitioning a computer for a new hire.
Personalized marketing: Personalization increases the chances of customer engagement and conversion and can significantly improve marketing ROI.Generative AI enables businesses to deliver hyper-personalized marketing campaigns. By analyzing customer data, generative algorithms can create dynamic content tailored to an individual’s preferences—optimizing engagement and conversion rates.Through the Take Blip platform and Azure OpenAI Service, brands can have one-on-one conversations that include an infinite flow of interactions with each customer. Interactions are digitized: customers’ requests, intentions, and desires can be recorded and used to tune the platform, making future interactions much more productive.
Chatbots and virtual assistants: Chatbots and virtual assistants powered by generative AI provide instant and accurate responses to customer queries.These intelligent systems can understand and respond to customer queries, provide recommendations, and offer personalized support—enhancing customer service, reducing wait times, improving operational efficiency, and boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty.By using a common chatbot framework along with the Azure Bot Services, Johnson & Johnson employees without technical training can now build their own bots to serve their teams and customers at a fraction of the time and cost it took to develop previous chatbot projects.
Product and service innovation: Staying innovative and meeting evolving customer demands is essential for business success.Local reporters used to be specialists—they focused their time on investigation and writing. Today, they need to be generalists who can create both written and video content and who knows how to maximize viewership on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and potentially many other distribution channels.”Nota has used Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to build two AI-assisted tools—SUM and VID. These tools do a lot of the heavy lifting needed to optimize stories for distribution and turn written pieces into engaging videos that can produce up to 10 times as much revenue as written pieces.
Language translation and natural language processing: In a globalized world, language barriers can hinder communication and business growth.Generative AI has improved language translation and natural language processing capabilities. Businesses can use generative models to accurately translate content in real time, enabling seamless communication across borders and bridging language barriers.Microsoft Azure AI services augment HelloTalk’s AI learning tools and technical capabilities, allowing users to connect with the world through language and culture exchange.
Fraud detection and cybersecurity: Businesses face constant threats from fraudsters and cyberattacks.By analyzing patterns and anomalies in large datasets, businesses can leverage generative models to detect and prevent fraud, safeguard sensitive information, and protect their digital assets.Using federated learning techniques along with Azure Machine Learning and Azure confidential computing, Swift and Microsoft are building an anomaly detection model for transactional data—all without copying or moving data from secure locations.
Predictive analytics and forecasting: Accurate predictions and forecasting are vital for effective decision-making and operational efficiency.Generative AI models excel in predictive analytics and forecasting. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns, businesses can leverage generative algorithms to make accurate predictions and informed decisions, optimizing supply chain management, inventory forecasting, and demand planning.Azure IoT helps Husky meet their system performance needs and maintain service levels for their customers. It scales quickly as they onboard new Advantage+Elite customers and reduces the time and resources spent on infrastructure maintenance.
Creative writing and content generation: Content generation can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Generative AI algorithms automate the content creation process, allowing businesses to generate articles, blog posts, and other written materials quickly. This technology assists content creators and ensures a consistent flow of fresh and engaging content for audiences.Generative AI algorithms automate the content creation process, allowing businesses to generate articles, blog posts, and other written materials quickly. This technology assists content creators and ensures a consistent flow of fresh and engaging content for audiences. Businesses and content creators can use these models to generate articles, blog posts, advertising copy, and more—saving time for content creators and providing fresh content to engage audiences.With Azure OpenAI Service, CarMax is creating content for its website much more efficiently, freeing up its editorial staff to focus on producing strategic, longer-form pieces that require more insight. Letting Azure OpenAI Service take care of data-heavy summarization tasks gives them time to be more creative and feel more fulfilled.
Medical research and diagnosis: The healthcare industry can benefit from quickly diagnosing diseases—potentially leading to faster and more accurate diagnoses—improving patient outcomes.Researchers can utilize generative models to analyze medical images, detect abnormalities, and aid in the development of new treatments. Additionally, generative AI algorithms can assist in diagnosing diseases by analyzing patient symptoms and medical records, potentially leading to more accurate and timely diagnoses.At Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, a single patient’s case notes could have up to 2,000 documents. In the past, if you needed information that was stored 1,600 documents ago, you weren’t going to find it. Now, using Azure Cognitive Search it takes as little as three seconds to search for a keyword across those 2,000 documents to find it.

Each of the 10 ways mentioned above addresses significant challenges and opportunities facing businesses today. Azure OpenAI Service empowers businesses to streamline processes, enhance customer experiences, drive innovation, and make data-driven decisions—resulting in improved efficiency, profitability, and competitiveness. In the case of generative AI, what’s good for business is also good for its customers. By leveraging the power of machine learning and generative algorithms, businesses can improve customer experiences while also gaining a competitive advantage in today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape.

How Can Bias Be Removed from Artificial Intelligence-Powered Hiring Platforms?



Harvard-led institute to pursue fairness in online systems

Cynthia Dwork, Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science




SUNNYVALE, CALIF. – A Harvard-led group of experts from academia and industry will gather here this week to launch a new research initiative aimed at promoting greater fairness in artificial intelligence-powered hiring platforms.
Today, 70% of companies use automated applicant tracking systems to find and hire talent, according to industry estimates. However, many of the algorithms used by recruiters to manage their hiring process have been shown to reproduce, and sometime amplify, biases and human errors they are supposed to eliminate.
The new effort, the Hire Aspirations Institute, brings together more than a dozen leaders in algorithmic fairness, privacy, AI, law, critical race theory, organizational behavior, economics, and social networking. The researchers are from Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, University of Chicago, Boston University, MIT, Weizmann Institute, Northeastern University, Rutgers, Microsoft Research and Apple. It will be led by Cynthia Dwork, Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).
“Hiring is a crucible in which forces of preference, privilege, prejudice, law, and now, algorithms and data, interact to shape an individual’s future,” said Dwork, who has made pioneering contributions to private data analysis, cryptography, distributed computing, and the theory of algorithmic fairness. “We will investigate pathways to minimize the transfer of persistent patterns of hiring bias and discrimination onto electronic platforms, from data and algorithms to corrective transformations and law.”
Dwork’s research has demonstrated that systems composed of elements that are “fair” in isolation are not necessarily fair overall. The Hire Aspirations Institute’s multi-disciplinary team will undertake a holistic research agenda to identify concrete solutions to real-world problems across several areas of focus:

Poorly worded job descriptions can lead to the exclusion of qualified Job candidates, and applicants’ own language can contain cultural biases. The initiative will explore AI and other techniques hiring platforms could employ to enable even-handed comparisons between candidates.
Algorithms deployed by hiring platforms to score and rank candidates often exacerbate existing unfairness. The researchers will pursue algorithmic approaches that nullify that effect and improve their overall performance.
Prediction algorithms assign scores intended to calibrate an individual job seeker’s likelihood of success in a role if hired. Drawing on the theory of pseudo-randomness, the team will interrogate approaches to ensure that prediction models are as accurate as possible.
Success in a job depends on the workplace, and the nature of a workplace is, in turn, influenced by the people who work there. The group will explore evidence-based techniques for modeling a more equitable workplace environment.
In-person and digital networking and referrals play an oversized role in how people get jobs. But these informal structures reinforce inequality. The researchers will test ideas for how hiring platforms can level the networking playing field.
The institute will identify legal frameworks that, in tandem with the technical work, can advance the fairness of hiring platforms.

To kick off the effort, the researchers will convene at the offices of LinkedIn. With 930 million members worldwide, LinkedIn is the world’s most widely used hiring platform and professional network. It’s vision to “create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce” and its ongoing efforts to grapple with the meaning and operationalization of fairness, prepare the ground for a fruitful exchange of ideas and insights.
The Hire Aspirations Institute is supported in part by grants from the Sloan Foundation, Simons Foundation, and Harvard University. LinkedIn will supply data to assist with the research.

After all, with the right prompts, these platforms can perform a lot of work tasks, from coding and emailing to project management and customer service assistance.However, the technology is nothing if not controversial, with a wide range of critics wary of AI’s potential impact on the business world. Concerns about its accuracy are the driving factor, but there are plenty of other reasons why banning AI has become increasingly popular over the last few months.In this guide, we’ll show you which companies have started banning AI for their employees, as well as outlining why the tech is being banned in the first place. Companies That Have Banned AIThe tech industry has been abuzz since the launch of ChatGPT in November, with many businesses building AI alternatives to compete with the impressive platform. Still, this has not stopped certain companies from outright banning or limiting generative AI use for employees, at least until they figure out how it can work for them in a more regulated way. AppleWhile Apple is typically on the cutting edge of new technology, the tech giant is taking a firm stance on the employee use of ChatGPT, banning the technology for all workers.The primary concern fueling the ban from Apple is that upper management is concerned about employees unknowingly sharing confidential information, which could then in turn lead to a leak.It’s worth noting, by the way, that Apple banned employees from using AI on the same day it launched the ChatGPT app for iOS. SamsungApple’s decision to ban employee use of generative AI platforms like ChatGPT may have been spurred by Samsung’s decision to do the same, as their reasoning is surprisingly similar. The difference, however, being that Apple was afraid of employees sharing confidential information, whereas a Samsung employee actually did share confidential information on ChatGPT, which led to a potential leak of its code.Samsung didn’t just ban ChatGPT without consideration for its employees. In fact, the South Korea-based company surveyed employees about the decision and found that 65% are concerned about security risks when using generative AI platforms like ChatGPT. VerizonIn a public statement to employees in February, the telecommunications company Verizon made clear its opinions about employees using ChatGPT, and as you might have guessed, it’s not a positive one.“ChatGPT is not accessible from our corporate systems, as that can put us at risk of losing control of customer information, source code and more… as a company, we want to safely embrace emerging technology.”Verizon did note in the statement that “artificial intelligence is integral” to the company’s long-term strategy, but that ChatGPT was “not synonymous with AI,” and therefore not to be used by employees. Wall Street BanksTech companies aren’t the only businesses that are wary of employees utilizing generative AI platforms like ChatGPT to improve productivity. In fact, one of the first industries to really take issue with the technology was banking, which saw a myriad of big banks banning AI outright for employees before the majority of the tech industries.Here’s a list of big banks that have banned employees from using generative AI for work:Bank of America Corp.Citigroup Inc.Deutsche Bank AGGoldman Sachs Group Inc.Wells Fargo & Co.JPMorgan Chase & Co.To be fair, though, the banking industry is not necessarily opposed to the technology on principal. The reality is that the banking industry is heavily regulated, which means that unvetted, third-party software like ChatGPT simply isn’t permitted to manage the billions of dollars passing through these big banks.Considering the fact that ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms have been described as “convincingly inaccurate,” even by their creators, it’s safe to say that they shouldn’t be handling all of our money anyway. Still, once these platforms are a bit more developed, and more importantly regulated, you can rest assured that banks will likely get on the bandwagon. Countries That Have Banned AIIn addition to several companies making the choice to nix ChatGPT for employees, there are some countries that are taking extraordinary steps to ensure the technology does not disrupt everyday life for their citizens. Here’s a list of the countries where ChatGPT is banned:RussiaChinaIranNorth KoreaCubaSyriaItalyIn the countries listed above, you will not be able to access ChatGPT, unless you’ve got a VPN of some kind. Yes, the list is not exactly a ringing endorsement for banning ChatGPT, considering their collective reputation when it comes to unjust internet censorship. Why Is ChatGPT Getting Banned?With so many prominent companies and actual countries banning generative AI platforms like ChatGPT, it’s safe to wonder, why is the technology being banned in the first place?For starters, ChatGPT and its alternatives are very much in their infancy. Having just launched in November 2022, these platforms are far from perfect, relaying a lot of significant AI errors that could have a decidedly negative impact on a company or a country. The tech is also very susceptible to spreading misinformation, according to a 2023 study of the generative platform Google Bard.On top of that, employees and employers just aren’t on the same page when it comes to the use of generative AI in the workplace. 68% of employees reportedly use generative AI platforms at work without telling their bosses, and 47% of employers are considered AI use over new hires. Suffice to say, the impact of AI on the workplace is going to be more that substantial.All that to say, generative AI just isn’t ready for the big time yet. The potential errors, the disconnect on usage, and proclivity for misinformation is enough to turn big business away from the tech. However, you can bet your bottom dollar that once these issues are at least somewhat resolved, these companies will be first in line to get the productivity boost they’ll all but ensure.

		Workers are becoming more accepting of AI, but more work remains to reduce concerns, a study by Boston Consulting Group has found.

Despite headlines warning that artificial intelligence poses a profound risk to society, workers are curious, optimistic, and confident about the arrival of AI in the enterprise, and becoming more so with time, according to a recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).
For many, their feelings are based on sound experience. Although ChatGPT, the poster child for generative AI applications, only launched in November 2022, already 26% of workers say they use generative AI several times a week, while 46% have experimented with it at least once, BCG found.
BCG asked 12,898 frontline employees, managers, and leaders in large organizations around the world how they felt about AI: 61% listed curiosity as one of their two strongest feelings, 52% listed optimism, 30% concern, and 26% confidence. A smaller BCG survey five years ago saw 60% listing curiosity, 35% optimism, 40% concern, and 17% confidence. A lot has happened since that last survey on attitudes to AI in 2018. Back then, “AI was still emerging and was not something many people used or saw,” said Vinciane Beauchene, BCG’s global leader for talent and skills, on a recent conference call to discuss the survey findings. But after the pandemic shook up the world of work, generative AI has flourished. “It’s the new normal: 80% of leaders claim they are using it on a weekly basis,” she said. “What was striking for me was how ill-equipped companies still are to deal with that.”
 
 
 













 
 

Familiarity breeds content
The study further found that the more workers used AI tools, the less they were concerned and more optimistic about their impact. Just 22% of regular AI users and 27% of rare users said they were concerned, compared with 42% of non-users. On the other hand, 36% of non-users said they were optimistic about AI, compared with 55% of rare users and 62% of regular users.

Enterprises can help their employees make that transition from concern to optimism, according to Nicolas de Bellefonds, global leader of AI at BCG X, the company’s technology build and design unit.
“What we’ve seen—and we have been helping companies make the most of AI for the past eight years now—is that AI acceptance by workers is directly linked to their understanding of how it will improve and augment their job,” he said.
 
 
 













 
 

There’s a lot of work still to be done on that score. So far, just 14% of frontline employees and 44% of leaders say they’ve received training on AI—but 86% of survey respondents believe they’ll need it.
“This is a massive number,” Bellefonds said. “We really have to address this upskilling issue.”
Change management
Helping workers understand what AI can do for them will be tricky, though, as they want to feel that AI is augmenting their work, and not just replacing the enjoyable parts, BCG found.
 
 
 













 
 

“The hardest part of AI acceptance is creating a space where employees can still add value and not feel they are competing with AI to create value,” Bellefonds added. “A lot of the work we do when it comes to change management and coaching is to help employees work with AI and at the same time, change the way they add value, so that a part of their job is taken by AI but their part refocuses on higher value-adding tasks.”

Exactly how those processes are rewired and the working methods changed will vary from one enterprise to another, he said.
There are other ways in which employees’ concerns about AI is unevenly distributed, too. Leaders are more likely to be optimistic, and frontline workers concerned, BCG found. And while 68% of leaders believe their companies have implemented adequate measures to ensure responsible use of AI, only 29% of their frontline employees feel that way.
 
 
 













 
 

Despite BCG’s findings of optimism in the workforce, there’s a darker side. Over one-third of respondents think their job is likely to be eliminated by AI, and almost four-fifths want governments to step in and deliver AI-specific regulations to ensure it’s used responsibly. That proportion was highest in India (89%), Spain (88%), Italy (84%), Brazil and France (both 83%), and lowest in Japan (64%), Germany (73%), the US (74%), and the Middle East and the Netherlands (both 76%).
Five-step program
While we wait for regulators to figure out what we can and can’t do, BCG’s chief AI ethics officer Steven Mills has some suggestions for CIOs on how to introduce generative AI into the workplace safely.
With familiarity with generative AI being a key factor for its successful adoption, employees must get a chance to test it themselves.
 
 
 













 
 

“It’s important folks get a chance to interact with these technologies and use them; stopping experimentation is not the answer,” Mills said, noting that it’s also not practical. “AI is going to be developed across an organization by employees whether you know about it or not,” he added.
Instead, he suggested, “rather than trying to pretend it won’t happen, let’s put in place a quick set of guidelines that lets your employees know where the guardrails are, what they can and can’t do, and actually encourage responsible innovation and responsible experimentation.”
Investing in upskilling—continuous, not one-off—will also help, especially among front-line employees where familiarity with the technology is lower. “That disparity across levels is going to be really important for companies to understand as they think about this continuous change journey they’re on … to give them the right skills to be successful as an organization,” he said.
 
 
 













 
 

Finally, he advised enterprises to build a responsible AI program to reassure employees that they use generative AI ethically.
In the abstract, there are five key pieces to such a program, Mills said: the overall principles setting out the enterprise’s strategy and risk tolerance; the governance structure setting out the organization and escalation paths; the processes for integrating AI into product development; the tooling needed to do all this; and the drive for cultural change.
Concretely, there are some immediate actions enterprises can take, he said, including handing responsibility and accountability for the program to a senior executive; ensuring that person and his or her team have the funding and resources to build the program; and quickly putting in place an initial set of guardrails and making sure they’re followed. 
 
 
 













 
 

That, he said, means “having an agile review process that teams experimenting with AI can work with and reach out to, to get their questions answered.”

Center launches as JFF releases preliminary survey data which finds a majority of workers feel they need new skills and training to prepare for AI's future impact. 
BOSTON, June 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Jobs for the Future (JFF), a national nonprofit that drives transformation in the U.S. education and workforce systems, today announced the launch of its new Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work. This center will play an integral role in JFF's mission and newly announced 10-year North Star goal to help 75 million people facing systemic barriers to advancement work in quality jobs. As AI's explosive growth reshapes every aspect of how we learn, work, and live, this new center will serve as a nexus of collaboration among stakeholders from every part of the education-to-career ecosystem to explore the most promising opportunities—and profound challenges—of AI's potential to advance an accessible and equitable future of learning and work. 
""While we have yet to realize the full impact of AI on the workforce, we must be proactive in harnessing its power and maximizing its potential to help people advance economically,"" said Maria Flynn, JFF's president and CEO. ""JFF's Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work will catalyze these efforts and ensure that workers of all backgrounds and experiences as well as businesses thrive in this rapidly emerging landscape."" 
In a forthcoming survey commissioned by JFF and conducted by Morning Consult, workers recognized the importance of skills related to AI. While only 1 in 10 workers said they are currently experiencing AI at work—receiving AI training, using it in their role, or seeing AI-related staffing changes—over half feel they need to gain new skills as a result of AI's impact (58%), but a majority do not trust their employer to support them in understanding AI (88%). JFF believes it is important to move quickly, responsibly leverage AI to accelerate progress toward achieving its North Star and identify concrete ways to support workers and learners in the near term. 
""No industry will be untouched by AI. Its potential is limitless and its power still to be seen, so it's essential for those of us who are committed to harnessing AI for good to ensure it is used ethically,"" said Howard Boville, JFF board member and head of IBM Cloud Platform. ""JFF has a tremendous track record in incubating cutting-edge innovations that drive economic advancement. As a JFF board member, I applaud this new center and I see a great opportunity for JFF to leverage their expertise in developing insights, connecting decision makers, and shaping policy around AI to empower workers and learners, employers, educators, and entrepreneurs for years to come."" 
JFF's new Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work's initial focus will include cross-sector convenings, research, and insights to identify best practices for leveraging AI to accelerate skill development, improvements in job quality, and economic advancement. The center will focus on connecting policy with practices that are grounded in equitable applications of AI so all learners and workers can gain access to and benefit from this fast-spreading technology. By deploying JFF's cross-sector networks and convening power, the center will facilitate knowledge sharing and scalable solutions that drive positive outcomes for people and businesses. 
The center will be incubated under JFFLabs, the innovation lab of JFF that provides the infrastructure to bring solutions from ideation to national-scale social impact. JFFLabs' proven model of insights, incubation, and investment provides robust market analysis, identifies emerging trends, and invests in promising innovators to create, test, and scale transformative models that drive equitable economic advancement. Other incubated practice lines within JFFLabs include climate innovation and lifelong learning. 
""Economic equity is, finally, about human potential—the opportunity for each and every one of us to thrive. It is our responsibility to harness AI with purpose and care,"" said Kristina Francis, executive director of JFFLabs. ""As we incubate new capabilities at JFFLabs, we will work across JFF and the field to discover, learn, iterate, and carefully integrate AI into existing systems while exploring how new models help realize AI's fullest potential."" 
Alex Swartsel, a managing director at JFFLabs, will lead the Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work. This builds on her current portfolio within JFFLabs including several extended reality (XR), immersive learning, and AI-related projects and partnerships with organizations such as Intel, Meta, and Unity. Swartsel will guide the center's foundational efforts, working closely with JFF's practice and center leaders to cultivate strategic partnerships and drive effective portfolio management. 
The launch of the Center for Artificial Intelligence & the Future of Work reaffirms JFF's commitment to fostering inclusive economic growth and preparing workers for the jobs of the future. By leveraging AI's potential and addressing its challenges, JFF and its partners aim to create a workforce and education ecosystem that thrives in the age of AI.

It would be a huge mistake to keep AI research ""under lock and key"", he added.What is AI and what risks does it pose?Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big riskPeople who worried that AI might pose a risk to humans did so because they couldn't imagine how it could be made safe, Prof LeCun argued.""It's as if you asked in 1930 to someone how are you going to make a turbo-jet safe? Turbo-jets were not invented yet in 1930, same as human level AI has not been invented yet.""""Turbo jets were eventually made incredibly reliable and safe,"" and the same would happen with AI he said.Meta has a large AI research programme and producing intelligent systems as capable as humans is one of its goals. As well as research, the company uses AI to help identify harmful social media posts.Prof LeCun spoke at an event for invited press, about his own work in so-called Objective Driven AI which aims to produce safe systems that can remember, reason, plan and have common sense - features popular chatbots like ChatGPT lack.Prof LeCun speaking to the press at Meta in ParisHe said there was ""no question"" that AI would surpass human intelligence. But researchers were still missing essential concepts to reach that level, which would take years if not decades to arrive.When people raise concerns about the human-level or above machines that might exist in the future, they are referring to artificial general intelligence (AGI). These are systems, that like humans, can solve a wide range of problems.There was a fear that when AGI existed scientists ""get to turn on a super-intelligent system that is going to take over the world within minutes"", he said. ""That's you know just preposterously ridiculous.""In response to a question from BBC news Prof LeCun said there would be progressive advances - perhaps you might get an AI as powerful as the brain of a rat. That wasn't going take over the world, and he argued ""it's still going to run on a data centre somewhere with an off switch"". He added: ""And if you realise it's not safe you just don't built it"".Impact on jobsIt has been argued that AI has the potential to replace many jobs, and some companies have paused recruiting for certain roles as a result. Prof LeCun told the BBC: ""This is not going to put a lot of people out of work permanently"". But work would change because we have ""no idea"" what the most prominent jobs will be 20 years from now, he said.Intelligent computers would create ""a new renaissance for humanity"" the way the internet or the printing-press did, he said.Prof LeCun was speaking Tuesday ahead of a vote on Europe's AI Act which is designed to regulate artificial intelligence.He said from his conversations with AI start-ups in Europe ""they don't like it at all, they think it's too broad, maybe too restrictive"". But he said he wasn't an expert on the legislation, Prof LeCun said he was not against regulation - but in his view each application would need its own rules, for example different rules would govern AI systems in cars and those scanning medical images.Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big riskMinister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warningsAI 'godfather' feels 'lost' over life's workAI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'Artificial intelligence",,,,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1232B/production/_130093547_ai-index-meta.jpg,,,,Meta scientist Yann LeCun says AI won't destroy jobs forever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How ChatGPT and other generative AI tools are transforming HR jobs



By Dawn Kawamoto

June 14, 2023 

Generative AI tools including ChatGPT are infiltrating a wide range of industries—and HR is not immune from the impacts of the emerging technology. Nor are HR professionals free from concerns about AI eventually stealing their jobs. However, experts say that, while the technology could indeed eliminate some HR roles, HR leaders should be more focused on how AI could change the profession and even create new opportunities.

HR is among the leading professions experimenting with AI, particularly in the talent acquisition space, where it is being used to help generate job requisitions and create policy documents, company handbooks and other forms of relevant content. It can also assist recruiters with scheduling and communicating with candidates and even act as a personal digital assistant.
HR is also tapping generative AI like ChatGPT for its knowledge-sourcing capabilities, which is its top emerging use case according to research from the International Data Corporation, says Zachary Chertok, a workforce research analyst with IDC.
Generative AI tools, including ChatGPT, can provide HR leaders with the ability to extract real-time information based on query searches as well as help cast a wide net across systems and concept silos, Chertok says. And ultimately, the technology can enable an employer to offer the right resources to the right people at the right time, to drive a data-informed people strategy. 
But since that has long been the responsibility of human HR professionals, the shift may have some HR professionals skeptical of embracing the technology. It’s a concern fueled by recent reports: The World Economic Forum, for instance, forecasted a 2% decrease in employment in the coming years, in part because of AI; meanwhile, IBM leadership made waves when it announced a halt on hiring for jobs that could be automated, with a particular focus on HR roles that are non-customer-facing.

ChatGPT to steal HR jobs?

Generative AI and ChatGPT most likely will help HR teams reduce tasks, accelerate work and boost efficiency—not steal HR jobs, Chertok tells HRE.
But in reducing those tasks per HR role, the technology is likely to mean that organizations will need fewer people to do that job, he notes. Think of the evolution of checkout stands in the grocery business, where self-service kiosks reduce the number of cashiers needed—but do not eliminate the need for that role altogether.

Similarly, HR and IT help desks are expected to be the first departments hit with job losses because of generative AI, including ChatGPT, Chertok says. 
“Naturally, there’s still going to be a certain amount of complex answers that will need to be provided by those teams but answering the simple questions can be automated with generative AI,” he says.
He predicts the same will hold true for positions that require only basic writing skills, such as crafting a job description.
When companies hire fewer people as technology picks up the slack, job demand is inevitably affected, says Rebecca Wettemann, CEO and principal analyst with research firm Valoir. She suggests that HR leaders get ahead of any job losses by taking such steps as developing reskilling and training programs for HR teams and leaning into the creative problem-solving that they do. 

HR roles change, emerge with generative AI, ChatGPT
With fewer tasks required thanks to generative AI and ChatGPT, the odds are great that additional roles will be assigned to HR professionals, making those roles “multi-competency” ones, Chertok says.
“They may take on more dynamic responsibilities, depending on their skills and position,” Chertok says. “Any time you have a broadening of skills, competencies or responsibilities in one role, it diminishes the need for added headcount overall because one FTE can do more.”

For example, HR generalists and performance managers may be combined into one role, while talent market intelligence analysts may take on additional recruiting, interviewing and level one hiring functions under a merged role, Chertok says.
Wettemann hasn’t seen new HR job titles emerge because of generative AI yet, but don’t be surprised to see that, she says.
“I think we’ll see a real shift in talent management roles, not just the traditional talent tracking sort of thing that can be automated,” Wettemann tells HRE. “It will be thinking more creatively about what are the real opportunities within the organization, what are the skills, the gaps, and what should a training strategy look like to bring everyone along to be more productive with AI?”
What’s the generative AI adoption rate for HR?
Among the various industries and roles that are experimenting with generative AI, HR is among the most active users based on job roles, according to a report by Valoir. 
“HR has always been ahead of the curve and thinking about the ethical use of data within an organization, far ahead of the customer service people, marketing people and certainly salespeople,” Wettemann said. “No ding to salespeople, but HR has always, always taken the role of data steward very, very seriously.”
HR’s willingness to lean into technology could be affecting companywide perceptions of the impact of automation. When Valoir asked employees to estimate what percentage of their co-workers could be replaced by AI in the next two years, 62% pointed to HR.
However, any potential job losses will likely move at a much slower pace, says Chertok.

And although Wettemann acknowledges the reality that some HR professionals will be replaced because of the technology, the need for humans leading HR won’t completely fade.
“HR is uniquely positioned to be part of the game,” Wettemann says. “When you think of replacing part of the HR world, there’s no HR person who says, ‘Boy, I have nothing to do today.’ There are always things on their plate, so [HR should focus on] taking advantage of technology to automate menial parts of the work areas where AI can do some heavy lifting.”

Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

For decades, advances in technology have changed the ways people work, and now artificial intelligence could be the next big disruptor.




Three professors from the University of Cincinnati's Carl H. Lindner College of Business discuss how artificial intelligence and automation will change the way people work, what types of jobs will be lost to artificial intelligence and the value human workers still provide.
The professors are:

Liwei Chen, PhD, assistant professor of operations, business analytics and information systems
Craig Froehle, PhD, professor of operations, business analytics and information systems
Michael Fry, PhD, professor of operations, business analytics and information systems and academic director of the Center for Business Analytics

How will artificial intelligence and automation affect the future of work?



Chen: In general, AI can be used in two ways. One is automation. That is, we use AI to replace some human beings for certain tasks. The other way is augmentation. We use AI to augment human beings’ intelligence and ability to finish some tasks. 
When we talk about augmentation, it is not to replace human beings. It is rather to complement. People and AI can collaborate together and do some tasks better. People often think these are two separate things: You can use AI either for automation or for augmentation. But in fact, when you zoom out across time and space, these two are not necessarily separated. They are actually intertwined with each other and interdependent.
Fry: What history suggests will happen is we’ll find a new equilibrium where in general people are more productive. However, that doesn’t mean it will be good for everyone. Because of automobiles, horse and buggy manufacturers, they had to find something different to do. There certainly will be certain people, certain job classes or industries that may be obsolete. There will be others where certain parts of their jobs will be aided by AI, so you can spend more time doing something that takes more thought whereas the routine things can be done with AI.
Froehle: Information automation, it’s a continuation of the mechanical automation that has transformed nearly every business that makes anything since the 1860s. The big difference is that we are starting to see it affect white-collar jobs, jobs that process information rather than physical goods … so-called “knowledge-work.”
Fry: We have a long history of disruption and automation, everything from [Johannes] Gutenberg and the printing press to the industrial revolution and the internet. What is different about this is that this does a much better job than previous attempts at generating what seems to be new content. You can ask a question that’s potentially never been asked before, and it gives you an answer that seems quite reasonable. 
The same with art; you can go to other places and say make a picture in this style, and it does it. I think that’s what people are really caught off guard by. Now it seems like AI can create, not just automate.

When we talk about artificial intelligence being able to “create,” how real is that?



Fry: We could talk to some philosophers about that: What does creation mean? The algorithms it’s using have been around for a while in some form but there definitely have been updates to the underlying algorithms it’s using. What has changed is the availability of data. It can scrape the web and get all sorts of stuff.
If you think about what it means to create, if you’re an artist, there are certain brushstrokes and things that you have seen, and you put it together. That’s basically what artificial intelligence is doing. Now does that make it intelligent like a human is intelligent? I don’t know because it is based on an algorithm, but it can access so much data, and it can pull things from so many places that it starts to learn, “OK, when I put this together with this, people think that is good.” That’s what it is. It’s all based on a scoring algorithm where it thinks through a lot of possible answers, and it has been trained to say that these types of answers people think are better than others. 
The underlying approach of what it’s doing is not brand new, but the ability to pull so much data, process so much data and some advances in the underlying algorithm lets it do some really cool stuff.



How will chatbots, like ChatGPT, affect how we work?








Craig Froehle, PhD, professor of Operations, Business Analytics and Information Systems








Froehle: The concern that tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E and other generative AI are going to eliminate jobs entirely are kind of overblown, I think. What I suspect is the primary effect is that it will augment or supplement parts of people’s jobs. But a lot of information-centric jobs, they’re doing value-added things that don’t necessarily fit the strengths of a generative AI. I also think it will reduce the time required for certain parts of our jobs, allowing us to spend more time on other parts of our jobs.
I read a story about a realtor who said she typically spent about two to three hours writing a listing for a new house. She can copy and paste some keywords and basic information into a generative AI tool, and it would spit out a first draft in about two minutes. Then she could spend 10 minutes editing it. So two to three hours goes to 15 minutes. What that does is allow her to spend a lot more time working with clients and less time sitting in front of a computer.
Fry: We’ve been playing with it to write code. As long as you are quite specific on the code you want it to write on a small block, it does a decent job which seems amazing. But very few coders these days start from a blank screen. If I know I need to write something, I do a Google search, and it’s out there. So that has already been partially automated for me. This automates it even further. And coders still have jobs; they just spend less time writing simple code and more time thinking about how to improve the efficiency and do fancier things. The job will change, but it doesn’t mean the job will go away, and that’s typically what we’ve seen when there’s been a technology disruption in the past.
Chen: AI plays increasingly important roles instead of being passive tools waiting to be used. They can work as colleagues with human beings. To use ChatGPT as an example, it is very helpful to generate some documents like reports. I can use ChatGPT to create an initial version of the document, and then I can utilize that template and add in additional insight to make it an effective report. It saves human beings time and can free up your time to focus on more challenging pieces of work, think more strategically, think more creatively.





Chatbots have been used by companies, such as for customer service for a while, correct?



Chen: Chatbots have existed for a long time. We talked with the chatbots, and they helped to identify the problems and direct us to the human beings as needed. ChatGPT, as a generative AI, has totally different capabilities. They can do much more challenging jobs.
Fry: The algorithm is simpler. What it’s been trained on is much simpler. Those are like a decision tree where it’s looking for keywords. If you say, “My internet is not working,” it hears certain things there and has been trained to give a verbatim response to that person. What ChatGPT can do, because it’s been trained on so much more data, it has a much better chance of understanding the nuances, so it can give you a better answer based on the context.



When might we see these new artificial intelligence tools become as ubiquitous as the internet?



Froehle: Like with most technologies, the progress isn’t even. You’ll go awhile then you’ll have a sudden big increase in quality or effective efficacy. We could see progress really, really fast, but I don’t know. But given the amount of money that’s being tossed into it and the amount of activity and excitement, we should see advances at least as fast as we saw advancements in the mid-’90s in terms of the internet. Probably faster than that given the amount of people, institutions and organizations and the amount of money that’s being thrown at it. I don’t think anyone wants to be left behind this time. I’ve told several people I think this is the next World Wide Web. Ignore it at your peril.
Fry: It will be interesting to see how they monetize these things. Right now ChatGPT is free. You can pay for premium access. But I assume it could go behind a paywall, which could stifle a little bit of the innovation and usefulness. But Google search is an amazing tool that I think has saved all of us an amazing amount of time, and it’s still free. So it’s possible these could be free, and they monetize it some other way. 
We’re in an interesting time right now thinking who are going to be the players in this, how open are they going to make it to people using it? Because the other interesting thing with this is they actually do get better the more they’re used. At least with ChatGPT, it allows you to give some feedback, and they can use that in improving the algorithm.



How are people going to respond to their increased interactions with artificial intelligence?








Liwei Chen, PhD, assistant professor of operations, business analytics and information systems








Chen: The AI can also be your boss, your manager. We have this term called “algorithmic management.” That means you work for an AI algorithm. You are monitored by an algorithm. For example, Uber drivers. When they drive, their tasks are assigned by the algorithms behind the platform. They are not assigned by human beings. So, essentially, they work for an algorithm as the boss. In that situation, how do you respond to a human being as your boss versus AI as your boss? Will that influence your interactions? Your work behaviors? Your interactions with your customers? Those social relationships will be changed because of this algorithm as your supervisor.
I have conducted research about this phenomenon. I looked at ATM service maintenance and how technicians work to fix the machines. This company implemented an AI to allocate tasks for those technicians. We noticed some very interesting tensions in this scenario. When the employees work with the AI, their motivations changed. Originally, either they were intrinsically motivated — they work because they love the job, the maintenance, their clients — or they work because they have to follow their supervisor’s guidance. After implementing this kind of system, we noticed a shift of their work motivation. They are more likely just to follow the instructions of the algorithm. They receive the message on their cell phone. The AI tells them to go to a location to fix that machine with certain tools to address pre-diagnosed problems. All of this guidance is provided by AI. Technicians just follow the instructions mechanically without even thinking about what’s going on, without utilizing their expertise or experiences.
Technicians also mentioned that they missed the old days when they had direct interactions with human being supervisors. They feel the warmth in the service process, and they enjoy the conversations with the customers when they work on site. In other words, the human intelligence and human touch pieces are decreasing after AI is introduced in the service process.
Froehle: Vanderbilt [University] had a situation where one of the colleges used ChatGPT to draft an email that went out to students and staff, kind of a heartfelt email about the shooting at Michigan State. And it was a pretty nice email, but then people found out that ChatGPT wrote it, and they kind of lost their minds. A majority of Americans are optimistic about the potential for AI, like the changes it’s going to create are more good than bad. But the pushback and the negative reactions we’ve seen in certain circumstances show that there’s a consistently negative reaction when it’s used in empathetic roles. Transparency is going to have to be part of it. If you try to hide the fact that you’re dealing with an AI from people and they find out, that’s going to be worse than if you just tell them upfront.





Can artificial intelligence be empathetic?



Fry: We’ve probably all faked emotions in certain circumstances. If you know in a business setting you’ve got to be nice to someone even though you don’t think you should, you can fake the emotion. Artificial intelligence can learn that. It may not be what we consider a genuine emotion, but I’m not convinced at some point artificial intelligence can’t do a decent job of replicating fake emotions. And will we be able to tell they’re fake? I’m not sure.



What types of tasks will people be able to do better than artificial intelligence?



Chen: Creativity and critical thinking are things people can do better. I demonstrated ChatGPT in my classroom for my undergraduate students. I let ChatGPT generate a paragraph of an essay and make critical comments about the paragraphs it just generated. We observed that the points it makes tend to be neutral, descriptive, informative, yet unoriginal, formulaic and not necessarily creative. If I ask my students to write a similar essay, their ideas might be more open-ended. I would expect more creative ideas with some really critical thoughts.
Froehle: They’re not good at being spontaneous, creative, quirky, having personality and adding the richness that humans do. Now sometimes human richness is not great; it’s not really what you want. But that’s going to be a factor in how we deploy these things. Is the richness of human involvement worth the cost of it being so slow? Because humans are slow, at least in comparison.
The analogy I make these days is a lot of generative AI tools right now are like really fast, low-paid or unpaid interns where you have to look at the output; you just can’t pass it along or stick it into a process without examining it first and adding some value for quality inspection. As we’ve seen, sometimes the pictures they generate aren’t quite right or the facts they write aren’t correct. We need someone peering over the shoulder of the AI right now to make sure that it’s producing usable content. As it gets better, it may need less oversight, but it’s really hard to tell how quickly it’s going to get better. I suspect in some ways it’s going to get pretty good really fast, but in other ways we’re going to find these challenging problems continuing to plague the output. But one thing I’ve never lost on is betting on the progress of technology.



What types of jobs are most likely to be replaced by artificial intelligence?








Michael Fry, PhD, professor of operations, business analytics and information systems and academic director of the Center for Business Analytics








Fry: I would say just like we’ve seen in other disruptions, automations, the things that are repetitive — and by repetitive, I mean if you can write out instructions to do it — those are things that we were pretty good at automating. I think about certain things people do in Excel spreadsheets. If I know you need to go here to get this data, click here, do this, do that, I can write a visual basic code to replace that very, very quickly. But if every day you don’t know what you’re going to be doing today in your job, that’s harder to automate.
Froehle: The most easily and directly influenced are those that process or transform information in a way that is fairly procedural, that can be scripted without a lot of creativity. We’re already seeing these generative AI tools creating content that is of fairly low quality but it just does it so quickly that it can make a difference.
What I suspect is going to happen is a lot of the fringe roles might have to change. For example, if a company can generate small pieces of artwork quickly and free, and low quality is adequate, then they might not need to hire an artist. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the artist is unemployable in general. It just means they might need to find a job in a different role or a different company.





Are there jobs that won't be affected by artificial intelligence?



Froehle: There’s a small percentage of jobs that aren’t going to be affected very much. A lot of manual labor jobs probably aren’t going to be affected very soon. Jobs that require a lot of personal, physical manipulation of things aren’t going to be affected by this as fast. But for anybody who's in an information job, they’re going to see this arrive on their desktops, on their watches, on their phones, if they haven’t already. Even most email clients right now have AI embedded in them to detect that, say, you received an email including some airline flight reservations, or for grammar checking.
Anytime you have a context that is purely information, the barriers to implementation, improvement and advancements are really, really low. Once you say you have to interact with the physical world, that’s when things become a lot more difficult. Roombas exist, but that’s about the only autonomous robot people have in their homes, and I don’t think that’s going to change much in the very near future.



Self-driving cars have received a lot of publicity. Will autonomous vehicles replace truck drivers?



Froehle: Given how we’ve been hearing promises for a decade now and we’re still in the limited on-road trials phase … Again, you’re interacting with the physical world. That’s really hard. Machine vision is getting better, processing of environmental stimuli is getting faster, but it’s a really hard nut to crack. It takes immense computing power to do it in real time with the level of reliability we expect of machines. What’s interesting is that the public tends to expect robots to be safer than people. If self-driving vehicles were only as safe as people, they would be legislated out of existence.
Fry: For that particular technology, insurance is probably a bigger barrier than the technology. If there is an accident, who’s at fault? Right now we say it’s the driver. If there’s not a driver, is it the car manufacturer, the software?



How can businesses use artificial intelligence to their benefit?



Chen: AI can help companies reduce costs. For example, companies use machines instead of human beings to reduce human resource costs. AI can also streamline the business process, to enhance the operational effectiveness and the efficiency. For example, in autonomous warehouses, robots can work faster and longer, and maintain the quality all the way through. The work processes will thus be standardized and streamlined; you don’t see a lot of deviations.



If more workers are replaced by robots, will we see more companies choose to remain in the United States rather than build factories in other countries?



Fry: It does open up a few things where labor costs could be less of an issue. This type of disruption certainly is not new. Since the ’80s we’ve talked about robots, and domestic manufacturers have reduced their labor costs by investing in robots. But at the same time, a lot of people, especially in the ’80s and ’90s talked about the “lights out factory.” That there would be no people, so you wouldn’t need any lights. It would just be all robots. There’s very, very few, if any, that are truly that. What we saw was this new equilibrium where a lot of routine tasks were done by robots and freed up humans to do other tasks that were not quite the same as [doing one action] every day, a million times a day. It did reduce labor costs, did reduce the labor force but also opened up some other jobs. Now we’re hiring skilled workers that actually work those computer-controlled machines. The company may need fewer of these workers because the computer-controlled machine is more efficient, but the workers may be paid more due to higher skill levels. It could potentially open up more companies to be willing to [stay] if labor is less of a cost, but we’ll have to see.



Will we see a time when a large percentage of people can’t get jobs because they’ve been replaced by artificial intelligence?



Froehle: I’m skeptical that it’s going to cause massive unemployment, at least anytime soon. The early indication seems to be that the net effect on jobs will probably be positive.
Fry: History suggests that’s not the most likely outcome. I would guess people have been having these same concerns, same discussions for centuries as every new technology came on. What tends to happen is efficiencies increase, new jobs are created, leisure time increases. But we do have to be careful to say that does not mean things are better for everyone. We have seen wealth inequality increase greatly. While average incomes may be up, that average income doesn’t represent everyone.
Froehle: Whether or not a specific person is capable of handling the revised version of a role is really up to that individual. But typically, jobs don’t go away as fast as they change. A classic example is most blacksmith jobs went away once we stopped riding horses, but a lot of the blacksmith-type jobs became auto mechanic jobs.
Chen: I believe the replacement happens at the task level. Jobs with tasks that can largely be automated will be at the high risk to be replaced by AI. Usually jobs that contain routine tasks and require a lot of repetitive work are very vulnerable to being replaced.
At this moment, I don’t think the technologies are ready to take the place of many jobs. But it definitely brings in a lot of changes in the organizations and how people finish their tasks. So people need to adapt to those changes and learn how to work with those technologies. In the long term, some job titles might disappear while new titles  emerge. This will require employees to acquire new skills and adapt to the changing job market.

Who is responsible for preparing individuals for the new reality of work that will be caused by artificial intelligence?



Froehle: It’s everybody. Schools, universities, trade schools, companies. Anybody who’s educating the workforce of tomorrow needs to be involved in establishing in students’ minds the fact that this stuff is here, it’s not going away and our most effective approach is to teach them how to use it, how to collaborate with it. How to do a job doesn’t end with school. There’s a lot of on-the-job training and experience gathering. Those have to also be invested in. Some companies are just going to leave it up to their employees; some are going to invest heavily. But a laissez-faire approach isn’t going to be nearly as competitive as one where you invest actively, develop your employees as well as invest in the technology.
We all talk about lifelong learning. That’s probably a minority of Americans who have that mindset. But as technology’s rate of change continues to increase, a lot more people are going to have to adopt that mindset in order to be employable.
With any technology that is increasingly ubiquitous, different roles have different responsibilities. A cab driver doesn’t need to know how the combustion happens in the engine. They don’t have to have a degree in mechanical engineering to drive a taxi. You shouldn’t need to have a computer science degree to interact with a generative AI. One of the exciting things is companies like OpenAI have put a lot of effort into making the tools accessible to the public.



How do we ensure bias isn't present in artificial intelligence?



Froehle: Ensuring that there isn’t bias is likely impossible, the same way finding a human without bias is likely impossible. Bias exists not only in the data we choose to train the AI on but also in how the AI is constructed. We need to have as much transparency as possible so that those who are concerned about it can look at it effectively.
Fry: There are certain things we can do to prevent that in terms of having a diverse training set and having what’s called “interpretable AI” or interpretable machine learning, so we can try to understand why it gave the output it did. It’s not easy to do, but it’s possible to do. But what we shouldn’t forget is if it was just a person making these decisions, they have biases. It’s sometimes unfair to say the AI or algorithm is less transparent than a person. I don’t always know why someone is making the decisions they make. They could lie to me when I ask them. Bias is inherent in any decision making, whether it’s a human or AI. But there are ways to try to make that AI potentially as transparent as a person.
Chen: We are still in the early stage of discussing AI bias. There are multiple ways we can potentially address this. In the development stage, we need to ensure transparency in AI. We can develop explainable AI, so AI not only provides the suggestions but also explains the rationale of how they came to this suggestion. Another way to address the potential bias is to include a more diverse set of people in the design group. If we could have developers from different ethnic groups, to represent different genders, to represent different minority groups, the algorithm might be designed and evaluated in a more diverse and neutral perspective. Since AI will not be perfect, we need to keep human beings in the loop when we maintain the algorithm. As we continually validate the performance of AI, we can check whether this is aligned with our core values. If there are any deviations, we will investigate the algorithms and fix the issues right away. Finally, government regulations and standards are necessary to make sure that AI is developed in an ethical manner. These regulations might include requirements of transparency and accountability, as well as guidelines for testing and validating AI systems. 
Froehle: One of the things I do worry about is: We’re going to be so excited about what these tools can do for us and how fast they do it that we’re going to spend more time building better tools and less time understanding how the tools actually work. Legislation will have to happen. With any technology, you can’t just let it govern itself because we’re going to quickly arrive at an unmanageable state.

It seems like the leadership of nearly every big company is excited about generative AI these days and rushing to announce or embrace new AI tools. But what impact will their moves have on the economy?
While it’s difficult to say for certain, global consulting leader McKinsey and Company — where GenAI is already in use by roughly half the workforce — has attempted to quantify the trend in a new report, The economic potential of generative AI.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



The report finds that GenAI could add “$2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually” to the global economy, close to the economic equivalent of adding an entire new country the size and productivity of the United Kingdom to the Earth ($3.1 trillion GDP in 2021). 
To construct the report, McKinsey’s analysts examined 850 occupations and 2,100 detailed work activities across 47 countries, representing more than 80% of the global workforce. 
A bigger impact on an accelerated timeline
The $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion economic impact figure marks a huge increase over McKinsey’s previous estimates of the AI field’s impact on the economy from 2017, up 15 to 40% from before. This upward revision is due to the incredibly fast embrace and potential use cases of GenAI tools by large and small enterprises. 
Furthermore, McKinsey finds “current generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb 60 to 70% of employees’ time today.”
Does this mean massive job loss is inevitable? No, according to Alex Sukharevsky, senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack, McKinsey’s in-house AI division and report co-author. 
“You basically could make it significantly faster to perform these jobs and do so much more precisely than they are performed today,” Sukharevsky told VentureBeat. 
What that translates to is an addition of “0.2 to 3.3 percentage points annually to productivity growth” to the entire global economy, he said. 
However, as the report notes, “workers will need support in learning new skills, and some will change occupations. If worker transitions and other risks can be managed, generative AI could contribute substantively to economic growth and support a more sustainable, inclusive world.” 
Also, the advent of accessible GenAI has pushed up McKinsey’s previous estimates for workplace automation: “Half of today’s work activities could be automated between 2030 and 2060, with a midpoint in 2045, or roughly a decade earlier than in our previous estimates.” 
Jobs and tasks most likely to be automated by generative AI and AI, generally
While generative AI has captured the public interest and imagination, McKinsey believes other AI applications and technologies will also play a major role in reshaping the global economy.
“When people talk today about GenAI, they sometimes view it an interchangeable with AI and robotics, but it is important to be precise,” Sukharevsky said.advertisement
That’s because generative AI and the large language models (LLM) at the center of the uptake of this technology are well-suited for certain kinds of white-collar, so-called “knowledge worker” roles and tasks, as opposed to general AI, robotics, and automation technologies, which may be more useful for more physical tasks such as manufacturing, construction, engineering, transportation, mining and search and rescue. 
The former is already here and disrupting the white-collar workforce, while the latter is also here but takes longer to deploy due to the physical machinery required, and will likely have longer-tail impacts further down the road, especially with projections that much of the current workforce will age out over the coming half-century, and there won’t be enough younger people coming up to replace them.
“How do you create a better piece of art? How do you write a better book? How do you produce a better movie? How do you actually create the solution for the world to recover from the worst natural disasters?” Sukharevsky asked, rhetorically, citing some examples of tasks that could be “augmented” by all kinds of AI. 
“Many new tasks and jobs will be created,” he continued. “In the short term, we clearly see the prompt engineers [for LLMs], but then in the longer term, I think the full industries will be readjusted here.”
Four tasks with most value addadvertisement
Specifically, McKinsey’s report found that four types of tasks — customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering and R&D — were likely to account for 75% of the value add of GenAI in particular.
“Examples include generative AI’s ability to support interactions with customers, generate creative content for marketing and sales and draft computer code based on natural-language prompts, among many other tasks.” 
For customer operations, McKinsey said its “research found that roughly half of customer contacts made by banking, telecommunications and utilities companies in North America are already handled by machines, including but not exclusively AI. We estimate that generative AI could further reduce the volume of human-serviced contacts by up to 50%, depending on a company’s existing level of automation.”
For marketing and sales, McKinsey found that creating more personalized and intelligent content with GenAI “could increase the productivity of the marketing function with a value between 5 and 15% of total marketing spending,” and increase the productivity of sales spending 3 to 5% globally. 
In software engineering, McKinsey sees the technology speeding up the process of “generating initial code drafts, code correction and refactoring, root-cause analysis and generating new system designs,” resulting in a 20 to 45% increased productivity on software spending. 
When it comes to R&D, McKinsey believes generative AI will “help product designers reduce costs by selecting and using materials more efficiently. It can also optimize designs for manufacturing, which can lead to cost reductions in logistics and production.”
AI as a ‘technology catalyst’ for economic growth
Overall, McKinsey views GenAI as a “technology catalyst,” pushing industries further along toward automation journeys, but also freeing up the creative potential of employees.
“I do believe that if anything, we are getting into the age of creativity and the age of creator,” Sukharevsky said.
Asked what types of AI tools he used in particular, Sukharevsky declined to comment specifically, saying he liked to test new ones out nearly every day. 
He did confirm that while the data for the report was analyzed and fetched in part by AI, the entire 2023 McKinsey report on the economic impact of AI was written by human authors.

The firm explained that recent developments in generative AI has “accelerated” its “midpoint” prediction by nearly a decade from 2053 — its 2016 estimate — to 2045.McKinsey explained that its broad range of 2030-2060 was made to encompass a range of outcomes — such as the rate at which generative AI is adopted, investment decisions and regulation, among other factors.Its previous range for 50% of work being automated was 2035-2070.McKinsey’s new predicted “midpoint” time at which automation reaches 50% of time on work-related activities has accelerated by eight years to  2045.

The report also predicts that the generative AI market will add between $2.6 to $4.4 trillion to the world economy annually and be worth a whopping $15.7 trillion by 2030.This would provide enormous economic value on top of non-generative AI tools in mainstream use today, the firm said:“That would add 15 to 40 percent to the $11.0 trillion to $17.7 trillion of economic value that we now estimate nongenerative artificial intelligence and analytics could unlock.”Generative AI systems are capable of producing text, images, audio and videos in response to prompts by receiving input data and learning its patterns. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is the most commonly used generative AI tool today.McKinsey’s $15.7 trillion prediction by 2030 is more than a three-fold increase in comparison to its $5 trillion prediction for the metaverse over the same timeframe.Related: The need for real, viable data in AI However, the recent growth of generative AI platforms hasn’t come without concerns.

The rapid advance of artificial intelligence has generated a lot of buzz, with some predicting it will lead to an idyllic utopia and others warning it will bring the end of humanity. But speculation about where AI technology is going, while important, can also drown out important conversations about how we should be handling the AI technologies available today.
One such technology is generative AI, which can create content including text, images, audio, and video. Popular generative AIs like the chatbot ChatGPT generate conversational text based on training data taken from the internet.
Today a group of 14 researchers from a number of organizations including MIT published a commentary article in Science that helps set the stage for discussions about generative AI’s immediate impact on creative work and society more broadly. The paper’s MIT-affiliated co-authors include Media Lab postdoc Ziv Epstein SM ’19, PhD ’23; Matt Groh SM ’19, PhD ’23; PhD students Rob Mahari ’17 and Hope Schroeder; and Professor Alex ""Sandy"" Pentland.
MIT News spoke with Epstein, the lead author of the paper.
Q: Why did you write this paper?
A: Generative AI tools are doing things that even a few years ago we never thought would be possible. This raises a lot of fundamental questions about the creative process and the human’s role in creative production. Are we going to get automated out of jobs? How are we going to preserve the human aspect of creativity with all of these new technologies?
The complexity of black-box AI systems can make it hard for researchers and the broader public to understand what’s happening under the hood, and what the impacts of these tools on society will be. Many discussions about AI anthropomorphize the technology, implicitly suggesting these systems exhibit human-like intent, agency, or self-awareness. Even the term “artificial intelligence” reinforces these beliefs: ChatGPT uses first-person pronouns, and we say AIs “hallucinate.” These agentic roles we give AIs can undermine the credit to creators whose labor underlies the system’s outputs, and can deflect responsibility from the developers and decision makers when the systems cause harm.
We’re trying to build coalitions across academia and beyond to help think about the interdisciplinary connections and research areas necessary to grapple with the immediate dangers to humans coming from the deployment of these tools, such as disinformation, job displacement, and changes to legal structures and culture.
Q: What do you see as the gaps in research around generative AI and art today?
A: The way we talk about AI is broken in many ways. We need to understand how perceptions of the generative process affect attitudes toward outputs and authors, and also design the interfaces and systems in a way that is really transparent about the generative process and avoids some of these misleading interpretations. How do we talk about AI and how do these narratives cut along lines of power? As we outline in the article, there are these themes around AI’s impact that are important to consider: aesthetics and culture; legal aspects of ownership and credit; labor; and the impacts to the media ecosystem. For each of those we highlight the big open questions.
With aesthetics and culture, we’re considering how past art technologies can inform how we think about AI. For example, when photography was invented, some painters said it was “the end of art.” But instead it ended up being its own medium and eventually liberated painting from realism, giving rise to Impressionism and the modern art movement. We’re saying generative AI is a medium with its own affordances. The nature of art will evolve with that. How will artists and creators express their intent and style through this new medium?
Issues around ownership and credit are tricky because we need copyright law that benefits creators, users, and society at large. Today’s copyright laws might not adequately apportion rights to artists when these systems are training on their styles. When it comes to training data, what does it mean to copy? That’s a legal question, but also a technical question. We’re trying to understand if these systems are copying, and when.
For labor economics and creative work, the idea is these generative AI systems can accelerate the creative process in many ways, but they can also remove the ideation process that starts with a blank slate. Sometimes, there’s actually good that comes from starting with a blank page. We don’t know how it’s going to influence creativity, and we need a better understanding of how AI will affect the different stages of the creative process. We need to think carefully about how we use these tools to complement people’s work instead of replacing it.
In terms of generative AI’s effect on the media ecosystem, with the ability to produce synthetic media at scale, the risk of AI-generated misinformation must be considered. We need to safeguard the media ecosystem against the possibility of massive fraud on one hand, and people losing trust in real media on the other.
Q: How do you hope this paper is received — and by whom?
A: The conversation about AI has been very fragmented and frustrating. Because the technologies are moving so fast, it’s been hard to think deeply about these ideas. To ensure the beneficial use of these technologies, we need to build shared language and start to understand where to focus our attention. We’re hoping this paper can be a step in that direction. We’re trying to start a conversation that can help us build a roadmap toward understanding this fast-moving situation.
Artists many times are at the vanguard of new technologies. They’re playing with the technology long before there are commercial applications. They’re exploring how it works, and they’re wrestling with the ethics of it. AI art has been going on for over a decade, and for as long these artists have been grappling with the questions we now face as a society. I think it is critical to uplift the voices of the artists and other creative laborers whose jobs will be impacted by these tools. Art is how we express our humanity. It’s a core human, emotional part of life. In that way we believe it’s at the center of broader questions about AI’s impact on society, and hopefully we can ground that discussion with this.

June 15, 2023 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Workato, the leading Enterprise Automation platform, today announced AI@Work which includes significant product updates that enable enterprises to adopt AI for automations to drive business efficiency. The new capabilities are seamlessly integrated into the Workato platform and leverage OpenAI technologies.


“Today, the massive productivity, efficiencies, and innovations AI can bring to businesses are only limited by the scale with which companies adopt it”Post this

“Today, the massive productivity, efficiencies, and innovations AI can bring to businesses are only limited by the scale with which companies adopt it,” said Gautham Viswanathan, co-founder, and Chief Product Officer at Workato. “Workato’s AI@Work brings the power of AI, Automation, and Integration capabilities into a single platform to enable enterprises to rapidly adopt AI at scale. With AI@Work, we are making it easier for our customers to incorporate generative AI in their automations, introducing a copilot experience to build recipes and connectors, and, finally, a new way to converse with your applications and data to automate your work.”


With AI@Work, Workato users will have access to the following:



Workato Copilots: Workato Copilots are like a co-worker who is a Workato expert. It works with you to build Workato recipes and connectors using natural language. The Copilots are trained on millions of data points from Workato’s public recipe community, have a deep understanding of business entity relationships, logic, data mappings, and transformations, and use this knowledge to guide the builder. Workato Copilots adhere to the strictest data privacy standards and do not use customer data from these interactions to train any model.




AI Connectivity: Users can use Workato’s OpenAI Connector and other AI Connectors to infuse AI capabilities into their automations to build smarter business processes. Since May 2023, many customers have used the OpenAI connector to create automated processes that generate content for sales emails/sequences, respond intelligently based on feedback, create personalized reactivation and nurture campaigns, automate help desk operations, build QBR and sales decks, enhance employee engagement, create virtual assistants, and more.




WorkbotGPT (Coming soon): WorkbotGPT enables users to converse in natural language with applications and data to automate their work. Users can also chain their interactions to automate complex multi-step automations. For example, you can instruct WorkbotGPT to fetch deals over 100K and ask for an update from the AEs. WorkbotGPT will then fetch those opportunities from Salesforce, and send an email to the AEs requesting an update. No recipes to build, no code to write. Just conversation!




GEARSAI : As the operational framework to drive adoption across any organization, GEARS (Govern, Enable, Adopt, Run, Scale), is used by Workato customers to successfully drive democratization and adoption of automation throughout their business. This framework has now been enhanced to provide a framework and roadmap for the adoption of AI along with Automation.



Workato’s AI@Work is powered by LLMs custom trained with proprietary data from Workato’s extensive public community of automations, integrations, APIs, and connectors.


Named a Leader in the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for iPaaS, Workato enables enterprises to automate their business processes across the organization by integrating their applications, data, and experiences. Designed with best-in-class security and governance, scalability, performance, and availability, Workato’s low-code, no-code platform makes it easy for IT and business teams to integrate their applications and automate their processes, drawing from thousands of automation “recipes” built by the Workato community. With Workato’s democratized approach to automation and integration, business technologists are empowered to fuel their organization’s digital transformation.


This announcement follows a year of milestones for the company which includes a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), launching the first Automate World Tour, and releasing two industry reports, The Work Automation Index and the vendor-neutral State of Business Technology Report.

Brace Yourself: The AI Jobs Panic Is About to Explode

“AI is an amplifier of human intelligence and when people are smarter, better things happen: people are more productive, happier, and the economy thrives.” – Yann LeCun
The Essay


🤖 Brace yourself: The AI jobs panic is about to explode
While extreme AI doomers will no doubt continue to intensely focus on the supposed existential threat posed by generative AI, particularly large language models, I think concerns about job loss are ready to dominate the conversation on social media and coverage by traditional media outlets. My candidate for a key catalyst is a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute, “The economic potential of generative AI.” While The New York Times went with the upbeat “Generative A.I. Can Add $4.4 Trillion in Value to Global Economy, Study Says,” for a headline, this Bloomberg hed gives a hint of hysteria to come, “Biggest Losers of AI Boom Are Knowledge Workers, McKinsey Says.” I have a feeling that alarming angle is going to catch on. From Bberg:
The transformation will pile pressure on the labor force, especially for higher-wage knowledge workers whose activities “were previously considered to be relatively immune from automation,” the report said. A few years ago, McKinsey had estimated that about half of worker hours worldwide were spent on tasks that could be automated. Now it’s raising the figure to as high as 60-70%. Employees could find that their time is reallocated — or that their jobs disappear. “Workers will need support in learning new skills,” the report said. “Some will change occupations.”
Question: If new technologies can perform part of your current job (allowing you to do higher productivity and/or more creative tasks) or even your entire job — or to put it another way, tasks previously performed by labor to be produced by capital — are you a “loser?” Such framing equates any and all change with loss. If that were truly the case, workers have been losing for more than two centuries. Yet our current prosperity is built on disruption. Indeed, McKinsey estimates that the 63 use cases spanning 16 business functions for GenAI that it has identified could deliver $3 trillion to $4 trillion in global economic benefits. And that’s in addition to the $11 trillion to $18 trillion of economic value that McKinsey estimates nongenerative AI analytics could generate. 


Then there are the potentially massive productivity gains: “Generative AI could enable labor productivity growth of 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology adoption and redeployment of worker time into other activities. Combining generative AI with all other technologies, work automation could add 0.2 to 3.3 percentage points annually to productivity growth.”


Industries rise and fall, jobs come and, the tasks performed in the production of products may change, sometimes favoring capital, other times labor. Such is economic history. But there’s a difference with generative AI, according to McKinsey, because of its ability to understand and use natural language for a variety of tasks … “particularly activities involving decision making and collaboration, which previously had the lowest potential for automation.”
Driving all of this is AI acceleration. MGI had previously identified 2027 as the earliest year when “median human performance for natural language understanding” might be achieved. But in this new analysis, the corresponding point is 2023. Now. From the report:
Previous generations of automation technology often had the most impact on occupations with wages falling in the middle of the income distribution. For lower-wage occupations, making a case for work automation is more difficult because the potential benefits of automation compete against a lower cost of human labor. Additionally, some of the tasks performed in lower-wage occupations are technically difficult to automate—for example, manipulating fabric or picking delicate fruits. Some labor economists have observed a “hollowing out of the middle,” and our previous models have suggested that work automation would likely have the biggest midterm impact on lower-middle-income quintiles. However, generative AI’s impact is likely to most transform the work of higher-wage knowledge workers because of advances in the technical automation potential of their activities, which were previously considered to be relatively immune from automation.




Overall, McKinsey sees 75 percent of the value from businesses using GenAI coming from four business functions:
Customer operations. For example: Customers could interact with a humanlike chatbot that delivers an immediate, personalized responses to complex inquiries, ensuring a consistent brand voice regardless of customer language or location), Marketing and sales. For example: Sales and marketing professionals could efficiently gather market trends and customer information from unstructured data sources and draft effective marketing and sales communications).Software engineering For example: Software engineers and product managers use GenAI to assist in analyzing, cleaning, and labeling large volumes of data, such as user feedback, market trends, and existing system logs, and research and development.Product R&D. For example: Researchers could use GenAI to generate prompt-based drafts and designs, allowing them to iterate quickly with more design options.
And here’s a specific example about product R&D:
For example, the life sciences and chemical industries have begun using generative AI foundation models in their R&D for what is known as generative design. Foundation models can generate candidate molecules, accelerating the process of developing new drugs and materials. Entos, a biotech pharmaceutical company, has paired generative AI with automated synthetic development tools to design small-molecule therapeutics. But the same principles can be applied to the design of many other products, including larger-scale physical products and electrical circuits, among others.
As it turns out, Goldman Sachs also just did a big report on the job impact of GenAI, focusing on the business and information services sector. So we’re talking about companies such as S&P Global, Moody’s, H&R Block, Manpower Group, and ADT among many others. In “Evaluating the impact of generative AI across Business & Info Services,” Goldman analysts scored companies on two dimensions; the subjectivity and creativity of their content or services, and the proprietary or commoditized nature of their content or services. The theory here is that GenAI can enhance subjective and proprietary content or services, but can disrupt rules-based and commoditized content or services. From the Goldman report
Based on our framework, we believe that generative AI can unlock a meaningful amount of opex savings in the Business & Info Services sector as headcount requirements for certain occupations go do down and productivities increase. Our analysis shows that 29-36% of labor costs in the sector could be eliminated by generative AI. Companies providing repetitive and rule-based services, such as tax preparation, background checks and staffing, could potentially benefit more from labor replacement than industry peers, with labor cost reduction potential totaling 35-36%.


Nothing in either of these reports necessarily means a faster growing and higher productivity economy will also mean one with higher unemployment, although there may be more job changing, more dynamism. If so, as MGI notes, “workers will need support in learning new skills.” But history suggests that general purpose technologies — and AI/machine learning/GenAI sure look like one — have a history of broadly improving human welfare even as they also unpredictably change what humans spend their days doing. Both of the recent periods of rapid productivity and economic growth, the 1960s and 1990s, were also ones of rapid job growth. There’s no reason yet to think another tech-driven boom will be any different.

▶ Artificial Artificial Artificial Intelligence: Crowd Workers Widely Use Large Language Models for Text Production Tasks – Veniamin Veselovsky, Manoel Horta Ribeiro, and Robert West, Arxiv | Large language models (LLMs) are remarkable data annotators. They can be used to generate high-fidelity supervised training data, as well as survey and experimental data. With the widespread adoption of LLMs, human gold standard annotations are key to understanding the capabilities of LLMs and the validity of their results. However, crowdsourcing, an important, inexpensive way to obtain human annotations, may itself be impacted by LLMs, as crowd workers have financial incentive to use LLMs to increase their productivity and income. To investigate this concern, we conducted a case study on the prevalence of LLM usage by crowd workers. We ran an abstract summarization task from the literature on Amazon Mechanical Turk and, through a combination of keystroke detection and synthetic text classification, estimate that 33–46% of crowd workers used LLMs when completing the task. Although generalization to other, less LLM-friendly tasks is unclear, our results call for platforms, researchers, and crowd workers to find new ways to ensure that human data remain human, perhaps using the methodology proposed here as a stepping stone.

“In my day,” began a voice endorsing a laissez-faire approach to police brutality, “no one would bat an eye” if a police officer killed 17 or 18 people. The voice in the video, which purportedly belonged to Chicago mayoral candidate Paul Vallas, went viral just before the city’s four-way primary in February.
It wasn’t a gaffe, a leak, or a hot-mic moment. It seemingly wasn’t even the work of a sly impersonator who had perfected his Paul Vallas impression. The video was a digital fabrication, a likely creation of generative artificial intelligence that was viewed thousands of times.
The episode heralds a new era in elections. Next year will bring the first national campaign season in which widely accessible AI tools allow users to synthesize audio in anyone’s voice, generate photo-realistic images of anybody doing nearly anything, and power social media bot accounts with near human-level conversational abilities — and do so on a vast scale and with a reduced or negligible investment of money and time. Due to the popularization of chatbots and the search engines they are quickly being absorbed into, it will also be the first election season in which large numbers of voters routinely consume information that is not just curated by AI but is produced by AI.
This change is already underway. In April, the Republican National Committee used AI to produce a video warning about potential dystopian crises during a second Biden term. Earlier this year, an AI-generated video showing President Biden declaring a national draft to aid Ukraine’s war effort — originally acknowledged as a deepfake but later stripped of that context — led to a misleading tweet that garnered over 8 million views. A deepfake also circulated depicting Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) insisting that Republicans should be barred from voting in 2024. In the future, malign actors could deploy generative AI with the intent to suppress votes or circumvent defenses that secure elections.
The AI challenge to elections is not limited to disinformation, or even to deliberate mischief. Many elections offices use algorithmic systems to maintain voter registration databases and verify mail ballot signatures, among other tasks. As with human decisions on these questions, algorithmic decision-making has the potential for racial and other forms of bias. There is growing interest by some officials in using generative AI to aid with voter education, creating opportunities to speed up processes but also producing serious risks for inaccurate and inequitable voter outreach.
AI advances have prompted an abundance of generalized concerns from the public and policymakers, but the impact of AI on the field of elections has received relatively little in-depth scrutiny given the outsize risk. This piece focuses on disinformation risks in 2024. Forthcoming Brennan Center analyses will examine additional areas of risk, including voter suppression, election security, and the use of AI in administering elections.
AI since the 2022 elections 
While AI has been able to synthesize photo-quality “deepfake” profile pictures of nonexistent people for several years, it is only in recent months that the technology has progressed to the point where users can conjure lifelike images of nearly anything with a simple text prompt. Adept users have long been able to use Photoshop to edit images, but vast numbers of people can now create convincing images from scratch in a matter of seconds at a very low — or no — cost. Deepfake audio has similarly made enormous strides and can now clone a person’s voice with remarkably little training data. 
While forerunners to the wildly popular app ChatGPT have been around for several years, OpenAI’s latest iteration is leaps and bounds beyond its predecessors in both popularity and capability. Apps like ChatGPT are powered by large language models, which are systems for encoding words as collections of numbers that reflect their usage in the vast swaths of the web selected for training the app. The launch of ChatGPT just weeks after the 2022 midterm election on November 30, 2022, has precipitated a new era in which many people regularly converse with AI systems and read content produced by AI.
Since ChatGPT’s debut, our entire information ecosystem has begun to be reshaped. Search engines are incorporating this kind of technology to provide users with information in a more conversational format, and some news sites have been using AI to produce articles more cheaply and quickly, despite the tendency for it to produce misinformation. Smaller (for now) replicas of ChatGPT and its antecedents are not limited to the American tech giants. For instance, China and Russia have their own versions. And researchers have found ways of training small models from the output of large models that perform nearly as well — enabling people around the globe to run custom versions on a personal laptop. 
Unique vulnerability to disinformation
Elections are particularly vulnerable to AI-driven disinformation. Generative AI tools are most effective when producing content that bears some resemblance to the content in their training databases. Since the same false narratives crop up repeatedly in U.S. elections — as Brennan Center research and other disinformation scholars have found, election deniers do not reinvent the wheel — there is plenty of past election disinformation in the training data underlying current generative AI tools to render them a potential ticking time bomb for future election disinformation. This includes core deceptions around the security of voting machines and mail voting, as well as misinformation tropes regularly applied to innocent and fast-resolved glitches that occur in most elections. Visual-based misinformation is widely available as well — for example, pictures of discarded mail ballots were used to distort election narratives in both the 2020 and 2022 elections.
Different kinds of AI tools will leave distinct footprints in future elections, threatening democracy in myriad ways. Deepfake images, audio, and video could prompt an uptick in viral moments around faux scandals or artificial glitches, further warping the nation’s civic conversation at election time. By seeding online spaces with millions of posts, malign actors could use language models to create the illusion of political agreement or the false impression of widespread belief in dishonest election narratives. Influence campaigns could deploy tailored chatbots to customize interactions based on voter characteristics, adapting manipulation tactics in real time to increase their persuasive effect. And they could use AI tools to send a wave of deceptive comments from fake “constituents” to election offices, as one researcher who duped Idaho state officials in 2019 using ChatGPT’s predecessor technology showed. Chatbots and deepfake audio could also exacerbate threats to election systems through phishing efforts that are personalized, convincing, and likely more effective than what we’ve seen in the past.
One need not look far to witness the potential for AI to distort the political conversation around the world: A viral deepfake showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy surrendering to Russia. Pro-China bots sharing videos of AI-generated news anchors — at a sham outfit called “Wolf News” — promoting narratives flattering to China’s governing regime and critical of the United States, the first known example of a state-aligned campaign’s deployment of video-generation AI tools to create fictitious people. GPT-4 yielding to a request from researchers to write a message for a Soviet-style information campaign suggesting that HIV, the virus that can cause AIDS, was created by the U.S. government. Incidents like these could proliferate in 2024.
Dramatically enhanced disinformation tools
In 2016, state-affiliated organizations in Russia employed hundreds and possessed a monthly budget of more than a million dollars to conduct information warfare in an attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election. Today, with the benefit of generative AI, a similar effort — or even one on a much larger scale — could be executed with a fraction of the personnel and at less expense. Future state-aligned influence campaigns could cut out many intermediaries, relying on better automated systems.
AI tools could also increase the persuasive power of large-scale disinformation campaigns by better blending falsehoods with recipients’ information environments and exploiting voters’ racial, religious, and political identities en masse. Prior Russia-backed influence campaigns were often pockmarked with obvious errors and missteps, but recent AI tools could blunt those flaws by erasing or mitigating glitchy visuals, mistranslations, grammatical faux pas, and bungled idioms so deceptions do not attract as much suspicion. Automated conversations with voters that are designed to deceive could be multiplied ad infinitum with a model fine-tuned for that function. And as Poynter has shown, apps like ChatGPT can facilitate entire misinformation-filled fake news sites — a particular risk when they masquerade as local news in “news deserts” where millions of eligible voters live in counties with no remaining local newspaper. 
At the same time, voters interacting with language models on search engines and through chatbots will likely unwittingly encounter misinformation since these tools are known to periodically “hallucinate” and even fabricate authoritative-looking footnotes with links to nonexistent articles to support false claims.
Trust in accurate election information
The president of Gabon traveled overseas for several months in 2018 to receive medical assistance. At home, his lingering absence produced confusion and fostered conspiracies. When the Gabon government released a video to prove the president was alive, opponents claimed that it was a digital forgery. Even though the video was likely authentic, the potential to create realistic fakes made the claim plausible and fueled confusion. This is what is known as the “liar’s dividend”— the mere existence of generative AI creates an atmosphere of mistrust — and the dividend could be set to grow dramatically.
Beyond outright falsehoods, the proliferation of AI-generated content may accelerate the loss of trust in the overall election information ecosystem. In the future, voters could inhabit online spaces crowded with manipulated viral images and videos and AI-generated text. Widespread use of generative technology could create a fog of confusion that makes it even harder to tell truth from falsity — an express goal of Russia’s “Firehose of Falsehood” propaganda model. That, in turn, could erode trust in election information more broadly, making it harder for voters to have faith in any sources of election information — even ones that are accurate and authoritative. Content that spoofs election officials, for instance, could result in real officials losing the credibility they largely enjoy. 
The path forward to protect elections
Americans need safeguards to protect our elections from the many risks that AI technologies pose. Below are just a few of the actions that should be considered as part of a comprehensive governmental, civil society, and private sector response to the threats that AI poses to elections and democracy.
While defending against damage to democracy from AI will require an interagency effort, the executive branch should designate a lead agency to coordinate governance of AI issues in elections. On the disinformation front, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency should create and share resources to help election offices address disinformation campaigns that exploit deepfake tools and language models to undermine election processes. To reduce the risk of AI misuse by political campaigns, the Federal Election Commission should ensure that its political ad disclosure requirements cover the full range of online communications currently permitted under federal law. That includes ensuring its rules cover political communications from paid influencers, who may disseminate AI-generated content, and the paid online promotion of content, which may also make use of AI.
The federal government should ramp up efforts to promote and encourage innovation in deepfake detection and to nurture progress in the detection of voting disinformation campaigns and election cybersecurity threats fueled by language models and chatbots, including through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the new AI Institute for Agent-based Cyber Threat Intelligence and Operation. Among the menu of actions should be the development of high-accuracy detection and anti-phishing tools for use by state and local election offices. In the arms race between AI tools that can generate disinformation and tools that accurately detect content generated by AI, the government can offer a boost to detection efforts — including those focused on coordinated bot campaigns — to bolster their effectiveness.
AI developers and social media companies must play a role in mitigating threats to democracy. Among other steps, AI developers should implement and continuously refine filters for election falsehoods and impose interface limitations to make it more difficult to create disinformation campaigns at scale. Social media companies should develop policies that reduce harms from AI-generated content while taking care to preserve legitimate discourse. They should publicly verify election officials’ accounts and other authoritative sources of election information, such as the National Association of Secretaries of State, using unique icons. (Twitter’s complimentary gray checkmark label for government accounts does not clearly cover local election offices, for example.) Platforms should devote more resources and attention to identifying and removing coordinated bots and labeling deepfakes that could influence elections. They need to coordinate closely with AI developers to continuously improve detection practices as generative AI capabilities evolve. 
Finally, Congress and state legislatures need to act quickly to regulate AI. While the process of establishing the most prudent course of action will require further discussion and refinement, it is clear that lawmakers cannot afford to dawdle or allow themselves to become mired in partisan bickering. The stakes are simply too high. Among options that merit deliberation and debate are mandating watermarking and digital signatures to help identify AI-generated content, requiring companies to prove the safety of their products before releasing them to the public, and limiting the creation and transmission of the most harmful AI-generated content that can interfere with elections.
Generative AI tools whose source code is fully public — and consequently downloadable and manipulatable — pose particular challenges since users can remove safeguards and operate these models without moderation or scrutiny. But huge numbers of users will continue to rely on proprietary AI apps provided by tech firms, so regulation targeting the development and deployment of such apps in the private sector will have a large impact despite the open-source alternatives.
Voters need some level of transparency to promote safe AI use when it comes to elections. Lawmakers could compel AI developers to make public the categories of data and guiding principles used to train and fine-tune generative AI models, they could require algorithmic impact assessments for AI systems deployed in governance settings, they could mandate periodic third-party audits of AI systems used in election administration, and they could require that election offices disclose details about their use of AI systems in running elections. Congress should also require “paid for” disclaimers and other disclosures for a much wider range of online ads than the law currently mandates. While the Honest Ads Act, a Senate bill, would accomplish this in part, it could be made even better by requiring the disclosure of information about the role of AI in generating certain political communications. These actions could help voters make informed choices and mitigate risks from AI use in election settings.
Any governmental use of generative AI to aid with educating voters or otherwise engage constituents in elections should be tightly regulated. We should also look beyond national borders to support a coordinated global response.
AI has the potential to dramatically change elections and threaten democracy. A whole-of-society response is needed.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






Made with Microsoft Bing Image Creator. Prompt: “A robot helping a software engineer develop code.”
Generative AI is already changing the way software engineers do their jobs. 
GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, ChatGPT, Tabnine, and various other AI coding tools are quickly gaining traction, helping developers automate mundane tasks and freeing them up to work on more challenging problems. 
A new survey from GitHub found that 92% of U.S.-based developers are using AI coding tools both in and outside of work, and 70% say the tools will give them an advantage at work. A majority also believe AI tools will lead to better team collaboration and help prevent burnout.
Another survey from Stack Overflow showed similar adoption of AI coding tools, with 77% saying they feel favorable about using AI in their development workflow. 
In an interview with Wired published Tuesday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said he realized AI was going to be transformative when he saw its ability to code, which led to the company developing GitHub Copilot.
We caught up with engineering leaders at six Seattle tech companies to learn about how they’re using generative AI and how it’s changing their jobs. 
Diamond Bishop, CEO and co-founder at Augmend, a Seattle collaboration software startup

“AI is making it so small startups like ours can accelerate all aspects of the software development lifecycle. We’re a team of five devs, and we estimate productivity impact of almost 2X. 
Each of us leverage both Copilot and ChatGPT in day-to-day development, debugging, and learning. Knowing the right way to leverage these tools and how best to be an AI-augmented cybernetic developer is a skill in itself, as there are pitfalls (hallucinated APIs/functions) and prompt incantations to learn. But it’s quite valuable in areas you aren’t already an expert, which is many in a jack-of-all-trades situation at a new startup. 
Going back to coding without this augmentation feels a lot like working without the internet at your fingertips.”
Bridget Frey, CTO at Redfin, a Seattle-based real estate company

“We’ve already found a number of places where AI tools are making our engineers more efficient. For instance, we’ve used LLM models, including ChatGPT, with a fair amount of success to assist with internal tasks like migrating from one programming language to another, helping developers understand legacy code written by other colleagues, or writing functions for converting data formats. These are good examples of tasks that our engineers can do without the assistance of LLMs, but with these models, they can move much faster. Something that used to take an engineer 30 minutes to do can now be done by AI in one minute.
“Something that used to take an engineer 30 minutes to do can now be done by AI in one minute.”
We’ve also found ways to use these tools to help us serve customers more efficiently. For example, it’s not unusual for homeowners to contact Redfin’s customer service team and ask why the Redfin Estimate has priced their home the way it has. So we taught a LLM to explain to us in plain language why the Redfin Estimate may have priced a specific home in a particular way, and then we can pass those insights via our customer service team back to the customer to help them understand what’s going on.
In other cases, we’re still too early in the experimentation phase to see a significant impact but are running tests to see what benefit we might gain. One such example is with Copilot, from GitHub. We’re trying to determine if its ability to suggest predictive code might help make some of our more rote coding tasks a little faster and easier by helping with simple scripts.”

Jonathan Wiggs. (Outbound AI Photo)
Jonathan Wiggs, CTO and co-founder at Outbound AI, a Seattle-based conversational AI startup 
“We’ve recently leveraged GPT to write narrative summaries of phone calls made by our AI-powered virtual agents, and what we’ve found is that GPT is able to do this effectively the same, if not better, than an experienced human worker. It’s one of the things GPT does extremely well. We’re also using some generative processes to write code snippets, specifically for well-known API calls. Large language models are great at this kind of focused, pattern-based code building. 
This said, it’s important to emphasize that we still need experienced and skilled engineers for 90% of our work. I think the companies that remain flexible and adopt these tools in a practical and thoughtful way will win the day for themselves and their customers.”

Laura Butler. (Armoire Photo)
Laura Butler, CTO at Armoire, a Seattle clothing rental startup
“We recently started using GitHub Copilot. It’s helpful with generating much of the boilerplate for unit tests. The auto-complete and auto-suggestions in Visual Studio Code are pretty good, too, without being annoying. Intellisense and language plugins like Pylance have been around for a while. GitHub Copilot just takes it to the next level.
The biggest problem with generative AI and coding is that it works best with patterns and as a fancier copy-and-paste. But great engineering isn’t pumping out tons of code. It’s about less code, shared components, using APIs and services that already exist, quality, and maintainability. The world doesn’t need more Javascript files without comments. It doesn’t need more buggy code that wasn’t thought through, reviewed, or tested properly.
I think AI tools would be of real use for engineering in two areas: documentation and brainstorming.
Documentation and comments in code get out of date so easily or they are useless. Making it easy for busy programmers to write good docs and to keep them up to date would be wonderful.  
Brainstorming assistance, generating lots of images and options from words to speed up ideation — that would be awesome, too. Those of us who aren’t graphic artists need a lot of assistance to visualize and share what’s in our heads before we start prototyping.”

John Zhang. (Highspot Photo)
John Zhang, vice president of engineering at Highspot, a Seattle sales software startup 
“We’ve seen equal parts benefits and limitations using generative AI as a ‘co-pilot’ for engineering. It’s saving us time, especially for generic implementations or generating code for some testing scenarios. 
Of course, we always check what it provides and haven’t seen value for complex implementations yet. We have begun scaling out its use across a broader range of engineers and expect greater value as we use it more.” 

Kevin Leneway. (PSL Photo)
Kevin Leneway, principal software engineer at Pioneer Square Labs, a Seattle startup studio
“We started building apps using GPT during the GPT-3 private beta in 2020, and I was an early beta user of GitHub Copilot last year. Copilot was particularly helpful for many PSL tasks like prototyping around an unfamiliar API, or swiftly writing out boilerplate code or simple tests.
Once I got access to GPT-4 in March, I really started to explore how far I could push the AI to help me to build real working code. 
Just for fun, I started building an AI coding “intern” named Otto. The goal is to have Otto interact with my existing dev and communication workflows just like any other dev on my team. I can assign issues in GitHub, give feedback via Slack, and do an interactive code review via pull requests. Otto can take on various roles; for instance, acting as a project manager by converting project briefs into a detailed list of GitHub issues, and even as a designer through a Figma plugin that turns designs into working components in my app.
When I first conceived the idea for Otto, I recognized that one of the initial steps would be to write all the code to interface with the GitHub and Slack APIs. Ordinarily this would have been a lot of tedious work to learn these APIs and get the basics working, but with GPT-4, I managed to get the core code written in just a few hours instead of days. 
“It reinvigorated my joy of coding in a way that I haven’t felt since I was a kid tinkering with my Commodore 64.” 
I’ve found that GPT-4 can efficiently handle the mundane parts, allowing me to focus on the higher-level planning and prompt engineering to get the whole project up and running. It reinvigorated my joy of coding in a way that I haven’t felt since I was a kid tinkering with my Commodore 64. 
I should note, though, despite being a huge AI enthusiast, I also have some reservations about the future. I’ve dedicated the past 20 years of my career to software development and there’s definitely some fear that my amassed knowledge will become less relevant within the next 5-to-10 years. I’ve been building out my auto-coding bot slowly over the past few months and now that it’s mostly working, I’m realizing that I’m probably one of the first people in the world to truly understand how it feels when you have a customized, aligned AI agent who is capable of doing much of my day-to-day work. It’s thrilling, but also there’s a bit of sadness knowing that the skillset I’ve cultivated is gradually declining in usefulness.”

We have officially entered the era of generative AI with tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT and DALL-E gaining more prominence everyday. And while some people are still asking, “What is generative AI?” there’s just as many asking, “How will this affect my job?” and “How do I get started with it?” And of course, there’s those who have already fully hopped on the bandwagon. At Infragistics, we currently have multiple ongoing experiments testing new features from OpenAI and ChatGPT.
3 Software Development Tasks Generative AI Can Help You With Right NowCode generation and completion: Generative AI tools can automatically suggest or generate sections of code.
Software testing: Generative AI is able to create tests and identify mistakes.
Code optimization: AI tools can recommend code modifications to boost performance or streamline the architecture.

At first glance, generative AI can seem like a beast. There’s so many features to access and different ways to use it, but you don’t have to do everything all at once. Here’s how software developers can get started with generative AI.
 
Introduction to Generative AI and Coding
Microsoft released GitHub Copilot two years ago. It’s an AI-based programming assistant that autocompletes code and helps developers accelerate hard tasks. It utilizes OpenAI Codex and GPT-3, which are large language models optimized to generate code in response to natural language questions. 
Microsoft also recently released a preview of GitHub Copilot Chat, which is more of a ChatGPT-like interface that lets developers ask questions about code, convert code from one language to another, explain code and more.
With GitHub Copilot, you have multiple options to accelerate your development:
AI-powered Intellisense.
Comment prompts and questions. 
Interactive Chat.
No matter what type of applications you are building, you’ll be able to find a Copilot-enabled feature that will help you write code easier and faster, driving efficiencies for your software developer team.

How to Use Generative AI to Automate Repetitive Tasks
With GitHub Copilot, developers can accelerate various development processes, and as a result, dial back their time spent on repetitive tasks. Developers using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Neovim or JetBrains can try Copilot directly in that IDE today. When GitHub Copilot is enabled, you get real-time autocomplete style suggestions for every aspect of your code that you are typing. In addition, using the comment prompt (//), you can ask GitHub Copilot for anything from help on syntax to writing entire code blocks or pages. 
For non-Visual Studio developers, ChatGPT is an excellent tool for the same accelerators. The only difference is that GitHub Copilot operates in-context with your code as you are typing, while ChatGPT is an interactive chat experience. This means you would ask ChatGPT questions about your code, for testing purposes or potential security issues, or just ask it to write entire functions for you. You can give ChatGPT information about your data schema, and then ask it to write a create, read, update, delete (CRUD) web API for you in Java or Python. It will do this in less than a minute, where it might take you several hours based on the complexity of your code. This is where generative AI shines, and where developer productivity can skyrocket. 


A tutorial on how to use generative AI tools like ChatGPT to write code. | Video: Fireship 
What Can You Use Generative AI Tools to Do? (With Examples).
Developers can use generative AI tools like Github Copilot to accelerate repetitive tasks like:
 
Code Generation and Completion 
As a developer types, software can automatically suggest or generate sections of code. This can cut down on errors and considerably speed up the development process. Microsoft reports that 46 percent of a developer’s code is created by GitHub Copilot, which is a significant number that will only increase with more adoption and more sophisticated models behind the AI.
 
Example
Ask GitHub Copilot questions by prefixing your question with //, like this:
// can you write a function that takes an array of CompanyName and loops through the array and returns a new array with the company names reversed
GitHub Copilot will return this as an example of the output:
 
// example: ['Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Google'] => ['elppA', 'ftroproC', 'elgooG']


As you hit the “Tab” and “Enter” key, GitHub Copilot will continue to write the lines of code that you asked for. It generates the new code commented out so it won’t run and return errors as it types, just remove the // and run your new code.
// function reverseCompanyName(array) {
//   let newArray = [];
//   for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
//     let reversed = array[i].split('').reverse().join('');
//     newArray.push(reversed);
//   }
//   return newArray;
// }

 
Software Testing
AI can increase the effectiveness of automated testing, a significant component of contemporary software development. AI is able to create tests, recognize when a system is doing improperly and give precise feedback on the types of mistakes that may have occurred.
 
Example
We’ll continue to ask GitHub Copilot to work with the code it just generated to create different types of unit tests.
// write a unit test for reverseCompanyName
// describe('reverseCompanyName', () => {
//   it('should return an array with the company names reversed', () => {
//     let array = ['Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Google'];
//     let result = reverseCompanyName(array);
//     expect(result).toEqual(['elppA', 'ftroproC', 'elgooG']);
//   });
// });

// write a unit test for reverseCompanyName that fails
// describe('reverseCompanyName', () => {
//   it('should return an array with the company names reversed', () => {
//     let array = ['Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Google'];
//     let result = reverseCompanyName(array);
//     expect(result).toEqual(['elppA', 'ftroproC', 'elgooG', 'test']);
//   });
// });

// write a unit test for reverseCompanyName that checks that the type of the return value is an array
// describe('reverseCompanyName', () => {
//   it('should return an array with the company names reversed', () => {
//     let array = ['Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Google'];
//     let result = reverseCompanyName(array);
//     expect(result).toEqual(['elppA', 'ftroproC', 'elgooG']);
//     expect(typeof result).toEqual('object');
//   });
// });

 
Code Optimization 
AI can also recommend code modifications or implement them automatically to optimize the code. This can involve anything from minor adjustments that boost performance to significant adjustments that streamline the code’s architecture, or simply cut down on the amount of code required.
 
Example 
In this example, we’ll switch gears to try something in ChatGPT. This code is a perfectly acceptable approach to count the number of items in an array:
function countNumbersPoorPerforming(arr, target) {
  var count = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === target) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}

However, what if I have a very large number of items? This function is iterating over the array arr using a for loop, and then it increments the count variable whenever we find a match between the current element and the target value. The problem is as the size of the array increases, the function’s execution time will grow linearly.
Let’s ask ChatGPT how it can help. In the prompt, I asked:
If I have a very large array, is this the most optimized code to count numbers in the array? 

function countNumbersPoorPerforming(arr, target) {
  var count = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === target) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}

ChatGPT replied with a comprehensive explanation with a new function to try:
“The code you provided is a straightforward approach to counting the occurrences of a specific number in an array. It iterates through each element of the array and increments the count if the element matches the target value. While this code will work correctly, its performance can be improved for very large arrays.
If you have a very large array, there are more efficient ways to count the numbers. One approach is to use a hash table or an object to store the counts of each number in the array. This way, you only need to iterate through the array once, and for each element, you can increment its count in the hash table. Here’s an example:”
function countNumbers(arr, target) {
  const countMap = {};
  
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const num = arr[i];
    countMap[num] = (countMap[num] || 0) + 1;
  }
  
  return countMap[target] || 0;
}

Advantages of Using Generative AI Tools in Software Development
When developers can automate their more repetitive tasks, they have more time to focus on complex and creative projects. Developers can go back to the projects that made them start as developers in the first place–with creativity leading the way. In fact, according to Github Copilot, 74 percent of developers using the tool reported that they felt less frustrated when coding and that they were able to focus on more satisfying work.
Some of the generative AI capabilities that developers can tap into for these more complex and creative projects, include:
 
Database Optimizations
AI tools can create data schemas, suggest schema improvements and generate data based on schema information. 
 
Advanced or Predictive Analytics 
AI tools like ChatGPT can very quickly answer analytics questions about your data. For example, if you pass it a data set, it can find outliers, correlations, regressions, future predictions and other deep data-related insights. A word of caution: Anything you upload to open tools like ChatGPT will be informing its model. Do not pass confidential information as you experiment.
 
Image Generation 
While some are better than others, developers that need images generated for projects can get them in a snap with AI tools. Building a website selling exotic surfboards? With the right prompts, you can get high-quality digital images that can be used in your applications. 
 
UX/UI Design 
AI can help in the UX design process by suggesting or creating user interface designs, predicting how users will interact with the design and suggesting improvements based on user feedback and usage data. While this is a very sophisticated expectation of AI, the more information you give the model, or the better the prompt, the more useful the outcome will be.
Instead of looking at AI as “taking” work away, look at it as a new partner in your workflow. Start experimenting with different AI tools that map to your needs, and work with your team on how to integrate them into your pipelines. While some of this is just individual accelerators (like GitHub Copilot to help write code faster), other AI capabilities like natural language processing (NLP) in custom Chatbots are enterprise-level capabilities that can be game changers for an organization and your customers.

Common Mistakes to Avoid While Using Generative AI
While generative AI is a game changer for productivity, there are caveats that every developer should be aware of. The code generated is based on what the model is aware of – it is learning from the millions of GitHub repositories and other public code repositories and sources. 
If there is not a large body of publicly available code using a library, Copilot may not be able to give meaningful code suggestions. Python, the world’s most popular language, has a very high (40 percent) accepted code rate using Copilot, along with other popular languages that have billions of lines of code publicly available like JavaScript, TypeScript, C# and Go. You may not have as high of a success rate if you are using something newer that does not have a large body of work available to the models.
Other items to consider are:
Because neither GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT are testing the code that they recommend, the results they suggest may not work or make sense.
The AI tooling does not necessarily know the latest versions of frameworks or libraries, so it may suggest code that is out of date.
Your prompt is the most important part of a successful output from the AI tools. Experiment by asking questions in different ways, and researching how others are getting results.
Non-English language prompts won’t always get the best results, as the majority of public repositories used are in English.
The best practice with any AI tool is to treat AI generated content just like you’d treat code from any public source that you did not create yourself. This means thoroughly testing for functionality and performance and ensuring there aren’t security vulnerabilities or maliciously generated code.

Blockchain and generative artificial intelligence (AI) are two disruptive technologies that can truly revolutionise businesses and various professional domains across the globe. The convergence of these technologies holds immense potential in creating secure, intelligent and adaptive systems even as they are together fuelling the demand for skilled professionals and consultancies in the tech landscape. To get a nuanced perspective, we need to understand what these technologies are and how they work and complement each other.
Understanding generative AI and blockchain
Generative AI, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on creating new content or data that is not present in the original input. Powered by deep neural networks like variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and transformers, generative AI models learn from vast amounts of data and generate new outputs based on probabilistic models. Generative AI can be gainfully applied in content creation, data augmentation and driving innovation.
Blockchain, on the other hand, is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure and transparent transactions without intermediaries. Having revolutionised domains like finance, supply chain and identity management by offering transparency, efficiency, and enhanced security, it stores data in blocks linked by cryptographic hashes and validated through consensus mechanisms.
Complementing each other’s strengths
The integration of blockchain and generative AI unlocks numerous benefits. Blockchain technology provides control and transparency to AI models by creating an audit trail of all AI model management activities. This integration enhances accountability, governance and trust. Additionally, blockchain improves generative AI by enhancing the quality of training data, ensuring diverse and representative inputs. It strengthens cybersecurity to provide robust and efficient systems for secure transactions.
Real-world examples show the way
One notable example of how blockchain and generative AI work together is Doppl, a platform that leverages both technologies to create realistic digital avatars. Doppl utilises generative AI to create natural language interfaces that interact with users through chatbots or voice assistants. Blockchain ensures the security and privacy of user data and transactions, preventing unauthorised access or manipulation. This integration showcases the potential of these technologies in delivering personalised services while maintaining security.
Benefits, challenges and future prospects
The integration of blockchain and generative AI brings efficiency, productivity and enhanced customer experience. Smart contracts automate transactions, saving time and resources. Tailored content and recommendations based on individual preferences foster engagement and loyalty. Furthermore, this integration fuels innovation and creativity, enabling the development of new products and business models.
However, challenges like technical complexity, scalability and human impact must be addressed. The demand for skilled professionals with expertise in blockchain and generative AI is growing rapidly, creating a talent gap in the market. This gap provides opportunities for consultancies to guide businesses in adopting these technologies and addressing associated challenges.
Personalised content creation, decentralised innovation, and ethical AI development are some future scenarios enabled by the integration of these technologies. Exploring these possibilities will unlock new avenues for personalisation, collaboration and responsible use of AI technologies.
Fuelling hiring expectations
The demand for blockchain and Web3 skills is growing rapidly due to the integration of AI into the tech landscape. This surge in demand is favoring specialists with niche skillsets, like data scientists, developers, cybersecurity engineers, and blockchain developers. However, the supply of talent with these skills is limited, which has created a talent gap in the market. According to a report by KPMG, 67% of CEOs face a challenge in sourcing talent with specialised skills in emerging technologies like AI and blockchain. Moreover, the rapid evolution of these technologies requires constant upskilling and reskilling of existing talent.
Consultancies can pitch in here by helping businesses negotiate their digital transformation journey with backup support on strategy, design, implementation, testing, maintenance, change management, stakeholder engagement and regulatory compliance.
Enormous potential, possibilities galore
The integration of blockchain and generative AI is still in its infancy, but it has already shown promising results. As these technologies mature and evolve, we can expect to see more use cases and applications across various industries.
There are several potential future scenarios that can arise from the integration of blockchain and generative AI. Personalised content creation is one such scenario, enabling users to generate their own personalised content or data based on their needs. This may include creating digital avatars, music, videos, or texts through generative AI models that are stored securely on the blockchain.
Furthermore, the integration of these technologies can contribute to the advancement of ethical and responsible AI systems. Blockchain technology provides transparency, accountability and governance, which are crucial for ensuring the ethical development and use of AI. Users can track and audit the activities and outputs of generative AI models that are recorded on the blockchain, thus promoting responsible practices.
To sum it up, blockchain and generative AI are reshaping industries and driving hiring expectations. Their convergence creates systems that are secure, intelligent and adaptive. Businesses and society can benefit from increased efficiency, productivity, enhanced customer experience and innovation. However, challenges must be navigated and consultancies can play a crucial role in guiding businesses through this transformative journey. By harnessing the power of blockchain and generative AI, we can unlock new possibilities and shape a technology-driven future.

FNB is running an Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy programme aimed at equipping its workforce with skills and competencies they need to be able to use for the new world of work. The programme also equips employees to critically assess AI tools, understand their context and embedded principles, and question their design and implementation. This includes understanding the basics of what AI is, how it works, and what the strengths and limitations of the technologies are.
Financial institutions like FNB have had to reimagine ways of working and ways of engaging with their customers. We’ve had to rapidly scale up online channels used to engage customers. We’ve also had to accelerate digital transformation initiatives and embrace automation to meet complex customer needs and to drive digital operational efficiency.




We’re in the midst of an era in which emerging technologies are becoming commonplace, and ever more capable, shaking up numerous industries in the process. One of these technologies is AI, which enables computers to perform the sorts of tasks generally thought to require human intelligence, and which can “learn” and adapt, and financial services are going to be as affected by it as any other industry.
Our new reality is AI-driven, and FNB’s workforce should feel excited rather than threatened. Because instead of presenting an existential threat, AI is poised to help the Bank scale up digital channels, meet more of our customers’ evolving needs, and drive efficiency for less complex work which AI can often automate. Where AI can’t automate a task, it can often nonetheless augment people’s ability to complete it. That frees up employees to do more creative work better suited to their expertise and helps increase effectiveness throughout the organisation.
AI isn’t new, but the rate at which its changing industries is ramping up exponentially. McKinsey expects the AI industry for banking will become a trillion-dollar one in coming years. A third of that value is anticipated to come from advanced AI functions — predominantly in the risk space — with the other two-thirds stemming from traditional AI and analytics used by marketing, sales, risk, and human resource (HR) divisions.
A UBS Evidence Lab report shows that 80% of banks like ours are highly aware of the potential benefits presented by AI, and by the end of 2023, the aggregate potential cost savings for banks from Al applications is estimated at $447 billion.
While FNB continues to steer the data literacy programme to enable the organisation to “speak data”, it’s also necessary to empower our people with AI skills by ensuring a base level of AI literacy. AI helps employees become more competent by deepening their knowledge of the work they do and helps reduce the time spent doing menial tasks.
This AI literacy programme covers — among other topics — the history of AI and its potential for financial services, why organisations need an AI strategy, current AI trends and tools, aligning AI strategies with business goals, and how to use AI tools to improve your effectiveness.
It also covers how frontline staff can identify and assess the possibilities for AI in the organisation, how to justify your use of AI to top management, regulators, and their staff with performance-based evidence, and how to align AI with strategic business goals. By the end of the programme, they will understand AI use cases, how to assess and prioritise AI opportunities, how to master responsible AI principles, and the factors to consider when building or enhancing an AI infrastructure to support AI applications.
They will also understand how to create a suitable data strategy to support the organisational AI strategy, what the pre-requisites for mitigating AI failures are, and how decision intelligence connects AI, data, actions, and value creation.
This AI literacy programme will equip FNB employees with skills (e.g., how to leverage AI, data informed decision making etc.) needed to use AI technologies and applications as tools, and reimagine ways of working and ways of engaging with customers.
This programme will also enable FNB to build further and scale its AI capabilities, drive collaborative engagement, and position FNB as a leading force that is leveraging AI to continue driving the contextual banking value proposition through scaling up digital channels (e.g. AI bots, digital payment advisors and risk detection mechanisms lead to higher quality of services to a wider customer base), use AI to customize financial products and services by adding personalized features for customers, and improve customer experience by understanding and meeting their evolving needs.
Through this programme FNB will be able to accelerate the use of AI to keep up with complex, evolving, and emerging risks (including climate, cyber, financial crimes, and the like) and drive efficiency for work which AI can often automate allowing FNB to leverage human and machine capabilities optimally to drive operational and cost efficiencies and deliver personalized services.
