But a limited pool of talent has allowed viable candidates who smell the desperation to put a high price on their skills. The number of job postings featuring “artificial intelligence” or “machine learning” in their description has doubled since 2015, according to global jobs site Indeed.com, and prospective employees are increasingly seeking them out. Search entries for AI and machine learning positions have risen 182 percent in the past three years. But more job searches don’t mean more qualified applicants, as industries struggle to find sufficiently skilled candidates.Meanwhile, the lucrative salaries being offered on public platforms such as Indeed.com may pale in comparison with bigger-money AI jobs filled directly or via head-hunters—jobs which can come with huge bonuses and stock options.Have a confidential tip for our reporters?

One Hour Translation CEO Ofer Shoshan told me that within one to three years, neural machine technology (NMT) translators will carry out more than 50% of the work handled by the $40 billion market.
PROMOTED
His words stand in stark contrast to the often-repeated maxim that, in the near future at least, artificial intelligence will primarily augment, rather than replace, human professionals.
Shoshan told me that the quality of machine translation has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years, to the point where half a million human translators and 21,000 agencies could soon find themselves out of work.
He says, ""The analogy that we can use is Kodak and digital photography - Kodak didn't see it coming … and before that, Corona typewriters and word processors
""Two years ago, translation technology would produce something that at best would let you get a general understanding of what the text was about – but in most cases, a professional translator would tell you they would rather just translate from scratch because they couldn't understand a lot of the output.
“Today with neural machines, for a growing amount of material and categories, they only need to make a very small number of changes to what a machine outputs, in order to get a human-quality translation.”

Quantifying this, Shoshan tells me that today on average 10% of a machine-translated document needs to be fine-tuned by humans to meet the standards expected by his company's Fortune 500 clients. Just two years ago, that figure was around 80%.
This has been made possible by the switch to neural machine translation – sometimes known as deep learning – adopted by the most advanced machine translation tools. Previously these relied on a method known as statistical translation. Google, Bing, and Amazon now all use NMT in their translation engines.
Training a neural machine to translate between languages requires nothing more than feeding a large quantity of material, in whichever languages you want to translate between, into the neural net algorithms.
To adapt to this rapid transformation, One Hour Translation has developed tools and services designed to distinguish between the different translation services available, and pick the best one for any particular translation task.
""For example, for travel and tourism, one service could be great at translating from German to English, but not so good at Japanese. Another could be great at French but poor at German. So we built an index to help the industry and our customers. We can say, in real time, which is the best engine to use, for any type of material, in any language.""
This work – comparing the quality of the output of NMT generated translation, gives a clue as to how human translators could see their jobs transforming in coming years. Humans rate the output of each engine and compile the index. In the case of One Hour Translation's index, this is done once per quarter, to reflect the speed at which NMT is evolving, and new players are emerging onto the market.
If that sounds like a silver lining, however, then things may not be quite that straightforward. The level of training and expertise required to rate machine translations, or to translate while “augmented” by a machine, is far lower than for traditional, “from scratch” translation.
“You need someone smart, with good language skills – but they don’t need to be a professional, traditionally-trained translator, because fixing one word here or there is much easier,” says Shoshan.
So, as was the case during the first industrial revolution, are we likely to see gangs of translators rioting in the streets and smashing up the intelligent machines which are threatening their livelihoods?
""I hope not,"" Shoshan says. ""But actually, it is an issue, just like autonomous trucking will be an issue for the four million or so truck drivers employed in the US.
""And importantly, we're not talking about five to ten years; we're talking one to three years.
“It’s obvious that if machines can do what you can do, then you have a problem. A lot of translators and agencies will tell you that there are certain highly specialized translation services which will require a human touch for the foreseeable future – and that may be true.
“But for the bulk – I would estimate 80% - of the material that corporate customers pay to have translated on the market today, it will be machine translatable in the next one to three years.”
Some advice for translators wanting to keep their heads above water could include specializing in languages which are less widely spoken. NMT services rely on huge bodies of literature being available, to train the algorithms – and for languages with a smaller user base, that quantity of material may not be readily available, particularly in specialist, technical or scientific subjects.
Another, as is the case with One Hour Translation, could be to get used to working alongside machines. While they will do the bulk of the work, there will be a need for people able to assess different translation technology and apply the correct tools for specific jobs.
One thing seems certain, however - hiding your head in the sand and pretending that none of this is happening is a recipe for unemployment.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",Enterprise & Cloud,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,

Yet for all the potential it has to do harm, AI might have just as much potential to be a force for good in the world.Harnessing the power for good will require international cooperation, and a completely new approach to tackling difficult ethical questions, the authors of an editorial published in the journal Science argue.“From diagnosing cancer and understanding climate change to delivering risky and consuming jobs, AI is already showing its potential for good,” says Mariarosaria Taddeo, deputy director of the Digital Ethics Lab at Oxford University and one of the authors of the commentary. “The question is how can harness this potential?”Trending NowQ&A: What's Next for the Coronavirus Pandemic?One example of the potential is the AI from Google's DeepMind, which made correct diagnoses 94.5 per cent of the time in a trial with Moorfields Eye Hospital, looking at 50 common eye problems. Another is helping us understand how the brain works.The potential for AI to do good is immense, says Taddeo. Technology using artificial intelligence will have the capability to tackle issues “from environmental disasters to financial crises, from crime, terrorism and war, to famine, poverty, ignorance, inequality, and appalling living standards,” she says.For example, AI has already been used to sift through hundreds of bird sounds to estimate when songbirds arrived at their Arctic breeding grounds. This kind of analysis will allow researchers to understand how migratory animals are responding to climate change. Another way we are learning about climate change is through images of coral. An AI trained by looking at hundreds of pictures of coral helped researchers to discover a new species this year, and the technique will be used to analyse coral's resistance to ocean warming.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDYet AI is not without its problems. In order to ensure it can do good, we first have to understand the risks.The potential problems that come with artificial intelligence include a lack of transparency about what goes into the algorithms. For example, an autonomous vehicle developed by researchers at the chip maker Nvidia went on the roads in 2016, without anyone knowing how it made its driving decisions.There is also a question over who is responsible if they make a mistake. Take the example of an autonomous car that's about to be involved in a crash. The car could be programmed to act in the safest way for the passenger, or it could be programmed to protect the people in the other vehicle. Whether or not the manufacturer or the owner makes that decision, who is responsible for the fate of people involved in the car crash? Earlier this year, a team of scientists designed a way to put the decision in the hands of the human passenger. The 'ethical knob' would switch a car’s setting from “full altruist” to “full egoist”, with the middle setting being impartial.Another issue is the potential for AI to unfairly discriminate. One example of this, says Tadeo, was Compas, a risk-assessment tool developed by a privately held company and used by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections. According to Taddeo, the system was used to decide whether to grant people parole and ended up discriminating against African-American and Hispanic men. When a team of journalists studied 10,000 criminal defendants in Broward County, Florida, it turned out the system predicted that black defendants pose a higher risk of recidivism than actually do in the real world, while predicting the opposite for white defendants.Read more: AI-powered brain emulation is changing our definition of deathMeanwhile, there is the issue of big data collection. AI is being used to track whole cities in China, drawing on data collected from various sources. For AI to progress, the amount of data needed for it to be successful is only going to increase. This means there will be increasing chances for people's data to be collected, stored and manipulated without their consent, or even their knowledge.But Taddeo says national and supranational laws and regulations, such as GDPR, will be crucial to establish boundaries and enforce principles. Yet ultimately, AI is going to be created globally and used around the world, potentially also in space, for example when hunting for exoplanets. So the ways we regulate it cannot be specific to boundaries on Earth.There should be no universal regulator of artificial intelligence, she says. “AI will be implemented across a wide range of fields, from infrastructure-building and national defence to education, sport, and entertainment” she says. So, a one-size-fits-all approach would not work. “We need to consider culturally-dependent and domain-dependent differences.” For example, in one culture it may be deemed acceptable to take a photograph of a person, but another culture may not allow photographs to be taken for religious reasons.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David GilbertPoliticsElon Musk ‘Fully Endorses’ Donald Trump After Deadly Rally ShootingBy Makena Kelly, WIREDThere are a few initiatives already working on understanding AI technology and its foreseeable impact. These include AI4People, the first global forum in Europe on the social impact of AI, the EU’s strategy for AI and the EU Declaration on Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence. The EU declaration was signed earlier this year, and those involved pledged to work together on both AI ethics and using AI for good purposes, including modernising Europe's education and training systems.Other initiatives include the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, which both of the Science editorial's authors are members of. ""We designed the Partnership on AI, in part, so that we can invest more attention and effort on harnessing AI to contribute to solutions for some of humanity’s most challenging problems, including making advances in health and wellbeing, transportation, education, and the sciences"" say Eric Horvitz and Mustafa Suleyman, the Partnership on AI's founding co-chairs.These are in their early stages, but more initiatives like this need to be created so an informed debate can be had, says Taddeo. The most important thing is we keep talking about it. ""The debate on the governance of AI needs to involve scientists, academics, engineers, lawyers, policy-makers, politicians, civil society and business representatives"" says Taddeo. ""We need to understand  the nature of post-AI societies and the values that should underpin the design, regulation, and use of AI in these societies.""After all, we are only humans. So the risk remains that we may misuse or underuse AI.“In this respect, AI is not different from electricity or steam engines” says Taddeo. “It is our responsibility to steer the use of AI in such a way to foster human flourishing and well-being and mitigate the risks that this technology brings about.”This article was originally published by WIRED UKEnter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

Yet AI is not without its problems. In order to ensure it can do good, we first have to understand the risks.
The potential problems that come with artificial intelligence include a lack of transparency about what goes into the algorithms. For example, an autonomous vehicle developed by researchers at the chip maker Nvidia went on the roads in 2016, without anyone knowing how it made its driving decisions.
There is also a question over who is responsible if they make a mistake. Take the example of an autonomous car that's about to be involved in a crash. The car could be programmed to act in the safest way for the passenger, or it could be programmed to protect the people in the other vehicle. Whether or not the manufacturer or the owner makes that decision, who is responsible for the fate of people involved in the car crash? Earlier this year, a team of scientists designed a way to put the decision in the hands of the human passenger. The 'ethical knob' would switch a car’s setting from “full altruist” to “full egoist”, with the middle setting being impartial.
Another issue is the potential for AI to unfairly discriminate. One example of this, says Tadeo, was Compas, a risk-assessment tool developed by a privately held company and used by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections. According to Taddeo, the system was used to decide whether to grant people parole and ended up discriminating against African-American and Hispanic men. When a team of journalists studied 10,000 criminal defendants in Broward County, Florida, it turned out the system predicted that black defendants pose a higher risk of recidivism than actually do in the real world, while predicting the opposite for white defendants.

Meanwhile, there is the issue of big data collection. AI is being used to track whole cities in China, drawing on data collected from various sources. For AI to progress, the amount of data needed for it to be successful is only going to increase. This means there will be increasing chances for people's data to be collected, stored and manipulated without their consent, or even their knowledge.
But Taddeo says national and supranational laws and regulations, such as GDPR, will be crucial to establish boundaries and enforce principles. Yet ultimately, AI is going to be created globally and used around the world, potentially also in space, for example when hunting for exoplanets. So the ways we regulate it cannot be specific to boundaries on Earth.
There should be no universal regulator of artificial intelligence, she says. “AI will be implemented across a wide range of fields, from infrastructure-building and national defence to education, sport, and entertainment” she says. So, a one-size-fits-all approach would not work. “We need to consider culturally-dependent and domain-dependent differences.” For example, in one culture it may be deemed acceptable to take a photograph of a person, but another culture may not allow photographs to be taken for religious reasons.
There are a few initiatives already working on understanding AI technology and its foreseeable impact. These include AI4People, the first global forum in Europe on the social impact of AI, the EU’s strategy for AI and the EU Declaration on Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence. The EU declaration was signed earlier this year, and those involved pledged to work together on both AI ethics and using AI for good purposes, including modernising Europe's education and training systems.
Other initiatives include the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, which both of the Science editorial's authors are members of. ""We designed the Partnership on AI, in part, so that we can invest more attention and effort on harnessing AI to contribute to solutions for some of humanity’s most challenging problems, including making advances in health and wellbeing, transportation, education, and the sciences"" say Eric Horvitz and Mustafa Suleyman, the Partnership on AI's founding co-chairs.
These are in their early stages, but more initiatives like this need to be created so an informed debate can be had, says Taddeo. The most important thing is we keep talking about it. ""The debate on the governance of AI needs to involve scientists, academics, engineers, lawyers, policy-makers, politicians, civil society and business representatives"" says Taddeo. ""We need to understand  the nature of post-AI societies and the values that should underpin the design, regulation, and use of AI in these societies.""
After all, we are only humans. So the risk remains that we may misuse or underuse AI.
“In this respect, AI is not different from electricity or steam engines” says Taddeo. “It is our responsibility to steer the use of AI in such a way to foster human flourishing and well-being and mitigate the risks that this technology brings about.”

There is no question that automation is changing the nature of work. But are the robots really coming for your job?
One of the most popular narratives is that low-paying jobs are doomed, while college-educated professions will remain largely untouched. Analysts often focus on wages and education as the primary predictors of job evolution, along with organizations’ potential to increase efficiency and reduce costs by changing or cutting jobs. But our research points to a more nuanced explanation.
A review of the academic literature and public discourse on automation revealed limited consideration of risks by profession. So we did our own comparison, coding 50 professions (including many from our literature survey) according to the type of value jobholders delivered and the skills they used to deliver it, to create a framework that helps workers assess what kind of threat automation poses for them. We identified four paths of evolution — jobs will be disrupted, displaced, deconstructed, or durable — and found that value is more predictive of change than wages, education, efficiency, cost, or other factors.
Counter to popular belief, it’s not necessarily blue-collar or non-college-educated workers who will be most threatened by automation in the coming decades. Our analysis suggests that a plumber may see less disruption than a legal professional. Simply instructing everyone to engage in continuous education and skill development is remiss. Workers must understand the four paths of job evolution — and the factors behind each path — if they hope to adapt.
Understanding the Four Paths
A jobholder uses a core set of skills to deliver value in some form to a recipient — either externally to a customer or within an organization. Jobs evolve as those consumers’ perceptions of value fluctuate along two dimensions: core skills and delivery mechanism, or what we call value form.
For some jobs, core skill sets include a specific knowledge base or craft. Others involve people skills and the ability to build relationships rather than technical expertise. Skills that can easily be standardized, codified, or routinized are most likely to be automated. Those that involve hands-on or real-time problem-solving are less so, because developing tools sophisticated enough to handle such ambiguity is either too cost- and labor-intensive or technologically out of reach. For example, while an electrician’s skills may seem vulnerable to automation, the application of those skills varies widely according to the unique circumstances of every client. This degree of customization would be difficult to automate.
A skill set provides value only when it is delivered to a recipient, however, and the delivery mechanism may be transformed. Here’s an example: A professor’s core skill set is expertise in a certain domain. Such expertise has traditionally been delivered to consumers (students) through in-person classes. However, online platforms and massive open online courses, or MOOCs, offer new vehicles through which learning can occur. The core skill remains the same, but technology is shifting the value form as adaptive software and virtual tutors offer highly personalized instruction and support to growing numbers of students with diverse needs. And computer-directed learning will continue to improve with the increasing sophistication of automation and AI.
We identified the four ways automation will affect jobs by separately assessing the degree of threat to each profession’s core skill set and value form. (See “Which Professions Are Most Vulnerable to Automation?”) Here, we’ll describe those paths to evolution and suggest strategies for navigating each one.

Which Professions Are Most Vulnerable to Automation?
Threats should be assessed along two dimensions: How replaceable are the core skill sets? And how much of a shift is there in the way value is delivered?




Disruption. Disruption occurs when the skills in a job are highly standardized yet the consumer prefers to receive value in the same form. It typically follows a reduction in the production costs of goods or services due to increased efficiency. For example, fast-food workers’ core skill sets are highly threatened by the implementation of self-ordering stations and apps where customers place their own orders. Food preparation in this setting is also highly standardized and may eventually be automated as well, disrupting workers in both checkout stations and kitchens. Although these workers’ skills are threatened, the consumer will continue to receive the same value form — fast food prepared consistently and quickly.
Some highly skilled professionals, such as real-estate agents and legal professionals, are experiencing similar disruption from house-hawking robots and the automation of document reviews and other routine legal tasks (although the more nuanced work of advising clients and negotiating in court requires human lawyers, at least for now). Accountants — another example — are seeing the automation of company ledgers and other types of financial data. Value form is not threatened because consumers still need access to their financials, but the skills used to generate those financials are vulnerable.









Finding transitional roles in which human involvement remains necessary is one adaptive solution. As large-scale automation continues to spread, consumers will have to learn to interact with nonhuman providers and adopt new routines. Disrupted workers can function as a bridge, ensuring that value is delivered to end users in its current form as processes are automated. For example, bricklaying robots are much faster and possess more stamina than their human counterparts. But for now, human bricklayers are necessary to complement and safeguard the robots’ abilities, read blueprints, and do corners.
Displacement. With displacement, the core skills of a job are deemed obsolete and the value form is irreversibly altered. Toll takers and telephone operators have already experienced displacement, but even highly skilled professions are not immune. Take pharmacists. They fill prescriptions, deliver them to consumers, and answer questions at brick-and-mortar pharmacies. Yet as more prescriptions are filled online and delivered through the mail, the value form and core skills of human pharmacists are increasingly fulfilled by automated processes. Other jobs facing displacement include librarians (for similar reasons) and software developers (because the skill of writing code is easily standardized, and thus value form has shifted away from in-house development to open platforms such as the cloud).
Retraining is often recommended for displaced workers, but that doesn’t always mean more formal education. They should focus on quickly acquiring the most relevant skills in an area with a relatively stable value form. In a volatile job market, lengthy programs that require years to complete (such as extra bachelor’s degrees) are likely not the best approach. Micro-credentialing programs — competency-based certifications, mini-degrees, and digital badges — deliver qualifications more quickly and offer more options on the path to a degree along with a sense of accomplishment as individuals obtain marketable skills fast. We suggest targeting high-growth sectors that need workers. A timely example is cybersecurity — a rapidly growing field where trained workers (who can qualify through certificate programs) are in demand.
Deconstruction. In the case of deconstruction, the core skill set remains safe, but the value form is threatened. Take, for example, taxi or limo drivers, or anyone who operates a car service. Livery drivers’ skills are central to the value delivered to customers — getting from point A to point B safely and efficiently. While those skills may be threatened by driverless automobiles at some point, human drivers will likely be a necessity in the near term. Yet the value form has already shifted. Traditionally, the value of livery transportation was offered as part of a centralized fleet — drivers were employed by a handful of taxi management companies within a city. Now, the same value is being delivered by Uber, Lyft, and others in the decentralized sharing economy. Photographers and professors are facing similar deconstruction. Their skills remain important, but consumer delivery preferences are changing.

When facing deconstruction, adapt your skills to new value forms. While this sounds easy enough, the biggest impediment is resistance to change. It is well-documented, for example, that many faculty resist online education as a new model for sharing knowledge and expertise with students. Livery drivers would be wise to adjust to evolving transportation norms instead of following these professors’ lead. When a new value form becomes central to consumers’ expectations, you have a choice: acclimate or fade into obsolescence.
Durability. Often lost in workforce analyses is the fact that many jobs will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future, including some lower-wage jobs. We refer to jobs as durable when neither the core skill set nor the value form is under significant threat. Electricians and plumbers are highly durable professions because the work is rarely routine and the cost to develop a technology that could deliver value in the same form — hands-on problem-solving — is excessive. Another example is the physician assistant. The skills associated with this job — medical training, insurance industry insight, bedside manner — will likely become more important as broader technological advancements require fewer doctors to treat more patients. Doing much the same work for less money, physician assistants may just disrupt the role of doctors.
The key for people in durable jobs is to avoid complacency by keeping an eye on tomorrow. Consider whether consumers’ future preferences are more likely to threaten your profession’s core skill set or its value form. Be aware that any job (including those discussed here) could drift from one evolution path to another over time. Thus, the framework we’ve described is a tool to be consulted regularly, even if your job is durable now.
It’s difficult to tell which jobs will be disrupted, displaced, deconstructed, or durable further down the road, but we believe that the basic framework presented here will hold up to changing times. While others have acknowledged that automation will affect jobs in different ways, our focus on jobs as a function of value creation offers an explanation of the underlying dimensions at play. Understanding core skills and value form as the key units of analysis will help jobholders of all types respond to workforce changes currently underway — and tackle those that are impossible to predict.

DataNews 15 millions jobs in Britain at stake with Artificial Intelligence robots set to replace humans at workforce

By Natasha Mathur -   August 23, 2018 - 7:00 am 4863 0 










2 min readEarlier this week, the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, gave a warning that the UK needs a skills revolution as up to 15 million jobs in Britain are at stake. This is apparently due to a “third machine age” where Artificial Intelligence is making a huge number of jobs that were previously the preserve of humans outdated.
Haldane says that this potential “Fourth Industrial Revolution” could cause disruptions on a “much greater scale” than the damage experienced during the first three Industrial Revolutions. This is because the first three industrial revolutions were mainly about machines replacing humans doing manual tasks.  But, the fourth Industrial revolution will be different. As Haldane told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, “the 20th-century machines have substituted not just for manual human tasks, but cognitive ones too — human skills machines could reproduce, at lower cost, has both widened and deepened”.
With robots becoming more intelligent, there will be deeper degrees of hollowing-out of jobs in this revolution than in the past. The Bank of England has classified jobs into three categories –jobs with a high (greater than 66%), medium (33-66%) and low (less than 33%) chances of automation. Administrative, clerical and production jobs are at the highest risk of getting replaced by Robots. Whereas, jobs focussing on human interaction, face-to-face conversation, and negotiation are less likely to suffer.

Probability of automation by occupation
This “hollowing out” poses risk not only for low-paid jobs but will also affect the mid-level jobs.

Meanwhile, the UK’s Artificial Intelligence Council Chair, Tabitha Goldstaub, mentioned that the “challenge will be ensuring that people are prepared for the cultural and economic shifts” with focus on creating “the new jobs of the future” in order to avoid mass replacement by robots.
Haldane echoed Goldstaub’s sentiments and told the BBC that “we will need even greater numbers of new jobs to be created in the future if we are not to suffer this longer-term feature called technological unemployment”.
Every cloud has a silver lining
Although the automation of these tasks can lead to mass unemployment, Goldstaub is positive. She says “there are great opportunities ahead as well as significant challenges”. Challenge being bracing the UK workforce for the coming change.
Whereas, the silver lining, according to Goldstaub is that “there is a hopeful view — that a lot of these jobs (existing) are boring, mundane, unsafe, drudgery – there could be — liberation from — these jobs and a move towards a brighter world.”

To pursue his education, Mumbai-born Professor Subra Suresh travelled to the US with less than $100 in his pocket, toting a half-filled suitcase.
His story is one of the power of education, a value instilled in him by his mother from an early age, he notes.

Suresh rose to become the first Asian-born academic to lead the National Science Foundation, an American agency with an US$8bn research budget, and joined Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University in January as its new President. GovInsider caught up with him to learn more about his vision for the university.
Boosting AI research

In one of his first moves, the university has partnered with Chinese tech giant Alibaba to set up a joint AI research institute - the first of its kind outside of China. The research tie-up will explore applications of Artificial Intelligence to solve real-life problems - diagnosis and prevention of diseases, for instance, and urban design, according to a Straits Times report.

Alibaba is dedicating US$15 billion to its Discovery, Adventure, Momentum and Outlook Academy programme, and the contribution to this research institute will likely come from this fund, Channel NewsAsia reported.

NTU Singapore was chosen for the partnership because of its AI expertise, the Straits Times report said. The university ranks in the top three globally in terms of AI research, according to a 2017 ranking that measures research citations between 2012 and 2016. At the signing of the agreement, Suresh said that the partnership would give NTU Singapore students and faculty “an opportunity to connect their basic research in the lab with real life applications that have immediate societal impact”.

Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative, noted at last week’s Alibaba Cloud Summit that “What we are trying to do, is to transform Singapore now that we are on the cusp of a new revolution. He added: “the real value today is in the ability to derive insights, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analytics, and deep learning”.

This year, NTU Singapore also launched a new undergraduate degree course in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, in response to rapidly growing demand for these capabilities across industries in Singapore. “Not unexpectedly, it's been oversubscribed,” Suresh remarks.

At the same time, the university is taking steps to prepare students for a tech-driven future that will inevitably require new skills and capabilities, says Suresh. “Unlike previous generations, this cohort is going to change not only jobs many, many more times, they are likely to change professions - that means they have to relearn at a much faster rate.”

One piece of Singapore’s skills redevelopment focus is how universities and tertiary institutes can support reskilling. NTU Singapore has announced that it will provide $1,600 worth of additional SkillsFuture credit for alumni all over the world to earn certificates through the university’s online professional development courses.
 
“If you graduated ten years ago, you've been working in industry and you know nothing about AI, can you learn through online mechanisms?”
These could potentially help professionals earn a promotion or climb the corporate ladder, Suresh notes. “If you graduated ten years ago, you've been working in industry and you know nothing about AI, can you learn through online mechanisms?”

And starting this year, the university is adjusting curriculums across the board so that all undergraduates will take core courses in basic digital literacy skills. “It doesn't matter whether you are an engineering or music or literature major. You will have what our faculty and experts believe is the minimum requirement to be a successful citizen of the digital world,” Suresh explains.

His vision for NTU Singapore’s graduates includes inculcating in them an understanding of how to use technology responsibly and wisely. “We want to make sure our students get as much exposure to the human aspects of technology - things like ethics, communications, leadership,” he explains, adding that the second largest college in the university is Humanities and Social Sciences.

Disruption is transforming economies and employment, and universities such as NTU Singapore are exploring ways to ensure their graduates are prepared. As Suresh summarises: “The goal of learning should be to acquire the skills that enables you to adapt to change.”
He was once the lead of the US’ largest research funding agency; but in a sign of the changing times, Suresh’s has started in his new role by embracing the opportunities being offered by a rising China.",,,,,,,,,,

But now, researchers from NASA's Frontier Development Lab (FDL) and Intel are working to change that. They've found a way to make it just as easy to navigate a new planet — they just needed a little help from artificial intelligence (AI) to do it.They presented their planetary navigation research during an Intel-hosted event on August 16.NON-GLOBAL GPS. GPS stands for ""global positioning system,"" and it's just that: global. The satellites that let the system know your location so your app can give you directions to that new restaurant don't work when you're not on Earth.Since positioning a similar system of satellites around every moon or planet we'd like to explore would be really difficult and expensive, NASA and Intel set out to create a different kind of planetary navigation system.If we could feed an AI enough pictures of the surface of a celestial body, they determined, a person could simply take a photo of their surroundings and the system would be able to figure out where they were and give them directions to the place they wanted to be.FROM THE MOON TO MARS. To see if this kind of system could work, the researchers built a virtual moon.""[F]or our approach, using the real Moon isn’t actually critical,"" researcher Andy Chung told Futurism. ""It would likely improve performance in a real mission, but a key point of our work is that it teaches a network to learn general distortions caused by general landscape topologies.""To construct this moon, the team first created 2.4 million images of its surface that were taken by a rover (or, at least would have been if the planet had been real). They fed the images captured by these hypothetical cameras to their AI, which put them together to create the virtual moon.According to the team's presentation, this was enough to effectively enable navigation on the virtual moon's surface.Next, they want to try to do the same thing with a real (not virtual) celestial body: Mars. They think they have enough satellite images to make it happen. If they're right, the first people to walk on the Red Planet could find that all they have to do to navigate around the Martian surface is just take a picture.READ MORE: NASA Is Developing AI to Give Directions in Space [The Next Web]More on GPS: GPS Tracking Is Now Accurate Down to the CentimeterEditor’s note 8/24/18 at 12:45 PM ET: This article was updated to include comments from researcher Andy Chung.Share This Article",Artificial Intelligence,,,,https://wordpress-assets.futurism.com/2018/08/planetary-navigation.jpg,,,2018.0,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'https://futurism.com#organization', 'url': 'https://futurism.com', 'description': 'Science and Technology News and Videos', 'foundingDate': '2015-11-25', 'masthead': 'https://futurism.com/masthead', 'name': 'Futurism', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': '60', 'width': '191', 'url': 'https://futurism.com/schema/OrgFuturism.png'}}",

On his first  solo project since 2013, Icelandic composer Ólafur Arnalds adds a new element – robots! – to his mix of post-minimalist repetition, indie swoon, film score frisson and ambient drifts. Re: Member is a conversation between Arnalds and algorithms, the programmed and the human, his own intentions and new inspirations, composed with a software called Stratus connected to two player pianos.
Nothing here has the unfamiliar, inhuman shocks of a John Cage indeterminate work, a John Zorn game piece or Autechre’s recent robo-dialogue. Instead it’s Arnalds’ signature gorgeous melancholy – as heard on albums like 2013’s For Now I Am Winter and the soundtrack to Broadchurch – with a gentle pulse. “Brot” features luminous throbs of strings, the itchy “Ekki Hugsa” twinkles with typewriter piano and “Inconsist” is reminiscent of fellow minimalist Hauschka gone downtempo. Clicks and clacks of the robotic processes add an extra textural layer for music that’s part Conlon Nancarrow’s 20th Century player piano compositions, part Aphex Twin Satie-and-skitter. A gentle mix of the stiff, sad and soothing.

Faculty and senior researchers at MIT are teaming up in unprecedented ways to help define the next frontier in human and machine intelligence with projects that delve into everything from fundamental research to societal applications for new technologies.
The MIT-SenseTime Alliance on Artificial Intelligence, a program within the MIT Quest for Intelligence, has announced funding for 27 projects involving about 50 principal investigators from departments and labs within engineering, science, architecture and planning, management, and the humanities and social sciences.
SenseTime, a leading artificial intelligence company founded by MIT alumnus Xiao’ou Tang PhD ’96, jointly created the alliance with MIT earlier this year to define the next frontier of human and machine intelligence. The selected projects are of one year in duration that are intended to kick-start new efforts and initiate longer-term work.
“We were thrilled with the range and creativity of the proposals we received,” says Anantha P. Chandrakasan, dean of the MIT School of Engineering and Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, who chairs the MIT-SenseTime Alliance.
“It is particularly exciting to see faculty from so many disciplines join together to embark on projects that speak to the major objectives of the MIT Quest for Intelligence,” he says.
Chandrakasan points to the funded exploratory “moonshot” projects that align with the work of “The Core,” which seeks to advance the science and engineering of human and machine intelligence, explore human intelligence using insights from computer science, and develop new machine-learning algorithms.
One such project features MIT faculty from the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. These professors are working on a “language moonshot” that explores how insights from linguistic theory can be transformed into machine-learning algorithms to better approximate how people converse.
Several MIT neuroscientists from the McGovern Institute for Brain Research are joining with an MIT physics professor and others in a moonshot project that explores the biological mechanisms subtending learning and how to incorporate that knowledge into more robust machine-learning techniques. Meanwhile, MIT faculty from computer science and brain and cognitive sciences are collaborating in a project focused on how artificial systems, like robots, can learn common sense knowledge.
Also popular were projects described as “mission-driven” that aligned, as Chandrakasan notes, with the MIT Quest for Intelligence’s second key entity, “The Bridge,” which is dedicated to the application of MIT discoveries in natural and artificial intelligence to all disciplines.
Seven principal investigators from disciplines including CSAIL, the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences are collaborating on a mission-driven project that will explore drone intelligence for societal applications.
Another mission-driven project features a faculty member from the Sloan School of Management teaming up with an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science who proposes to use machine learning to amplify human intelligence and human employment in future manufacturing. Another involves two MIT mechanical engineering faculty focusing on developing tools in product design and systems architecture that capitalize on strategies that combine human intelligence with machine intelligence.
Eight collaborative projects that involve two or more principal investigators also received funding. For example, Media Lab professors will evaluate the use of a social robot as a personalized emotional wellness coach; electrical engineering and computer science professors will use embedded AI to track neurocognitive decline in the elderly; nuclear science and engineering, materials science and engineering, and electrical engineering professors will develop an all-solid device for low-power, fast, brain-like computing; Sloan professors will research dynamic portfolio management with deep learning; and mechanical engineering professors will investigate a specific approach to low-power image regression at the edge for the internet of things.
Additional funding was dedicated to 13 projects led by individual faculty from a range of departments, including media arts and sciences, chemistry, computer science, anthropology, physics, brain and cognitive sciences, and more. These projects are wide-ranging and include pursuits such as harnessing artificial intelligence to design vaccines for treating metastatic skin cancer, quantifying the robustness of neural networks, and using AI to increase equity in decision making for agriculture market design.“These projects are just the beginning of what promises to be one of the most important initiatives MIT has ever started,” says Antonio Torralba, the director of the MIT Quest for Intelligence. “SenseTime’s tremendous support for pivotal research will deepen the footprint of The Quest on campus.”
