Today that has changed. While natural language processing (NLP) and recognition is far from perfect, thanks to machine learning algorithms it’s getting increasingly closer to a point where it will be harder to tell whether we are talking to a human or a computer.
Business has capitalized on this, with increasing numbers of chatbots deployed, usually in customer service functions but increasingly in internal processes and to assist in training.
At ICLR 2018 in Vancouver, Salesforce’s chief scientist, Richard Socher, presented seven breakthrough pieces of research covering practical advances in NLP including summarization, machine translation and question answering.
PROMOTED
He told me “NLP is going to be incredibly important for business – it is going to fundamentally change how we provide services, how we understand sales processes and how we do marketing.

“Particularly on social media, you need NLP to understand the sentiment around your marketing messages and how people perceive your brand.”
Of course, this raises some issues, and one of the most glaring is, do people really want to talk to machines? From a business point of view it makes sense – it’s incalculably cheaper to carry on 1,000 simultaneous customer service conversations with a machine than with the giant human call center which would be needed to do the same job.
But from a customer point of view, are they gaining anything? Unless the service they receive is faster, more efficient and more useful, then they probably aren’t.
“I can’t speak for all chatbot deployments in the world – there are some that aren’t done very well,” says Socher.

“But in our case we’ve heard very positive feedback because when a bot correctly answers questions or fills your requirements it does it very, very fast.”
“In the end, users just want a quick answer, and originally people thought they wanted to talk to a person because the alternative was to go through a ten minute menu or to listen to ten options and then have to press a button – that’s not fun and its not fast and efficient.”
Key to achieving this efficient use of NLP technology are the concepts of aggregation and augmentation. Rather than thinking of a conversation exclusively taking place between one human and one machine, AI and chatbots can be used to monitor and draw insights from every conversation and learn from them how to perform better in the next one.
And augmentation means that the machine doesn’t have to conduct the entire conversation. Chatbots can “step in” for routine tasks such as answering straightforward questions from an organization’s knowledge base, or taking payment details.
In other situations, the speed of real-time analytics available today means that bots can raise an alert when they detect, for example, a customer becoming irate – thanks to sentiment analytics - prompting a human operator to take over the chat or call.
Summarization is another highly useful function of NLP, and one which is likely to be increasingly rolled out to chatbots. Internally, bots will be able to quickly digest, process and report business data when it is needed, and new recruits can quickly bring themselves up to speed. For customer-facing functions, customers can receive summarized answers to questions involving product and service lines, or technical support issues.
Chatbots are a form of the ‘intelligent assistant’ technology which powers Siri or Google Assistant on your phone, or Cortana on your desktop. Generally though they are focused on one specific task within an organization.
One study found that 40% of large businesses have implemented this technology in some form, or will have done so by the end of 2019.
Among those, 46% said that NLP is used for voice to text dictation, 14% for customer services and 10% for other data analytics work.
Chatbots are also increasingly ubiquitous in collaborative working environments such as Slack, where they can monitor conversations between teams and provide relevant facts or statistics at pertinent points in the conversation.
In the future, chatbots will probably be able to take things even further and propose strategy and tactics for overcoming business problems.
Socher tells me “They will probably be able to help us craft marketing messages, based on understanding of the language of all the things that have been successful in the past.”
Another example could be customer service bots which can allocate resources to dealing with customer cases based on the classification and sentiment analysis of the conversations they are having.
As with all AI, development of NLP is far from a finished process and level of conversation we are able to have today will undoubtedly seem archaically stilted and unnatural in just a couple of years’ time.
But today, organizations are clearly becoming more comfortable with the idea of integrating chatbots and intelligent assistants into their processes, and confident that it will lead to improvements in efficiency and customer satisfaction.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

In tomorrow’s workplace, many routine jobs now performed by workers will increasingly be assumed by machines, leaving more complicated tasks to humans who see the big picture and possess interpersonal skills, a Stanford scholar says.

Artificial intelligence and other advancing technologies promise advances in health, safety and productivity, but large-scale economic disruptions are inevitable, said James Timbie, an Annenberg Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution. He trained at Stanford as a physicist, served as a senior advisor at the State Department from 1983 to 2016 where he played a key role in arms control and disarmament, and now studies the impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.Timbie discussed what the future may hold for workers in a chapter in the new book, Beyond Disruption: Technology’s Challenge to Governance, which he co-edited with Hoover’s George P. Shultz and Jim Hoagland. He was recently interviewed on the subject. How will the emergence of artificial intelligence affect individual workers in the future?Artificial intelligence combined with other advancing technologies – such as robotics and 3D printing – will lead to more efficient production of goods and services. Machines can be trained to perform a wide range of non-routine cognitive tasks, and advanced robotics can increasingly perform manual tasks. Society as a whole will benefit from increased productivity and lower costs, but many individual workers will be adversely affected. Research indicates that on the order of half of today’s workers are in industries vulnerable to disruption in the near term.  In some cases – truck drivers – machines will replace workers. In other fields – education and medicine – work will be transformed, with machines assuming some tasks in close coordination with skilled humans performing other tasks. Will well-paying “cognitive” jobs be lost to automation?Many well-paying “cognitive” jobs are vulnerable to disruption, perhaps more over time than the well-paying factory jobs that were lost to globalization. A wide range of vulnerable occupations traditionally filled by well-educated, well-paid workers includes tax preparers, radiologists, paralegals, loan underwriters, insurance adjusters, financial analysts, translators, and even some journalists and software engineers. How can humans and machines work together for greater efficiency and productivity?One example is medical diagnosis. A diagnosis is a determination of how information on a patient fits into a pattern characteristic of a disease. This is something machines do well. Machines trained with the digital records and outcomes of millions of previous patients can produce a diagnosis for a sick patient, along with recommendations for treatment and perhaps further tests. Machines can take into account far more data and keep up with the latest research better than any doctor. The doctor’s primary role would be to convey the outcome to the patient, and help the patient understand and accept it, so the patient follows through with the treatment plan.Research indicates that in many fields, the best results will come from humans supported by intelligent machines – a combination of a doctor and a machine, a teacher and a machine, etc. In the workplace of the near future, machines would continue to do the computational work they do well, while leaving other tasks to humans who see the big picture and have interpersonal skills. How is the artificial intelligence revolution different from 20th–century labor and tech disruptions?One big difference is the rate of change. The transition from manual labor to steam power, and the subsequent transition from steam to electricity, played out over decades. The mechanization of agriculture took a generation, so it was sufficient to educate the children of farmers with the new skills necessary for new occupations. Today the changes are coming so fast that many workers themselves will need to learn new skills for new jobs.Another problem concerns inequality. Advancing technology increases national wealth and income, and the GDP grows. But these benefits are distributed unevenly. This growing inequality is a continuation of a long-term trend. According to Census Bureau data, median household income is about what it was in 1999, while GDP is up 38 percent. Most of the gains have gone to the upper end. The spread of automation contributes to this growing inequality in wealth and income.Consider tax preparation software. A lot of people benefit because it is cheap and easy and they can do their taxes themselves. But many people who earned their living as tax preparers now find their jobs and income threatened. How can society best protect workers and prepare them for this new future?The challenge is to facilitate transitions to new occupations with new skills.In addition, new jobs will be created even as traditional jobs disappear.  Over the 200 years since the Luddite rebellion, a movement led by workers in 19th-century England who opposed the introduction of weaving technology, gains in productivity through advancing technology have led over time to new industries and new jobs. That could continue, or this time could be different.In addition, there are more than 6 million job openings unfilled today, according to the Department of Labor. Employers cannot find qualified candidates for many well-paying jobs, which means there are potential opportunities for displaced workers with appropriate training.These new jobs will not necessarily be in nearby locations, nor are they likely to pay as well, at least initially. New jobs require new skills.Some advocate a guaranteed basic income. My view is that there is no shortage of work that needs to be done. Money is not the only thing; a sense of self-worth and standing in the community are also important. So, rather than pay people not to work, better to support transitions to new jobs.The existing adjustment assistance program did not do much to counter the impact of job losses attributed to globalization; it could be expanded to provide income and assistance for training and relocation for layoffs due to automation as well as foreign competition.Finally, the rapid pace of change reinforces the benefit of a habit of life-long education. Community colleges and internet courses provide low-cost education and training on a wide variety of subjects.

And no one is in a better place to figure out how than Kriti Sharma, Vice President of AI at SAGE, and one of Forbes' 30 Under 30.""When I was 15, I got some exposure to a government research facility where a scientist could use his voice to make a computer do something,"" Sharma tells Bustle. ""That was magical for me. How awesome would it be if I had my own personal machine that could understand my voice?"" Fourteen years later, interconnected smart homes powered by AI are becoming an increasingly mainstream use of technology. But for those who haven't adopted AI's ubiquity, the technology can still be a scary thing. And that is an unfounded bias Sharma hopes to address in her work. ""Either we get too scared and don't really embrace the benefits, or we start to become sensible and get past the hype.""To start this process, Sharma thinks we need to change the way we think about and design AI. For one, we need to understand that it isn't there to replace humans. It's there to make life easier — but often it's gone in different directions. ""Take Slack,"" she tells Bustle. ""It's supposed to raise productivity by reducing the amount of time we spend on email; but it turns out we are spending more time on Slack than we were on email. We’re realizing that we’ve got to think about humans in the design process, not about products."" Courtesy of Kriti Sharma & SAGEBut it's not just about how AI is used; it's about how it's created. Sharma is a prominent advocate for ethical AI and diversity in artificial intelligence in general, because what we put into AI shapes what we get out of it, and if it learns prejudice — even unintentionally — it's going to replicate that in the world. Most artificial intelligence at the moment, from basic chatbots and autocorrect to bigger projects like IBM's Watson, is based on a process called machine learning, where systems learn and develop based on all the new information they encounter. Think about how Google search fills in your searches, or Alexa gets to know your preferences. The problem? Machine learning without boundaries isn't necessarily a good thing.""Just like you would teach children values, AI needs to be given a set of values, too,"" Sharma tells Bustle. ""It’s important because AI learns on its own."" If not, you can see the same kind of regressive bias that humans are prone to in AI — which has happened across different platforms, from chatbots that learned racist behavior from its interactions, to photo-tagging systems that weren't trained to recognize non-caucasian skin tones.But, Sharma says, ""it’s not just the data; it’s also the design."" She cites the fact that most personalized AI assistants, like Siri or Alexa, are designed to sound female. Male-coded AIs, by contrast, tend to be business-focused, like IBM's Watson. ""Children are growing up in houses that are powered by smart assistants and learning that it’s OK to bark orders at a female voice without having to say 'sorry', 'thank you', or 'please'."" In a world where AI is becoming more and more powerful, these ingrained biases can be potentially damaging.Alex Wong/Getty Images News/Getty ImagesSo how do we fix it? Design it ethically from the beginning, says Sharma. ""One of the biggest reasons we have these problems,"" she tells Bustle, ""is that when you don’t have diversity it’s hard to build diverse products."" More women and minority at the table from the beginning, Sharma believes, will make better products — and more inclusive data sets for AIs to learn from. The future of AI, according to this vision, doesn't necessarily involve robots taking over human jobs. ""It’s not about replacing the human advisor; it’s about giving them help,"" she says. But she does believe that everybody should get the chance to get involved with AI, from the ground up. ""There are so many opportunities for people, from freelancers to small business owners, who can benefit from it,"" says Sharma. ""I want to give everybody the power to benefit from this technology and also design it in a very diverse way."" Whether you're a blogger or part of a big company, expect AI to be coming to help out soon.

In the 1980s he led efforts that allowed machines to reason probabilistically. Now he’s one of the field’s sharpest critics. In his latest book, The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect, he argues that artificial intelligence has been handicapped by an incomplete understanding of what intelligence really is.Three decades ago, a prime challenge in artificial-intelligence research was to program machines to associate a potential cause to a set of observable conditions. Pearl figured out how to do that using a scheme called Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks made it practical for machines to say that, given a patient who returned from Africa with a fever and body aches, the most likely explanation was malaria. In 2011 Pearl won the Turing Award, computer science’s highest honor, in large part for this work.But as Pearl sees it, the field of AI got mired in probabilistic associations. These days, headlines tout the latest breakthroughs in machine learning and neural networks. We read about computers that can master ancient games and drive cars. Pearl is underwhelmed. As he sees it, the state of the art in artificial intelligence today is merely a souped-up version of what machines could already do a generation ago: find hidden regularities in a large set of data. “All the impressive achievements of deep learning amount to just curve fitting,” he said recently.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

Virtually all human achievements have been made by groups of people, not lone individuals. As we incorporate smart technologies further into traditionally human processes, an even more powerful form of collaboration is emerging.

The ongoing, and sometimes loud, debate about how many and what kinds of jobs smart machines will leave for humans to do in the future is missing a salient point: Just as the automation of human work in the past allowed people and machines to do many things that couldn’t be done before, groups of people and computers working together will be able to do many things in the future that neither can do alone now.
To think about how this will happen, it’s useful to contemplate an obvious but not widely appreciated fact. Virtually all human achievements — from developing written language to making a turkey sandwich — require the work of groups of people, not just lone individuals. Even the breakthroughs of individual geniuses like Albert Einstein aren’t conjured out of thin air; they are erected on vast amounts of prior work by others.
The human groups that accomplish all these things can be described as superminds. I define a supermind as a group of individuals acting together in ways that seem intelligent.
Superminds take many forms. They include the hierarchies in most businesses and other organizations; the markets that help create and exchange many kinds of goods and services; the communities that use norms and reputations to guide behavior in many professional, social, and geographical groups; and the democracies that are common in governments and some other organizations.
All superminds have a kind of collective intelligence, an ability to do things that the individuals in the groups couldn’t have done alone. What’s new is that machines can increasingly participate in the intellectual, as well as the physical, activities of these groups. That means we will be able to combine people and machines to create superminds that are smarter than any groups or individuals our planet has ever known.
To do that, we need to understand how people and computers can work together more effectively on tasks that require intelligence. And for that, we need to define intelligence.

What Is Intelligence?
The concept of intelligence is notoriously slippery, and different people have defined it in different ways. For our purposes, let’s say that intelligence involves the ability to achieve goals. And since we don’t always know what goals an individual or group is trying to achieve, let’s say that whether an entity “seems” intelligent depends on what goals an observer attributes to it.
Based on these assumptions, we can define two kinds of intelligence. The first is specialized intelligence, which is the ability to achieve specific goals effectively in a given environment. This means that an intelligent entity will do whatever is most likely to help it achieve its goals, based on everything it knows. Stated even more simply, specialized intelligence is “effectiveness” at achieving specific goals. In this sense, then, specialized collective intelligence is “group effectiveness,” and a supermind is an effective group.
The second kind of intelligence is more broadly useful and often more interesting. It is general intelligence, which is the ability to achieve a wide range of different goals effectively in different environments. This means that an intelligent actor needs not only to be good at a specific kind of task but also to be good at learning how to do a wide range of tasks. In short, this definition of intelligence means roughly the same thing as “versatility” or “adaptability.” In this sense, then, general collective intelligence means “group versatility” or “group adaptability,” and a supermind is a versatile or adaptable group.
What Kind of Intelligence Do Computers Have?
The distinction between specialized intelligence and general intelligence helps clarify the difference between the abilities of today’s computers and human abilities. Some artificially intelligent computers are far smarter than people in terms of certain kinds of specialized intelligence. But one of the most important things most people don’t realize about AI today is that it is all very specialized.1
Google’s search engine is great at retrieving news articles about baseball games, for example, but it can’t write an article about your son’s Little League game. IBM’s Watson beats humans at Jeopardy!, but the program that played Jeopardy! can’t play tic-tac-toe, much less chess.2 Teslas can (sort of) drive themselves, but they can’t pick up a box from a warehouse shelf.
Of course, there are computer systems that can do these other things. But the point is that they are all different, specialized programs, not a single general AI that can figure out what to do in each specific situation. Humans, with their general intelligence, must write programs that contain rules for solving different specific problems, and humans must decide which programs to run in a given situation.
In fact, none of today’s computers are anywhere close to having the level of general intelligence of any normal human 5-year-old. No single computer today can converse sensibly about the vast number of topics an ordinary 5-year-old can, not to mention the fact that the child can also walk, pick up weirdly shaped objects, and recognize when people are happy, sad, or angry.
How soon, if ever, will this change? Progress in the field of artificial intelligence has been notoriously difficult to predict ever since its early days in the 1950s. When researchers Stuart Armstrong and Kaj Sotala analyzed 95 predictions made between 1950 and 2012 about when general AI would be achieved, they found a strong tendency for both experts and nonexperts to predict that it would be achieved between 15 and 25 years in the future — regardless of when the predictions were made.3 In other words, general AI has seemed about 20 years away for the last 60 years.
More recent surveys and interviews tend to be consistent with this long-term pattern: People still predict that general AI will be here in about 15 to 25 years.4 So while we certainly don’t know for sure, there is good reason to be skeptical of confident predictions that general AI will appear in the next couple of decades. My own view is that, barring some major societal disasters, it is very likely that general AI will appear someday, but probably not until quite a few decades in the future.
All uses of computers will need to involve humans in some way until then. In many cases today, people are doing parts of a task that machines can’t do. But even when a computer can do a complete task by itself, people are always involved in developing the software and usually modifying it over time. They also decide when to use different programs in different situations and what to do when things go wrong.
How Can People and Computers Work Together?
One of the most intriguing possibilities for how people and computers can work together comes from an analogy with how the human brain is structured. There are many different parts of the brain that specialize in different kinds of processing, and these parts somehow work together to produce the overall behavior we call intelligence. For instance, one part of the brain is heavily involved in producing language, another in understanding language, and still another in processing visual information. Marvin Minsky, one of the fathers of AI, called this architecture a “society of mind.”5
Minsky was primarily interested in how human brains worked and how artificial intelligence programs might be developed, but his analogy also suggests a surprisingly important idea for how superminds consisting of both people and computers might work: Long before we have general AI, we can create more and more collectively intelligent systems by building societies of mind that include both humans and machines, each doing part of the overall task.
In other words, instead of having computers try to solve a whole problem by themselves, we can create cyber-human systems where multiple people and machines work together on the same problem. In some cases, the people may not even know — or care — whether they are interacting with another human or a machine. People can supply the general intelligence and other skills that machines don’t have. The machines can supply the knowledge and other capabilities that people don’t have. And, together, these systems can act more intelligently than any person, group, or computer has done before.
How is this different from current thinking about AI? Many people today assume that computers will eventually do most things by themselves and that we should put “humans in the loop” in situations where people are still needed.6 But it’s probably more useful to realize that most things now are done by groups of people, and we should put computers into these groups in situations where that is helpful. In other words, we should move away from thinking about putting humans in the loop to putting computers in the group.
What Roles Will Computers Play Relative to Humans?
If you want to use computers as part of human groups in your business or other organization, what roles should computers play in those groups? Thinking about the roles that people and machines play today, there are four obvious possibilities. People have the most control when machines act only as tools; and machines have successively more control as their roles expand to assistants, peers, and, finally, managers.
Tools
A physical tool, like a hammer or a lawn mower, provides some capability that a human doesn’t have alone — but the human user is directly in control at all times, guiding its actions and monitoring its progress. Information tools are similar. When you use a spreadsheet, the program is doing what you tell it to do, which often increases your specialized intelligence for a task like financial analysis.
But many of the most important uses of automated tools in the future won’t be to increase individual users’ specialized intelligence, but to increase a group’s collective intelligence by helping people communicate more effectively with one another. Even today, computers are largely used as tools to enhance human communication. With email, mobile applications, the web in general, and sites such as Facebook, Google, Wikipedia, Netflix, YouTube, and Twitter, we’ve created the most massively connected groups the world has ever known. In all these cases, computers are not doing much “intelligent” processing; they are primarily transferring information created by humans to other humans.
While we often overestimate the potential of AI, I think we often underestimate the potential power of this kind of hyperconnectivity among the 7 billion or so amazingly powerful information processors called human brains that are already on our planet.









Assistants
A human assistant can work without direct attention and often takes initiative in trying to achieve the general goals someone else has specified. Automated assistants are similar, but the boundary between tools and assistants is not always a sharp one. Text-message platforms, for instance, are mostly tools, but they sometimes take the initiative and autocorrect your spelling (occasionally with hilarious results).
Another example of an automated assistant is the software used by the online clothing retailer Stitch Fix Inc., based in San Francisco, California, to help its human stylists recommend items to customers.7 Stitch Fix customers fill out detailed questionnaires about their style, size, and price preferences, which are digested by machine-learning algorithms that select promising items of clothing.
The algorithmic assistant in this partnership is able to take into account far more information than human stylists can. For instance, jeans are often notoriously hard to fit, but the algorithms are able to select for each customer a variety of jeans that other customers with similar measurements decided to keep.
And it is the stylists who make the final selection of five items to send to the customer in each shipment. The human stylists are able to take into account information the Stitch Fix assistant hasn’t yet learned to deal with — such as whether the customer wants an outfit for a baby shower or a business meeting. And, of course, they can relate to customers in a more personal way than the assistant does. Together, the combination of people and computers provides better service than either could alone.
Peers
Some of the most intriguing uses of computers involve roles in which they operate as human peers more than assistants or tools, even in cases where there isn’t much actual artificial intelligence being used. For example, if you are a stock trader, you may already be transacting with an automated program trading system without knowing it.
And if your job is dealing with claims for Lemonade Insurance Agency LLC, based in New York City, you already have an automated peer named AI Jim.8 AI Jim is a chatbot, and Lemonade’s customers file claims by exchanging text messages with it. If the claim meets certain parameters, AI Jim pays it automatically and almost instantly. If not, AI Jim refers the claim to one of its human peers, who completes the job.
Managers
Human managers delegate tasks, give directions, evaluate work, and coordinate others’ efforts. Machines can do all these things, too, and when they do, they are performing as automated managers. Even though some people find the idea of a machine as a manager threatening, we already live with mechanical managers every day: A traffic light directs drivers; an automated call router delivers work to call center employees. Most people don’t find either situation threatening or problematic.
It’s likely that there will be many more examples of machines playing the role of managers in the future. For instance, the CrowdForge system crowdsources complex tasks such as writing documents. In one experiment, the system used online workers (recruited via the Amazon Mechanical Turk online marketplace) to write encyclopedia articles.9 For each article, the system first asked an online worker to come up with an outline for the article. Then it asked other workers to find relevant facts for each section in the outline. Next it asked still other workers to write coherent paragraphs using those facts. Finally, it assembled the paragraphs into a complete article. Interestingly, independent readers judged the articles written in this manner to be better than articles written by a single person.

How Can Computers Help Superminds Be Smarter?
If you want to design a supermind (like a company or a team) that can act intelligently, it needs to have some or all of the five cognitive processes that intelligent entities have — whether they are individuals or groups. Your supermind will need to create possibilities for action, decide which actions to take, sense the external world, remember the past, and learn from experience. (See “The Basic Cognitive Processes Needed by Any Intelligent Entity.”)



The Basic Cognitive Processes Needed by Any Intelligent Entity
Entities that act intelligently (such as people, computers, and groups) need to do these things:




Computers can help do all these things in new ways that often — but, of course, not always — make the superminds smarter. To see how, let’s consider how a large corporation like Procter & Gamble could develop a new strategic plan. The possibilities we’ll discuss are just that: possibilities. I have no reason to believe that P&G is doing these things at present. But I think that P&G and many other companies are likely to do things like this in the future.
Today, corporate strategic planning in large companies usually involves a relatively small group of people, mostly senior executives, their staff, and perhaps some outside consultants. But what if we could use technology to involve far more people and let machines do some of the thinking?
Create
As we saw above, one of the most important roles for computers is as a communication tool that allows much larger groups of people to think together productively. A promising approach for doing that within the strategic planning process is to use a family of related online contests, called a contest web.10 There could be separate online contests for strategies at different levels of the organization. For example, if P&G used this approach, the company might have separate contests for each brand, such as Pantene shampoo, Head & Shoulders shampoo, and Tide laundry detergent. It could also have separate contests for how to combine the strategies of the brands in each business unit, such as hair care and fabric care. And the company could have another contest aimed at combining the business unit strategies into an overall corporate strategy.
Each contest could be open to many company employees, perhaps all of them. Anyone in the contest could propose a strategic option, and others could comment on or help develop the idea. Eventually there would be one winning strategy chosen in each challenge, but during the planning process, it would be important to consider a number of different options.
Opening this process to lots of people could allow surprising new options to arise. For instance, a group of young, tech-savvy employees, who would never have been included in a traditional corporate strategic-planning process, might propose a new cosmetics concept involving skin and eye makeup specially formulated for individual customers who upload selfies to the website.
Decide
One benefit of involving more people in generating strategic possibilities is that you get far more possibilities. But deciding which possibilities are most promising requires evaluating them all, and new technologies also make it easier to involve far more people and more kinds of expertise in evaluating. For instance, P&G might want its manufacturing engineers to evaluate whether it is technically feasible to make a product, its operations managers to estimate manufacturing cost, and perhaps outside market researchers to predict the demand for the product at different price points.
In some cases, it may be worth combining many people’s opinions about some of these questions. For instance, P&G might use online prediction markets to estimate the demand for products. Such markets have already been used to successfully predict movie box-office receipts, winners of U.S. presidential elections, and many other things. Somewhat like futures markets, prediction markets let people buy and sell “shares” of predictions about future events. For instance, if you believe that global sales for Pantene shampoo will be between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion per year, you could buy a share of this prediction. If the prediction is right, then you will get, say, $1 for each share you own of that prediction. But if your predictions are wrong, you will get nothing.11 That means the resulting price in the prediction market is essentially an estimate of the probability that sales will be in this range.12
Sense
A key necessity for developing good strategic plans is the ability to effectively sense what is going on in the external world: What do customers want now? What are our competitors doing? What new technologies might change our industry? By far the most visible means for improving sensing today are big data and data analytics.
For example, P&G might analyze the positive and negative comments about its products in online social networks to gauge how customer sentiment about the products is changing. It might conduct online experiments at different prices for the products. And it might be able to obtain early warnings about sales changes by installing video and touch-sensitive floors in retail stores to analyze how much time customers spend looking at P&G’s products versus competitors’ products.
P&G might even be able to do something Amazon.com Inc. has already done: use vast amounts of data to develop detailed models of many parts of its business, such as customers’ responses to prices, ads, and recommendations, and sort out how supply-chain costs vary with inventory policies, delivery methods, and warehouse locations.13 With tools like these, computers can take over much of the quantitative work of strategic planning by running the numbers, and people can use their general intelligence to do more qualitative analysis.
Remember
Another way technology can help superminds create better strategic plans is by helping them remember good ideas that others have had in similar situations. For example, software assistants embedded in an application for generating strategy proposals could automatically suggest generic strategies, such as the following:

Integrating forward by taking on some of the tasks done by your customers, or integrating backward by taking on some of the tasks done by your suppliers;
Outsourcing more of the things you do internally to freelancers or specialized providers;
Moving into related market segments, nearby geographical regions, or other markets frequented by your customers.
When you pick one of these options, the system could then automatically provide a template including the kinds of details necessary for that type of strategy.

By remembering good strategies from other settings, software assistants could help generate new strategies for your setting. For instance, if the strategy of using selfies to customize cosmetics were successful, a software assistant could suggest similar strategies that let customers use smartphones to customize P&G’s other products: shampoos, toothpastes, laundry detergents, potato chips, and others. Of course, many of these combinations would be silly or impractical and could be very quickly eliminated, but some might be surprisingly useful. And even silly options sometimes give rise to good ideas.
For instance, in the early 2000s, P&G developed a process for printing entertaining pictures and words on Pringles potato chips.14 An approach like this might have led to another promising idea: using this technology to let customers buy Pringles that are preprinted with images that customers specify themselves.
Learn
If a system is used over time, it can help a supermind learn from its own experience to become more and more effective. For example, it might help recognize strategic ideas that most people wouldn’t recognize in their early stages. In the 1970s, when Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were first playing around with what we now call personal computers, most people had no idea that these strange, awkward devices would turn out to be among the most innovative and influential products of the next several decades.
It’s certainly not easy to rapidly filter ideas without missing these diamonds in the rough. But perhaps it’s possible to identify the unusual people who do have this skill by systematically tracking over time how accurately, and how early, people predict technological advances and other kinds of breakthroughs. Then we could ask these people to take a second look at some of the “crazy” ideas that we might otherwise reject.
Another intriguing possibility is to use “learning loops” that begin with human experts evaluating strategies manually and then gradually automate more and more of the work as the machines get better at predicting what human experts would do.
In a company like P&G that generally tries to compete on quality rather than price, experts evaluating product strategies usually reject those that emphasize competing on low price. But instead of programmers writing programs that explicitly filter out low-price strategies, a machine-learning program might recognize that experts often reject these types of strategies and start suggesting this action. If the experts agree with the suggestion enough times, then the program might stop asking and just do the filtering automatically.
A Cyber-Human Strategy Machine
You might call the kind of strategic planning process I’ve described above a cyber-human strategy machine.15 Given how complex such a system could be and how generic much of the work would be, it seems unlikely that companies would develop proprietary systems for this purpose. Instead, today’s consulting firms, or their future competitors, might provide much of this functionality as a service. Such a strategy-machine company, for instance, could have a stable of people at many levels of expertise on call who could rapidly generate and evaluate various strategic possibilities, along with software to automate some parts of the process and help manage the rest.
In the long run, such a strategy machine might use a supermind of people and computers to generate and evaluate millions of possible strategies for a single company. Computers would do more and more of the work over time, but people would still be involved in parts of the process. The result would be a handful of the most promising strategic options that the human managers of the company would choose among.
The examples we’ve just discussed are focused on strategic decision-making, but what we’ve really seen is an architecture for general purpose, problem-solving superminds: Computers use their specialized intelligence to solve parts of the problem, people use their general intelligence to do the rest, and computers help engage and coordinate far larger groups of people than has ever been possible.
As new technologies make this easier, we are likely to see many more examples of human-computer superminds being used to solve all kinds of business and societal problems — not just corporate strategic plans, but also designs for new houses, smartphones, factories, cities, educational systems, antiterrorism approaches, and medical treatment plans. The possibilities are virtually unlimited.

One oft-cited Oxford University study predicted 47% of jobs are in jeopardy.

But while AI conjures up robots and dystopian science fiction movies, it isn’t magic. Today’s AI consists of algorithms developed with “training data” that improve over time, otherwise known as machine learning. The result is better pattern recognition, as when Google seems to predict what you’re searching for after typing a few letters. What it ultimately means is automation of the information economy in the same way that the industrial revolution changed manufacturing. Any job that involves processing or manipulating information in a repeatable or even predictable way is a job that probably will be automated by AI and its kissing cousin robotic process automation (“RPA”).
Colleges and universities have lots of jobs like this. Not in the classroom, mind you; teaching and learning have a relatively low level of repeatability. But keep in mind that only $0.21 out of every tuition dollar is actually spent on instruction. That leaves a lot of repeatable processes that AI will automate. Nevertheless, what we’re seeing so far suggests predictions of massive job losses in higher education are overblown.
PROMOTED
An article last month in the Chronicle of Higher Education focused on how UT Austin is utilizing AI to monitor and adjust landscape sprinkler systems. The entirely uncontroversial result is not job cuts, but rather a huge improvement in water conservation and concomitant cost savings. Then there’s admissions. Reviewing college applications is a highly repeatable process, particularly at the top of the admissions funnel. University of Arizona’s Dean of Undergraduate Admissions has commented that AI won’t be used to “count anybody out automatically,” but will rather “help to enhance” the admissions staff make good matches. No mention of any plans to reduce admissions staff.

When it comes to interacting with students, we’re seeing a similar pattern: AI isn’t displacing workers, but rather enhancing student experience by filling current gaps in the service offering. In the enrollment and financial aid processes, the Chronicle profiled Georgia State’s use of AI chatbot AdmitHub (a University Ventures portfolio company) to respond to enrollment and financial aid questions. Tim Renick, GSU’s dynamic VP for Enrollment Management and Student Success, says that in the run-up to the start of each semester, his team can receive as many as 2,000 calls a day. That’s volume GSU cannot handle: “We’re not American Express. We don’t have a call center with 200 people.” AdmitHub’s chatbot allows students to ask any question at all hours. The technology takes a statistical approach to responding to questions. If it’s less than 95% certain of the answer, it connects the student to a human staff member. As you might expect, AdmitHub gets smarter with each question. In its first summer at GSU, AdmitHub answered 200,000 questions and successfully reduced summer melt by 20%.
In addition, AdmitHub founder Drew Magliozzi points out that by addressing simple questions, AI technology integrated into college systems can trigger a staff member to reach out for a human-to-human conversation: “The death of a parent, financial struggles, depression, and many other challenges require time and care. These conversations are the reason most got into the field in the first place. And thanks to the AI, they can talk to a student for an hour without worrying their inbox will be overflowing when they’re done.”

Another area of great promise is the online discussion board. Anyone who’s been in an online discussion for a large lecture course will tell you they’re unproductive and tedious at the best of times. Neither faculty nor teaching assistants are incentivized or able to provide the requisite level of structure, guidance, and feedback to keep every thread moving towards a productive educational outcome. That’s where Packback Questions comes in. Packback (a University Ventures portfolio company) is an AI-powered tool that picks up where the humanoids leave off. Its algorithms coach students to improve responses and to ask more thought-provoking questions, sparking better discussion and critical thinking. Packback also provides recommendations to faculty on how to further improve student engagement.

It seems likely that students will find themselves engaging with more bots. Georgia State has now enrolled students who are wondering “Where did the chatbot go? I still want to ask it questions.” Across town at Georgia Tech, one faculty member has already utilized a bot (“Jill Watson”) as a teaching assistant without telling students. Said the faculty member, “I don’t intend to put myself out of business. I think of this as improving teaching quality… [not] decreasing teaching quantity.”
While higher education may not see major job losses, there’s little question that entire job categories in other sectors of the economy (e.g., data entry, tax preparation) will go the way of bowling alley pin setters. However, for most of us in the labor market, AI won’t result in job loss, but rather significant changes in what we do every day. McKinsey has estimated that AI will automate 30% of tasks in about 60% of jobs. This means most of us will need to use AI technology in the same way as we currently use non-AI software and SaaS platforms to do our jobs. As configuring and managing AI software – and interpreting data output – will be more complex than using Word or Salesforce, this means upskilling will be required for most jobs, primarily a higher level of cognitive and technical skills.
And so while AI should allow colleges and universities to become more efficient and effective in supplying higher education, it will also shift the demand curve for postsecondary education to the right. With greater demand for cognitive and technical skills, colleges and universities will have a golden opportunity to reassert their preeminence in human capital development.
But just as the impact on the broader economy will be uneven, AI will result in some dislocation in higher education. Specifically, it will be a harder road for disciplines that cannot seriously and credibly claim to further skills in managing software. That’s what employers will expect. And as the drumbeat of AI gets louder and louder over the next decade, these requirements will become gospel to guidance counselors, parents, and applicants alike. Carnegie Mellon’s new bachelor’s degree in AI (the first of its kind) is an obvious early winner. But any program or pathway that builds skills at or close to the human-machine interface central to the coming AI revolution will thrive. Adding software + data to work yields a multidisciplinarity that will resonate across every profession and every area of study. Those who opt to remain on the periphery – regardless of how much they claim to foster core cognitive or creative skills – are likely to wither.
A Northeastern-Gallup survey released in January showed that only 22% of current workers with bachelor’s degrees or higher think their own education has prepared them to work with AI. Meanwhile, only 43% are confident they can obtain the education they’ll need. Some of that is undoubtedly concern about affordability, but it probably also reflects worries about availability. The response from America’s colleges and universities can’t be “more of the same.”
The reason there’s often a fine line between hero and villain is that some heroes are disruptive. And for the sector charged with cultivating natural intelligence, artificial intelligence will be a hero, albeit a very disruptive one.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Ryan CraigFollowingFollowAuthor of Apprentice Nation: How the ""Earn and Learn"" Alternative to Higher Education Will Create a Stronger and Fairer America.

An Information Communication Technology (ICT) expert, Mr Adede Williams, says the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will ease the difficulty involved in doing businesses in the country.
Williams, who is President of Association of Telecommunications Professionals of Nigeria (APTN), stated this in an interview with on Thursday in Abuja.      
He spoke at the backdrop of the 2018 World Telecommunication and Information Society Day, with “Enabling the Positive Use of Artificial Intelligence for All’’ as theme.
Artificial Intelligence is an aspect of Computer Science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react, like humans.
Williams said that the theme for the year was apt and carefully selected by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), adding that the positive use of AI was a powerful message to the public.
He said that AI could be used in all sectors of the economy as it made the job easier and effective.      
“When you look at what is happening these days, artificial intelligence is what is actually taking care of a lot of things.
“For instance, you can use AI in the marine, oil sector and a lot of other things as there are some places that human intelligence cannot reach, but artificial intelligence would do that.
“So everything is boiling down to AI and that is why the United Nation (UN) says it is important for us to develop more on artificial intelligence as it makes the job easier, ‘’ he said.  
Williams debunked the claim that a lot of people would lose their jobs with the introduction of AI, saying instead, it would make jobs easier and effective.
