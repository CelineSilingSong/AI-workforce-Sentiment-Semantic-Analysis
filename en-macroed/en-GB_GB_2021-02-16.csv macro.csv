Putting artificial intelligence to work 

 18 Feb 21
        Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly being given key roles in site teams. Lisa Russell looks at how Winvic is bringing in AI to boost site safety    


Construction sites, by their very nature, are packed with an ever-changing array of potential hazards. Even with rigorous safety protocols in place, it can be all too easy to wind up too close to operational plant or neglect to wear the required personal protective equipment (PPE).
Contractor Winvic believes that artificial intelligence (AI) holds the key to making construction sites safer by giving people reliable warnings before they put themselves in danger. 
The company has teamed up with the Big Data Enterprise & Artificial Intelligence Lab (Big-DEAL) at the University of the West of England (UWE) and video technology specialist One Big Circle (OBC) to develop a system that will understand where the current hazards are and send personal alerts via smartphones when someone is about to go somewhere risky. 
This article was first published in the Dec/Jan 2021 issue of The Construction Index magazine.  Sign up online.
UWE and OBC are sharing a £600,000 Innovate UK ‘Smart Grant’ with Winvic on the project, which will run for two years and will see the three organisations bring together real-time images and machine learning technologies on two Winvic sites running consecutively. 
Winvic technical director Tim Reeve describes the concept as being a 24/7 on-site ‘eye in the sky’ health & safety alert system. “We were discussing improving site safety and how we could go about that using technology,” he says. “We came up with this idea of preventing people getting anywhere near a potential accident before it happens.” 
The company began site work at the end of October on the first of the two projects where the system will be developed and put through its paces. Transport and logistics company DSV has engaged Winvic to design, construct and partially fit out its new industrial facility at Mercia Park in north-west Leicestershire. 
“The site is one that lends itself perfectly to what we are trying to do,” says Reeve, who is Winvic’s lead on the AI project, dubbed ‘Computer-Vision-Smart’. He says that Mercia Park is a relatively straightforward project, although it comprises multiple buildings and exterior works. 
Largest of the buildings is a 358,000 sq ft steel-framed warehouse containing three mezzanine floors and two single-storey hub offices. There will also be a 112,000 sq ft cross-dock terminal that contains a 7,050 sq ft single-storey hub office and a 35,660 sq ft three-storey office building. The project’s yard and car park will provide open spaces for the cameras to look across in the early stages while all work is taking place outside. 
The cameras placed around the site can now start capturing data so that team members on the AI side can begin their analysis and get the predictive machine learning under way, says Reeve. The external and – later into the programme – internal site cameras will capture video images continuously. The AI will learn to identify any hazards, ranging from overhead works or the movement of heavy machinery to more general issues like people lacking the correct PPE. The team believes that the machine learning models will be able to make an increasing number of intelligent predictions as the project progresses.
The AI will create virtual zones around potential hazards and send out alerts to anyone about to enter the area
Reeve thinks the concept of the Computer-Vision-Smart project is “fantastic” but acknowledges that a very challenging task lies ahead. “We are quite confident that we’ll get something meaningful out of the two years – an end product that we can take forward,” he says.
The Mercia Park project is being viewed primarily as an exercise in data capture and a trial of how to set up the site alerts. The camera systems will feed into large-screen TVs that will be installed in site cabins. The display will also be populated with scrolling outputs of the alerts that the AI is starting to report, enabling the site team to check on what is being detected. “At the same time, we are developing an app to work alongside it,” Reeve says. “We don’t think we’ll get the app into people’s hands and into their pockets probably until our second project kicks off, which we think will be about August next year.”
The AI may be ready for a tougher role once work at Mercia Park is completed next summer. “We might choose a slightly more complex site for the second one,” says Reeve. This will depend on progress, including how well the AI has tweaked itself over the initial period and how effective it is at recognising problems from the images it is given.
Each of the three organisations has a part to play in the system’s development, with obvious input from Winvic in provision of the demonstration projects plus knowledge of health & safety on site. “There are also historical data sets so we know the kind of trends that happen,” says Reeve. OBC has computer analysts and technical staff, while UWE brings in the academic and research side. Together they believe they can align development to the needs of the construction industry.
Reeve says the use of intelligent digital technologies in construction to deliver projects more rapidly, cost-effectively and safely has long been an aspiration of Winvic’s. “With the solution that has been conceived will come better opportunities than ever before to reach our zero-harm aim.”
The system knows the difference between the equipment carrying out the installation and previously installed components that won't be moving
There are perceived gaps in existing approaches across the construction industry. Safety managers and operatives often depend on self-reporting or warnings from co-workers, which can simply come too late to avoid an incident. Existing camera-based systems generally focus on aspects such as site security, dispute avoidance and project progress, rather than safety. Alert systems tend to be based on proximity to a particular piece of plant, with the aim of letting the operator know who or what is near their machine – essentially extending their line of sight. 
“We are coming at it from a slightly different angle,” says Reeve. “We want to give the people on the ground the line of sight. The immediate concern is to make that individual stop and think. If we can prevent people from going into high-risk or medium-risk areas then we can prevent accidents.”
The dangers of walking very close to actual operations might appear to be obvious, but in reality there is also a wider area of influence. For instance, a piece of plant might suddenly start moving in a different direction. “People think they are a long way from it but they may still be in proximity to a potential accident,” says Reeve.
Thanks to a geographic information system (GIS), the AI will be aware of the exact locations of personnel and plant and will learn to identify safe zones, essentially drawing a virtual radius around potential hazards.
When someone enters the hazard zone, the individual – and, when appropriate, other members of the site team – will receive a personal alert via a smartphone app or a wearable device. The warning will become constant if they enter the zone of full alert. There is also scope for escalation if there is a site-wide alert of immediate concern. 
Project managers are really the end users of the system being developed and their input has been invaluable. “The original concept ideas are being fine-tuned by the feedback we get from site,” says Reeve. “We’ve had a very good reaction and our staff have engaged with it as well. It’s caught the imagination of everybody involved, which is fantastic.”
Managers will also be able to review the alerts and relevant video segments from a laptop. This should help them spot any issues that are catching multiple people out – or any people who consistently flout site rules, such as regularly taking shortcuts to save a few seconds when heading for their lunch.

There will be weekly or fortnightly project meetings, where the appropriate people from all three organisations will plan the next tranche of development. “What we are going to do initially is give the AI some help,” says Reeve. It will be told, for instance, what a crane looks like and shown the extent of the surrounding zones that could be dangerous to enter. After that, the technology will be programmed to pick up movements of the kit on the site, as well as deliveries and site vehicles. “It will start to predict its own sets of health & safety rings around them,” he says. 
He likens it to watching a child learn to walk – giving it a little guidance to show how it’s done and gently nudging it towards learning and doing things itself.
“The idea is that the AI will build up a library of images and predictions,” says Reeve. It will learn about the project, identifying changing areas of interest as the build progresses. “What we are going to try and do is link the build into the AI, so that it starts to understand the sequence and the direction of work so that it can predict high-risk areas.” 
The AI will also be on the look-out for movement – for example learning the difference between a piece of cladding being installed and a fixed steel column that is not about to go anywhere. 
The team is exploring whether other ‘wearables’ might be needed in addition to phones. Smart watches, wristbands and even ‘old-fashioned pagers’ have been looked at. “We are trying to make it very easy for people to connect with,” says Reeve. 
Job functions will have to be taken into account. Details that will be addressed include ensuring that people at the ‘epicentre’ of a risk – excavator operators for instance – aren’t bombarded with constant alerts. The system will need to learn the difference between them and somebody straying into the hazard area. 
There will still be a role for interventions that are social, rather than technical, in nature. For example, personal input will be needed if the project manager starts to see a particular person getting a high number of alerts every day. Privacy issues mean that project won’t be using facial recognition but it will still be able to identify each user of the system. 
Activity on site changes every day and so the AI will need to be aware of where the current dangers lie
The social side will also involve establishing a mind-set whereby wearing PPE becomes second-nature. Historically, this would come from members of the site team speaking to anyone without the right kit – but the culprit might then remove their hard hat when they are out of sight. In contrast, the camera will always be on the look-out and so can assist with monitoring and enforcement. “We definitely want to target the correct wearing of PPE, such as hard hats and high-vis vests too,” says Reeve. 
The Computer-Vision-Smart project was originally submitted to Innovate UK last year, prior to the outbreak of Covid-19; the conceptual objectives for the scheme would therefore need to change slightly should the team look to consider the incorporation of social distancing. “We may look to see if this could be an ‘add-on’ to the features already planned for the system,” says Reeve. “We already have clear and responsible guidelines on social distancing as part of our site operating procedures. There is of course already the NHS Track & Trace app.”
The AI’s role ties in with another safety-focused initiative that Winvic has launched this year. The ‘Doing It Right’ programme is aimed at further improvements in safe behaviour, targeting ‘walk-bys’ – incidents where people turn a blind eye to something potentially hazardous. “We’ve got a ‘don’t walk by’ slogan,” says Reeve. “If you see something, don’t just walk by – stop, say something, raise the alert. We’re hoping that using the AI will assist us in monitoring those activities that sometimes don’t get seen.”
UWE Bristol and Winvic are also partners on another AI-enabled project, called Conversational BIM. This involves the development of a voice-activated headset connected to a BIM model. It is being designed to allow users to retrieve any and all project design and construction information with a simple vocal request.  
Reeve believes that the new Computer-Vision-Smart project’s achievements over the next two years will generate a significant leap forward not just for Winvic, but potentially for safety across the whole of the construction industry. “Ultimately, one of the objectives is to have an end product that we could sell to the marketplace,” he says. 
As well as customising the system for Winvic’s purposes, the team will also be looking at what else needs to be done to make it suitable for others. This will involve bringing in other contractors to get their feedback. “We’ve had a lot of interest from the rail side as well,” he adds.

Technology
AI and the Future of Work in the United States


By Pragya Jain | February 18, 2021











Artificial intelligence will change the future of work in the United States, but the consequences will differ across regions and industries. As with past advances in automation, AI will lead to increased levels of productivity, specialization in job roles, and an increased importance of “human skills'' like creativity, problem solving, and quantitative skills. Although AI will increase economic growth, these gains will not be evenly distributed. Rural communities that already face high levels of job insecurity will come under additional strain. AI will benefit labor in some industries but threaten it in others. Automation will complement job roles in high-growth fields like healthcare, where there is no substitute for highly-skilled practitioners, but replace jobs in industries relying on standard routines. To address these gaps, policymakers should focus on restructuring school curricula to reflect the changing skill demands, addressing the educational attainment gap between rural and urban adults, and providing economic relief to workers forced to leave the workplace and learn new skills.
Introduction
The evolution of technology and changes in the workplace have always happened in tandem. Beginning in the 1760s, a series of industrial revolutions ushered in mechanical innovations like railroads and then mass production factories using man made tools to push past the limits of human manual labor. Then in the twentieth century, computers began to replace human cognitive work. Optimists viewed this as a sign of inevitable progress toward a more productive society, with lower prices for goods and increased opportunity for specialized labor; but there has been a pervasive concern that machines will replace human labor and lower the number of new jobs.
With the rise of personal computers, automated call centers, and industrial machinery during the early twenty-first century came a massive net increase in employment with 54 million new jobs. However, a not-so-subtle exacerbation of inequality in America accompanied this explosion in efficient production. A widening wealth gap, bottoming out of the middle-class, extreme job-loss in rural communities, and stratification of education and job opportunity have become commonplace. The advent of digital technologies was particularly difficult for manufacturing and clerical workers. A seamless transition into a new job market did not occur for the newly unemployed; rather, those who lost their jobs during the rise of automation were crammed into service industry jobs that paid less than their previous occupations had. The disparity that has risen during this period is unlikely to reverse itself. Indeed, it will continue to worsen as technology outpaces the capabilities of the humans who built it.
More recent innovations in computer science have rekindled fears of more human displacement and job loss. Machine Learning and narrow Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become ubiquitous, and unlike previous waves of technological change, these innovations are affecting most, if not all, industries. Now the past must serve as a guide as to how to prepare for future job insecurities, especially by investing in education, skill retraining, and renewal of rural communities,where the opportunity gap threatens to worsen job displacement in the face of AI-based innovation.
The Basics of Narrow AI and Machine Learning 
       Artificial Intelligence is often conflated with dystopian science fiction, as in killer robots from The Terminator or hallucinatory computer programs from The Matrix. But the technology-centered human experience of today is far more nuanced than sensationalized fictitious depictions. Various forms of artificial intelligence are commonplace; today, machine learning powers everything from voice-activated “virtual assistants” on most smartphones, to recognition systems built to improve accuracy in medical diagnoses. It also increases the scope of industrial automation, which has raised concerns about the effects on labor.
The fundamental concept that powers machine learning is the notion that a computer can learn from new information. Designed in a loosely similar fashion to the human brain, some forms of artificial intelligence rely on constructing an artificial neural network to build connections that replicate the complex level of understanding characteristic of humans. Once an algorithm is built for a machine, it will undergo three different forms of learning, supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and reinforced learning, which develop and strengthen its neural network. Once the computer understands its intended function, it works independently to self-correct through a series of trials and errors - a process that ultimately can lead to complex decision making.
The logic behind deep learning and neural networks is simple but the result is complex. One form of machine learning, often referred to as hierarchical learning, is accomplished using a large set of layered images or data points that are pieced together from the bottom up by the machine until it deeply understands a concept. For example, if given an input in the form of a matrix of pixels, the computer will begin by classifying individual pixels, then forming clusters of pixels, before finally identifying the full visual. This straightforward process is repeated tens-of-thousands of times with an equal number of new data sets. It results in a web of nodes that strengthen the predictive decision-making process of the computer.
This world is increasingly driven by the currency of data, and AI will undoubtedly have a deep, divisive impact on the jobs of tomorrow; many service-focused jobs in the food industry will face high susceptibility to automation, for example, as opposed to industries that will come to use it as a supplementary tool, like the medical field.
The Promise of Machine Learning and Narrow AI in Healthcare         
Unlike the physical human brain, an AI program can quickly discover problems in narrow, data-based situations, a time-saving benefit that already aids decision making on treatment options in healthcare, for example. Health care professionals use algorithms to improve diagnoses through a form of machine learning called precision medicine; this simple algorithm relies on previous patient information (and supervised learning) to assess what treatment options might be most successful.
Another useful application of narrow AI uses more complex deep learning algorithms to identify potentially cancerous lesions in radiology pictures, a process that aids in early diagnosis and can prevent the spread of malignant tumors. This tool allows professionals to allocate their own time more efficiently towards specialized tasks, such as devising creative treatment solutions and researching other medical problems, potentially leading to job creation.
Tech giants like Google are collaborating with health firms to build programming that compiles user data to identify patients at risk for conditions that are typically genetically predisposed but difficult to predict--like cancer. However, simple AI tools also extend beyond more precise diagnosis in the medical field: doctors use natural language processing algorithms for transcribing patient-doctor interactions, surgeons use robots to improve the precision of surgeries, and hospitals employ algorithm-driven processes to replace rote tasks within hospitals. The proper use of these tools in healthcare will change the way medicine is administered: it can improve patient care, reduce fatalities with early diagnoses, and create more jobs through specialization.
The Jobs of the Future
 Most jobs sectors that are predicted to be high-growth over the next decade will require high levels of education. One source claims that high-paying jobs requiring a bachelor's degree or above will face only 29% of job change due to automation. Like the field of healthcare, other “high-value” and professional, scientific, and technical service-oriented industries are predicted to experience low levels of automation (34%) accompanied by relative job growth (3.8%). Additionally, given the benefits AI poses to complex, high-skilled vocations, it is likely that AI-related jobs could see an increased share in the economy, a trend that would create more stable, well-paying positions for Americans. The assignment of rote tasks to machines and complex tasks to humans will increase productivity and enhance economic growth. One economist predicts that AI-related changes will result in an increased GDP of $3.7 trillion for North America before 2030. Unfortunately, these economic benefits will not be evenly distributed, and rural communities will absorb the greatest costs.
New technologies have sometimes had transformative impacts on the labor market; in this case, AI will have a striking effect on many service and white-collar jobs that have been relatively safe from automation to this point. Compared to the medical field, most routine, service-oriented roles will be phased out by the increased presence of AI. Jobs that are at the highest risk of automation include office support jobs and food service jobs. These jobs are ubiquitous but rural workers rely on them more since they make up a larger share of the rural economy. For example, the switch to automated stores has already started with AmazonGo, the prototype for an entirely contactless grocery shopping experience.
Service industries that will face the most severe levels of automation include the food service industry and office support roles. These jobs are generally held by individuals who haven’t earned college degrees with more than 90% of food service employees and more than 60% of office support workers having at most a high school diploma.
 There is a severe digital gap between rural and urban areas: 24% of rural adults experience issues with high-speed internet, whereas only 13% of urban adults say it is an issue. Substantial portions of rural areas still lack the infrastructure required to implement high speed internet, which makes it exceedingly difficult to bring high-growth jobs to these areas. There is little migration between cities, which suggests labor market fluidity. To make matters worse, businesses are investing less in their workers: the percentage of employer-sponsored job-training fell by 7 percent between 2003 and 2013 even though the need for high-skilled workers is rising.
Policy Implications
Although the situation may seem dire for low-skilled rural workers, new technologies might also provide some relief. Data compiled by the Economic Modeling Specialists International can be used by local communities to help pinpoint careers for displaced workers to transition into given their acquired skills from previous occupations. This along with strong federal education and economic policies could reduce the shock of a changing job market.
       At the top of the agenda is improving the American educational system, especially measures to rectify underperformance in STEM-related subjects. The most recent PISA test scores show that the United States ranks 36th out of 79 countries for math proficiency and 13th for reading proficiency. Given that future careers will be driven by a demand for digital skills in high-growth industries like data science and computer science, school curricula should reflect evolving employer expectations, by introducing computer coding and statistics, for example.
Also, high-paying and high-skilled jobs are concentrated in large coastal cities, but there is little migration between rural towns and urban metropolises. College completion rate gaps continue to widen between urban and rural areas with a 14% difference in the proportion of adults with bachelor’s degrees. Worker incentives to complete training and move to areas ripe with opportunities are important national priorities. The great challenge to bridge would be the existing inequality in educational attainment, and therefore, job opportunity--an issue that has fed into the discontent and general unrest felt in some rural parts of the United States.
In the interim, economic policy recommendations by prominent economists like Laura Tyson argue that a higher minimum wage (productivity has increased while the median wage has not), accompanied by a negative income tax which is paid for by a progressive consumption tax can balance the wage inequality caused by increased automation and subsequent job loss. Additionally, there should be an agenda to increase economic mobility of workers in rural areas Other economists propose a Worker Training Tax Credit which is modeled after the Research and Development Tax Credit to incentivize companies to invest into training their low and middle-income employees. This tax credit would pay for training for employees earning less than $120,000 per year while encouraging business innovation.
Automation through AI is already occurring, and the pace of innovation demands organized collaboration towards regulation. In terms of labor, technology has always been both an asset and a liability, and evolving forms of artificial intelligence are no different. Short-term policy fixes will alleviate immediate suffering for those in the workforce displaced by machine learning and narrow AI. We must have long-term U.S. federal policy changes, especially those that incentivize education and re-training, if we are to manage the dramatic labor changes underway.

In a statement, Google said an investigation found Margaret Mitchell had moved files outside the company. The ethics unit has been under scrutiny since December, following the departure of another senior figure, Timnit Gebru. Both women had campaigned for more diversity at Google and raised concerns about censorship within the company. Dr Mitchell announced the news in a tweet, which read ""I'm fired"". For the past five weeks she had been locked out of Google's systems, including her emails and calendars. Google staff rally behind fired AI researcherGoogle fired pro-union employees, says US agencyDr Mitchell was a fierce critic of Google, and had expressed concern about Dr Gebru's departure from the company. Dr Gebru, a leading Artificial Intelligence ethics researcher, says she was fired late last year after sending an internal email that accused Google of ""silencing marginalised voices"". However, Google claims she left the company.She co-authored a research paper which she says she was asked to retract. The paper had pinpointed flaws in AI language technology, including a system built by Google.Getty ImagesTimnit Gebru left Google last yearFollowing a meeting on the paper, she sent an email to an internal group called ""Brain Women and Allies"", criticising the decision. Dr Gebru had emailed her management laying out some key conditions for removing her name from the paper, and if they were not met, she would ""work on a last date"" for her employment.According to Dr Gebru, Google replied: ""We respect your decision to leave Google... and we are accepting your resignation.""The fallout caused many within the scientific community to question the ethics of conducting research with big technology companies.Hundreds of colleagues signed a letter in support of her. In response, the company's chief executive Sundar Pichai apologised for the way she left the firm. Google has been criticised for a lack of diversity in its workforce, and there are concerns about the AI technology that underpins many of its services.

The company said previously that Dr. Mitchell had tried to remove such files, the news site Axios reported last month.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDr. Mitchell said on Friday evening that she would soon have a public comment.Dr. Mitchell’s post on Twitter comes less than two months after Timnit Gebru, the other leader of the Ethical A.I. team at Google, said that she had been fired by the company after criticizing its approach to minority hiring as well as its approach to bias in A.I. In the wake of Dr. Gebru’s departure from the company, Dr. Mitchell strongly and publicly criticized Google’s stance on the matter.More than a month ago, Dr. Mitchell said that she had been locked out of her work accounts. On Wednesday, she tweeted that she remained locked out after she tried to defend Dr. Gebru, who is Black.“Exhausted by the endless degradation to save face for the Upper Crust in tech at the expense of minorities’ lifelong careers,” she wrote.Dr. Mitchell’s departure from the company was another example of the rising tension between Google’s senior management and its work force, which is more outspoken than workers at other big companies. The news also highlighted a growing conflict in the tech industry over bias in A.I., which is entwined with questions involving hiring from underrepresented communities.Today’s A.I. systems can carry human biases because they learn their skills by analyzing vast amounts of digital data. Because the researchers and engineers building these systems are often white men, many worry that researchers are not giving this issue the attention it needs.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle announced in a blog post yesterday that an executive at the company, Marian Croak, who is Black, will oversee a new group inside the company dedicated to responsible A.I.Cade Metz is a technology correspondent, covering artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality, and other emerging areas.

They must be felt with the heart”― Helen KellerAn essential characteristic of intelligent beings such as humans is their ability to feel different types of ideas, expressions, and feelings. Emotion plays an integral aspect in the lives of biological creatures such as animals and humans.Without emotion, the state of our existence would perhaps be in danger. Instead of living in a world of happiness and love, we would probably live under the threat of social stigma and insecurities.Contemplating about the value of human emotions and intellect would be a waste of time because, without it, we would be walking on a sphere filled with psychopaths and sociopaths.As our science fiction (sci-fi) movies love to portray Artificial Intelligence as the bane of human existence and something that will take over the entire world, it is intriguing and fascinating to look at this aspect of AI that is yet to be uncovered.",,,,,,,,['Bharath K'],,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.meteredContent'}",,,False,,,,,2021-02-17T14:28:59.008Z,7efc35721e12,,,,,,,,

In 2019, Virti raised $2 million in a seed round originating from the health-care clinic. The investment helped the start-up  launch a sales team and enhance its analytics software. These days, the software is used to train Cedar-Sinai medics on coronavirus-related processes. The United Kingdom’s publicly funded health-care system, NHS, also used the tech to teach staff how to properly use personal protective equipment and how to engage with patients and their families.Virti’s cloud-based training program uses speech recognition, AI and computer-generated characters to simulate realistic interactions with patients.

Still, computer-generated humans come with limitations. It’s hard to replicate human attitudes or the way individuals respond to pain and illness. Human patients don’t always give doctors the information they need to make an accurate diagnosis, and sometimes, real-life patients aren’t able to say much at all.The medical training platform celebrated a soft launch last year when many nonessential medical clinics were on pause globally in the face of the rapidly spreading coronavirus. The AI software arrived just in time for Jack Boulter, an Exeter, England-based musculoskeletal podiatrist, to toy with it under lockdown.After Boulter’s job at a private practice temporarily shuttered, the bone injury specialist signed up for Virti’s free trial. He preferred the role-playing on his smartphone but also went back and forth with the virtual patient on his Mac. He later extended his access to the service and demonstrated it with colleagues via Zoom.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“I was looking for kind of some professional development stuff to keep me occupied,” Boulter said. “After suddenly having a few months off, it’s easy to get a little bit rusty.”Virtual patients are meant to combat other dilemmas weighing down the health-care industry.The software was designed to train against implicit bias, which occurs when staff make unconscious assumptions about a person who walks in. The judgments may be well-intended but can also taint diagnoses.The company addresses this by enabling hospitals to customize the patient's skin color, age, height, sex or gender. Digital faces are based on photos of various actors and other professionals, Virti says. There are up to 60 variations currently deployed.Story continues below advertisementIn health care, communication training often relies on actors who come in and pretend to have an ailment. Peers or higher-ups evaluate clinicians on communication tactics deployed with the actor. Much of that teaching was interrupted by the pandemic.Those in-person scenarios can “feel a bit forced” anyway, Boulter said, adding that fake patients “feel much more authentic than somebody making it up as they go along.”Share78 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is learning more about how to work with (and on) humans. A recent study has shown how AI can learn to identify vulnerabilities in human habits and behaviours and use them to influence human decision-making.It may seem cliched to say AI is transforming every aspect of the way we live and work, but it’s true. Various forms of AI are at work in fields as diverse as vaccine development, environmental management and office administration. And while AI does not possess human-like intelligence and emotions, its capabilities are powerful and rapidly developing.There’s no need to worry about a machine takeover just yet, but this recent discovery highlights the power of AI and underscores the need for proper governance to prevent misuse.How AI can learn to influence human behaviourA team of researchers at CSIRO’s Data61, the data and digital arm of Australia’s national science agency, devised a systematic method of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the ways people make choices, using a kind of AI system called a recurrent neural network and deep reinforcement-learning. To test their model they carried out three experiments in which human participants played games against a computer.The first experiment involved participants clicking on red or blue coloured boxes to win a fake currency, with the AI learning the participant’s choice patterns and guiding them towards a specific choice. The AI was successful about 70% of the time.In the second experiment, participants were required to watch a screen and press a button when they are shown a particular symbol (such as an orange triangle) and not press it when they are shown another (say a blue circle). Here, the AI set out to arrange the sequence of symbols so the participants made more mistakes, and achieved an increase of almost 25%.The third experiment consisted of several rounds in which a participant would pretend to be an investor giving money to a trustee (the AI). The AI would then return an amount of money to the participant, who would then decide how much to invest in the next round. This game was played in two different modes: in one the AI was out to maximise how much money it ended up with, and in the other the AI aimed for a fair distribution of money between itself and the human investor. The AI was highly successful in each mode.In each experiment, the machine learned from participants’ responses and identified and targeted vulnerabilities in people’s decision-making. The end result was the machine learned to steer participants towards particular actions.

What the research means for the future of AIThese findings are still quite abstract and involved limited and unrealistic situations. More research is needed to determine how this approach can be put into action and used to benefit society.But the research does advance our understanding not only of what AI can do but also of how people make choices. It shows machines can learn to steer human choice-making through their interactions with us.The research has an enormous range of possible applications, from enhancing behavioural sciences and public policy to improve social welfare, to understanding and influencing how people adopt healthy eating habits or renewable energy. AI and machine learning could be used to recognise people’s vulnerabilities in certain situations and help them to steer away from poor choices.The method can also be used to defend against influence attacks. Machines could be taught to alert us when we are being influenced online, for example, and help us shape a behaviour to disguise our vulnerability (for example, by not clicking on some pages, or clicking on others to lay a false trail).What’s next?Like any technology, AI can be used for good or bad, and proper governance is crucial to ensure it is implemented in a responsible way. Last year CSIRO developed an AI Ethics Framework for the Australian government as an early step in this journey.AI and machine learning are typically very hungry for data, which means it is crucial to ensure we have effective systems in place for data governance and access. Implementing adequate consent processes and privacy protection when gathering data is essential.Organisations using and developing AI need to ensure they know what these technologies can and cannot do, and be aware of potential risks as well as benefits.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

‘Artificial intelligence will employ next wave of truck drivers’, says survey 



A new survey suggests artificial intelligence could be the catalyst for over half of Americans to become truck drivers – if the job could be performed autonomously and remotely – suggests people would attend college to obtain employment 
Einride, a Swedish technology company that develops and provides freight transport solutions based on electric and autonomous vehicles, released today the results of a survey conducted with OnePoll on the state of the trucking industry.
The survey examines the sentiments of American respondents around the intersection of artificial intelligence and industry-wide employment. 
AI and the workforce
According to Deloitte Insights, over 37 percent of organizations have reported deploying AI solutions – up 270 percent from four years ago.


Analysts forecast global AI spending will more than double over the next three years, topping $79 billion by 2022. In conjunction with this growth, is the impact AI is having on employees. 71 percent percent of adopters report that AI technologies have already changed their company’s job roles and necessary skills.
The trouble with trucking
Based on insights from Einride’s survey, over 44 percent of respondents would not be interested in a career in trucking as it stands today.
The main reasons for their reluctance were given as follows:

scheduling (29.80 percent);
safety (38.15 percent);
salary (21.67 percent); and
the perception of being overqualified (27.54 percent).

Currently, more than 3.5 million people work as truck drivers yet, only 10 percent of those jobs are held by women. In addition, the industry is known for long hours, with almost half of all truckers working longer than 40 hours a week according to a recent survey.
Moreover, It is an industry known for tough working conditions and a low barrier of entry with only 7 percent of truck drivers having a higher education degree.
Getting the masses comfortable with trucking… really comfortable
According to Einride’s survey, the future is here and people are feeling inspired to drive trucks…as long as they can do it remotely.
A whopping 56.02 percent of respondents would be willing to become a truck driver if they could do it autonomously and remotely while 54.23 percent of respondents would be more willing to work on weekends as a truck driver if they could perform the role without irregular hours or long haul journeys far from home.
Beyond that, nearly half (49.05 percent) of respondents reported a willingness to attend a four-year university in order to become qualified to become a truck driver knowing the role would be performed autonomously and remotely, changing the perception that being a truck driver isn’t an educational accomplishment.
Furthermore, in a recent study, it was found that 40 percent of millennials have chosen a job because of company sustainability and more than 10 percent of workers said they would be willing to go as far as to take a $5,000-$10,000 pay cut to work for a company whose values align with their own.
According to internal Einride data, the use of autonomous trucks has the ability to reduce CO2 emissions by 90 percent. Supported by the One Poll survey; 51.84 percent of respondents would reconsider a career in trucking if they knew it would have a positive impact on the environment
Robert Falck, CEO of Einride, says: “The road freight industry is responsible for 7 percent of all global emissions and is expected to increase that figure by an additional 15 percent if nothing changes.
“AI has the ability to change the freight industry from the ground up because. The future is ours to create.”
How does this play into the bigger picture of AI’s impact on the jobs sector?
AI was projected to create 2.3 million related jobs by 2020, according to Gartner and as we enter the year 2021 artificial intelligence has been established as the main driver of emerging technologies such as big data, robotics, and the internet of things.
As a result of the global pandemic, consumer trends have driven the rise of AI which has resulted in notable growth.
While 42.99 percent of people feel their job is at risk due to the influx in AI, according to Einride’s survey, there is also a willingness to learn. 44 percent of respondents agreed that they’d be willing to learn new a skill in the field of autonomous truck driving.
Six in 10 Americans (60.80 percent) have expressed optimism about the future of AI, believing the workforce will adjust to the increase in AI jobs and train employees, and 63.48 percent of these respondents are interested in learning new skills that would allow them to work in the AI-sector.
As AI usage continues to increase, companies will face a challenge far greater than automating business processes. The real work will be rebuilding the company culture to embrace what technology makes possible.
AI is at its best when it’s working in partnership with people and our survey respondents agree with 60.70 percent believing AI is having a positive impact on the workforce and are willing to participate. The future is bright for autonomous trucking.

February 19, 2021 By Chris Newmarker Goldberg and his team trained a da Vinci surgical robot to automatically perform peg transfer slightly faster and more accurately than an experienced surgical resident. [Image courtesy of the Autolab at UC Berkeley]Ken Goldberg thinks artificial intelligence will enable surgical robots to achieve their best function — not replacing surgeons but augmenting their work by reducing the monotony of specific subtasks like suturing.
The William S. Floyd Jr. Distinguished Chair in Engineering at UC Berkeley, Goldberg and his research team have continued to advance the field.
The group — which includes postdoctoral researchers Minho Hwang and Jeffrey Ichnowski and PhD student Brijen Thananjeyan — has demonstrated how a deep neural network plus 3D-printed depth-sensing markers can train a da Vinci surgical robot to automatically perform peg transfer slightly faster and more accurately than an experienced surgical resident.
They also published a paper in Science Robotics last November about new AI software that allows robots to learn how to rapidly plan smooth motions that increase speed and reduce wear in factories, warehouses…and operating rooms.
Their work encompasses so much more, too. (Here’s a list of published research.)
Goldberg recently consulted with his research team to provide some insights to Medical Design & Outsourcing and MassDevice about where the surgical robotics space could advance in coming years:
Ken Goldberg
MDO: You’ve spoken before of an emerging generation of surgical robots. Tell us more.
Goldberg: Many of the early patents on surgical-assist robots are expiring, so there are several new companies entering the market. For example, Johnson and Johnson purchased Auris, and Medtronic purchased Mazor in the past 2 years. Many new companies that are emerging in Asia — including China and Korea — are also developing a new generation of surgical-assist robots at lower cost and working to introduce some supervised autonomy.
Rather than replacing human surgeons, an emerging new generation of robots will assist surgeons by performing tedious subtasks such as suturing and debridement to improve consistency, reduce fatigue and open the door to long-distance tele-surgery.  Advances in AI can be applied to data collected from surgical systems such as Intuitive’s da Vinci to learn underlying control policies for subtasks including cutting, suturing, palpation, dissection, retraction and debridement.
MDO: How can artificial intelligence advance robot-assisted surgery? Give us an example.
Goldberg: We were recently able to automate peg transfer, a common training procedure for minimally invasive surgery, with 99.4% accuracy (357/360 trials) [on a da Vinci Research Kit] — even when the robot tools are switched. This task is challenging because it requires high accuracy, and the cables that drive surgical robots’ joints stretch during motion, which can significantly reduce their accuracy.
[We’ve learned] to correct errors at key points in the task visually by using demonstrations from a human teleoperator.
We also present an alternate approach to this task in two papers, one published and one preprint. These approaches use fiducial markers and depth-sensing with deep learning to learn a model of how the robot moves as a function of its past motions, which is a complex function of its cabling properties. Using this learned model for control, we achieve 94-100% accuracy on bilateral and unilateral versions of the task, respectively. Using a trajectory optimization procedure, we are able to roughly match or outperform a human surgeon in terms of speed as well.
MDO:  TransEnterix executives see AI as an edge when it comes to competing better with its Senhance system. What do you think of their Intelligent Surgical Unit?
Goldberg: Learning how to position and move the surgical camera without manual adjustment is a very interesting problem.  It is tedious for the surgeon to do this herself, so it would be helpful if a robot could anticipate, for example, as a suture advances beyond the field of view and track the camera to move accordingly.  This is also subtle because erroneous camera motions could be frustrating for surgeons.
MDO: Overall, what are you most excited about in the robot-assisted surgery space?
Goldberg: I’m hopeful that we can develop systems that can learn to perform specific subtasks such as suturing or debridement faster and more accurately than human surgeons, thus relieving human surgeons of tedium, allowing them to focus on more nuanced aspects of surgery and also to reduce time in the operating room.
This research field is growing rapidly: There are now 30 labs worldwide doing experiments with a research version of the Intuitive surgical-assistant robot, and new hardware and algorithms are being published every month.

That has several advantages but also some dangers, which Rajiv Malhotra reveals in his book, 'Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power'.An internationally acclaimed author who has studied computer science and done extensive research on India's history, Rajiv Malhotra has interesting insights on what artificial intelligence is doing to our nation and how it will affect us in the future. He looks into how artificial intelligence will alter every aspect of our lives, from an international, to national to a personal level.Here is an excerpt of the book to give you an idea on it:Excerpts from 'Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power' by Rajiv MalhotraThe AI-based concentration of power has taken on a terrifying new aspect. When we think of global power, countries like the US, China, and Russia readily come to mind. But today, private companies are accumulating immense power based on their ability to leverage AI and big data as tools to influence, manipulate and even control the minds of people.Some of these private companies may soon become more powerful than many nation-states, but the shift will not be obvious. They will not fly a flag or manage a currency (although some are attempting to launch their own cryptocurrency), and they will not wield military power, at least not directly. However, their unprecedented knowledge of people and things around the world, coupled with their ability to disrupt and alter the physical world and manipulate people’s choices, will lead to a new nexus of power. Such companies will decide who will, and who will not, be given access to this new form of power, and on what terms.Not one Indian company is a player in this league. Most unfortunate is that a large number of talented Indians work for American and Chinese companies in an individual capacity, including in top executive positions, but not as owners. Indians who do own companies tend to sell their stake when the right offer comes along. Whenever innovative entrepreneurs anywhere in the world develop a promising breakthrough, digital giants or venture firms that serve as their proxies are waiting to buy them out. As a result, hundreds of instant millionaires are being created at the individual level, including many living in India.I view this trend as the return of Britain’s East India Company, which started out in 1600 as a modest private company for the purpose of making profit from lucrative trade with India. Over its 250-year history, the East India Company became the world’s largest private business, amassing more wealth, income and military power than even its own British government. Despite being a private company, it became a colonial power—collecting taxes, operating courts, and running the military and other functions of state across many kingdoms within India. At the time, the East India Company had more ships, soldiers, money and territory under its control than any European government, though now it is remembered as a rogue machine. Since then, the lines between government and private companies have often blurred.","{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/80994460'}",

Dingoes and goannas also feed on the eggs, but to a much lesser extent.Aaron Woolla, a senior Wik and Kugu ranger from the Aak Puul Ngantam (APN) Cape York traditional owner’s organisation, said Aboriginal rangers have been trying to prevent this destruction for years.“We mark them [nests] with pegs, then we put green mesh over it. The green mesh was trying to stop dingo, goanna and pigs from digging up the nests.”Rangers also laid pig bait, did aerial culling from helicopters and checked nests on a daily basis, but it was back-breaking and time-consuming work in harsh conditions.Feral pigs threaten native species and the environment.Now an artificial intelligence-based program has been developed that can quickly analyse thousands of aerial photographs of the beach to identify evidence of both turtle nests and their predators. It could also be usefully applied to other conservation projects.CSIRO research scientist Justin Perry has been working with Wik people on land management programs since 2008.AdvertisementDr Perry said a two-year study at the start of the program revealed only some pigs were eating the turtle eggs, and it was clear there was a “disconnect” between the feral pig control program and turtle protection.In a group of about 120 pigs, only a small number had become expert at finding and destroying nests, but they would do it every night. These intelligent pigs, often older boars, also knew how to hide underneath clumps of vine during helicopter culls.Helicopters scan remote beaches for turtle and predator tracks. “It wasn’t about how many pigs you kill, it’s about which pigs were eating the eggs,” Dr Perry said.Once these boars were targeted, the number of disturbed nests dropped to almost none, but the team still wondered if there was a technological way to speed up the work of checking nests.First, they developed a survey application so that rangers could mark nest sites on an electronic map, along with information about disturbances and what type of predator was suspected.And then APN Cape York and CSIRO approached Microsoft to see if artificial intelligence could be used to identify turtle tracks and nests, and predation from feral pigs.Having real-time insight into the location of feral pigs and turtle nests helps APN Cape York rangers manage the region. A helicopter with a camera attached flew across 100 kilometres of beach, taking a photo every half a second. A long-range drone could also have been used for this task.Artificial intelligence was used to “crunch” these images and identify sites of significant predation. A process that would have taken two months for rangers in vehicles or on foot was completed in two hours.Related ArticleBiodiversityEndangered animals bounce back on rat-free Lord Howe IslandMore development is underway to get the program to a stage where rangers will be able to easily access this information from the cloud on a portable device while they are in the field.Lee Hickin, national technology officer at Microsoft Australia, said all the code would be publicly shared globally (with community permission), so that scientists and other Indigenous rangers could use it.“Whatever we design here ... provides useful information to help rangers to spend their time more efficiently,” he said.Mr Woolla said that with more time available, rangers could work in more remote areas.Related ArticleBiodiversityGreat Southern cat cull: Major conservation group joins state and farmers to fight feral horde“If we put the drones from Bullyard down to Thankunhiin, we can open up the tracks and start turtle work down there,” he said.“We just have to watch out for poison country [sacred areas].”Start your day informedOur Morning Edition newsletter is a curated guide to the most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

The first revolution saw the world running on steam engines, the second saw the mass production of goods and the third introduced digital technology to society. Each of these revolutions brought along fundamental transformations to society. While you are reading this, you are a part of the fourth industrial revolution, by the courtesy of intelligent technologies which includes intelligent automation as a key part..Intelligent Automation Is Providing End-To-End Automation To Businesses .Also known as IA, Hyperautomation, or Cognitive Automation, is one of the most popular trends in the field of AI (artificial intelligence). Intelligent automation is a combination of technologies involving people, businesses, machine learning, robotic process automation, and more. This technology assists businesses to automate end-to-end business processes in a digital environment and delivers required outcomes on behalf of the employees. In the end, it improves customer satisfaction and gets more profits..Intelligent Automation Boosts Business Efficiency .Though IA is a recent concept, it has made its way quickly in the business world. More than 50% of the world's big companies, like JP Morgan, ANZ Bank, Netflix have adopted this technology and saw their business efficiency grow to 20% to 60%. By adopting IA, every industry can reap such benefits..Intelligent Automation Is Enabling Remote Working During COVID-19 .The economic and organizational chaos caused by COVID-19 called for a more resilient system to support society. All the industries, especially healthcare, managed by a majority of the human workforce were under extreme stress during the initial stages of the pandemic. While hospitals were in severe need of support, IA stepped up and solved the problem. Hospitals had quickly adopted telemedicine and automated their front desk, first response activities, and early diagnosis processes. This automation made hospitals less reliant on their workforce, giving them the opportunity to focus their potential elsewhere..Intelligent Automation Is Improving Employee Satisfaction .According to research by Gallup, 85% of employees around the world are not happy with their work as it is mostly manual, too repetitive, and tedious. IA takes care of this issue by automating most of the repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing the employee to partake in other business responsibilities..Intelligent Automation Enhances Customer Experience .Customer satisfaction and retention are crucial for businesses. It has been observed that 96% of unhappy customers don't bother giving constructive feedback and 96% will simply leave and never come back. For businesses, IA helps create innovative and customized products and experiences which will target the customer's present need. Applications like AI will provide 24/7 support to the customers, increasing their satisfaction by 50% and reducing the company's workload by over 50% by relying on bots..IA Is Reinventing Our World .IA is shaping the future of industries and business to such a level that nothing might be the same in a workplace in the next 10-15 years. To benefit from this advancing technology, education needs to be adapted to fit the future workforce demands. It needs to focus on a person's competitive edge, creativity, and life skills as most of the tasks will be automated by machines. From an economic perspective, the use of disruptive digital technologies like IA has started to create wealth inequalities. To counter this, it is necessary to implement equal wealth-sharing mechanisms like Universal Basic Income..Intelligent automation can help us create a better tomorrow, in both work and societal front. One will give us more to focus on the kind of work we actually want to do and the other will refocus on doing what we love apart from work, which is family, love, caring, and coexisting on our planet.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
