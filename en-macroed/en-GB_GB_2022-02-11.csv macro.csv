Language is the cornerstone of human intelligence.

The emergence of language was the most important intellectual development in our species’ history. It is through language that we formulate thoughts and communicate them to one another. Language enables us to reason abstractly, to develop complex ideas about what the world is and could be, and to build on these ideas across generations and geographies. Almost nothing about modern civilization would be possible without language.

PROMOTED
Building machines that can understand language has thus been a central goal of the field of artificial intelligence dating back to its earliest days.

It has proven maddeningly elusive.
This is because mastering language is what is known as an “AI-complete” problem: that is, an AI that can truly understand language the way a human can would by implication be capable of any other human-level intellectual activity. Put simply, to solve language is to solve AI.

This profound and subtle insight is at the heart of the “Turing test,” introduced by AI pioneer Alan Turing in a groundbreaking 1950 paper. Though often critiqued or misunderstood, the Turing test captures a fundamental reality about language and intelligence; as it approaches its 75th birthday, it remains as relevant as it was when Turing first conceived it.

Humanity has yet to build a machine intelligence with human-level mastery of language. (In other words, no machine intelligence has yet passed the Turing test.) But over the past few years researchers have achieved startling, game-changing breakthroughs in language AI, also called natural language processing (NLP).

The technology is now at a critical inflection point, poised to make the leap from academic research to widespread real-world adoption. In the process, broad swaths of the business world and our daily lives will be transformed. Given language’s ubiquity, few areas of technology will have a more far-reaching impact on society in the years ahead.


Transformers: A Once-In-A-Generation Breakthrough
The most powerful way to illustrate the capabilities of today’s cutting-edge language AI is to start with a few concrete examples.
Today’s AI can correctly answer complex medical queries—and explain the underlying biological mechanisms at play. It can craft nuanced memos about how to run effective board meetings. It can write articles analyzing its own capabilities and limitations, while convincingly pretending to be a human observer. It can produce original, sometimes beautiful, poetry and literature.
(It is worth taking a few moments to inspect these examples yourself.)
What is behind these astonishing new AI abilities, which just five years ago would have been inconceivable?
In short: the invention of the transformer, a new neural network architecture that has unleashed vast new possibilities in AI.
A group of Google researchers introduced the transformer in late 2017 in a now-classic research paper.
Before transformers, the state of the art in NLP—for instance, LSTMs and the widely-used Seq2Seq architecture—was based on recurrent neural networks. By definition, recurrent neural networks process data sequentially—that is, one word at a time, in the order that the words appear.
Transformers’ great innovation is to make language processing parallelized, meaning that all the tokens in a given body of text are analyzed at the same time rather than in sequence. In order to support this parallelization, transformers rely on an AI mechanism known as attention. Attention enables a model to consider the relationships between words, even if they are far apart in a text, and to determine which words and phrases in a passage are most important to “pay attention to.”
Parallelization also makes transformers vastly more computationally efficient than RNNs, meaning that they can be trained on larger datasets and built with more parameters. One defining characteristic of today’s transformer models is their massive size.
A flurry of innovation followed in the wake of the original transformer paper as the world’s leading AI researchers built upon this foundational breakthrough.
The publication of the landmark transformer model BERT came in 2018. Created at Google, BERT’s big conceptual advance is its bidirectional structure (the B in BERT stands for “bidirectional”). The model “looks in both directions” as it analyzes a given word, considering both the words that come before and the words that come after, rather than working unidirectionally from left to right. This additional context allows for richer, more nuanced language modeling.
BERT remains one of the most important transformer-based models in use, frequently treated as a reference against which newer models are compared. Much subsequent research on transformers—for instance, Facebook’s influential RoBERTa model (2019)—is based on refining BERT.
Google’s entire search engine today is powered by BERT, one of the most far-reaching examples of transformers’ real-world impact.
Another core vein of research in the world of transformers is OpenAI’s family of GPT models. OpenAI published the original GPT in June 2018, GPT-2 in February 2019, and GPT-3 in May 2020. Popular open-source versions of these models, like GPT-J and GPT-Neo, have followed.
As the “G” in their names indicates, the GPT models are generative: they generate original text output in response to the text input they are fed. This is an important distinction between the GPT class of models and the BERT class of models. BERT, unlike GPT, does not generate new text but instead analyzes existing text (think of activities like search, classification, or sentiment analysis).
GPT’s generative capabilities make these models particularly attention-grabbing, since writing appears to be a creative act and the output can be astonishingly human-like. Text generation is sometimes referred to as “NLP’s party trick.” (All four of the examples linked to above are text generation examples from GPT-3.)
Perhaps the most noteworthy element of the GPT architecture is its sheer size. OpenAI has been intentional and transparent about its strategy to pursue more advanced language AI capabilities through raw scale above all else: more compute, larger training data corpora, larger models.
With 1.5 billion parameters, GPT-2 was the largest model ever built at the time of its release. Published less than a year later, GPT-3 was two orders of magnitude larger: a whopping 175 billion parameters. Rumors have circulated that GPT-4 will contain on the order of 100 trillion parameters (perhaps not coincidentally, roughly equivalent to the number of synapses in the human brain). As a point of comparison, the largest BERT model had 340 million parameters.
As with any machine learning effort today, the performance of these models depends above all on the data on which they are trained.
Today’s transformer-based models learn language by ingesting essentially the entire internet. BERT was fed all of Wikipedia (along with the digitized texts of thousands of unpublished books). RoBERTa improved upon BERT by training on even larger volumes of text from the internet. GPT-3’s training dataset was larger still, consisting of half a trillion language tokens. Thus, these models’ linguistic outputs and behaviors can ultimately be traced to the statistical patterns in all the text that humans have previously published online.
The reason such large training datasets are possible is that transformers use self-supervised learning, meaning that they learn from unlabeled data. This is a crucial difference between today’s cutting-edge language AI models and the previous generation of NLP models, which had to be trained with labeled data. Today’s self-supervised models can train on far larger datasets than was ever previously possible: after all, there is more unlabeled text data than labeled text data in the world by many orders of magnitude.
Some observers point to self-supervised learning, and the vastly larger training datasets that this technique unlocks, as the single most important driver of NLP’s dramatic performance gains in recent years, more so than any other feature of the transformer architecture.

Foundation Models
Training models on massive datasets with millions or billions of parameters requires vast computational resources and engineering know-how. This makes large language models prohibitively costly and difficult to build. GPT-3, for example, required several thousand petaflop/second-days to train—a staggering amount of computational resources.
Because very few organizations in the world have the resources and talent to build large language models from scratch, almost all cutting-edge NLP models today are adapted from a small handful of base models: e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, BART. Almost without exception, these models come from the world’s largest tech companies: Google, Facebook, OpenAI (which is bankrolled by Microsoft), Nvidia.
Without anyone quite planning for it, this has resulted in an entirely new paradigm for NLP technology development—one that will have profound implications for the nascent AI economy.
This paradigm can be thought of in two basic phases: pre-training and fine-tuning.
In the first phase, a tech giant creates and open-sources a large language model: for instance, Google’s BERT or Facebook’s RoBERTa.
Unlike in previous generations of NLP, in which models had to be built for individual language tasks, these massive models are not specialized for any particular activity. They have powerful generalized language capabilities across functions and topic areas. Out of the box, they perform well at the full gamut of activities that comprise linguistic competence: language classification, language translation, search, question answering, summarization, text generation, conversation. Each of these activities on its own presents compelling technological and economic opportunities.
Because they can be adapted to any number of specific end uses, these base models are referred to as “pre-trained.”
In the second phase, downstream users—young startups, academic researchers, anyone else who wants to build an NLP model—take these pre-trained models and refine them with a small amount of additional training data in order to optimize them for their own specific use case or market. This step is referred to as “fine-tuning.”
“Today’s pre-trained models are incredibly powerful, and even more importantly, they are publicly available,” said Yinhan Liu, lead author on Facebook’s RoBERTa work and now cofounder/CTO of healthcare NLP startup BirchAI. “For those teams that have the know-how to operationalize transformers, the question becomes: what is the most important or impactful use case to which I can apply this technology?”
Under this “pre-train then fine-tune” paradigm, the heavy lifting is done upfront with the creation of the pre-trained model. Even after fine-tuning, the end model’s behavior remains largely dictated by the pre-trained model’s parameters.
This makes these pre-trained models incredibly influential. So influential, in fact, that Stanford University has recently coined a new name for them, “foundation models”, and launched an entire academic program devoted to better understanding them: the Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM). The Stanford team believes that foundation models, and the small group of tech giants that have the resources to produce them, will exert outsize influence on the future behavior of artificial intelligence around the world.
As the researchers put it: “Foundation models have led to an unprecedented level of homogenization: Almost all state-of-the-art NLP models are now adapted from one of a few foundation models. While this homogenization produces extremely high leverage (any improvements in the foundation models can lead to immediate benefits across all of NLP), it is also a liability; all AI systems might inherit the same problematic biases of a few foundation models.”
This Stanford effort is drawing attention to a massive looming problem for large language models: social bias.
The source of social bias in AI models is straightforward to summarize but insidiously difficult to root out. Because large language models (or foundation models, to use the new branding) learn language by ingesting what humans have written online, they inevitably inherit the prejudices, false assumptions and harmful beliefs of their imperfect human progenitors. Just imagine all the fringe subreddits and bigoted blogs that must have been included in GPT-3’s vast training data corpus.
The problem has been extensively documented: today’s most prominent foundation models all exhibit racist, sexist, xenophobic, and other antisocial tendencies. This issue will only grow more acute as foundation models become increasingly influential in society. Some observers believe that AI bias will eventually become as prominent of an issue for consumers, companies and governments as digital threats like data privacy or cybersecurity that have come before it—threats that were also not fully appreciated at first, because the breakneck pace of technological change outstripped society’s ability to properly adapt to it.
There is no silver-bullet solution to the challenge of AI bias and toxicity. But as the problem becomes more widely recognized, a number of mitigation strategies are being pursued.
Last month, OpenAI announced that it had developed a new version of GPT-3 that is “safer, more helpful, and more aligned” with human values. The company used a technique known as reinforcement learning from human feedback to fine-tune its models to be less biased and more truthful than the original GPT-3. This new version, named InstructGPT, is now the default language model that OpenAI makes available to customers.
Historically, Alphabet’s DeepMind has been an outlier among the world’s most advanced AI research organizations for not making language AI a major focus area. This changed at the end of 2021, with DeepMind announcing a collection of important work on large language models.
Of the three NLP papers that DeepMind published, one is devoted entirely to the ethical and social risks of language AI. The paper proposes a comprehensive taxonomy of 6 thematic areas and 21 specific risks that language models pose, including discrimination, exclusion, toxicity and misinformation. DeepMind pledged to make these risks a central focus of its NLP research going forward to help ensure that it is pursuing innovation in language AI responsibly.
The fact that this dimension of language AI research—until recently, treated as an afterthought or ignored altogether by most of the world’s NLP researchers—featured so centrally in DeepMind’s recent foray into language AI may be a signal of the field’s shifting priorities moving forward.
Increased regulatory focus on the harms of bias and toxicity in AI models will only accelerate this shift. And make no mistake: regulatory action on this front is a matter of when, not if.

Beyond Natural Language
Interestingly, perhaps the most creative use cases for NLP today don’t involve natural language at all. In particular, today’s cutting-edge language AI technology is powering remarkable breakthroughs in two other domains: coding and biology.
Whether it’s Python, Ruby, or Java, computer programming happens via languages. Just like natural languages like English or Swahili, programming languages are symbolically represented, follow regular rules, and have a robust internal logic. The audience just happens to be software compilers rather than other humans.
It therefore makes sense that the same powerful new technologies that have given AI incredible fluency in natural language can likewise be applied to programming languages, with similar results.
Last summer OpenAI announced Codex, a transformer-based model that can write computer code astonishingly well. In parallel, GitHub (which is allied with OpenAI through its parent company Microsoft) launched a productized version of Codex named Copilot.
To develop Codex, OpenAI took GPT-3 and fine-tuned it on a massive volume of publicly available written code from GitHub.
Codex’s design is simple: human users give it a plain-English description of a command or function and Codex turns this description into functioning computer code. A user could input into Codex, for instance, “crop this image circularly” or “animate this image horizontally so that it bounces off the left and right walls”—and Codex can produce a snippet of code to implement those actions. (These exact examples can be examined on OpenAI’s website.) Codex is most capable in Python, but it is proficient in over a dozen programming languages.
Then, just two weeks ago, DeepMind further advanced the frontiers of AI coding with its publication of AlphaCode.
AlphaCode is an AI system that can compete at a human level in programming competitions. In these competitions, which attract hundreds of thousands of participants each year, contestants receive a lengthy problem statement in English and must construct a complete computer program that solves it. Example problems include devising strategies for a custom board game or solving an arithmetic-based brain teaser.
While OpenAI’s Codex can produce short snippets of code in response to concrete descriptions, DeepMind’s AlphaCode goes much further. It begins to approach the full complexity of real-world programming: assessing an abstract problem without a clear solution, devising a structured approach to solving it, and then executing on that approach with up to hundreds of lines of code. AlphaCode almost seems to display that ever-elusive attribute in AI, high-level reasoning.
As DeepMind’s AlphaCode team wrote: “Creating solutions to unforeseen problems is second nature in human intelligence—a result of critical thinking informed by experience. For artificial intelligence to help humanity, our systems need to be able to develop problem-solving capabilities. AlphaCode solves new problems in programming competitions that require a combination of critical thinking, logic, algorithms, coding, and natural language understanding.”
Another “language” in which today’s cutting-edge NLP has begun to generate remarkable insights is biology, from genomics to proteins.
Genomics is well-suited to the application of large language models because an individual’s entire genetic endowment is encoded in a simple four-letter alphabet: A (for adenine), C (for cytosine), G (for guanine), and T (for thymine). Every human’s DNA is defined by a string of billions of A’s, C’s, G’s and T’s (known as nucleotides) in a particular order.
In many respects DNA functions like a language, with its nucleotide sequences exhibiting regular patterns that resemble a kind of vocabulary, grammar, and semantics. What does this language say? It defines much about who we are, from our height to our eye color to our risk of heart disease or substance abuse.
Large language models are now making rapid progress in deciphering the language of DNA, in particular its “noncoding” regions. These noncoding regions do not contain genes but rather control genes: they regulate how much, when, and where given genes are expressed, giving them a central role in the maintenance of life. Noncoding regions comprise 98% of our total DNA but until now have remained poorly understood.
A few months ago, DeepMind introduced a new transformer-based architecture that can predict gene expression based on DNA sequence with unprecedented accuracy. It does so by considering interactions between genes and noncoding DNA sequences at much greater distances than was ever before possible. A team at Harvard completed work along similar lines to better understand gene expression in corn (fittingly naming their model “CornBERT”).
Another subfield of biology that represents fertile ground for language AI is the study of proteins. Proteins are strings of building blocks known as amino acids, linked together in a particular order. There are 20 amino acids in total. Thus, for all their complexity, proteins can be treated as tokenized strings—wherein each amino acid, like each word in a natural language, is a token—and analyzed accordingly.
As one example, an AI research team from Salesforce recently built an NLP model that “learns the language of proteins” and can generate plausible protein sequences that don’t exist in nature with prespecified characteristics. The potential applications of this type of controllable protein synthesis are tantalizing.
These efforts are just the beginning. In the months and years ahead, language AI will make profound contributions to our understanding of how life itself works.

Conclusion
Language is at the heart of human intelligence. It therefore is and must be at the heart of our efforts to build artificial intelligence. No sophisticated AI can exist without mastery of language.
Today, the field of language AI is at an exhilarating inflection point, on the cusp of transforming industries and spawning new multi-billion-dollar companies. At the same time, it is fraught with societal dangers like bias and toxicity that are only now starting to get the attention they deserve.

Scheduling that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) produces various benefits, including easing the frequent burnout experienced by physicians, according to new data from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA).







Researchers from the ASA examined the impact of implementing an AI-based scheduling system on physician experience. Their goal was to explore new possibilities for AI and discover ways to decrease the rate of physician burnout, which currently sits at around 50 percent according to the press release. The research was presented at ASA's ADVANCE 2022 conference, Jan. 28 to 30.
For the study, researchers assessed data collected from 2018 through the COVID-19 pandemic at Ochsner Health.
When done manually, creating a schedule generally requires an average of 60 to 75 hours monthly.
Meanwhile, the AI-based scheduling tool cut the time taken to generate new schedules to 14 hours.
Physician engagement rates, which reflect the physician’s level of engagement with the healthcare organization, also skyrocketed following the creation of this new system. After using the AI scheduling system for six months, the average engagement score for 60 anesthesiologists was 4.2 out of 5, significantly higher than the former average of 3.3.
These strong scores did not decrease during the COVID-19 pandemic, showing the method’s effectiveness and ability to reduce stress levels. This pandemic led to the creation of COVID intensive care units (ICUs), resulting in scheduling complications for physicians. However, the AI system was able to keep up with the speed of the disease, consistently staffing all ICUs.
Besides the significant reduction in time dedicated to scheduling and high physician engagement, an AI-based approach provides various other benefits.
""On average, the scheduling allows our anesthesiologists to have one or two mornings and one or two afternoons off a month to allow for increased work-life balance so they are better able to attend events important to them,"" said Dhruv Choudhry, MD, lead author of the study and anesthesiology resident at Ochsner Health in New Orleans, in the news release.
Launched in 1905, ASA is an organization of 55,000 members that aims to promote the field of anesthesiology.
AI scheduling appears to improve work-life balance for physicians and could result in a higher retention rate due to decreased burnout. According to a survey on physician burnout, the year 2020 saw the physician burnout rate drop 4 percent compared with five years prior.
In addition to scheduling benefits, AI is improving the lives of anesthesiologists in the operating room. A recent study explained how drug administration is possible through AI, allowing doctors to attend to other responsibilities while performing surgery, such as monitoring patient comfort levels and making sure they are physiologically stable.

The Smart Nonprofit: Staying Human-Centered in An Automated World

240 pages, Wiley, 2022

“Smart tech” is an umbrella term we created to describe advanced digital technologies that make decisions for people, instead of people. It includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its subsets and cousins such as machine learning, natural language processes, smart forms, and chatbots, robots, and drones.
Right now, smart tech is best at doing rote tasks like filling out intake forms, and answering the same questions over and again (“is my contribution tax-deductible?”). However, the technology is quickly embedding itself into the heart of nonprofit work in a wide variety of functions. As a result, we anticipate that staff will be free to focus on other activities. We call this benefit the “dividend of time,” which can be used to, say, reduce staff burnout, get to know clients in deeper ways, and focus on problem-solving like addressing the root causes of homelessness in addition to serving homeless people. 
Smart tech has recently reached an inflection point common to technologies that reach everyday use: An enormous increase in computing power meets a dramatic decrease in the cost of the technology. As a result, technology that was previously available only to elite institutions like NASA or embedded in widely complicated systems has suddenly become available to everyday people and organizations for fundraising, accounting, human resources, service delivery, and more.
Grabbing software off-the-shelf that is “smart” may look like a technical decision, at its heart it is a deeply and profoundly human challenge that requires informed leadership to do well. There is a sweet spot of balancing the capability of the technology with the interests and needs of the people inside and outside that organizations need to identify. Some people call this convergence “co-botting.” The responsibility for identifying this sweet spot cannot rest with the IT department alone. Organizational leaders need to be interested, knowledgeable, and engaged enough to ensure smart tech is used in human-centered ways.
In the following excerpt from our chapter on staying human-centered in our new book, The Smart Nonprofit, we discuss how being human-centered means prioritizing the interests, strengths, and unique talents of people over the speed and wizardry of the technology. Valuing humans has never been more important as our workplaces become more and more automated.—Allison Fine and Beth Kanter
* * *
Caesar Chavez said, “It was never about grapes or lettuce and always about people.”1 The same holds true for smart tech. It is not about the code or the wizardry; it’s about ensuring that people matter the most. Being human-centered means prioritizing the interests, strengths, and unique talents of people over the speed and wizardry of the technology. Valuing humans has never been more important as our workplaces become more and more automated.
Smart tech is a fundamentally new way of working and has the potential to do more harm than good if treating people well inside and outside isn’t the top priority. This chapter explores the differences between human and machine intelligence, describes how to marry people and bots inside of organizations, and outlines steps for designing human-centered efforts to ensure smart tech is enhancing and not subjugating the needs of people.
Man vs. Machine
Since the 1950s experts have been forecasting that smart tech will reach human-level intelligence in 20 years. “In other words, it’s been 20 years away for 60 years,” according to MIT Professor Thomas Malone.2
Over the past few years, Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates, and many other big names in science and technology have expressed concerns in the media about the potential for AI to be smarter than humans. There have been a number of surveys asking when this will happen and they all reach the same conclusion: we simply don’t know. But we can say with absolute confidence that right now human and machine intelligence are not equal.3
In a gross oversimplification, intelligence has two components: fact-based knowledge and emotional intelligence. Smart tech is clearly gaining ground on fact-based knowledge, but it is also in the very early stages of incorporating emotional intelligence. At the heart of emotional intelligence is empathy, understanding what other people are feeling. Smart tech is not as empathetic as people yet, and may never be, but it can mimic empathy through sentiment analysis.
Smart technologies are more accurate, faster, and more consistent at doing particular tasks like filling out forms. Smart technologies never get tired or need to take a lunch break or vacation. However, currently, bots are not empathetic. What they can do is simulate an emotional response. For instance, a customer support chatbot may be taught to apologize in a caring or helpful tone, even calling you by your name. Imitating emotions is not the same as having them or understanding them.
People have the unique ability to imagine, problem solve, anticipate, feel, and judge changing situations, which allows us to shift perspectives. Our memories, hopes, concerns, and personality also contribute to how we react to the world around us. Smart technologies simply are not capable of empathy, love, or other emotions, yet. Stuart Russell, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, writes, “. . . while AI systems may be able to mimic human empathy, they can’t truly understand what empathy is like. It’s a distinction that nonprofits may not understand, but it is an essential tenet of being human-centered.”4
The gap between human and bot intelligence is reflected in the growing field of therapy chatbots. Dr. Freud in a Box and other therapy chatbots are attractive products because they are inexpensive and always available. But research has shown that bots make terrible therapists because of the limitations of smart technology to understand subtext.5
There are other significant challenges to therapy bots. Private companies are often not transparent about how their algorithms work, amplifying the potential for the chatbot therapist to provide bad or biased advice.
If all this was not bad enough, there is potential to weaponize private information by sharing it with marketing companies. For instance, there’s Woebot. It is a chatbot therapist providing cognitive behavioral therapy through Facebook Messenger (Editorial note: Woebot is no longer on Facebook messenger and is available via the app store on a smartphone.) It is not regulated or licensed as a therapist and although it has no plan to do so today, the company could choose to sell users’ data to pharmaceutical companies or employers in the future.6
Co-Botting
Getting the balance right between people and smart tech is called co-botting or augmented intelligence.7 H. James Wilson and Paul R. Daugherty have conducted research with over 1500 companies and found that significant performance improvements happen when humans and machines work together. “Through augmented intelligence, humans and AI actively enhance each other’s complementary strengths: the leadership, teamwork, creativity, and social skills of the former, and the speed, scalability, and quantitative capabilities of the latter.”8  
Smart tech is an equal opportunity job disrupter and doesn’t care if a job is low paying or high paying. If it involves analysis of large amounts of data, the job is going to change. Curtis Langlotz, a radiologist at Stanford, predicts, “AI won’t replace radiologists, but radiologists who use AI will replace radiologists who don’t.”9
Most experts doubt AI will replace doctors any time soon because even if an algorithm is better at diagnosing a particular problem, combining it with a doctor’s experience and knowledge of the patient’s individual story will lead to a better treatment and outcome.
The Trevor Project provides crisis counseling to young lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ+) people. They created Riley, a chat bot to help train counselors by providing real-life simulations of conversations with potentially suicidal teens. Riley is always available for a training session with volunteers and that helps the staff scale the number of trained counselors without adding more resources. Riley will never work on the front line directly with youth in crisis because The Trevor Project sees this role as a human-centered one.10
Co-botting goes beyond working with chatbots. Benefits Data Trust is a Philadelphia-based poverty reduction organization. It created a co-botting system for integrating smart tech into its efforts to help its call-in center staff assist clients to navigate and complete public benefits’ application processes. The pain point they were trying to solve was the enormous amount of time and documentation it takes for clients to apply for and receive benefits. The computer system was trained on thousands of interactions between call-in staff and clients to make recommendations among dozens of possible public benefits. The system also pre-populated forms for clients, saving staff an enormous amount of time.
Ravindar Gujarl, chief data and technology officer from the Public Benefits Trust, told us, “At the end of the day, our role as a nonprofit is to create a human connection. We won’t replace our call-in staff who directly interface with our clients. Our nonprofit’s work is about building relationships with our clients. They come to us in distress and we want them not to have to worry about having to collect documents or wade through a complicated application process.”11
These examples involved careful planning to ensure that the technology augmented and didn’t replace the work of staff. There is no special formula for ensuring you get the right balance between people and technology. It takes careful planning, monitoring, and continuous adjustments to ensure your organization is staying human-centered and getting the best out of both. Without this kind of care and thoughtfulness, your nonprofit could end up adding a bot like Flippy to your staff.
In March, 2018, Miso Robotics and Caliaburger, a fast-food franchise in Southern California, announced the public debut of “Flippy,” the world’s first autonomous robotic kitchen assistant powered by artificial intelligence. Flippy’s job was to flip burger patties and remove them from the grill for its human co-workers to put the cheese on top at the right moment and add the extras, such as lettuce and sauce, before wrapping the sandwiches for customers.
The press release for the launch described how Flippy would disrupt and transform the fast-food industry by taking over the hot, greasy, and dirty task of flipping burgers. The company touted Flippy as a cost-effective and highly efficient solution that could flip 150 burgers per hour, far more than the cooks it was replacing. What the press release didn’t mention was that in addition, Flippy wouldn’t complain about the low pay, scanty benefits, and long hours.12
After two days on the job, Flippy was fired. News of Flippy, the robot cook, went viral on social media. This prompted a surge in interest and while Flippy flipped away, the human kitchen staff could not keep up with the demand. The restaurant realized it needed to spend more time on its internal systems and training people to work side-by-side with the robots.
This story shows how easy it is for an organization to choose a bot to solve a problem without engaging staff in the process and keeping the entire system human-centered.13,14
Human-Centered Design
COVID-19 highlighted the bad habit some organizations have of not staying human-centered during stressful times. A hospital system in Washington State welcomed donors who had given at least $10,000 to set up vaccination appointments on an “invite-only” basis. The chief executive of a high-end nursing home and assisted-living facility in West Palm Beach, Florida, invited board members and major donors to receive immunizations. These were not the only two examples of hospitals and care facilities offering donors first shot at the shots.
Mike Geiger, president of the Association of Fundraising Professionals, said in response, “The idea of hospital systems, or any charity, ignoring protocols, guidance, or restrictions—regardless of origin—and offering certain donors and board members the opportunity to ‘skip the line’ and receive vaccinations ahead of their scheduled time is antithetical to the values of philanthropy and ethical fundraising.”15
While this example is not specifically about smart tech, it illustrates how easy it is for organizations to slip away from keeping clients and patients front and center. The use of smart tech makes staying human-centered even more pressing. We recommend engaging with end users through human-centered design techniques noted in the sidebar. Human-centered design focuses on developing deep empathy for end users or those who are impacted by smart tech. At the heart of this process is designing processes and services with people, not at them, through interviews, observation, and developing personas or models of end users to test processes and assumptions.
There are many excellent tools and resources for human-centered design. The essence of these processes is to:

Get input from key stakeholders about what issues are most important to them.
Outline an idea, process or service that delineates responsibilities.
Test, reflect, improve.

Public Benefits Trust used this kind of process to determine what parts of their process should be automated. Ravinder said, “You can’t build an algorithm that powers a public benefit system without getting feedback from the people using it.”16
Conclusion
The very first step that nonprofits must do when embracing smart tech is to put humans first and deeply understand how machines and people can work together. Human-centered principles and approaches are critical for the successful use of smart technologies by nonprofits as we have discussed throughout this chapter.

Human-Centered Design Resources
There are many excellent human-centered design resources that offer step-by-step guidance for implementing a human-centered design process, which is beyond the scope of this book. Many are techniques that any nonprofit can use without hiring an expensive consultant.
If you want to quickly get up to speed, we recommend these resources for additional reading about human-centered design. Many of these organizations also offer training.
Ideo Design Kit: IDEO has been a thought leader in human-centered design methods. The design firm has a nonprofit spinoff (ideo.org) that focuses on methods for nonprofits and social change and includes many free practical resources and examples. In addition, IDEO has also developed specific human-centered design methods for artificial intelligence, including these cards to help understand unintended consequences of smart technologies.

Stanford Design School: In 2018, the D-School (as it is known), launched an initiative called “Radical Access,” a program and resources to develop fluency in emerging technologies as a medium of design for all people. The rationale is that for any use-case of artificial intelligence to serve us, we must be involved in the design. These two techniques are especially useful to designing human-centered algorithms or mapping problems to solutions for artificial intelligence.

Participatory Machine Learning: Defined as the practice of using human-centered design methods to inform the design and iteration for automation projects. Google has recently published a guide that actively involves a diversity of stakeholders—technologists, UXers, policymakers, end users, and citizens—in the process of feedback for the project. The guidebook provides an overview of how human perception drives every facet of machine learning and offers up worksheets on how to get user input.

Agentive Design: When designing chatbots and “intelligent agents for automation,” it must be grounded in human-centered design principles. The concept was developed by Chris Noessel, an interface designer for Watson IBM. Design principles include the focus on easy setup and informative touch points. Also, when the chatbot is working, it’s out of sight. When a user must engage its touch points, they require attention and consideration. Overall, well-designed chatbots and agents require lots of constant attention to manage. Effectively designing chatbots or intelligent agents requires a lot of user testing and feedback to properly for training. The more a chatbot or intelligent agent interacts with humans, the better it learns to respond. It is different than designing other types of technology where the user is actually performing the actions versus the programming code. The metaphor often used is that it is less like designing a hammer and more like designing a butler.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






Zoë Kravitz portrays a Seattle tech worker in “Kimi.” (Warner Bros. Entertainment Photo / Claudette Barius)
Once again, Seattle’s tech scene provides the backdrop for a high-profile movie on HBO Max — but this time, it’s serious.
Oscar-winning film director Steven Soderbergh’s tech-noir thriller, “Kimi,” echoes movies like “Rear Window” and “The Conversation” in a tale that also reflects the mind-wrenching isolation forced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the concerns raised by smart devices that are capable of tracking our every move.
 Zoë Kravitz portrays an employee at a Seattle tech startup that markets a smart speaker and AI voice assistant called Kimi. The startup is gearing up for an IPO that promises a big payoff, but as Kravitz’s character works through a list of audio files that Kimi couldn’t understand, she happens upon a snippet that suggests a crime was committed. Her efforts to get to the truth spark a classic spy chase with some extra tech twists.
It’s a tale far darker than “Superintelligence,” the 2020 romantic comedy starring Melissa McCarthy as a Seattle techie and James Corden as an AI overlord.
Will “Kimi” stir up a debate over AI voice assistants? Does the movie accurately reflect the Seattle vibe? Will it generate as much buzz as Amazon’s Alexa, or will it flop as hard as the Fire Phone? The early indications are mixed: On the Rotten Tomatoes website, for example, the critical consensus is thumbs-up (90%) while the audience score is an emphatic thumbs-down (55%).
To get the verdict from ground zero, we turned to the experts who helped us sort out the fact, fiction and frivolousness in “Superintelligence”: Carissa Schoenick, director of program management and communication at Seattle’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence; and Kurt Schlosser, GeekWire’s go-to guy for coverage of Seattle’s tech culture.
Here’s the slightly spoiler-y breakdown from Schoenick and Schlosser, with some extra spin provided by yours truly:



Smart speaker … dumb plot?
There are strong echoes of Amazon’s Alexa AI assistant and Apple’s Siri in the squat smart speaker that was designed specifically for “Kimi.” (Soderbergh’s ex-wife, Betsy Brantley, provides the placid feminine voice that’s a prerequisite for smart speakers.)
Screenwriter David Koepp was reportedly inspired to write the script for “Kimi” by a murder case in Arkansas in which prosecutors sought access to audio files that may have been recorded by a suspect’s Amazon Echo device. That case was eventually dismissed due to lack of evidence, but it’s specifically invoked in the movie.
In some of the Seattle scenes, we see flashes of billboards touting Kimi 6.0, but Schoenick was surprised by how basic the speaker’s functions seemed to be. “It was all extremely Home Smart Speaker 101,” she said.
At the beginning of the movie, the CEO of the company that makes Kimi claims that his product is superior to Alexa and Siri because actual humans are employed to make sense of the audio that Kimi can’t figure out. (This is the job that Kravitz’s character has.)
Real-world AI companies would probably dispute the CEO’s claim.
“I’ve heard reports of Amazon using content workers to look at misheard commands and help annotate those, to correct the system,” Schoenick said. “That is absolutely par for the course with AI. Having a human in the loop like that is the way you get annotated data to improve your models.”
Director Steven Soderbergh looks over Zoë Kravitz’s shoulder during the filming of “Kimi.” (Warner Bros. Entertainment Photo / Claudette Barius)  
An ethical company would scrub the audio files to ensure the users’ anonymity. But because this is a movie, the company behind Kimi isn’t bound by real-world rules. “They had a nice, really slick little app for how to spy on their users,” Schoenick said.
The same goes for the other intrusive surveillance methods shown in “Kimi,” including triangulating on cellphone signals and collecting retinal scans of employees without their informed consent. 
“It’s a good example of how a tech company could have abused personal data rights by gathering data and hiding that language in their terms and conditions, because the point that nobody reads those is true,” Schoenick said. “That is where regulating the application of AI can be important.”
In contrast to many other tech thrillers, the AI isn’t the bad guy. Instead, the plot relies on old-fashioned human villains who aren’t always as smart as the devices they wield. Without getting too heavily into plot spoilers, Schoenick said the movie’s climactic confrontation strained plausibility.
“No one was doing the thing that they would really do in real life in this situation,” Schoenick said. “Including the bad guys. They seemed very bad at their job.”
Seattle shines … maybe too much?
One of the least plausible aspects of “Kimi” has to do with the idea that Kravitz’s character could actually afford the apartment where most of the action takes place.
“She’s a glorified content moderator,” Schoenick said. “This is a job that crowdsourced folks would be doing in the real world  — you know, people in content moderation farms. It wouldn’t support the lifestyle of a single person in a huge loft apartment.”
The Kimi-equipped apartment serves as a fortress for the audio interpreter, whose fear of public places arose after a traumatic experience and was reinforced by COVID-related social distancing. It’s in a neighborhood that looks like Capitol Hill, Pioneer Square or Belltown in Seattle, but is actually in Los Angeles.
Schlosser agreed that the apartment seemed a bit too upscale for the typical Seattle techie, but he said Kravitz’s blue-haired, hoodie-wearing character was in tune with the Pacific Northwest vibe.
“She looked perfectly Seattle to me,” he said. “She had a young and fun, techie look about her, and her apartment was decorated with the requisite music posters and stuff like that.”
There are plenty of exterior scenes showing off the Emerald City — including views of Westlake Park, the Helix Pedestrian Bridge and the city’s light-rail stations. There’s even a homeless protest that brought hundreds of extras to downtown Seattle during last year’s filming.

Seattle looks good in the movie. Maybe a little too good, Schlosser said. The way he sees it, a tech-noir thriller like “Kimi” could have taken better advantage of the Pacific Northwest’s trademark gloom. 
“The sunshine was a little offputting,” he said.
But Schlosser said the mere fact that AI-centric movies like “Superintelligence” and “Kimi” are set in Seattle says something about the city’s status as a tech capital.
“I just think it’s cool in regard to the fact that now moviemakers are leapfrogging Silicon Valley and picturing Seattle as the setting for anything happening in tech — whether it’s badly portrayed, weirdly portrayed, funny, exciting or beautiful to look at,” he said. “Seattle is on the moviemaking minds of these guys who are saying, ‘Where is tech centered?'”
Final grades
AI2’s Carissa Schoenick: “The AI voice assistant Kimi takes a backseat to the psychology and action of the storyline. Kimi isn’t invoked in any surprising ways that aren’t already possible with today’s smart speakers – instead, the tech is a plot device to motivate the agoraphobic main character to face her fears. The notion that humans would be employed to review and correct misheard voice commands is not unrealistic; in fact, human-annotated data is fundamental in developing and improving AI algorithms, and companies like Amazon do this very type of voice command auditing for speech recognition technology. The movie has a slow start and really uneven character development with a bit of an eye-rolling conclusion, but if you’re looking for something short and a little weird, it’s a pretty average watch. Grade: C for technology, and C-minus for watchability.”
Geek Life guru Kurt Schlosser: “I’ve been living through COVID and forced isolation for two years. I didn’t need a movie to trap me inside all of that for two more hours – especially with a smart speaker as my only friend. I want to escape! When ‘Kimi’ does get outside, it’s into a Seattle that is too sunny for a film that is so psychologically gloomy. Grade: C-minus.“
Science geek Alan Boyle: “Maybe ‘Kimi’ doesn’t quite measure up to ‘Rear Window,’ but I think anyone who’s a fan of that claustrophobic film genre (which also includes ‘The Woman in the Window’ from last year and a newly released parody, ‘The Woman in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window’) will want to check this out. The same goes for folks who get into the issues raised by digital surveillance, or who just want to see if they recognize the Seattle scenery. ‘Kimi’ is the first movie I’ve seen that weaves the COVID-19 pandemic into its plot, and the first movie since ‘Her’ to give a central role to an AI voice assistant. Grade: B.”

Azerbaijan to develop national artificial intelligence strategy


 11 February 2022 18:00 (UTC+04:00)







By Ayya Lmahamad
Nowadays, practically everything around us that comes from the
realm of technology appears to have some aspect of artificial
intelligence (AI).
Artificial intelligence, in computer terminology, is the
programming and development of computers and systems capable of
utilising and processing information in a way analogous to human
activity. In other terms, it is a technology that allows robots to
accomplish jobs that would ordinarily need human-like
reasoning.
Artificial intelligence offers a wide range of potential
applications, including transportation, healthcare, education,
agriculture, cybersecurity, and so on. It has the potential to
increase worker productivity, stimulate economic growth, and
improve the lives of millions of people.
Azerbaijan, like many other countries, is interested in
introducing artificial intelligence into public management.
National strategy for AI
Azerbaijan’s Economy Ministry has recently reported that a
national plan for artificial intelligence will be established.
The work done in this area was discussed at the inaugural
meeting of the working group on Fourth Industrial Revolution
technologies.
Presentations on IoT, Big Data, and its analysis and processing
were also included in the program.
It should be mentioned that over 60 nations worldwide have
national plans, programs, and initiatives in the field of
artificial intelligence, with only 40 countries developing national
strategies that have been authorized as a distinct document.
Azerbaijan places a high value on this set of technologies.
Currently, over 15 businesses in the country provide consultancy
services and do research in several sectors of artificial
intelligence.
A symposium on artificial intelligence in digital governance was
conducted online in April 2021. The three-day conference was
conducted by the E-GOV Development Center (EGDC) of the State
Agency for Public Service and Social Innovations and featured 58
speakers from 22 nations. The worldwide conference was held in
remembrance of late world-renowned scientist Lotfi Zadeh.
AI application in South Caucasus
Azerbaijan ranks 65th in the Artificial Intelligence application
index, according to Oxford Insights.
Azerbaijan has led the South Caucasus in the use of artificial
intelligence for several years in a row.
In the list, Georgia ranks 72nd and Armenia 77th. In terms of
artificial intelligence application, Turkey ranks 67th, Iran 75th
and Russia 33rd.
The top five nations for artificial intelligence application are
the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, Germany, and
Sweden.
One of the facts of the current period is the development of new
technologies throughout the world, as well as the employment of
artificial intelligence and robots in many aspects of social
life.

								JAIC piloting artificial intelligence education for DOD							

								New education pilots from the JAIC are seeing large demand from across the DOD, its policy head said.

The Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center recently launched new AI education pilots for thousands of DOD employees that range from executive education for general officers to in-depth coding bootcamps.
The most recent cohort of participants started taking an “AI 101” course in early February through a partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while another recently entered an AI coding bootcamp. The range of educational offerings from the AI-accelerator is designed to eventually be transitioned to other DOD institutions for tens or even hundreds of thousands of people to learn about AI, Greg Allen, the JAIC’s head of policy and strategy, told FedScoop.
“We are running training pilots to really test,” Allen said. “We partner with the broader department of defense … to help them deliver education materiel at scale.”
Allen added that “ultimately there is going to be hundreds of thousands of folks” getting some form of AI training, out of the DOD’s nearly 3 million employees and service members.

The work stems from a congressional mandate for the JAIC to develop an AI workforce and education strategy in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act. The JAIC is now implementing that strategy through educational pilots, Allen said.
In that strategy, the JAIC identified six archetypes of AI learner: Lead AI, Drive AI, Create AI, Employ AI, Facilitate AI and Embed AI. Each type of DOD employee needs a different level of detail on AI, so the JAIC is leaning on different platforms to teach them.
For general and flag officers at the highest ranks of the military, Lead AI is an in-person seminar on the basics of what AI can do and how it will impact the capabilities they oversee. On the other end of the spectrum is Create AI, a group of coders that will be developing machine learning models for the military and need specialized training in developing machine learning models.
One of the adjustments the JAIC has made to its offerings for the Create AI category is a new coding bootcamp on the Python coding language that is often used to develop AI.
“These are folks who actually need all the skills to meet their current and future operational needs,” Allen said.

By 2023 the JAIC hopes to have all these lesson plans transitioned to other organizations, like the Defense Acquisition University or the Air Force’s Digital University.
“The No. 1 thing that brings the most joy to us is when we hear back from past participants … they put what they learned to practice in their jobs,” Allen said.

AdChoicesADVERTISINGPomerleau, based in Quebec, completes work through multiple  delivery systems ranging from design-build to lump sum, employs 2,000 and claims  revenue of about $1 billion. The project will apply powerful AI algorithms and  neural networks to the problem of speeding up, de-risking and improving the estimating  processes that set any construction project on a path towards either success  or failure.The initiative announced today is a second phase of Zetane  and Pomerleau’s collaboration. Zetane already successfully completed an initial  phase last year, designed to deliver an AI methodology that can pull important information  from unstructured documents submitted during a request for proposals (RFP).  Prior to that project, Pomerleau engaged in a Call for Innovation, soliciting  small technology companies to engage work with them on an AI-driven approach to  estimating. Thirty companies participated, five were retained for more  substantive proposals and Zetane was ultimately selected. After selection, Zetane  delivered a four-month proof of concept for its approach to intelligent  estimating functionality. The more thorough buildout of this proof of concept  is what is ultimately announced today.“The Initial  problem we addressed that evolved into this project had to do with  preconstruction and estimating and the fact that contractors are getting all of  these complex requests for bids,” Zetane CEO Guillaume Herve’ told ForConstructionPros  in a phone interview in the days before the announcement. “The project was focused on  buildings rather than civil engineering. The problem statement was that they always  get the same massive request for proposal, specifications that are written and  in drawings, and have to throw a number of estimators at it to extract the most  relevant data and get the risk profile and other things that allow you to bid  on the contract.”The labor-intensive nature of the estimating process and the  risk that comes from the fact that estimators can still miss critical elements  were both problems the technology project was designed to address.“It is a very manual process, even if you are using digital  tools currently used in construction and they were using a couple,” Herve’  said. “There is no re-use of data. You would submit a bid and you would not  learn anything from it or from the hundreds of other estimates you have  completed.  And then there is no  continuity between estimating and the project. So what you did in estimating  kind of got restarted—if you did win the job it was a reset. There was no  benefit from all the work you did in preconstruction on the execution phase of  the project. This is the problem addressed in the proof of concept and that is  what we will now be doing at scale.”The technology Zetane and Pomerleau are working towards can  take historical information and use it to inform estimates going forward. This  includes not just looking at past estimates, but at change orders on the  ensuing projects to identify risks inherent in the design, the project type,  the specification or even the customer organization.“They have massive amounts of data against the original bid  that you had, including data on change orders,” Herve’ said. “There are ways  today in AI to retroactively look at that and tell us ‘well, you can expect  these areas to be changed.’ In construction 20 percent of the project probably  drives 80 percent of the cost and the risk. Knowing which 20 percent that is  gives you a proactive way to assess risk, cost, or for the contractor, success  or failure.”Structured Data MandatoryThe current phase of the project will be developed  specifically for Pomerleau, but following that according to Herve’ it will be  commercialized, likely as a digital service offered within estimating software brought  to market by others. What this means is that standardization becomes important  both internal to a given contracting organization and to an extent across the  industry.This consistency must extend to data held in tables and as  text, as well as images and drawings. Design documents may vary, depending on  subindustry and source, ranging in quality and sophistication from building information  modelling (BIM) structed data files to portable document format (PDF) images.“On this project we had to address the problem of How to  extract data and important specs from documents,” Herve’ said. “That was easy.  The hard part was the drawings—there is more richness and risk in large scale  construction drawings than in text. In this project, we are creating the tool  that allows automatic export of information from drawings that are then  provided as input to an estimating tool.”The current phase of the project will involve arriving at a unifying  format the resulting AI application will use to teach the algorithm so it can  create projections that lead to faster, more accurate and less risk-intensive  estimates and bid documents. The AI application will be able to identify and  provide take-offs for graphical elements in a drawing that represent wiring, size  of a room, lighting, ductwork and other structural and mechanical elements.Contractors Must ModernizeHerve' stressed that as more AI-enabled applications make  their way to market, contractors should make sure their data house is in order  so they can take advantage of emerging technology.“The big message for us now is that the massive amount of  data that has always been there can now be useful because machine learning,  deep learning and AI allow you to get value out of that data to do a better job  on estimating and projecting costs and risks in proposals,” he said. “Those  algorithms did not exist five years ago. The tech was just not there. AI has  been around for a long time, but in categories like statistics and business  intelligence. What has changed is the availability of machine learning and deep  learning which can extract value from the data to arrive at a better end point.”   The end result of the project announced today will be a web  service accessible to Pomerleau estimators as a guide-on-the-side during  estimating and bidding processes. That same solution will be adapted for broad  market use, according to Herve', and could come to market either as its own  estimation software solution but more likely as a licensed or whitelabeled  feature within estimating softwares already broadly used in the construction  market.But much of the construction industry may not be prepared.“AI is now ready to revolutionize the preconstruction  process,” Herve’ said. “Despite incremental innovation, the industry has lagged  in the introduction of new technology across the supply chain. Don’t let the  disparate format of data formats you currently have keep you out of the AI  conversation. If you’re not doing it, your competitors are.”  BOTTOM LINE: The Zetane-Pomerleau project is promising not  only because it attacks one of the most critical and challenging elements of  construction, and an element that can get a project off on a positive or  negative trajectory. The involvement of a Pomerleau as a stakeholder also  ensures the application that results from this project will be laser-focused on  immediate industry needs of large and complex contracting organizationsFacebook IconLinkedIn IconTwitter X iconRelatedQ3 Construction Technology UpdatesSeptember 30, 2022How Technology Can Change The Future of Skilled TradesJuly 6, 20223 Cool Construction Estimating Software TrendsApril 13, 2022Latest in Construction TechnologyInside the R&D at Milwaukee ToolJuly 15, 2024Point of Rental Elite Releases Work Orders for POR OneJuly 18, 2024Hitachi Unveils Solution Linkage CONNECT Fleet Management SystemJuly 17, 2024Caterpillar Launches Sensor to Monitor Undercarriage DamageJuly 17, 2024RecommendedConstruction TechnologyHow AI, Automation, and Tech Are Shaping Asphalt IndustryThe machines that we use to pave, mill, and compact are getting smarter at an increasingly fast pace.

Study on the use of artificial intelligence in refrigeration plants





Details 



15 February 2022 





  

International. A group of Italian researchers presented a review of the performance of 19 refrigeration plants in which artificial intelligence algorithms were implemented.
Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANN), and deep learning (DL), which are subfields of AI, can generate significant benefits in terms of operation and maintenance of refrigeration and air conditioning systems.
Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for predictive maintenance and improvement of machine operations is one of the most studied AI applications in these fields. As predictable failures, the authors give examples of refrigerant charge defects, in terms of overload or leakage/insufficient load, and heat exchanger failures in terms of fouling, secondary fluid mass flow, and reduced heat transfer.
Using AI algorithms instead of physics-based ones can be interesting if a reduced calculation time is required and if the cumulative operational effects over time are considered. FDD enables better scheduling of maintenance operations to avoid serious failures and limit costs related to minor failures.

AI is also being widely used for predicting the energy performance of refrigeration equipment. Energy performance prediction is useful for establishing the optimal control strategy and maximizing energy savings. For example, predicting the COP of a geothermal heat pump with an ANN algorithm using soil temperature and air temperature of the inlet and outlet condenser as input variables resulted in an error of only 1% between the measured and predicted COP.
Predictive control is an important application of AI. Thanks to their simplicity and reduced computing time, ANN algorithms can be implemented in the main control boards of operating systems in real time. These novel control systems can push the boundaries of widely used thermostatic and PID controls by providing a shorter response time during transient operation, achieving significant energy savings.
As an example, the authors present the modeling of a 4-cooler plant with a two-level algorithm to minimize operating costs. At the first level, a genetic algorithm is used to predict the on/off state of the cooler based on the cooling charge. At the second level, particle swarm optimization is used to minimize system energy consumption using cooling capacity, water temperature difference, and enthalpy as main inputs. During two days of operation, energy savings of 14% were achieved; In addition, thanks to a high calculation rate, it is possible to implement this algorithm to control the entire plant in real time.
On the other hand, little work has been done on the prediction of frost formation and on the techniques of optimizing thaw control, which shows that this area of research is still to be explored.
