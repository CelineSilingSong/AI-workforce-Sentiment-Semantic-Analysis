The substitutive effect
In the future, machines will replace humans in jobs. This is not controversial: it’s what machines have done since well before the start of the industrial revolution. Petrol pump attendants were replaced by automated pumps, secretaries were replaced by Microsoft Office. This is what economists call the substitutive effect of automation: humans are substituted in jobs by machines.


The complementary effect
From time to time, fears have been expressed that humans would run out of jobs entirely. I first wrote about this concern back in 1980, and like many other people at the time, I under-estimated the resilience of what economists call the complementary effect of automation. To simplify a little, this means that when a human job is automated, the amount of wealth generated in the economy increases. That increases demand, which in turn increases employment. The new jobs that are created are done by humans, because machines can not yet do everything that we can do for money.

The complementary effect probably won’t last forever. The amount of compute power you can buy for $1,000 continues to increase exponentially: Moore’s Law is evolving, not stopping. This means that in a decade, the machines we have will be 100 times as powerful as the ones we have today. In two decades the multiple will be 8,000, and in three decades, 1,000,000. There is no straight-line correlation between compute power and the ability of AI to carry out human tasks, but the two do travel together. People who airily dismiss fears about medium-term technological unemployment are committing the Reverse Luddite Fallacy. They are making four mistakes.

PROMOTED
The Reverse Luddite Fallacy
First, they forget that we have seen technological unemployment before. In 1915 there were 22 million horses working in America, pulling vehicles and working on farms. The horse population of America today is two million. That is severe technological unemployment.

Second, they argue that because automation has not caused technological unemployment in the past, it will not do so in the future. The past is often a good guide to the future, but it is far from perfect: if it was, we would not be able to fly.

Third and fourth, they are thinking too short-term, and they are not taking into account the astonishing power of exponential growth. Machines will not be able to do everything humans can do for money in the next year, nor in the next decade. It is also true that technologies are not implemented overnight. It takes time for companies to figure out how to use them. But three decades from now, when our machines are 1,000,000 times more capable than they are today, they will probably be cheaper, faster, and better at almost everything that humans can do for money.

Creativity and consciousness will keep us employed?
Some people reply that we will endlessly create jobs which machines are unable to do, either because they are not creative, or because they are not conscious, and therefore have no empathy. These are likely to prove vain hopes: AI systems are creative already, and they can decode human emotions very effectively. They can also provide the same appearance of empathy that humans often do at work.

If technological unemployment is coming, we must transition to a very different type of economy. I call the transition the “economic singularity”, using a term from physics which was first applied to human affairs by computer pioneer John von Neumann. Back in the 1950s, he said we were “approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.”
How should policy makers respond to the challenges presented by the economic singularity? Let’s look at a few options.
Should we try to protect jobs?
In America, some truckers’ groups want to ban the introduction of self-driving lorries. Not unreasonably, they argue that the technology will put millions of them out of work, with serious knock-on effects for their families and their communities. This could be an effective strategy if they were not in a competitive market: train drivers unions in the UK have prevented efficiency measures for years. But unlike trains, trucking is a competitive market. And even if the federal government were to wave a magic wand and give the truckers their wish, the US economy would become less competitive internationally. Protecting jobs stifles competition, kills innovation, and makes everyone poorer.
Should we tax robots?
Similarly, taxing robots in order to fend off or mitigate technological unemployment would stifle both innovation and competitiveness. It also suffers from conceptual difficulties. Machines will rarely replace humans on a one-for-one basis, and most of the “robots” automating jobs in the coming years will be software, not androids. Humans will disappear from many call centres, for instance, and be replaced by AI systems running on banks of servers in big buildings with powerful air conditioning. Does the government tax one entity – namely the AI system - or each individual server? Or does it estimate the number of humans who have been laid off by the system and calculate the tax based on that?
If we are going to tax machines which automate jobs away, do we start with tractors and weaving machines? Or do we just tax new instances of replacement? Imagine two firms making the same product. One has been going for a few years, and recently replaced half its staff with machines. The other is a startup, and used machines from the outset. The former would be hit by a tax that the latter would escape. Not only is that patently unjust, it would simply mean the former would close, and the tax base would disappear anyway.
Universal Basic Income?
There are a number of problems with introducing UBI in the types of economy that exist today, which is why it has never been done, except in limited, temporary trials. The biggest problem is the little word in the middle: basic. Without spending implausible amounts, the best that UBI can do is to make its recipients poor. That is much better than being dead, if that were the alternative, but it is nowhere near good enough. As the noted economist John Kay said, “either the basic income is impossibly low, or the expenditure on it is impossibly high.”
Abundance 
Despite its failings, the proponents of UBI have hit upon a vital insight: in a post-jobs world, there are going to have to be substantial transfers of income and / or wealth from the minority who are still in paid employment, and from the owners of major assets. The problem is that if the cost of a good life remains high, then these transfers will be onerous, and therefore avoided. Wealthy people will move to jurisdictions which don’t enforce the taxes, or they will simply cease to work at all.
The solution is not to persecute the wealthy, but to reduce the cost of a good life. This means developing the economy of abundance, in which the prices of all the goods and services that you need for a very good standard of living are very low. Then the transfers from the wealthy need not be onerous – and avoided.
This does sound crazy when you first hear it, but if you think about the music industry, you can see how it could happen. Twenty years ago, not even a rich person could listen to any piece of music which took their fancy. Now it costs $10 a month, thanks to Spotify and similar services. Music, of course, is now digital, so it is dematerialised and non-rivalrous, as economists say. But more and more of what we value these days is digital, and this trend will continue. In another decade or so, many of us will probably spend hours at a time in virtual realities.
Fully Automated Luxury Capitalism
What form of economic and political governance will best suit this post-jobs world? Some have argued for a version of communism, called fully automated luxury communism. While this approach deserves credit for facing up to the exponential future, it overlooks two important facts. First, it is no coincidence that wherever communism has been tried, it has degenerated into some of the worst regimes the world has ever seen. Communism grants absolute power to a ruling elite, and we all know what absolute power does to people.
The other fact is the astonishing power of markets. Markets incentivise people and firms to provide goods and services that are genuinely valued, and to do it efficiently. Allied with technology, free markets (with appropriate welfare safety nets, and with regulation to ensure that markets are not suborned) have made this the best time ever to be a human. Technology provides potential solutions to problems, and markets provide the incentive for people to develop and invest in those solutions. This is how China has gone from backwater to superpower in a single generation.
Even in the abundance economy, it will be a very long time before we have the technology to build the matter replicators found on Star Trek’s USS Enterprise, so goods and services will impose a residual cost. And as long as we are human, we will also face shortages of things like attention, artisanal goods, and works of art. Markets are the best system we know of for resource allocation, so to start with at least, the optimal system for the economy of abundance is likely to be a form of capitalism: let’s call it “fully automated luxury capitalism”.
There's still money to be made
In fully automated luxury capitalism, people would continue to trade and innovate. Fortunes (and also more modest wealth) would continue to be made by creating art, artisanal goods, and other forms of intellectual property. Even when AIs can create objects more beautiful than the ablest human craft worker, there could well be a premium attached to items which are “made by hand”. Judiciously trading scarce assets such as beach-front properties, and original Aston Martin DB5s could remain another source of wealth and income.
But not everyone will be able to or inclined to participate in this reduced commercial world. The three central insights underpinning the idea of fully automated luxury capitalism are (1) that most humans will not have jobs, (2) that everybody must be wealthy – or at least comfortable rather than poor, and (3) that the taxes levied on wealthy people people and organisations must be affordable. The only way to achieve this is to drive prices down – to evolve the economy of abundance.
If we can achieve the economy of abundance, then we should be thankful that humans are not condemned to do jobs forever, because although some people love their jobs, plenty of research shows that most people don’t. Many people will take time to adjust, and some will need help, but a post-jobs world could be one in which humans do whatever we want to. We could have a second Renaissance. The Reverse Luddite Fallacists are not only probably wrong – they are also profoundly pessimistic.
Clothify and Constructify
Is the economy of abundance possible? Obviously, not everything is digital, like music. Can we reduce the cost of non-digital goods and services too, like housing and clothes? Can we create their Spotify equivalents, “Constructify” and “Clothify”?
We can, if we do three things. First, we must take the expensive humans out of the production process for all goods and services. That is exactly what automation does, so this is a case where the problem is also part of the cure.
Second, we must make energy very cheap. The cost of solar cells is falling fast, and battery technology is improving. Many observers think that within 20 or 30 years, electricity could not only be much cheaper to generate, store and transmit than the oil and gas we get by digging up dead dinosaurs – it could be almost too cheap to meter. This would also reduce CO2 emissions much faster than most people today think possible.
Third, we must use AI to make all production processes as efficient as possible, requiring minimal material inputs.
""Automate and redeploy""
Andrew McAfee pointed out in his recent book “More From Less” that we are already on this path, but there is much further to go. We should therefore not hold automation back; instead we should accelerate it. The mantra for companies and for countries should be: “automate and redeploy, rinse and repeat”. Companies which automate rapidly will prosper, but the outstanding ones will be those which also genuinely value their people: companies where people actively seek to work out how to automate their tasks, in the knowledge that they will be rewarded both with pay and with more interesting work in the future.
The Churn
For a decade or three before technological unemployment arrives, AI-driven automation will have an increasingly disruptive effect on the job market: the Churn. People will lose their jobs to machines, and they will have to be redeployed within companies, between companies, and between industries. With increasing frequency. Workers will have to learn how to work with machines: AI won’t replace humans in all jobs, but increasingly, humans who can work with AI will replace those who cannot. We cannot yet say what jobs people will be re-trained to do; no doubt some of them will surprise us.
This process will be disturbing and frightening for many of us. Governments will need to support their people through the Churn with enhanced welfare programmes and other methods of economic support. The experience of massive government intervention during the corona virus crisis should teach us valuable lessons about what works and what doesn’t.
Education will become ""vacational"", not ""vocational""
During the period of Churn, we will need to re-train ourselves more and more frequently, and do it faster each time. Education and training are notoriously hard industries to reform. Here again, AI will provide solutions as well as raising the challenge in the first place. Education and training will become personalised, as we all acquire learning assistants - digital coaches which know better than we do (and better than any human teacher could do) what we already know, what we need to learn next, and how to optimise that learning process. For many years, these assistants will work alongside human teachers rather than replacing them. If we manage the transition smoothly, then by the time the replacement happens, we will hardly notice, and we won’t object.
Once we arrive at the economy of abundance, some people will continue to re-train for economic activity, but for most of us, educational will become vacational, not vocational. Which is what many of us wanted it to be all along.
Plan or panic
To survive the economic singularity, we need to identify the optimal outcome in a largely post-jobs economy. If it is indeed the economy of abundance, and fully automated luxury capitalism, then we need to build a consensus about that, and a plan for how to get there without panic. Panic at the thought of racing toward technological unemployment without a plan could be almost as bad as the fact itself. But if we can manage the transition through the economic singularity successfully, the outcome will be wonderful.

In Seinajoki, Finland, metal company  Prima Power  is trialing two of the EU’s  Factory2Fit project  solutions. This €4m study explores new ways for people and machines to work together. Dr Eija Kaasinen from  technical research centre VTT  says the aim is to put people at the centre and to enable them to participate in designing their own work environment.\xa0 The fourth industrial revolution Globally, automation and robotics are transforming manufacturing as part of the fourth industrial revolution. But this doesn\'t mean the human element is removed from work. ""Of course there are manual elements - but the work is changing towards knowledge work,"" explains Kaasinen. ""It\'s more like working with the virtual counterparts of the physical things in the physical world."" A Pre-training Solution, for example, uses 3D models and cloud-based tutorials, while a so-called Knowledge Sharing solution makes the most of all the experience a worker gathers while running complex machinery, especially when something goes wrong, as Prima Power\'s Mariia Kreposna explains. ""So here the operator can open the additional dialogue box to get extra information about the situation. This is done by sharing the additional text, description, pictures or videos so the idea is in the future whenever the alarm with the same code happens, the operator will be able to learn not only the standard remedies but also other possible reasons and how to prevent this alarm happening in the future."" ""Sleep was really important for my work performance"" At the  Elekmerk  factory in Keuruu, Finland, workers have tested the Worker Feedback Dashboard - a biometric monitoring tool - like a fitbit - and an app. It charts someone\'s work achievements and their well being - such as sleep and steps taken per day - and shows how the two can be linked. ""When we interviewed factory workers during the project we heard that often they had negative feedback when something is not going well,"" says VTT\'s Päivi Heikkilä.. ""So we wanted to develop an application that would also give you positive feedback of the fluency of your work and your accomplishments, so feedback of the things that are going well."" Ville Vuarola was one of five workers who wore the wristband for the three-month pilot scheme. He was happy to take part and says he was surprised at how a good night\'s sleep had a positive impact on his job. ""I was surprised to see how sleeping well influenced my work performance. Together with leisure activities, sleep was really important for my general performance at work,"" he says. ""We always consider the ethics"" Of all the  Factory2Fit  solutions, this was the one that proved the most controversial with fears expressed over the possible misuse of workers\' data. But Päivi Heikkilä says these concerns are unfounded. ""When we are developing these kind of solutions we always consider the ethics,"" she says, ""and I want to stress and highlight that this should always be voluntary."" The data gathered is kept on a separate server, not in the factory system. Researchers expect at least some of their Factory2Fit solutions to be commercially available by the end of next year.\xa0 ', 'dateCreated': '2020-06-02 16:06:07 +02:00', 'dateModified': '2020-06-15 18:55:05 +02:00', 'datePublished': '2020-06-15 18:50:58 +02:00', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/71/86/52/1440x810_cmsv2_701d6a35-a640-51af-899f-f25165e090a5-4718652.jpg', 'width': '1440px', 'height': '810px', 'caption': 'Futuris looks at how the relationship between man and machine in modern manufacturing is evolving through the adoption of Artificial Intelligence and automation.', 'thumbnail': 'https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/71/86/52/385x202_cmsv2_701d6a35-a640-51af-899f-f25165e090a5-4718652.jpg', 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'euronews', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/website/images/euronews-logo-main-blue-403x60.png'}}, 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Julian GOMEZ', 'url': 'gomez', 'sameAs': 'https://twitter.com/euronews'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Euronews', 'legalName': 'Euronews', 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/website/images/euronews-logo-main-blue-403x60.png', 'width': '403px', 'height': '60px'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/euronews', 'https://twitter.com/euronews', 'https://flipboard.com/@euronews', 'https://www.instagram.com/euronews.tv/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/euronews']}, 'speakable': {'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xPath': ['/html/head/title', ""/html/head/meta[@name='description']/@content""], 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/next/2020/06/15/industrial-revolution-4-0-how-man-and-machine-are-increasingly-working-as-one'}}, {'@type': 'WebSite', 'name': 'Euronews.com', 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/', 'potentialAction': {'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://www.euronews.com/search?query={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/euronews', 'https://twitter.com/euronews', 'https://flipboard.com/@euronews', 'https://www.instagram.com/euronews.tv/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/euronews']}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When company leaders talk about democratizing artificial intelligence (AI), it’s easy to imagine what they have in mind. The more people with access to the raw materials of the knowledge, tools, and data required to build an AI system, the more innovations are bound to emerge. Efficiency improves and engagement increases. Faced with a shortage of technical talent? Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have all released premade drag-and-drop or no-code AI tools that allow people to integrate AI into applications without needing to know how to build machine learning (ML) models.

What is fair when it comes to AI bias?
by Anand Rao and Ilana Golbin


But as companies move toward democratization, a cautionary tale is emerging. Even the most sophisticated AI systems, designed by highly qualified engineers, can fall victim to bias and can be difficult to explain. An AI system that was built by someone without proper training or that is operated without appropriate controls could create something outright dangerous, introducing discrimination or serious errors. Worse, the problems might not become evident until after a system has been implemented, leaving companies scrambling to reassure stakeholders, undo the damage, and fix the tech.
This is not to say that the democratization of AI is valueless. Making these new technologies more accessible and affordable expands the possibilities of what businesses and governments can accomplish and fuels competition. For example, data sets, models, and research related to the fight against the novel coronavirus have been open source, enabling a large global community to collaborate. The key for company leaders is to avoid getting carried away by the hype and instead focus on clearly identifying exactly what they are going to democratize (will it be something simple, such as data visualization, or something complex, such as model development?), who the users will be, and how their organization can both maximize the benefits and manage the risks with proper training and governance.
The technology spectrum
The technology vendors releasing AI and ML products need to start by determining which part or parts of the value chain their tool or platform will be democratizing. Here, it is helpful to think of a spectrum across which the tools and models grow more sophisticated and result in greater value generation.
At one end of the spectrum is data, and the ingestion of data into data warehouses and data lakes. AI systems, and in particular ML, run on large volumes of structured and unstructured data — it is the material from which organizations can generate insights, decisions, and outcomes. In its raw form, it is easy to democratize, enabling people to perform basic analyses. Already, a number of technology providers have created data explorers to help users search and visualize openly available data sets.
Next along the spectrum come the algorithms into which the data is fed. Here the value and complexity increase, as the data is put to work. At this point, democratization is still relatively easy to achieve, and algorithms are widely accessible; open source code repositories such as GitHub (purchased by Microsoft in 2018) have been growing significantly over the past decade. But understanding algorithms requires a basic grasp of computer science and a mathematics or statistics background.
As we continue to move along the spectrum to storage and computing platforms, the complexity increases. During the past five years, the technology platform for AI has moved to the cloud with three major AI/ML providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine. This has made central processing units and graphics processing units — essential for training reasonably large deep learning models — accessible to end-users on a pay-as-you-go basis, substantially reducing the barrier to entry. However, whereas algorithms are hardware agnostic (for example, they typically can run on any hardware or cloud platform), the cloud storage and computing platforms require users to have specific training and to be certified by the technology vendors.

Now we come to model development. Models solve specific problems: Some become recommendation engines, some become facial recognition systems, and so on. Here we are seeing democratization with automated machine learning (AutoML) platforms and tools. For example, automating the ability to ingest a variety of data formats — structured, semi-structured, and unstructured — and to run a number of algorithms on the same data set and select the best ensemble of algorithms is making the model development process more accessible and faster. But if the users are not appropriately trained, the potential is high for building bias into the model, being unable to explain the results of the model, and even making wrong decisions.
Finally, at the far end of the spectrum, we are in the early stages of creating a marketplace for data, algorithms, and models. A marketplace is also emerging for problems and talent that can solve these problems. Kaggle, created in 2010 and acquired by Google in 2017, is one of the best-known examples of a data science or AI marketplace. Its data science challenges (with significant prize money) allow people anywhere in the world to compete and demonstrate their skills. Yet as we curate data, algorithms, and models in these marketplaces, the risk of misinterpreting them and applying them in the wrong context increases significantly. The danger of systemic misuse of models will rise.
Know your users
Designing an AI system requires extensive technical know-how and a firm grasp of data science. Just as you would want to be sure a surgeon was qualified, trained, and experienced in the operating room before engaging in important surgery, you should ensure that people with solid tech chops, an understanding of the key components of an AI system, and a commitment to responsible AI are designing, testing, and maintaining the AI system.
Vendors often make sweeping statements, saying they have democratized data ingestion, data cleansing, and data mining by creating drag-and-drop tools. Or they claim that they have democratized complex statistical and computational model development by automating the entire machine learning or data science process. But who is accessing these tools and models? Have those users been appropriately trained — not just in the tool, but also in the underlying concepts?
In one example, a business user at an organization that had made drag-and-drop tools widely available built a machine learning model without setting aside a sample of the data for validation and testing. Instead, the training data was assumed to be representative of the operational data. Because the model was overfit to this training data, if it had been deployed across the organization it would have produced highly inaccurate results — leading to significant financial losses. 
The beneficiaries of AI democratization exist in three broad categories: casual users, power users, and specialist developers. Casual users and specialist developers are at opposite extremes, and power users somewhere in between; power users are more knowledgeable and well-trained than casual users, but are not working at an expert level. Business users are typically casual users; they have received extensive training neither in the statistical and mathematical concepts underlying the models nor in the specific processes required to build models. Specialist developers or data scientists generally have strong qualifications and the appropriate certifications.
Companies need to determine which of these three categories they are targeting with various initiatives. For example, when we democratize data visualization, we are enabling all three types of users to quickly create a variety of visualizations with little or no programming — which is a low-risk proposition. However, when we say we are democratizing model development, are we doing it for just specialist data scientists, to enable them to run different algorithms, evaluate them, and choose the right ensemble of models? Or are we attempting to democratize it for casual and power users as well? If the latter, extreme caution is required.
Training and governance
Organizations that have defined what they want to democratize and who will be using the tools can then determine the how — that is, how to democratize AI while avoiding misuse, abuse, bias, and other problems. There are five areas in which leaders need to take action.
1. Training. Lack of adequate training in AI development and implementation could be calamitous — especially when it comes to systems that deal with people’s health or financial well-being. For example, if casual or untrained users don’t understand the importance of splitting data into buckets for training, validation, and testing, they could easily end up with AI that produces inaccurate or unintended results (as in the example above). If we want to move from just providing access to stimulating the safe use of these AI tools, training the casual or power users with the appropriate foundations of data science is critical.
2. Data governance. Company leaders need to establish clarity on the ownership and control of data that is fed into AI-powered platforms, and on how rights relate to the insights generated. When data is collected for a specific AI/ML program, then used for other applications (which can be the case with open source data lakes), it’s easy to lose visibility into the data’s origins, the purpose of the data collection, how the data has been modified, and how it is or isn’t being safeguarded. “Shadow AI” — AI created using data not governed by teams within an organization whose job is to ensure data integrity — is also a concern. To minimize risk, AI/ML models should be built using data that is monitored, secured, and understood.
3. Model governance. Organizations often have data governance as part of corporate compliance activity, but few are monitoring the other elements involved in an AI system as closely as they should. Controls need to be in place to ensure that the models are being developed with the appropriate success or validation metrics (a balance of accuracy, fairness, and the ability to be explained) to avoid the development and deployment of AI models whose results are biased or can’t be easily explained or understood.

4. Intellectual property (IP) rights. The perceived benefits of democratization may not be achieved without decisions about who owns the IP rights. A number of companies have refused to use cloud platforms for image or audio processing out of fear that confidential information will be processed outside their four walls, and that the cloud solution provider will use and benefit from the significant insights generated from their data. As more and more companies realize that the full power of democratization comes from their data (and that of their competitors), and not from the tools and platforms themselves, they will likely demand some level of IP rights.
5. Open sourcing. Closing the loop on the enablers of democratization requires all parties to make what they have done open source, to the extent that it does not infringe on privacy, confidentiality, and competitive dynamics. Failure to close the loop from ownership to access will essentially create a one-way flow wherein some players — typically larger companies or governments with ample funding — will benefit from democratization in the short term, and those with fewer resources will be left behind.
By acknowledging the possible downsides of the democratization of AI, industry can explore the standards and guidelines needed to ensure that innovation goes hand in hand with safe implementation. And by making AI transparent and establishing governance, organizations can remove it from its “black box” and can engender trust.

Artificial intelligence has been one of the hottest areas of tech and the economy in the last few years, and AI job growth has reflected that: AI roles ranked at the top of LinkedIn's Job Of Tomorrow report in December, and the World Economic Forum estimated in January that 16% of new jobs would be in AI. Then came the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding economic downturn, which led to up to 40 million US jobs disappearing. How is the ""job of tomorrow"" faring now? New data from job boards shows that while the number of AI jobs is still growing, that growth has slowed dramatically during the coronavirus crisis.

On Monday, LinkedIn released new research showing that growth in the number of AI jobs openings has slowed, and the growth in applications for available jobs has dropped even more sharply. ""Our analysis shows that no sector of the labor market is fully immune to the impact of downturns, but some have proven to be more resilient than others — the AI specialist role is a key example,"" sai d Guy Berger, principal economist at LinkedIn. ""Scarcity of these workers continues to give them bargaining power.""

Between January 6 and March 15, before the realities of COVID-19 had fully settled in, AI job listings on LinkedIn were growing 14% year-over-year. Then, from March 16 to May 24, as US shelter-in-place orders started to take effect, AI job growth slowed to 4.6% year-over-year. AI job applications slowed too: Applications were growing 50.8% year-over-year before the pandemic, and only 30.2% after. The more dramatic slow-down in applications ""suggests that candidates in that job market may be playing it safe during a period of uncertainty,"" wrote Jenny Ying, a senior data scientist at LinkedIn, on the company's blog.The jobs that LinkedIn studied – which had AI or ML (for machine learning) in the title – typically have ""a very high bar for candidates,"" Ying wrote, adding that most new hires transition from existing, in-demand tech jobs, such as software engineering jobs or data science roles, Ying says.

Some employers believe that the coronavirus will actually lead to increased applicants, as some AI startups crumble during the crisis. ""C3.ai continues to hire exceptional data scientists and AI professionals,"" says Tom Siebel, CEO of C3.ai, which posted billboards on Bay Area highways late last year advertising its hiring. ""We expect to see the current trend of increased applicant interest accelerate as the recession and market uncertainty shake out second and third-tier AI startups and larger corporations continue to defund internally developed AI projects.""As Siebel mentions, some companies that planned AI expansion may pause those goals. ""The experimental long-term stuff will have to wait,"" says Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter, an online job board. ""The goal for businesses right now is survival, not exploring new markets, new products, and new technologies.""

ZipRecruiter saw AI job postings drop to 582 the week of April 26, from 1,798 the week of January 19. As of last week, new job AI job postings have crept back up to 810. Both LinkedIn and ZipRecruiter believe AI job growth will bounce back.""In the long term, however, COVID-19 could actually boost the adoption of AI,"" says Pollak. ""With more shopping, working, learning, exercising, and entertainment taking place online, companies will have even more user data at their fingertips. The companies that figure out how best to use it will be at a distinct advantage in the future."" Similarly, LinkedIn's Ying wrote that AI is increasingly becoming ""a tool in the toolbox for solving business problems, with expertise spread throughout people in many different roles at a company.""

With that in mind, AI skills could be useful for anyone that wants to make their resume more marketable. Online training site deeplearning.ai said that interest in its courses is booming. ""Over the past few months, we've seen a large influx of students trying to up-skill and adapt ahead of the curve,"" said Ortal Arel, the company's director of partnerships.Here are other resources for job-seekers interested in picking up AI expertise or skills during the quarantine: Take a free, seven-week machine learning course at Harvard, or pay $200 to get a certificate upon completion. Take a $50 introduction to AI online from deeplearning.ai. Many more advanced classes and a forum for students are also available. Take a six-week course on using AI in business strategy and earn a certificate from the business school of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Put AI to work for you as a job-seeker by understanding how tech companies use algorithms to find applicants. Look into AI jobs in the five states where the industry is booming fastest. Take AI classes on LinkedIn where you can also build your network and apply for openings. Learn how to apply artificial intelligence in the Salesforce system by taking any of 100 AI classes on Trailhead, the company's free online learning academy. Apply to DataRobot's online learning academy, which provides an applied data science certification, use of the DataRobot platform, and access to job placement services.

What is the acceptable failure rate of an airplane? Well, it is not zero… no matter what how hard we want to believe otherwise. There is a number, and it is a very low number. When it comes to machines, computers, artificial intelligence, etc., they are perfectly imperfect. Mistakes will be made. Poor recommendations will occur. AI will never be perfect. That does not mean they do not provide value. People need to understand why machines may mistakes and set their beliefs accordingly. This means understanding the three key areas on why AI fails: implicit bias, poor data, and expectations.




The first challenge is implicit bias, which are the unconscious perceptions people have that cloud thoughts and actions. Consider, the recent protests on racial justice and police brutality and the powerful message that Black Lives Matter. The Forbes article AI Taking A Knee: Action To Improve Equal Treatment Under The Law is a great example of how implicit bias has played a role in the discrimination  and just how hard (but not impossible) it is to use AI to reduce prejudice in our law enforcement and judicial systems. AI learns from people. If implicit bias is in the training, then the AI will learn this bias. Moreover, when the AI performs work, that work will reflect this bias… even if the work is for social good.



Take for example the Allegheny Family Screening Tool. It is meant to predict which welfare children might be at risk from foster parent abuse. The initial rollout of this solution had some challenges though. The local Department of Human Services acknowledged that the tool might have racial and income bias.  Triggers like neglect were often confused or misconstrued by associating foster parents who lived in poverty with inattention or mistreatment. Since learning of these problems, tremendous steps were taken to reduce the implicit bias in the screening tool. Elimination is much harder. When it comes to bias, how do people manage the unknown unknowns? How is social context addressed? What does “right” or “fair” behavior mean? If people cannot identify, define, and resolve these questions, then how will they teach the machine? This is a major driver AI will be perfectly imperfect because of implicit bias.

The second challenge is data. Data is the fuel for AI. The machine trains through ground truth (i.e. rules on how to make decisions, not the decisions themselves) and from lots of big data to learn the patterns and relationships within the data. If our data is incomplete or flawed, then AI cannot learn well. Consider COVID-19. John Hopkins, The COVID Tracking Project, U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the World Health Organization all report different numbers. With such variation, it is very difficult for an AI to gleam meaningful patterns from the data let alone find those hidden insights. More challenging, what about incomplete or erroneous data? Imagine teaching an AI about healthcare but only providing data on women’s health. That impedes how we can use AI in healthcare.

Then there is a challenge in that people may provide too much data. It could be irrelevant, unmeaningful, or even a distraction. Consider when IBM had Watson read the Urban Dictionary, and then it could not distinguish when to use normal language or to use slang and curse words. The problem got so bad that IBM had to erase the Urban Dictionary from Watson’s memory. Similarly, an AI system needs to hear about 100 million words to become fluent in a language. However, a human child only seems to need around 15 million words to become fluent. This implies that we may not know what data is meaningful. Thus, AI trainers may actually focus on superfluous information that could lead the AI to waste time, or even worse, identify false patterns.

The third challenge is expectations. Even though humans make mistakes, people still expect machines to be perfect. In healthcare, experts have estimated that the misdiagnosis rate may be as high as 20%, which means potentially one out of five patients are misdiagnosed. Given this data as well as a scenario where an AI assisted diagnosis may have an error rate of one out of one hundred thousand, most people still prefer to see only the human doctor. Why? One of the most common reasons given is that the misdiagnosis rate of the AI is too high (even though it is much lower than a human doctor.) People expect AI to be perfect. Potentially even worse, people expect the human AI trainers to be perfect too.

On March 23, 2016, Microsoft launched Tay (Thinking About You), a Twitter bot. Microsoft had trained its AI to the level of language and interaction of a 19-year-old, American girl. In a grand social experiment, Tay was released to the world. 96,000 tweets later, Microsoft had to shut Tay down about 16 hours after launch because it had turned sexist, racist, and promoted Nazism. Regrettably, some individuals decided to teach Tay about seditious language to corrupt it. In conjunction, Microsoft did not think to teach Tay about inappropriate behavior so it had no basis (or reason) to know that something like inappropriate behavior and malicious intent might exist. The grand social experiment resulted in failure, and sadly, was probably a testament more about human society than the limitations of AI.

Implicit bias, poor data, and people expectations show that AI will never be perfect. It is not the magic bullet solution many people hope to have. AI can still do some extraordinary things for humans like restore mobility to a lost limb or improve food production while using less resources. People should not discount the value we can get. We should always remember: AI is perfectly imperfect, just like us.

Communication in the World of Artificial Intelligence Alumni Spotlight: Sara Wagner '17
June 11, 2020



Sara Wagner graduated in 2017 with a B.A. in Strategic and Corporate Communication and a B.A. in Psychology. We caught up with Sara to hear about her Chapman experience and how her communication degree prepared her prepare for life after college. If you want to connect with Sara, you can find her on LinkedIn.
Where do you work and what is your job title?
I work at NVIDIA as a Deep Learning Institute Training Programs Manager
What does your job entail?
I Coordinate logistics to train developers, data scientists, and researchers in Artificial Intelligence and Accelerated Computing at events, trade shows, customer sites, and public workshops. We have trained over 200,000 unique individuals worldwide.
Tell us about your job search process.
I had a family friend that had a job opening on her team at NVIDIA. The team needed help immediately, I was graduating a semester early and could move there quickly to start, so they hired me as a contractor. About six months later, they created a full-time position for me and signed me as a full-time employee.
Tell us about your internship experience while at Chapman.
I found two of my internships through the Chapman job fair, which I think is one of the most valuable resources Chapman offers for its students and alumni. I had the opportunity to explore two avenues- writing for an online magazine and helping rebrand a 501c non-profit organization by creating a website and more. It gave me such great hands-on experience that helped me decide marketing was not my thing!
Why did you choose Chapman University and the School of Communication?
I chose Chapman because I wanted to be an athlete and receive an excellent education. I loved the size of the classrooms and how you could have a personal relationship with all of your professors.
How has your School of Communication degree benefited you in your career?
My Strategic and Corporate Communication senior seminar class prepared me so well for job hunting, equipping us with interview tips, resume workshops, and knowledge on researching companies before interviewing. Generally, I got experience in marketing, economics, cross-cultural communication, and more. The program was everything in one.
What advice do you have for undergraduate students or recent graduates?
Do as much hands-on, application-focused work as you can. I know this sounds clichè, but the more you put into your work, the more you will learn and grow. At Chapman, I accidentally signed up for a huge role in a big campaign project. I was not happy at first, but in the end, it turned out to be the most beneficial for me and my skill set, especially in job interviewing.

Apart from lip-syncing it also caters to short dance, comedy, and talent videos. A closer analogy would be Vine, Twitter’s still sorely missed short-form video app whose content lives on as YouTube compilations.TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Beijing based technology company found in 2012. ByteDance first launched Douyin for the China market, then it was gradually launched for the market outside China. ByteDance owns two social media platforms:- TikTok(Duoyin) for China(censored by their protocols), and a TikTok for the rest of the world. Later, TikTok merged with Musical.ly, the venture grown enormously and it was one of the most downloaded apps in the US for Q3 2018.ByteDance is the world’s most successful startup with a valuation of $100 Billion in private markets. The linchpin can be regarded as AI, the company uses powerful AI tools that are more extreme to any competitor in the west. It also developed an AI tool that can read news from 5000 sources and can generate a custom article of 400 words in 2 seconds. The company holds a firm grip over AI and have great potential to replace other social media platforms.What makes TikTok unique from other Social Media Platforms?From Susan Wojcicki to Mark Zuckerberg, all have expressed their concern over the market snatched by TikTok in recent years and are crazed by the success, it is achieving amongst users, ranging from elders to teenagers.But that explains only a part of the unprecedented success story of TikTok. It went from a “lip-syncing” feature in a small fan base to a viral feature in 2020 with almost 800 million active monthly users in less than 2 years. Within such a short period, it is comparable to old-guard social medial platforms with over 10 years in the market!TikTok monthly active users. Source : WeAreSocialTalking of numbers, TikTok has over 800 million active users worldwide that make TikTok 7th in terms of social network sites, ahead of well-known platforms such as Twitter, Pinterest, and Snapchat.Comparing with adversaries, Instagram took six years, Facebook took nearly four years from its launch to gain the same amount of monthly active users that TikTok achieved under three years.TikTok is the most downloaded app in US for May 2020. (Source: SensorTower)TikTok is the most downloaded app worldwide (non-game) for May 2020 with more than 111.9 million downloads including China’s Douyin, a 2x YOY increase from May 2019.Jumping back to the question, What makes it unique?It uses an advanced and cyclic recommendation system, Unlike old schools entertaining platforms like Netflix and YouTube, it doesn’t recommend you videos rather it dictates you what to watch?As quoted by Connie Chan, a renowned Chinese investor :“TikTok is the first mainstream consumer app where artificial intelligence IS the product. It’s representative of a broader shift.”Contradictory to Instagram and YouTube, you don’t need a single view or followers to be viral. It uses an AI-powered feed that works on the motto “the more you use it, the more it learns you”.It heavily relies on the user’s personal information(location, characteristic, traits, internet searches) to make the feed more personalized and thus often been part of information leak and misuse controversies.The basic aim of any social media platform is to keep its users engaged, and surprisingly, TikTok can engage its average new users up to 10 minutes that is three times the capability of Instagram.It lowers the barriers of entry and doesn’t even require you to sign up, once you install the app it starts tracking you from that moment and starts recommending you videos based on those factors.For illustration, if you’re new on the application and TikTok showed you a video, and you don’t watch the entire video, you will get less recommendation of those types of videos and vice-versa.Furthermore, it allows you to showcase your talent unlike other social media giants that promote status over talent; Anyone can be a creator on TikTok which is it USP!Several TheoriesThere is not a lot of transparency about algorithms, but still there are several theories based on user experiences and experts analysis.Batch Theory :According to this, when a video is uploaded, it is shown to a pool of batches with different ideologies or in simple words, based on several distinguishing factors such as their watching history, location, personal preferences. The fate of your content is based on those different batches; Re-watching, Liking, Sharing, and comments, these are the little inputs that the algorithm takes to escalate the score of your content.If your content is liked by the batches then it is pushed to a larger audience of the same thought-process and thus making it viral!Coping up with this theory, it might take a few days for you to be a celeb.And a bonus point:- The more you engage yourself in trending challenges, the more it promotes you.Authority Ranking :In the light of this principle, your fate of going viral depends upon your first few videos. If those garner some views and likes, then it sets a stage for you as a creator and your only job will be to engage with the audience as much as possible.Once you get authority ranking, you will be in limelight and will stand some levels above novice users although you’re still a novice.Delay Momentum :Following this principle, some users have advised not to delete any piece of content no matter how crap that is!Some users have experienced that, if their content does no good and they start being less active on the platform, the platform will try to boost their content on its own after a while, thus encouraging them to create more for their audience.Possible TikTok recommendation systemThere is no confirmed workflow for the TikTok’s algorithm but based on the data posted by the company, and trails found by nerds. I made up the accompanying determination.How does the TikTok algorithm work for a content creator?Once a video is uploaded to TikTok, the highly capable AI algorithm uses NLP and computer vision to analyze the video.SourceIt will analyze every part of your video including audio, captions and metadata(hashtags) to build up an understanding of the content and context of the videos.“Artificial intelligence powers all of Bytedance’s content platforms,” the spokesperson says. “We build intelligent machines that are capable of understanding and analyzing text, images and videos using natural language processing and computer vision technology. This enables us to serve users with the content that they find most interesting, and empower creators to share moments that matter in everyday life to a global audience.”How TikTok uses AI to analyze the content, Created By Daksh Trehan, All Rights ReservedAfter being checked upon its rules and regulations, the content will be pushed to a small batch of the audience and, an evaluation will happen based on how the sample set of users reacted to that piece of content. Each metric that is tracked has a possible associated score.Re-watch rate = 10 PointsCompletion rate = 8 PointsShares = 6 PointsComments = 4 PointsLikes = 2 PointsBut looping your video over and again won’t make you viral, because this algorithm can distinguish redundant entries.Once the aggregate score for your content is decent, it will push it to a wider audience sharing same thoughts and dogma.TikTok workflow for Content Creators, Designed by Daksh Trehan, All Rights ReservedAnd don’t be disheartened if your content doesn’t go viral, because the cycle isn’t ended but rather just paused and according to Delay Momentum theory, it might roll back once you start leaving a shorter footprint on the application.This is a chain reaction, that will going to continue, engaging more content creators and thus more audience. This is the essence of this platform, that can hooks its users for a long time.How does TikTok learn about you as a user?As discussed earlier, TikTok lowers its barrier of entry by not forcing its users to sign up. Rather the app starts learning as much as it can about you. The first sequence of videos you consume helps it to decide your taste.The first task is to keep you in the app for as long as possible. It will only show you videos that are liked by wider range of audience thus trying to keep your exit rate low.Once you are in their ecosystem, they will track each of your metrics and create a score for your profile for each genre.Every time you re-watch a video or consume the entire duration of the video, the algorithm takes note suggesting some more videos of similar type for your profile. Here is the detailed possible metrics system:Re-watch rate = 10 PointsCompletion rate = 8 PointsShares = 6 PointsComments = 4 PointsLikes = 2 PointsTikTok workflow for New Users, Designed by Daksh Trehan, All Rights ReservedAlong with your metrics data, it will also collect your personal information such as your location, your internet history, your age to create a more accurate personalized feed, thus keeping you in their ecosystem as long as possible.The wonder of such algorithm is, it can engage user all around world from different age group with its exceptional content recommendation system!Recommendation workflow in a NutshellTikTok algorithm possible workflow, Designed by Daksh Trehan, All Rights ReservedAt TikTok, there are millions of contents uploaded by users daily. It is not practically possible to monitor each content manually, so a review is done by the machine and if the content is tagged insensitive to company’s protocols it is passed for a human review.After passing human review, the content is checked for duplication, after passing that stage, the content is passed to a small batch of users for initial feedback; based on metrics system the score for the content is evaluated, the score decides the fate of content; if the score is above some threshold then the content is pushed to a wider audience but is cooled down in a week or so, to keep its users experiencing new content.But if the feedback is low, the cycle doesn’t stop right here, but rather it is paused and the application observes user’s behavior and its active time, if it experiences a high exit rate then the cycle will become active again and boosting the content thus encouraging the creator to create more and engage more on the platform.This cycle is the main reason, it makes its users obsessive as doesn’t let its users get bored, if you’re a user it will keep dictating you and recommending you highly personalized feeds and if you’re a creator it will try to distribute you some attention thus keeping your morale high and encouraging to you create more!If you like this article, please consider subscribing to my newsletter: Daksh Trehan’s Weekly Newsletter.ConclusionHopefully, this article has given you How TikTok is using AI and how its recommendation workflow can hook its users for a longer time with a low exit rate.As always, thank you so much for reading, and please share this article if you found it useful! :)References:[1] Reverse engineering how TikTok algorithm works[2] Why TikTok made its user so obsessive?

While many opinions have been expressed on the predatory role of AI (for example, AI will ‘replace’ most of the work humans do), we offer an alternate view of the role AI can play in our lives and especially in our organizations. The famous poet, Robert Frost, once beautifully articulated that ‘Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference’. It seems that, as business leaders, we are at a similar ‘two roads diverged in a wood’ moment, and the decisions we take on the role AI will play in our organisations will probably significantly change the evolutionary trajectory of our organisations. We believe that organisations can benefit much more from following an ‘augmentation’ strategy (as compared to ‘replacement’ strategy) as it relates to AI. Our experience has shown that, if augmented effectively with unique human capabilities, AI has the potential to significantly transform the three key pillars of organisations – work, worker and workplace - and enable creation of a hyper-productive ‘HumBot’ (Human + Robot) organisation. Work Work is a fundamental and defining component of a human life. While technology advancements have impacted the way work is done, humans still spend a lot of time doing work that can be best done by a machine (‘Bot’). By freeing up humans to focus more on those tasks (for example, empathy and inspiration) that maximises their potential, we are likely to significantly increase organisational productivity. However, to achieve this, we will need to redesign work to optimally utilise and integrate the best of both ‘human’ and ‘bot’ capabilities. For example, we can leverage the bot’s ability to do high-volume, complex data collation task (for example, download bulk data from multiple systems at different times and do pattern and anomaly detection) and augment that with uniquely human skills (for example, deep enquiry, crisp articulation) to create a ‘proactive insights platform’ that can significantly enhance quality of decision making throughout the organisation. Worker As work gets redesigned through infusion of AI technologies, the role of the worker (doing the work) is also likely to change significantly. While some roles may get replaced by AI, we believe AI technologies can lead to two significant benefits for workers – (a) it can create new roles that do not exist today (b) it can transform existing roles to make them more impactful. For example, while AI may automate a transactional process like ‘invoice processing’ (and hence replace the work of people processing invoices), it can create new higher value-added roles for better managing the working capital of the organisation and to enhance the quality of relationship the organisation has with its ecosystem of vendors and partners. Additionally, AI has the potential to further increase the effectiveness of these new roles by acting as ‘personalised digital augmenters’ (for example, alert the ‘vendor relationship manager’ on a significant news about an important vendor and proactively perform quick customised correlation analysis to provide ‘next best moves’ for consideration). By embracing (rather than fearing and resisting) AI, we have the opportunity to enhance the quality of work and provide human workers more opportunities to find joy, meaning and fulfilment in their work. Also Read: Automation and AI in a changing business landscape Workplace As the work gets redesigned and the role of worker gets enhanced, the workplace is also expected to change significantly. COVID-19 has taught us that humans are resilient enough to change their behaviours and attitudes quickly and dramatically. As ‘work from anywhere’ becomes more common, the definition of ‘workplace’ may become more fluid. While this increased fluidity may lead to increased productivity and better worker morale, organisations will need to consider creating a more secure, responsive and collaborative hybrid (‘virtual’ and ‘physical’) workplace. AI technologies (for example, virtual whiteboards that convert speech to text and vice versa) can help create these hybrid workplaces to help human workers achieve better outcomes in a faster, smarter and more secure manner. As business leaders navigate the proverbial ‘two-roads-diverged-in-a-wood’ moment as it relates to defining the right AI strategy for their organisations, we suggest also considering the ‘augmentation’ strategy (as compared to the ‘replacement’ strategy we hear most about). Defining and implementing the right AI strategy can help organisations to create a hyper-productive HumBot organisation in which a new type of work is performed by a new type of worker in a new type of (hybrid) workplace.

INTRODUCTION 
MEANING OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a term which was coined by the father of AI – John McCarthy. The Oxford Dictionary defines Artificial Intelligence as “ the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception ,speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages[1]” Simply put, AI is a broad branch of computer science wherein the goal is to create systems which can function independently and intelligently One can say that it is an intelligent machine which has the ability to think, understand and act on its own and also has the skill to replicate certain human behaviour. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence is a machine which has the capability and ability to solve problems that are usually tackled by us humans with our natural intelligence. To elaborate further, the purpose behind the development of AI is the requirement as well as the demand for automation in this high paced life of humans. The monotonous tasks or even complex tasks and are now being performed by utilizing the AI technology. 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INDIAN LEGAL PROFESSION 
From using the typewriters to now using a computer, from using only libraries for legal research to using online portals for finding relevant case laws, from fax machines to emails, each advancement has been transformative in the field of law. Now it’s time for AI to enter the field of law. The legal services market is one of the largest in the world, but at the same time it is also said to be under-digitized in its working. The field of law is very traditional in its approach and slow in adapting to new tools. It’s time that we acknowledge the fact that Artificial Intelligence possess the capabilities to change the manner in which lawyers currently operate and the way law is looked at in India. Technology is of relevance in so far as it promotes- efficiency, transparency and objectivity in public governance – as humbly stated by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, he threw light upon the idea that AI is not there to replace the judges or the human mind but it is present in order to provide a facilitative tool to the judges in order to recheck or reassess the work, the process and the judgements. The prime goal being to ultimately provide a wider access to justice to the common people.
The primary step taken for India’s Artificial Intelligence framework was the AI Task Force Report, in order to study artificial intelligence in depth. This task force was set up by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry headed by the Chairman of Tata Sons N. Chandrasekaran for analyzing the financial advantages of using AI and to see how it will benefit India.[2] The Task force stated its vision “To embed AI in our Economic, Political and Legal thought processes so that there is systematic capability to support the goal of India becoming one of the leaders of AI-rich economies”.
The Indian legal profession is such that the whole process is manually done as the nature of the legal industry is still said to be tilted towards being labour intensive. Hence, AI is at its early stages as most of the older generation advocates are of the opinion that technology should not be used extensively as it might take over man and thus shy away from the idea of AI in law. Having said that, there are many tech-savvy lawyers, as well as big law firms which are utilizing the advancements in the field of technology to the fullest in order to have an edge over others. We all know that the Indian legal system is vast, our Constitution alone being the lengthiest in the whole world, hence with changing times it’s essential to cope with the dynamic environment with the usage of AI in law. Using machine learning technology by lawyers in the field of legal research can help them to get an unparalleled insight into the legal domain within a few seconds. One such firm being Cyril Armarchand and Mangaldas who has acknowledged the AI powers and is also embracing it with enthusiasm. CAM has made history by being the first Indian law firm to give license to “Kira”, which is a Canada based machine learning software built by Kira Systems. This AI based software is capable of doing many things and thus saves the long man-hours. “Kira” system is being used for analyzing legal documents, identifying and spotting any risk areas and it also used for extracting clauses from various legal documents.
 
USES AND ADVANTAGES OF AI IN LEGAL PROFESSION 
With the advancement in the field of AI technology, it has reduced the long man-hours which were earlier required to do the tiresome work of going through hefty paperwork which is required to be done by lawyers. There are various ways by which the legal industry can benefit by using the AI technology to its advantage in order to reap out the maximum benefits.
Some highlights of the ways in which AI technology is helping out law firms and lawyers and proving to be a boon for the legal industry are discussed below:

Legal Research Work: 

Legal research requires long hours and can also get monotonous due to its complex nature, and keeping in mind the tight deadlines most law firms require to meet they need a quick and accurate legal research work. This challenge is met by using AI software which can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy; it reduces time as with one click AI provides relevant case laws which can be beneficial for assisting judges in order to deliver speedy judgements. ROSS Intelligence is one such company which employs machine run software to review contract documents quickly and also reviews them; the software also highlights relevant documents. Therefore, with the usage of correct software legal research can be optimized and can greatly improve the efficiency as well.

Due Diligence: 

Due diligence process requires long number of working hours by legal practitioners as they are required to review multiple legal documents. Converting and organization of all such important documents is surely a cumbersome process and takes in a long time. However, with the availability of AI solutions, the tedious work of due diligence can be handled much more quickly and with more accuracy. With the help of machine learning technology, studies prove that AI systems have shown to do the work of reviewing legal documents much faster and with accuracy. Kira systems is one such company which accurately carries out the due diligence checks, it is far quicker than reviewing it manually.

Reduce Costs and Increase Productivity: 

AI can help in streamlining the legal department by automating tasks and processes. In order to fully utilize the potential of AI, the in-house lawyers should start using the software as it can be a useful tool, it can help to reduce costs, it can aid in coming up with new strategies, AI software can detect and reduce the contract risks and thus deliver a more efficient and better service. It is important to use the best AI contract review software. Company called eBrevia- developed with assistance from the Columbia University aims to apply machine learning and tools like natural language processing, software driven by AI to minimize the time spent on reviewing contracts and the goal is to speed up the research and review process.

Analysis of Legal Documents: 

The AI software can detect important patterns and can help in figuring out the correlations it can help legal practitioners in their case by furnishing judgements and also precedent law which can be used by them. AI can review bulk contracts efficiently and much faster than humans.

Electronic Billing: 

Legal software used in AI technology is used for the preparation of invoices for the lawyers according to the work carried out by them. This helps the firm and the lawyer to decipher the accurate billing of the work done by the legal practitioner.
 
CHALLENGES OF AI IN LAW

Not completely accepted by legal professionals: 

Artificial intelligence in law is still at its infant stage when we look India. Lawyers are reluctant to use this technology and fear that it will have a toll on employment. They dread that technology would take over a lawyer or a legal clerk’s bread and butter and would ultimately lead more cases of unemployment in the country. Most senior legal practitioners shy away from changing their habits and want to stick to their traditional way of practicing without using AI.

Legal Personality of AI is Not Defined: 

The legal personality of artificial intelligence is not clearly defined anywhere in our law, robots are complex in nature and thus it becomes difficult to ascertain whether ordinary laws and rules would be applicable in the same manner or not. Therefore, until the rights and obligations of AI driven machines and tools become clear it would continue to cause confusion since the current legal framework does not hold a robot responsible for its acts or omissions per se.

Lack of Proper Systems and Data:

Machine learning is based on the algorithms which are fed in the computer systems and on the basis of that the machine acts. One of the major barriers in using AI technology in the case of India is that, there is outdated technology and machines which are being used, the data is often not complete and unless huge chunk of reliable data is provided to the machine it will not be able to perform accurately.[3]

Costly: 

The AI machines are sophisticated machine systems capable of learning and acting on its own, this also calls for huge amount of investment in terms of money. Mostly such AI driven machines are produced by foreign companies, this further makes it difficult for small and midsized law firms to get their hands on the only big law firms are able to afford them.

Privacy and Protection of Personal Data: 

It is essential that the AI driven machine learning robots are developed in such a manner which keeps the private data of the parties involved safe and secure. Since machine learning works on huge amount of data it becomes all the more essential that, the legal framework is such which provides protection that the data will not be misused, confidentiality must be maintained and a fair due process needs to be followed, a security layer to check breach of privacy must be done.
NITI Ayog in 2018 released a paper called “National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence” this policy paper considered the importance of AI which can be used in various sectors in India, in the 2019 Budget it also put forward the idea of launching a national programme on AI.[4] Even though all these advancements took place in the technological fronts, there is still no effective legislation which regulates and controls the AI industry in India.
 
AI RELATED START-UPS AND THEIR IMPACT 

Spot Draft: 

This is an AI based start-up by Shashank Bijapur, who is a Harvard Law School alumni and Madhav Bhagat an ex-Google employee. This AI driven business has the ability to scrutinise legal documents and it reduces the paperwork by giving the customers an option to create business contracts. This revolutionary platform offers its clients an option to draft and sign contracts it also has features of automatic reminders and payments.

CaseMine: 

This is a legal research platform. This start-up aims at using AI technology in order to draw links between different case laws and thus makes it simpler for the legal researcher to have an in depth and comprehensive research.

CaseIQ: 

This machine learning software acts like a legal assistant in researching case laws, it also analyses the legal language and works like an assistant by pointing out any potential points of law which might be missing, suggests alternative arguments, highlights relevant judgements and case laws for a comprehensive legal research.

NearLaw: 

This Mumbai based start-up offers AI based solutions to legal practitioners and law firms. NearLaw is said to be using NLP technologies to assist in legal matters by understanding case rankings.

Practice League: 

This is a Pune based legal tech law firm which has used AI capabilities to transform the working model for more than 8,000 lawyers. Reports highlight that this firm is working with tech giants like Google and Amazon in order to weave AI abilities into its working solutions.
 
IMPACT OF AI ON INDIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM: 
When we look at the Indian judicial system, there exists judicial delays the judiciary is over burdened with more than 3 crore pending cases which leads to unwanted delays in providing justice to the people and as the saying goes- justice delayed is indeed justice denied. Therefore, various measures are being taken up to improve the current condition like reducing the vacation duration, increasing the strength of the judges but it’s time to do more than this and that is where the role of Artificial Intelligence comes into play.[5] There are various cases registered every year which are of similar nature thus, Judiciary requires data science and AI which have the ability of assisting the judges by using predictive technology which helps in availability of vital information about the ongoing cases based on previous case of similar nature. Analysis done by AI can aid judges in speedy judgement delivery. Studies show that the role of AI can be very useful at the evidence stage, as it is a vital stage of any case it also takes up a huge amount of court’s time, multiple delays are a common feature of this stage for various reasons such as delay because of Investigation in-charge, absence of witnesses etc. the role of AI technology in such cases would be of predicting potential delays and this would aid the judges as they would have knowledge beforehand about the causes for above mentioned delays in certain similar kind of cases eg; murder. This predictive technology will be useful as the judges would be able to handle the load of each case accordingly, it can also help the judges to take proactive measures to prevent the witnesses from turning hostile by granting them extra police protection.
One of the major developments which recently took place was that the Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde, recently said in an even that “We have a possibility of developing Artificial Intelligence for court system. Only for the purpose of ensuring that the undue delay in justice is prevented” He also made it clear that AI will not be replacing human discretion or judges. Sharing more insights he further stated that “It is only the repetitive, mathematical and the mechanical parts of the judgements for which help can be taken from the machine learning system…we are exploring the possibility of implementing it”.[6]
This is certainly one of the biggest highlights that the Chief Justice of India himself is of the view that using AI technology in law and judicial system will reap out benefits. Indian Judicial system will greatly benefit from it if its gets implemented with proper legal framework stating rules and regulations.
  
RECENT GROWTH OF AI IN JUDICIAL DOMAIN 

Supreme Court Vidhik Anuvaad Software (SUVAS): 

The Supreme Court of India has launched an official AI driven application which is specially created by using machine assisted translation technology trained by AI. The primary focus of this app is to translate English legal documents and Orders into 9 vernacular languages. This is the very first step taken by our judiciary to include AI in Legal domain.

Multilingual Official Mobile app. of Supreme Court of India: 

The apex court of our country with assistance of the National Informatics Centre has launched an app which would provide the citizens with the authentic access to the display board, cases, daily orders, judgements, important circulars and much other vital information with just a click.

E-courts: 

This is one of the most important developments done by the judicial reforms it has made a huge impact in terms of saving time, energy and money as all the important data regarding judgments, court orders is available online at zero cost for the users.[7]

IIT-Kharagpur developed AI system to read legal orders: 

Researchers at IIT Kharagpur have come up with an AI aided technology which can read orders and judgements and it also possess the ability to highlight the laws which are being violated, all this is being done via machine learning technology.
 
WILL AI REPLACE LAWYERS? 
Artificial Intelligence is used to facilitate the working of lawyers by reducing their load and not to replace them. There is a big misconception among many legal practitioners and firms that AI would take over the lawyers, but it is certainly not possible because even though a machine learning tool can aid in research, contract review and predicting certain aspects with desired data but it certainly cannot take over tasks like giving advice to clients, negotiating terms, arguing in front of the judges, all these essential activities will always be performed by lawyers and no machine can replace them. As correctly stated by our Chief Justice that AI is their to aid lawyers and judges for a speedy delivery of justice and can never replace them.[8]
In fact, AI has reduced the burden on lawyers so that they can focus their mind on other important aspects, thus it has made them more productive and efficient. The emergence of AI will actually create more job opportunities of data analytics, thus the notion that technology is taking away jobs is negated, rather it is actually creating new opportunities for us.
 
USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND AI DURING COVID-19 IN LAW 
The pandemic caused due to the highly infection disease coronavirus has taken a toll on the lives of people. In context of law, it has most certainly made the lawyers and judges realize the importance of technology and the need of using AI and machine learning software to get the work done. Since social distancing has led to a lockdown situation the courts are taking up only urgent matters via video conferencing methods and e- filing of legal documents as per the order passed by the Supreme Court.[9] The Apex Court in the case of Swapnil Tripathi v. Supreme Court of India has itself recognized the principle of live streaming of proceeding except certain cases like rape, matrimonial cases etc.[10]
“The wheels of justice cannot be halted because of lockdown” as correctly pointed out by Justice Sikhri, delivery of justice also comes under essential services and during the time of Covid-19 technology has played a vital role from e-filing, e-payment of court fee etc. Delhi High Court has even took a step forward by setting up e-rooms by making some court rooms entirely paperless, and one can check their case details on their online portal. Thus, given the situation we all are in, technology is the only friend who is here to stay for a long time, it’s time to embrace the advancements in technological fields including AI and move towards the path of development.
 
CONCLUSION
Advancement in technology has surely changed the outlook of the legal industry, it can be concluded that AI in the field of law proves to have many advantages, it has aided legal professionals in brisk research work, with its predictive technology it can assist judges in decision making process, it is useful for law firms for due diligence work, collection of data etc. which makes their work more efficient and quicker ,machine learning technology saves time, it is accurate and has effective results . Even though AI has multiple advantages but it cannot not replace lawyers, it can assist them in certain areas of work but AI lacks strategic thinking, it is not creative like humans, it lacks the ability to improvise in front of a judge, robots don’t possess emotional intelligence and feeling of empathy. Inclusion of AI in the legal industry has many challenges ahead of itself, some of them being- it is still prone to a lot of risks thus we need a proper legal framework in order to regulate Artificial Intelligence to prevent it from misusing their client’s data . The complete inclusion of AI in legal industry will be possible only once we have legal framework governing its actions to minimize the risks attached with it, only then we would be able to reap out maximum benefits of AI. To safeguard the inclusion of AI, we need to have a fair and balanced approach, few suggestions include- 1) A strong regulatory framework is required to be drafted which clearly states out the obligations and liabilities of this intelligent machine, 2) accountability factor needs to be paid attention to, in order to control its actions 3) stronger data protection laws are needed to protect privacy. Thus, the solution is not to take a back seat and shy away from the technological advancements but to embrace it and use AI to our advantage by having required legislations in place to safeguard the interests of its users.

This week IBM, Microsoft and Amazon announced that they would suspend the sale of their facial recognition technology to law enforcement agencies. It’s yet another sign of the dramatic impact of the protests for social justice. 


But the moves from the tech giants also illustrate the inherent risks of AI, especially when it comes to bias and the potential for invasion of privacy.  Note that there are already indications that Congress will take action to regulate the technology.  In the meantime, many cities have already instituted bans, such San Francisco.

Because of the advances of deep learning and faster systems for processing enormous amounts of data, facial recognition has certainly seen major strides over the past decade. Yet there is still much to be done. 

PROMOTED
“AI face recognition technology is damn good, but it is not very robust,” said Ken Bodnar, who is an AI researcher. “This means that the neural network is well trained and capable of amazing feats of identification, but if one little parameter is off, it mis-identifies you. The way that it works, is that everything is a probability with AI. So when it looks at a face, it has a range of proprietary algorithms and parameters it measures. The most accurate AI tools are Deep Belief Networks that winnow out features like double chins, eye distance, hair type, bushy eyebrows, fat lips, age parameters etc. But the ‘not-very-robust’ categorization means that it is easy to fool because of the intrinsic nature of the way that neural networks work.”

True, when it comes to certain applications of facial recognition, the accuracy issues may not necessarily be a big deal (such as with a cool social media app). But of course, this is a different matter when its about whether someone should be arrested.

Facial recognition has also been shown to be less effective when analyzing videos and images of minorities. “As for the issues with this technology, a study out of MIT last year found that all of the facial recognition tools had major issues when identifying people of color,” said Michal Strahilevitz, who is a professor of marketing at St. Mary's College of California. “Another study out of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology suggested facial recognition software had far more errors in attempting to recognize black and Asian faces than it had in recognizing Caucasian ones.  This means that black and brown people are more likely to be inaccurately identified, and thus unfairly targeted. This may not be intentional, but it ends up having a racial bias that is dangerous and unethical.”

Yet the debate over facial recognition can certainly get complicated and may even lead to unintended consequences. 
“The moves reflect a lack of popular understanding of the technology–the public is conflating facial recognition with body recognition and tracking, facial analysis, facial detection, gender/age/ethnicity recognition, biometric validation, etc. as well as misunderstanding the difference between the use case and the technology,” said Kjell Carlsson, who is an analyst at Forrester. “It is very unclear exactly what is being renounced and for what use cases. The result is almost certainly the worst of both worlds: Ineffectual policy to prevent misuse together with applying the breaks on valuable use cases. For example, wouldn’t we want folks to use facial recognition to help identify kidnapping victims in Nigeria? Or to help diagnose rare genetic disorders in children with facial analysis for genetic phenotyping? Or to help catch the Boston Marathon bombers? Or to reduce the false positives in the techniques that the police use to match faces to mugshots that they have been using for decades?”

It's interesting to note that facial recognition technology will likely continue to see more innovation and development. regardless of the bans and regulatory actions. Just take a look at GitHub and you’ll find sophisticated systems…for free.
So if anything, when it comes to companies like IBM, Microsoft and Amazon, it’s important for them to do more than ban the technology. “I do hope that they come back with a better-designed system that respects the user's privacy and allows for usage in times of need and with conscious protection for users and their data,” said Lovelesh Chhabra, who is the Vice President of Membership Platforms at Verizon Media.
This should then be backed up with a strong set of principles and ethical standards that the industry can follow. The result will likely be a stronger foundation for AI. 
“The good news is that bias-free identification at all levels of a device is possible, but every player involved–for apps, hardware and OS providers—has to be willing to commit to it,” said André Ferraz, who is the founder and CEO of Incognia.
