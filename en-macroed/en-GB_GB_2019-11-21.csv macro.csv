For sure you will hear an interesting and conflicting set of opinions that range from “AI will destroy all jobs as we know it” to “AI will enable us to work better and do new things we’ve never been able to do”. If you look at various economic and analyst predictions, their assessments are all over the place, ranging from dramatic job losses across most economic sectors to large increases in employment due to dramatic increases in job productivity. Of course, as with everything, the true answer will be somewhere in the middle. There’s no doubt that AI will eliminate the need for many different kinds of jobs in many different categories. But at the same time, AI will create new jobs in categories that we know of, and many more in categories that have yet to be created.

Is AI a Job Killer?

A Gallup poll from 2018 reveals that many people think AI will destroy jobs, but just not theirs. In fact, in that poll, over 73% of Americans believe that AI will be a net job destroyer, but only 23% of these same surveyed adults were worried about it. How can you reconcile those two positions?  In that same survey, over 90% of those polled believed that AI will destroy at least half of all jobs, but 91% of them believed it wouldn’t impact their employment. The general consensus from the average person is that AI is continuing the unimpeded progress of automation and technology that brings increasing levels of productivity. Businesses will be able to do more with their existing resources, and perhaps do more with fewer resources, with those resources being primarily human labor and the costs associated with it.

Automation has been embraced by companies for many decades, but automation is not intelligence and there is no doubt that the addition of more cognitive capabilities in the technologies that companies use will allow organizations to rethink their usage of human labor for activities as wide ranging as call center operations, warehouse activities, trucking and transportation, brick-and-mortar retail, and even mining, oil, and gas activities. Many make the argument that job losses won’t be felt at the top or bottom of the pay scale, but rather in the middle. There will be less management by humans, and more management by machines and AI colleagues. Collectively these middle income jobs employ a very large percentage of the American population so this will no doubt have an impact on jobs and the workforce.
PROMOTED
A Bureau of Labor & Statistics report from 2017 reports that most employment is in retail, professional services, healthcare, and government. It’s no surprise then that AI may take a chunk out of retail, government, and professional services employment.  In fact, a workforce adjustment is already being experienced in areas that require human-intensive labor moving paper or bits and bytes around from one place to another. These highly repetitive, regulatory intensive, and error-prone processes jobs are being replaced by computer systems. Why have a human move information around when a computer can do just as good a job, especially with the ability to understand the meaning and context of information?  Furthermore, while we’re still in the very early (and possibly dangerous) days of autonomous vehicles, there’s no question that the future direction of the transportation, warehouse, and logistics industries is rapidly heading to an autonomous future. Truck driving, which represents the largest employer by number of people employed by category in many US states will clearly be a job position in jeopardy in the future.
Is AI a Job Creator?
The argument with every wave of technology, from the automatic weaving looms of the early industrial revolution to the computers of today is that jobs are not destroyed, but rather employment shifts from one place to another as entirely new categories of employment are created. The Luddites might have wrecked the mills as a protest against machine-enabled automation, but today, those same workers would be defending manufacturing against the disappearance of those jobs. In fact, if you look back far enough, you’ll see the trend away from manufacturing and towards professional services started just after World War II and the irresistible move towards globalization. Some have even made the stark point that the only reason why American manufacturing stayed a significant employer until the late 1970s was because World War II destroyed so much manufacturing capacity in Europe and Asia that the United States was the de facto manufacturing leader for many decades afterward.

In 1910, manufacturing, transportation, retail, and domestic services were the major employers.  Inventions such as the washing machine, dishwasher, microwave, and cooktops / ranges put an end to domestic service as a major employer. Yet, the US didn’t experience massive waves of unemployment, because we invented whole new major sectors of the economy in professional services which barely even existed as a category in 1910. Likewise, the evolution of major employer by category shifted significantly from even 1978, when secretaries were the largest category of employee type.  Along came computers and out went entire rooms of typewriters, filing cabinets, and people handling the scheduling of management staff. Yet, again, the United States didn’t have a major economic collapse or massive waves of unemployment because new employment categories emerged before the old ones were fully retired.

Furthermore, there are many categories of employment that will be relatively un-impacted by even super-cognitive AI-enabled systems. The government, healthcare, education, leisure and hospitality, and many professional services categories (notably real estate) will continue being major employers. Even with the addition of AI to these industries humans will still be needed, they will just be better at their jobs and more responsive to the needs of other humans, rather than replacing them. After all there’s nothing more human than government or lounging in a hotel. As long as there are humans, we’ll have government, teachers, doctors, and cabanas. Even in areas where robotics have had a significant impact, we see puzzling contradictions. Amazon is employing more people than ever in its warehouses even though it has one of the highest penetrations of intelligent automation.

AI Will Kill Jobs in Some Categories, but Create Entirely New Categories of Jobs
The real job creator will be entirely new categories of jobs that we can’t even think of yet. If you went back in time 20 or 30 years and told someone that they would work as a social media marketer they would have no idea what you were talking about. Likewise, if you go forward 20 to 30 years there will be whole sectors of the economy and major employers that are not even possible today. Yesterday’s manufacturers are today’s programmers. Yesterday’s secretaries are today’s database administrators. Yesterday’s milkmen are today’s Uber drivers. Indeed, it’s not that jobs have been created or destroyed, but rather entire job categories are gone and new ones have taken their place.
Humans have a very, very hard time imagining what sort of new jobs and new sectors will come to be. Since we can only truthfully envision what might be gone tomorrow, but have a hard time imagining what will be possible, our limited human minds make the mental calculation that the net impact will be negative. But that’s simply not the case. There is no doubt that there will be new categories of jobs that relate directly to the creation of AI-enabled capabilities, whether in software or hardware.  However, no one can argue that any number of those jobs will make up for the decline in workers that come from using those products. Data scientists, robotic engineers, and ML programmers will not make up for fewer truck drivers or call center workers. Rather, the creation will be where we least expect it. Will there be entirely new categories of professional services that would be impossible without the use of advanced intelligence as a helper? Will we see a massive wave of self-employment enabled by intelligent assistants and third-party services that turn individuals into major powerhouse corporations of one?
There is no question that the world’s economies are undergoing a revolutionary shift as we move from one age of industrialization to another — something that many in the industry are calling Industry 4.0. The transition between each wave of industrialization is not necessarily a clean one. If new job categories are not created before old job categories are retired, then the transition can be a messy one. However, it’s clear that we’re already embarked on the transition, and now it remains to be seen what the future will create with the new capabilities that are being developed. Only time will tell what new jobs will appear and which ones will disappear.

In opening yesterday’s AI and the Work of the Future Congress, MIT Professor Daniela Rus presented diverging views of how artificial intelligence will impact jobs worldwide.By automating certain menial tasks, experts think AI is poised to improve human quality of life, boost profits, and create jobs, said Rus, director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.Rus then quoted a World Economic Forum study estimating AI could help create 133 million new jobs worldwide over the next five years. Juxtaposing this optimistic view, however, she noted a recent survey that found about two-thirds of Americans believe machines will soon rob humans of their careers. “So, who is right? The economists, who predict greater productivity and new jobs? The technologists, who dream of creating better lives? Or the factory line workers who worry about unemployment?” Rus asked. “The answer is, probably all of them.”Her remarks kicked off an all-day conference in Kresge Auditorium that convened experts from industry and academia for panel discussions and informal talks about preparing humans of all ages and backgrounds for a future of AI automation in the workplace. The event was co-sponsored by CSAIL, the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy (IDE), and the MIT Work of the Future Task Force, an Institute-wide effort launched in 2018 that aims to understand and shape the evolution of jobs during an age of innovation.Presenters were billed as “leaders and visionaries” rigorously measuring technological impact on enterprise, government, and society, and generating solutions. Apart from Rus, who also moderated a panel on dispelling AI myths, speakers included Chief Technology Officer of the United States Michael Kratsios; executives from Amazon, Nissan, Liberty Mutual, IBM, Ford, and Adobe; venture capitalists and tech entrepreneurs; representatives of nonprofits and colleges; journalists who cover AI issues; and several MIT professors and researchers.Rus, a self-described “technology optimist,” drove home a point that echoed throughout all discussions of the day: AI doesn’t automate jobs, it automates tasks. Rus quoted a recent McKinsey Global Institute study that estimated 45 percent of tasks that humans are paid to do can now be automated. But, she said, humans can adapt to work in concert with AI — meaning job tasks may change dramatically, but jobs may not disappear entirely. “If we make the right choices and the right investments, we can ensure that those benefits get distributed widely across our workforce and our planet,” Rus said.Avoiding the “job-pocalypse”Common topics throughout the day included reskilling veteran employees to use AI technologies; investing heavily in training young students in AI through tech apprenticeships, vocational programs, and other education initiatives; ensuring workers can make livable incomes; and promoting greater inclusivity in tech-based careers. The hope is to avoid, as one speaker put it, a “job-pocalypse,” where most humans will lose their jobs to machines.A panel moderated by David Mindell, the Dibner Professor of the History of Engineering and Manufacturing and a professor of aeronautics and astronautics, focused on how AI technologies are changing workflow and skills, especially within sectors resistant to change. Mindell asked panelists for specific examples of implementing AI technologies into their companies.In response, David Johnson, vice president of production and engineering at Nissan, shared an anecdote about pairing an MIT student with a 20-year employee in developing AI methods to autonomously predict car-part quality. In the end, the veteran employee became immersed in the technology and is now using his seasoned expertise to deploy it in other areas, while the student learned more about the technology’s real-world applications. “Only through this synergy, when you purposely pair these people with a common goal, can you really drive the skills forward … for mass new technology adoption and deployment,” Johnson said.In a panel about shaping public policies to ensure technology benefits society — which included U.S. CTO Kratsios — moderator Erik Brynjolfsson, director of IDE and a professor in the MIT Sloan School of Management, got straight to the point: “People have been dancing around this question: Will AI destroy jobs?”“Yes, it will — but not to the extent that people presume,” replied MIT Institute Professor Daron Acemoglu. AI, he said, will mostly automate mundane operations in white-collar jobs, which will free up humans to refine their creative, interpersonal, and other high-level skills for new roles. Humans, he noted, also won’t be stuck doing low-paying jobs, such as labeling data for machine-learning algorithms.“That’s not the future of work,” he said. “The hope is we use our amazing creativity and all these wonderful and technological platforms to create meaningful jobs in which humans can use their flexibility, creativity, and all the things … machines won’t be able to do — at least in the next 100 years.”
Kratsios emphasized a need for public and private sectors to collaborate to reskill workers. Specifically, he pointed to the Pledge to the America’s Worker, the federal initiative that now has 370 U.S. companies committed to retraining roughly 4 million American workers for tech-based jobs over the next five years.Responding to an audience question about potential public policy changes, Kratsios echoed sentiments of many panelists, saying education policy should focus on all levels of education, not just college degrees. “A vast majority of our policies, and most of our departments and agencies, are targeted toward coaxing people toward a four-year degree,” Kratsios said. “There are incredible opportunities for Americans to live and work and do fantastic jobs that don’t require four-year degrees. So, [a change is] thinking about using the same pool of resources to reskill, or retrain, or [help students] go to vocational schools.”Inclusivity and underserved populationsEntrepreneurs at the event explained how AI can help create diverse workforces. For instance, a panel about creating economically and geographically diverse workforces, moderated by Devin Cook, executive producer of IDE’s Inclusive Innovation Challenge, included Radha Basu, who founded Hewlett Packard’s operations in India in the 1970s. In 2012, Basu founded iMerit, which hires employees — half are young women and more than 80 percent come from underserved populations — to provide AI services for computer vision, machine learning, and other applications.A panel hosted by Paul Osterman, co-director of the MIT Sloan Institute for Work and Employment Research and an MIT Sloan professor, explored how labor markets are changing in the face of technological innovations. Panelist Jacob Hsu is CEO of Catalyte, which uses an AI-powered assessment test to predict a candidate’s ability to succeed as a software engineer, and hires and trains those who are most successful. Many of their employees don’t have four-year degrees, and their ages range from anywhere from 17 to 72.A “media spotlight” session, in which journalists discussed their reporting on the impact of AI on the workplace and the world, included David Fanning, founder and producer of the investigative documentary series FRONTLINE, which recently ran a documentary titled “In the Era of AI.” Fanning briefly discussed how, during his investigations, he learned about the profound effect AI is having on workplaces in the developing world, which rely heavily on manual labor, such as manufacturing lines.“What happens as automation expands, the manufacturing ladder that was opened to people in developing countries to work their way out of rural poverty — all that manufacturing gets replaced by machines,” Fanning said. “Will we end up across the world with people who have nowhere to go? Will they become the new economic migrants we have to deal with in the age of AI?”Education: The great counterbalanceElisabeth Reynolds, executive director for the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future and of the MIT Industrial Performance Center, and Andrew McAfee, co-director of IDE and a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management, closed out the conference and discussed next steps.Reynolds said the MIT Task Force on the Work of the Future, over the next year, will further study how AI is being adopted, diffused, and implemented across the U.S., as well as issues of race and gender bias in AI. In closing, she charged the audience with helping tackle the issues: “I would challenge everybody here to say, ‘What on Monday morning is [our] organization doing in respect to this agenda?’” In paraphrasing economist Robert Gordon, McAfee reemphasized the shifting nature of jobs in the era of AI: “We don’t have a job quantity problem, we have a job quality problem.”AI may generate more jobs and company profits, but it may also have numerous negative effects on employees. Proper education and training are keys to ensuring the future workforce is paid well and enjoys a high quality of life, he said: “Tech progress, we’ve known for a long time, is an engine of inequality. The great counterbalancing force is education.”

She previously held various roles at Accenture. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Artificial intelligence is changing the way healthcare networks do business and physicians perform their routine activities from medical transcription to robot-assisted surgery. Although the more mature use-cases for AI in healthcare are those built on algorithms that have applications in various other industries (namely white-collar automation), we believe that in the coming three to five years, AI solutions for healthcare will become increasingly specialized to individual use-cases.  In phase two of the AI zeitgeist, leadership teams at healthcare networks will have familiarized themselves with basic AI concepts, and they’ll be able to work with vendors that offer AI solutions for very specific healthcare concerns. In this article, we look at the state of AI for epidemiology, the study of the incidence and spread of disease. The large majority of AI applications for epidemiology are predictive analytics applications, perhaps unsurprisingly.  Predictive analytics involves AI algorithms that use historical data to predict future outcomes. As such, there’s some evidence that they can help government bodies, community health organizations, and researchers figure out how a disease might originate in a population and how it might spread based on these predictions. Predictive analytics applications for epidemiology almost always require clients to supply very large quantities of anonymized patient data, which may prove challenging for research institutions that do not have robust partnerships with healthcare organizations.  Leaders interested in using AI for epidemiology should consider the data requirements of a vendor’s AI solution well before they choose to do business with a vendor. We cover four AI vendors offering artificial intelligence solutions for epidemiology: IBM. Saama, SAS, and Orion Health. We begin our analysis of the space with IBM Watson Health. IBM Watson Health IBM Watson Health offers the Explorys data set and analytics solution, which the company claims can provide life sciences companies and epidemiologists a better understanding of  disease history, epidemiology, and disease progression, and determine the economic impact for select populations. The company claims that knowing this will also enable organizations to identify efforts for deeper study and identify populations most likely to benefit from a treatment. The company states the machine learning model behind the analytics software was trained on ambulatory, inpatient, and adjudicated claims data of 50 million anonymized patients sourced from electronic medical record systems. The data would then be run through the software’s machine learning algorithm.  This would have trained the algorithm to discern which data points correlate to the rates of health events in a population, the history of disease, and their most successful treatments. The software would then be able to predict the incidence and prevalence of a disease in populations, disease treatment patterns, and treatment-related risks. Below is a short 5-minute video explaining how IBM Explorys Data integrates data from multiple care settings. This includes 3 to 4 years worth of individual patient data, encompassing ambulatory, in-patient, specialty care, and post-acute care. Other types of data include lab results, vitals, biometrics, and patient-reported outcomes. The video reports that data is updated daily and weekly:  IBM Watson claims to have helped Smart Analytics study the treatment journey of more than 6,500 psoriasis patients using IBM Explorys. One of SmartAnalytics’s customers, a pharmaceutical company, wanted to know how long it took for psoriasis patients to transition from topical to oral treatments and finally to injectable treatments.  SmartAnalyst turned to IBM Watson Health and used Explorys to discover that over the course of three years, patients tended to skip oral medications and immediately transition from topical remedies to injectables.  The Explorys dataset revealed that a large number of patients transitioned from topical therapy to injectables within 206 days, not enough time for some topical treatments to take effect. However, patients who tried oral treatments before switching to injectables took an average of 488 days. As a result of having this information, SmartAnalytics’s customer developed a communication plan to educate patients and doctors on the importance of giving oral medications time to take effect, and that the more expensive injectables are a last resort treatment. IBM Watson Health also lists AHMC Healthcare, Schneck Medical Center, SmartAnalyst, Edward-Elmhurst Healthcare, Harrow Council, Floyd Health Care System, and Hallmark Health Medical Associates as some of their past clients. Scott Spangler is the Chief Data Scientist and a Distinguished Engineer at IBM Watson Health. He holds an MS in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin. Previously, Spangler served first as Sr Tech. Staff Member and then as Principal Data Scientist, Distinguished Engineer at IBM Watson Innovations for 19 years. Saama Technologies Saama offers Real World Analytics, which it claims can help life sciences companies mine data that will allow them to monitor million-wide populations during clinical trials and forecast disease incidence or prevalence using machine learning. Saama claims that the application resides in the cloud. The company adds that the machine learning model behind the software was trained on data consisting of billions of patients’ electronic medical and health records. The data would then be run through the software’s machine learning algorithm. This would have trained the algorithm to discern which data points correlate to the efficacy of a drug.  The software would be able to predict treatment patterns such as shifts in the type of drug, the ideal duration of a treatment, and the prevalence and incidence rates of a disease. Below is a short 3-minute video demonstrating how Saama’s Real World Analytics uncovers data about treatment pathways of patients, in this case, with lung cancer. Users select the data source, diagnosis, and therapies to show the number of patients by gender and age, and reveal the popular treatments administered to them.  The results also show the duration of therapy as well as the period when patients change from one treatment to the another:  Saama claims to have helped Pharmacyclics, a company that developed and marketed small-molecule medicines to treat cancers and other autoimmune diseases, aggregate all its clinical operations data for a singular, central view. As its clinical operations grew, Pharmacyclics needed to maximize its clinical data better. However, the data silos made it difficult to generate automated and accurate reports. Pharmacyclics turned to Saama, which deployed its Clinical Development Optimizer (CDO), part of the Life Science Analytics Cloud.  The case study reports that the implementation of the CDO resulted in: A comprehensive view of clinical operations data Consolidated data and automated, error-free reports  More transparency and consistency in clinical operations data Enhanced collaboration among the business team members Standardized data and business definitions Improved data flow, data management, and governance Saama also lists Actelion, Astellas, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Brocade, Broadcom, Cisco, CSAA Insurance Group, Dignity Health, GoPro, Motorists Insurance Group, Otsuka, PayPal, Roche, and Unilever as some of its past clients. Rajeev Dadia is the CTO at Saama. He holds an MS in Computer Science from the California State University-Chico. Previously, Dadia served as IT Manager. SAS SAS offers its Real World Evidence, which it claims can help healthcare providers and life sciences companies better understand a population and improve population health and treatments by providing data from a wide variety of sources.  These sources include: The environment Electronic medical and health records Genomics  Socioeconomic data  Clinical trials,  Case reports Healthcare insurance claims,  Public health investigations The data will then be analyzed using machine learning and predictive analytics. The company states that the machine learning model behind the software was trained on point-of-care systems, electronic medical records, insurance claims, patient-reported outcomes, and third-party data.  The data would then be run through the software’s machine learning algorithm. This would have trained the algorithm to discern which data points correlate to, for instance, a drug’s utilization and performance, as well as the patient’s adherence to the treatment and treatment preferences. The software would be able to predict how the therapeutic value of an existing drug can be expanded by identifying new illnesses it can treat and new customers. This may or may not require the user to upload information about their new customer segments or plans for a marketing campaign into the software beforehand. SAS claims to be helping Renown Institute for Health Innovation (Renown IHI) better understand how genetic, clinical, environmental and socioeconomic factors affect population health. Renown IHI in September 2016 embarked on the Healthy Nevada Project and needed to develop an application that would reveal population health risks of patients based on gender, age, and personal or family health history.  The application will also be used to uncover public health risks of diseases, illnesses, and environmental factors such as air quality. According to the case study, the pilot phase of the project had enlisted 10,000 participants whose DNA samples had been collected in 60 working days. The project’s second phase opened to 40,000 more Nevadans last March 2018. SAS reported that using its application could potentially predict how environmental factors contribute to the Nevada population’s health, and understand what role age, gender, or genetics play. The results could then be used to progress precision medicine and other health innovations and research. SAS also lists Honda, Nestle, HSBC, Lufthansa, Health Data Essentials, OhioHealth, Stockholm County Council, University of new hampshire, and Western Australia Department of Health as some of its past clients. Orion Health Orion Health offers Amadeus, a population health management and precision medicine software, which it claims can help healthcare organizations handle large volumes of data to predict and differentiate the health risks in a population using machine learning. The company explains that having this capability will allow healthcare organizations to make quick and informed decisions. The company states the machine learning model behind the software was trained on claims, clinical, and non-traditional data such as omics, social, and behavioral data. The data would then be run through the software’s machine learning algorithm. This would have trained the algorithm to discern which data points correlate to the health risks of a population. The software would be able to predict which patients are at risk, the treatments that can be administered, as well as the accompanying costs. This may or may not require the user to upload information about their care-coordination programs or personalized care plans into the software beforehand. Below is a short 2-minute video demonstrating how Amadeus integrates health data such as claims, clinical, behavioural, social, genomic and device to ensure that physicians have complete patient records. The application then enables users to analyze this data to identify at-risk patients and provide specific treatments:  Orion Health claims to have helped the Scottsdale Health Partners (SHP), a physician-led clinical network that covers more than 60,000 patients, set up a health information exchange (HIE) that would provide complete, accurate patient data. The SHP turned to Orion Health to establish the HIE that would allow its more than 700 participating clinicians using disparate EMR software to share health information. The HIE also enabled the clinicians to identify at-risk patients, find data related to appropriate treatments, and simplify reporting. Using the application, the SHP was able to predict patients at-risk of readmission and the contributing factors after being discharged. This enabled them to develop programs to reduce the risks, resulting in a 9% decrease in readmissions within one year of the application’s deployment.  The case study also claims that within the same period, SHP was able to reduce costs by 10%, attributed to the predictions provided by the application. The case study also claims that SHP is the only Arizona Medicare Shared Savings Program to achieve an almost $3.75 million in savings, attributed to the application’s predictions. Orion Health also lists New Mexico Health Information Exchange, University of Louisville Hospital, Oregon Health Authority, Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, and Maine HealthInfoNet as some of their past clients. Ian McCrae is CEO at Orion Health. He holds an MS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Auckland. Previously, McCrae served as telecommunications consultant at Ernst & Young, Senior Business Analyst at the London Stock Exchange, and as a scientist at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.   Header Image Credit: CIR Vitals Related Posts Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity - Current Use-Cases and CapabilitiesAI has made some inroads in the cybersecurity sector and several AI vendors claim to… Artificial Intelligence at Goldman Sachs - Current InitiativesThe top 100 global banks, including Goldman Sachs, are beginning to take AI strategies very… Artificial Intelligence at Morgan Stanley - Current InitiativesMorgan Stanley is a US financial institution known mostly for its financial advisory services.

[+] speak languages, play soccer, and perform a myriad of other tasks like humans? Here’s what AI can learn from biology.AFP via Getty Images
In building the world’s first airplane at the dawn of the 20th century, the Wright Brothers took inspiration from the “insightful” movements of birds. They observed and reverse-engineered aspects of the wing in nature, which in turn helped them make important discoveries about aerodynamics and propulsion. 


Similarly, to build machines that think, why not seek inspiration from the three pounds of matter that operates between our ears? Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer of artificial intelligence and winner of the Turing Award, seemed to agree: “I have always been convinced that the only way to get artificial intelligence to work is to do the computation in a way similar to the human brain.” 

So what’s next for artificial intelligence (AI)? Could the next wave of AI be inspired by rapid advances in biology? Can the tools for understanding brain circuits at the molecular level lead us to a higher, systems-level understanding of how the human mind works? 

PROMOTED
The answer is likely yes, and the flow of ideas between learning about biological systems and developing artificial ones has actually been going on for decades. 

The origins of machine learning: human brain science
First of all, what does biology have to do with machine learning? It may surprise you to learn that much of the progress in machine learning stems from insights from psychology and neuroscience. Reinforcement learning (RL) — one of the three paradigms of machine learning (the two others being supervised learning and unsupervised learning) — originates from animal and cognitive neuroscience studies going all the way back to the 1940s. RL is central to some of today’s most advanced AI systems, such as AlphaGo, the widely-publicized AI agent developed by leading AI company Google DeepMind. AlphaGo defeated the world’s top-ranked players at Go, a Chinese board game that comprises more board combinations than there are atoms in the universe.

Despite AlphaGo’s superhuman performance in the game of Go, its human opponent still possesses far more general intelligence. He can drive a car, speak languages, play soccer, and perform a myriad of other tasks in any kind of environment. Current AI systems are largely incapable of using the knowledge learned to play poker and transfer it to another task, like playing a game of Cluedo. These systems are focused on a single, narrow environment and require vast amounts of data, and training time. And still, they make simple errors like mistaking a chihuahua for a muffin!

What children and AI systems have in common
Similar to child learning, reinforcement learning is based on the AI system’s interaction with its environment. It performs actions that seek to maximize the reward and avoid punishments. Driven by curiosity, children are active learners that simultaneously explore their surrounding environment and predict their actions’ outcomes, allowing them to build mental models to think causally. If, for example, they decide to push the red car, spill the flower vase, or crawl the other direction, they will adjust their behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. 
Children experience different environments in which they find themselves navigating and interacting with various contexts and objects’ dispositions, often in unusual manners. Just as child brain development could inspire the development of AI systems, the RL agent’s learning mechanisms are parallel to the brain’s learning mechanisms driven by the release of dopamine - a neurotransmitter key to the central nervous system - which trains the prefrontal cortex in response to experiences and thus shapes stimulus-response associations as well as outcome predictions. 
Synthetic biology and AI
Biology is one of the most promising beneficiaries of artificial intelligence. From investigating mind-boggling combinations of genetic mutations that contribute to obesity to examining the byzantine pathways that lead some cells to go haywire and produce cancer, biology produces an inordinate amount of complex, convoluted data. But the information contained within these datasets often offers valuable insights that could be used to improve our health.
In the field of synthetic biology, where engineers seek to “rewire” living organisms and program them with new functions, many scientists are harnessing AI to design more effective experiments, analyze their data, and use it to create groundbreaking therapeutics. I recently highlighted five companies that are integrating machine learning with synthetic biology to pave the way for better science and better engineering.
Artificial general intelligence: The holy grail of AI
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) describes a system that is capable of mimicking human-like abilities such as planning, reasoning, or emotions. Billions of dollars have been invested in this exciting and potentially lucrative area, leading some to make claims like “data is the new oil.”
Among the many companies working on general artificial intelligence are Google’s DeepMind, the Swiss AI lab IDSIA, Nnaisense, Vicarious, Maluuba, the OpenCog Foundation, Adaptive AI, LIDA, and Numenta. Organizations such as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute and OpenAI also state AGI as their main goal. One of the goals of the international Human Brain Project is to simulate the human brain.
Despite a growing body of talent, tools, and high-quality data needed to achieve AGI, we still have a long way to go to achieve this.
AI in our daily lives
Today, AI techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) are ubiquitous in our society, reaching from healthcare and manufacturing to transportation and warfare but are qualified as “narrow AI”. They indeed process and learn powerfully large amounts of data to identify insightful and informative patterns for a single task, such as predicting airline ticket prices, distinguishing dogs from cats in images, and generating your movie recommendations on Netflix.
In biology, AI is also changing your health care. It is generating more and better drug candidates (Insitro), sequencing your genome (Veritas Genetics), and detecting your cancer earlier and earlier (Freenom). 
Where do we go from here?
As humans, we are able to quickly acquire knowledge in one context and generalize it to another environment across novel multiple situations and tasks, which would allow us to develop more efficient self-driving car systems as they need to perform many tasks on the road concurrently. In AI research, this concept is known as transfer learning. It assists an AI system in learning from just a few examples — instead of the millions that traditional computing systems usually need — to build a system that learns from first principles, abstracts the acquired knowledge, and generalizes it to new tasks and contexts. 
To produce more advanced AI, we need to better understand the brain’s inner workings that allow us to portray the world around us. There is a synergistic mission between understanding biological intelligence and creating an artificial one, seeking inspiration from our brain might help us bridge that gap.

San Francisco
CNN
         — 
    


            Artificial intelligence doesn’t know what to make of Os Keyes. 
    

            The 29-year-old graduate student is dark-haired, tattooed and openly transgender, using the pronouns “they” or “them.” Facial analysis software, however, typically assigns each face it analyzes one of two labels: male or female.
    

            The software literally can’t categorize Keyes correctly.
    

            Yet for Keyes, who studies gender, technology and power at the University of Washington, this technology is not simply software that doesn’t get it right. According to them, it’s also representative of how companies are not thinking through how power is distributed and norms are reinforced by such software. And Keyes — like a number of other experts in AI and in gender issues who spoke with CNN Business — is concerned about how these AI classifications could police, restrict, or otherwise harm transgender people, as well as those who don’t look stereotypically male or female. 
    

            “The people producing this software are producing something that, in a small way, makes people like me miserable and keeps us miserable,” Keyes told CNN Business. 
    


   


            Top tech companies including Microsoft, Amazon and, until recently, IBM, have all invested in technology that can tag pictures of faces fed to their AI systems with binary labels such as “male” and “female,” along with predicting other characteristics, such as whether they are wearing glasses or makeup. A company might, as Amazon suggests in a company blog post, use this gender-prediction feature to analyze footage of shoppers at their stores to learn about how many are men and how many are women. The technology is often offered alongside facial recognition software, though they may be separate systems.

            But there is a fatal flaw: The way a computer sees gender isn’t always the same way people see it. A growing number of terms for describing one’s gender are becoming common in everyday life. Over a dozen states and Washington, DC, currently or will soon offer a third gender option, “X,” on drivers’ licenses. Companies such as United Airlines now let customers pick the pronoun “X” or the gender-neutral honorific “Mx” when booking a ticket. On Instagram, 9 million posts are tagged as “transgender” and over 7 million as “trans.” Well over 3 million posts are tagged with the hashtag “nonbinary.” Gender diversity is on smartphones, too, as both Apple and Google offer nonbinary emoji.
    



        “We need to push back on the idea that these systems should exist at all, and look at these kind of assumptions—that someone’s body or face or style or hair can kind of detect their interior state or identity.”
    

            Meredith Whittaker, former Google employee and cofounder of NYU's AI Now Institute
        


            As these societal changes proliferate, AI-driven conclusions have become more than a gender identity concern. Some AI experts and members of the transgender community are worried about the potential for serious repercussions if gender recognition, as it exists today, is put to use for more complicated and sensitive tasks, whether it be using AI to help screen job candidates or nab criminal suspects. 


            Keyes is personally afraid it could enable a surveillance system to issue alerts when someone of the “wrong gender” walks into a bathroom or changing room. Indeed, one AI startup told CNN Business that it offers a gender prediction system that could help security guards flag men who are in an all-female dormitory, or vice versa.
    

            “What you’re talking about is deliberately putting trans people, who don’t have the best relationship with law enforcement, on a collision course with law enforcement,” Keyes said.

            Already, AI that scans your face is being used for security applications at concerts, airports, sports arenas and more. These sensitive use cases only raise the stakes for how peoples’ lives could be upended by a few lines of code.
    

            “I think we need to push back on the idea that these systems should exist at all, and look at these kind of assumptions — that someone’s body or face or style or hair can kind of detect their interior state or identity,” said Meredith Whittaker, a former Google employee and cofounder of New York University’s AI Now Institute, which studies social impacts of AI.

Os Keyes, a graduate student at the University of Washington, worries that artificial intelligence could put transgender people ""on a collision course with law enforcement"" based on how it categorizes gender.

Dorothy Edwards/Crosscut



        Tech (mostly) doesn’t want to talk about it


            The tech companies are mostly staying quiet on these concerns. Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment for this story. IBM, which appeared to stop offering facial-analysis services in September, also declined to comment. Kairos and Megvii, both AI startups that offer such services, didn’t respond to requests for comment. (Google, which offers image-identification features through its Cloud Vision service, doesn’t appear to offer a gender-labeling feature as part of its facial analysis tools, but the company declined to confirm whether or not this is the case.)
    











            Only one company contacted by CNN Business, New York-based startup Clarifai, was willing to speak. Kyle Martinowich, VP of commercial sales and marketing, said Clarifai built its AI model for predicting gender in response to customer demand. He said those customers now range from bricks-and-mortar stores — who may use Clarifai’s technology to figure out how many women walk down a particular aisle — to the US government — which may use it for gathering information about the types of people walking through airports or into federal buildings.
    

            Clarifai’s system for recognizing gender was trained on a data set of over 30 million images, each of which was annotated as masculine or feminine by three different people. Given how small the trans population is — an estimated 1.4 million adults in the US alone, or 0.6% of the adult population — there’s no training data available to help the company incorporate trans individuals into its gender predictions, according to Martinowich. And he argued it’s not worth the money it would cost to source such data. But if a customer offered to pay the company to make such a product, and brought its own data, he said Clarifai would comply.
    

            Martinowich stressed there are limits to what Clarifai would allow customers to do with its services. For instance, he said that “if the Congolese government called us and said, ‘We want to stop females from entering an all-male building,’ we wouldn’t sell them that. And if we found out, we would cut our service off to them.”
    

            Yet, he also said Clarifai is talking to companies that offer single-sex dormitories about how the startup’s automated gender-identification could be used for safety and security purposes — not to deny someone entry to a building, but to flag a security guard “who would need to make the human determination” about whether a person should be rejected from a building.
    

        How well does the technology work?


            The automated facial analysis systems used by tech companies invariably compute gender as one of two groups — male or female. This may come with a numerical score indicating how confident the computer is that the face it sees looks like one gender or the other.

            Yet a small but growing area of research indicates there are a number of issues with using AI to spot gender, such as increased error rates when it comes to identifying women of color and concerns about accuracy in general. 
    

            There’s also the question of how well the technology works when it encounters pictures of people that identify themselves differently than the software might. As Morgan Klaus Scheuerman, a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, found in a recent study, facial analysis systems from major tech companies were all markedly worse at determining gender when confronted with images of people who are trans. 
    

            Scheuerman and other researchers built a dataset of 2,450 photos of faces from Instagram that had been labeled by their authors with one of seven different gender-related hashtags such as “transman”, “transwoman”, “man”, “woman” and “nonbinary.” Then they ran the images through facial-analysis services from Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, and Clarifai.
    

            The results? On average, the services classified photos tagged “woman” as “female” 98.3% of the time, and photos tagged “man” as “male” 97.6% of the time. 
    

            When it came to images tagged “transwoman” or “transman”, however, they fared far worse. Photos with the “transwoman” tag were identified as “female” over 87.3% of the time, but photos tagged as “transman” were labeled as “male” just 70.5% of the time. Amazon did most poorly when it came to labeling “transman”-tagged photos as male, which it did just 61.7% of the time.
    



        “Any time you try to codify gender norms, either into laws or into algorithms, you’re bound to have an impact on anyone who’s not Ron Swanson or Barbie.”
    

            Gillian Branstetter, former spokesperson for the National Center for Transgender Equality
        


            Scheuerman said this may indicate that images of trans men are not included in training these AI systems to determine what men look like.
    

            “I think the real danger is this notion of objectivity,” said Scheuerman, a long-haired, facial-piercing-bedecked student who studies gender and technology and has repeatedly been misidentified by these systems. “The idea that because this is trained, this system is super advanced, then it must be making these objective, data-driven decisions that have to be correct.”
    

            It may also be seen as another way in which the technology humans build falls short when it comes to analyzing a more diverse population than may be found on some tech engineering teams — which are often largely male and white. Human biases, such as sexist notions, can seep into machine-learning software in particular, regardless of creators’ intentions.
    

        Even tech companies can’t control how gender ID is used


            As with so many other use cases of artificial intelligence, it can be hard to understand the full impact of the technology’s gender identifications — or misidentifications — on peoples’ lives because the systems frequently operate in a black box. Often the deployment of AI that analyzes faces, whether it’s done by a police department or a department store, is not publicly disclosed, and many countries (including the US) have few laws governing its use.
    

            This concerns Gillian Branstetter, spokesperson for the National Center for Transgender Equality until November, who points out it can impact not just trans people, but anyone. “Any time you try to codify gender norms, either into laws or into algorithms, you’re bound to have an impact on anyone who’s not Ron Swanson or Barbie,” she said.
    

            To make matters more complicated, companies are already using commercially available AI to deduce gender for a number of reasons — and they’re not always using it in the ways the creators intended. 
    

            For instance, Amazon writes in its online Rekognition developer guide that gender predictions from its facial analysis service are “not designed to categorize a person’s gender identity” and shouldn’t be used to do so. (According to the version of the developer guide that Amazon maintains on Github, this kind of language was added in late September; previously, it included no guidance about how the technology was intended to be used.) 
    






Morgan Klaus Scheuerman, a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, ran the same image of his face through facial analysis systems from two different companies. One determined his face was male, while the other identified it as female.

            Yet Woo, an Indian dating app that matches heterosexual couples, uses Rekognition’s gender-identifying feature mainly to help make sure the gender that users state in their profile matches up with the images of themselves they post within the app, said Woo cofounder and CEO Sumesh Menon. 
    

            If there’s a perceived mismatch, a human worker will be notified, and they may contact the user to ask if their gender is incorrectly stated in the app, Menon said. Men, for instance, have accidentally labeled themselves as women in the past, then complained that they were only seeing other men as potential matches.
    

            “It’s not very nuanced; it’s very straightforward,” he said. “But it is super helpful in how we are able to present profiles to the right gender.”
    

            However, it shows that companies selling this AI technology can’t control its deployment once it’s in the hands of customers. (Woo is listed, along with a testimonial from Menon, on an Amazon Rekognition Customers page.)
    

            “That’s in a way proving the point that there’s no way to really ensure your client is using this in an ethical way or a way you intended it to be used,” said Scheuerman.
    

        Nix it, or fix it?


            Despite the ethical concerns, businesses believe there is a clear value in having this gender data — but only if the data itself is accurate. To that end, rather than abandon the feature, some companies are now wrestling with how to improve its predictive capabilities.
    

            Limbik, a startup that calls itself a “data studio for short-form video,” uses AI to analyze videos and predict what people will want to watch. The startup turns to AI from Amazon and IBM to identify gender in videos and analyze all manner of things, such as how frequently men pop up in a certain kind of commercial.
    

            But Limbik CEO Zach Schwitzky said his company has “struggled with binary classification.” Two common issues he encounters with the software include short-haired females being classified as males, and people who appear to be teenagers being misclassified as either gender. In his experience, existing automated gender identification works well for anyone who’s between 25 and 35, but that it’s not as helpful for people who are older or younger.
    


   


            Now, Limbik is building its own software to label gender in images, which to start includes three categories: male, female, and other. Eventually, the company may add more categories, too. Right now, the company is sorting images by hand from sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram; these will be used to train an AI model, Schwitzky said.
    

            “I just struggle to think about how to do it in a way that it could be done accurately and effectively,” Schwitzky said.
    

            The research community, too, is wrestling with how to represent gender. Aaron Smith, director of Data Labs at Pew Research Center, said the issue of how to accurately represent gender and gender identity “is a topic of huge interest,” particularly to those who study AI.
    

            Yet whether AI can be built that could accurately identify gender on a broader spectrum, or perhaps consider any characteristics beyond outward appearances, is still largely unknown.
    

            Smith isn’t sure whether technology will eventually be able to suss out a person’s internal identity. He notes that that identity can be “inherently opaque” to AI systems making assessments based on outward appearances.


            For those like Keyes, who are worried about the consequences of using AI to recognize gender, there’s a belief that no amount of tinkering will make these systems work or even worthwhile. 
    

            “You could add a million categories, and unless you’re adding one category per person you’re never going to get to a place where you can work out someone’s gender from their face,” Keyes said.

The 29-year-old graduate student is dark-haired, tattooed and openly transgender, using the pronouns “they” or “them.” Facial analysis software, however, typically assigns each face it analyzes one of two labels: male or female. The software literally can’t categorize Keyes correctly. Yet for Keyes, who studies gender, technology and power at the University of Washington, this technology is not simply software that doesn’t get it right. According to them, it’s also representative of how companies are not thinking through how power is distributed and norms are reinforced by such software. And Keyes — like a number of other experts in AI and in gender issues who spoke with CNN Business — is concerned about how these AI classifications could police, restrict, or otherwise harm transgender people, as well as those who don’t look stereotypically male or female.  “The people producing this software are producing something that, in a small way, makes people like me miserable and keeps us miserable,” Keyes told CNN Business.  Top tech companies including Microsoft, Amazon and, until recently, IBM, have all invested in technology that can tag pictures of faces fed to their AI systems with binary labels such as “male” and “female,” along with predicting other characteristics, such as whether they are wearing glasses or makeup. A company might, as Amazon suggests in a company blog post, use this gender-prediction feature to analyze footage of shoppers at their stores to learn about how many are men and how many are women. The technology is often offered alongside facial recognition software, though they may be separate systems. But there is a fatal flaw: The way a computer sees gender isn’t always the same way people see it. A growing number of terms for describing one’s gender are becoming common in everyday life. Over a dozen states and Washington, DC, currently or will soon offer a third gender option, “X,” on drivers’ licenses. Companies such as United Airlines now let customers pick the pronoun “X” or the gender-neutral honorific “Mx” when booking a ticket. On Instagram, 9 million posts are tagged as “transgender” and over 7 million as “trans.” Well over 3 million posts are tagged with the hashtag “nonbinary.” Gender diversity is on smartphones, too, as both Apple and Google offer nonbinary emoji. As these societal changes proliferate, AI-driven conclusions have become more than a gender identity concern. Some AI experts and members of the transgender community are worried about the potential for serious repercussions if gender recognition, as it exists today, is put to use for more complicated and sensitive tasks, whether it be using AI to help screen job candidates or nab criminal suspects.  Keyes is personally afraid it could enable a surveillance system to issue alerts when someone of the “wrong gender” walks into a bathroom or changing room. Indeed, one AI startup told CNN Business that it offers a gender prediction system that could help security guards flag men who are in an all-female dormitory, or vice versa. “What you’re talking about is deliberately putting trans people, who don’t have the best relationship with law enforcement, on a collision course with law enforcement,” Keyes said.  Already, AI that scans your face is being used for security applications at concerts, airports, sports arenas and more. These sensitive use cases only raise the stakes for how peoples’ lives could be upended by a few lines of code. “I think we need to push back on the idea that these systems should exist at all, and look at these kind of assumptions — that someone’s body or face or style or hair can kind of detect their interior state or identity,” said Meredith Whittaker, a former Google employee and cofounder of New York University’s AI Now Institute, which studies social impacts of AI.   Tech (mostly) doesn’t want to talk about it The tech companies are mostly staying quiet on these concerns. Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment for this story. IBM, which appeared to stop offering facial-analysis services in September, also declined to comment. Kairos and Megvii, both AI startups that offer such services, didn’t respond to requests for comment. (Google, which offers image-identification features through its Cloud Vision service, doesn’t appear to offer a gender-labeling feature as part of its facial analysis tools, but the company declined to confirm whether or not this is the case.) Only one company contacted by CNN Business, New York-based startup Clarifai, was willing to speak. Kyle Martinowich, VP of commercial sales and marketing, said Clarifai built its AI model for predicting gender in response to customer demand. He said those customers now range from bricks-and-mortar stores — who may use Clarifai’s technology to figure out how many women walk down a particular aisle — to the US government — which may use it for gathering information about the types of people walking through airports or into federal buildings. Clarifai’s system for recognizing gender was trained on a data set of over 30 million images, each of which was annotated as masculine or feminine by three different people. Given how small the trans population is — an estimated 1.4 million adults in the US alone, or 0.6% of the adult population — there’s no training data available to help the company incorporate trans individuals into its gender predictions, according to Martinowich. And he argued it’s not worth the money it would cost to source such data. But if a customer offered to pay the company to make such a product, and brought its own data, he said Clarifai would comply. Martinowich stressed there are limits to what Clarifai would allow customers to do with its services. For instance, he said that “if the Congolese government called us and said, ‘We want to stop females from entering an all-male building,’ we wouldn’t sell them that. And if we found out, we would cut our service off to them.” Yet, he also said Clarifai is talking to companies that offer single-sex dormitories about how the startup’s automated gender-identification could be used for safety and security purposes — not to deny someone entry to a building, but to flag a security guard “who would need to make the human determination” about whether a person should be rejected from a building. How well does the technology work? The automated facial analysis systems used by tech companies invariably compute gender as one of two groups — male or female. This may come with a numerical score indicating how confident the computer is that the face it sees looks like one gender or the other. Yet a small but growing area of research indicates there are a number of issues with using AI to spot gender, such as increased error rates when it comes to identifying women of color and concerns about accuracy in general.  There’s also the question of how well the technology works when it encounters pictures of people that identify themselves differently than the software might. As Morgan Klaus Scheuerman, a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, found in a recent study, facial analysis systems from major tech companies were all markedly worse at determining gender when confronted with images of people who are trans.  Scheuerman and other researchers built a dataset of 2,450 photos of faces from Instagram that had been labeled by their authors with one of seven different gender-related hashtags such as “transman”, “transwoman”, “man”, “woman” and “nonbinary.” Then they ran the images through facial-analysis services from Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, and Clarifai. The results? On average, the services classified photos tagged “woman” as “female” 98.3% of the time, and photos tagged “man” as “male” 97.6% of the time.  When it came to images tagged “transwoman” or “transman”, however, they fared far worse. Photos with the “transwoman” tag were identified as “female” over 87.3% of the time, but photos tagged as “transman” were labeled as “male” just 70.5% of the time. Amazon did most poorly when it came to labeling “transman”-tagged photos as male, which it did just 61.7% of the time. Scheuerman said this may indicate that images of trans men are not included in training these AI systems to determine what men look like. “I think the real danger is this notion of objectivity,” said Scheuerman, a long-haired, facial-piercing-bedecked student who studies gender and technology and has repeatedly been misidentified by these systems. “The idea that because this is trained, this system is super advanced, then it must be making these objective, data-driven decisions that have to be correct.” It may also be seen as another way in which the technology humans build falls short when it comes to analyzing a more diverse population than may be found on some tech engineering teams — which are often largely male and white. Human biases, such as sexist notions, can seep into machine-learning software in particular, regardless of creators’ intentions.  Even tech companies can’t control how gender ID is used As with so many other use cases of artificial intelligence, it can be hard to understand the full impact of the technology’s gender identifications — or misidentifications — on peoples’ lives because the systems frequently operate in a black box.

The new law, which takes effect on January 1, 2020, regulates Illinois employers’ use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the interview and hiring process.",N/A,https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,"
It’s time for employers to start preparing for legislation recently signed into law in Illinois, the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act. The new law, which takes effect on January 1, 2020, regulates Illinois employers’ use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the interview and hiring process.
Under the AI Video Interview Act, employers that record video interviews and use AI technology to analyze applicants’ suitability for employment must:

inform applicants that AI technology may be used to evaluate their interviews;
provide applicants with a written explanation of the technology’s mechanics, including the traits that will be reviewed and analyzed by AI and the characteristics the AI program uses to evaluate applicants; and
acquire applicants’ prior consent to be assessed by AI technology.

Employers that conduct such interviews may not distribute videos to other parties, except as necessary to obtain expert assistance in evaluating a candidate’s fitness for a particular position. In addition, an employer has only 30 days to destroy all video copies of the interview if an applicant seeks such destruction.
This law highlights a myriad of privacy concerns for employers evaluating the costs and benefits of incorporating AI technology into their hiring practices. As a preliminary matter, employers should consider designing, maintaining, and testing their security systems to ensure that they can (1) comply with their 30-day destruction obligation and (2) prevent unauthorized third parties from acquiring interview videos.
Passage of the Act further highlights how companies may need to implement effective breach-detection processes, act in a timely manner upon receipt of system alerts and warnings, and maintain industry-standard data security measures to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information. Employers with inadequate security precautions may be liable for the negligent distribution of interview videos. In an era when recordings can be reproduced in seconds, potential security breaches may make it difficult—if not impossible—for employers to ensure that they have adequately confirmed the destruction of all video copies.
The potential for information security breaches concerning interview videos poses a host of privacy concerns. For instance, third parties illegally acquiring interview videos could use voice and facial recognition software to mine identifier data. Voice and facial recognition software uses videos to detect and transform voice and facial images into digital data, and data of this type resides in large databases.
Progressively more governmental and other private entities are using this technology as a sophisticated alternative to established biometric measurements, such as fingerprints. This, in turn, creates an increased fear of function creep, or the use of technology outside its intended purpose, and employers may want to take prophylactic measures to protect video interviews and avoid the liabilities associated with having such data land in the wrong hands.
Employers that currently use (or plan to use) AI to analyze applicants should consider preparing the documentation and consents required by the AI Video Interview Act to ensure compliance with the Act’s January 1, 2020, effective date. In addition, those employers may want to provide employees who have the authority to hire or interview applicants with training and written guidance to ensure compliance with the statute’s mandates.
Balancing the above-described risks of using such information against the benefits of AI technology, which can help employers quickly evaluate applicants, make more informed hiring decisions, and potentially reduce attrition and terminations, will be a very company-specific calculation. Those who decide to rely on technology will need to keep current with new legislation such as this statute, protect their applicants’ privacy rights, and prevent technology use outside its intended function. Because Illinois increasingly follows California in introducing progressive employment legislation, employers may wish to contact their state representatives and senators to provide feedback and recommended changes to pending legislation.

When you step back and look at AI, yes there is hype, it will replace all jobs. We say look that's not the right way to approach it. The correct way to say is that this set of artificial intelligence technologies will augment and assist humans to do their work better,” Ashvin Vellody, Partner, Deloitte India told indianexpress.com during an interaction. According to a new report by Deloitte and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), AI could prove to be most beneficial in areas like agriculture, manufacturing, education and health care services in India. Regarding AI and the ‘jobs’ crisis that often comes up, he said nothing is further from the truth. “AI will free the person to explore other upscaling areas that he or she might be interested in. It'll allow mundane activity to be taken away,” he said pointing out that in many cases they are already seeing examples of dangerous activity being handed over to machines who can do the job better. “It is activities, not the job that gets outsourced. We have seen in energy mining. The trends from both private sector and public sector organisations working in space show active use of AI. To inspect level of this natural resources in different parts of the ground, AI is being used, ” he pointed out. Vellody says one needs to take a more holistic view when viewing the growing implementation of AI in enterprises across India. “In manufacturing, whether it is large scale production of goods, we see a substantial input of AI, ML. One way is to manage demand, to know how many units to produce, what not to produce. Then the other part is to understand your customers demand, and the customers better,” he said. But he also notes that there are several challenges, including one where senior leadership in organisations will have to embrace AI. “Many times what is happening is these technologies suffer from what I call being in perpetual proof of concept (POC). We found that a large number of projects stop at the POC level. Second is that the data sets have to be good to make the use cases possible,” he said. In his view, India has a unique potential for data sets to solve different problems, but notes that privacy issues and anonymisation of data cannot be ignored. He acknowledges there is hesitation and lack of clarity around privacy and AI, which pose a challenge. According to the report, AI can also impact agriculture in India by helping the sector with accurate climate patterns, more sustainable irrigation and water management, which will be crucial in light of the growing water crisis in the country. But there are challenges to AI implementation as the report notes. Cultural barriers, bridging the skills gap and the need of good quality data sets for reliable AI, along with the relatively higher costs of AI computation still need to be solved. Further the lack of transparency in decision making and poor accountability structures along potential bias and discrimination in AI decision add to the challenges.",,en,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.ie-premium-content-block', 'video': [], 'audio': []}","{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-16,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",1932,JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,The Indian Express,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/indian-express-logo-n.svg', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'width': 600, 'height': 60, 'caption': 'The Indian Express'}","{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Express Building, B-1/B, Sector-10', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}","['https://www.facebook.com/indianexpress', 'https://twitter.com/IndianExpress', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/indian-express', 'https://www.instagram.com/indianexpress/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJEDFSxHHOW1PpBccdSxOTA']","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://indianexpress.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",2024,"{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/11/artificial-intelligence.jpg', 'caption': 'AI can reduce hiring lag in an organization through remote communication.', 'description': 'Advent of AI in recruitment', 'width': 1200, 'height': 675}","{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'IE Premium', 'productID': 'indianexpress.com:showcase'}",,

Called upon by the United Nations, World Bank, INTERPOL, and leading enterprises, Daniel is a globally sought-after expert on the competitive strategy implications of AI for business and government leaders. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  It isn’t surprising that many Google search results for “artificial intelligence for government surveillance” involve China. The consensus is that China is either catching up or overtaking the US in AI research, and it’s quite open about using AI for government surveillance of its own people.  While it might be the most aggressive surveillance state on earth – China isn’t the only nation to deploy AI for surveillance purposes – and in this article we set out to explore the new and unique uses of domestic surveillance and spying applications of AI around the world. Emerj CEO Daniel Faggella presenting Emerj research and predictions about AI for law enforcement and surveillance at INTERPOL’s innovation center in Singapore, 2018 (Read the full article) The US has a long history with government surveillance, starting in 1928 with wiretapping. Many people still remember the startling revelations in 2013 of National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden about exactly what the US government is compelling phone companies to do with their personal calls. Government surveillance is also a growing concern in Russia, the UK and Australia as well as the UAE. This is not to say that government surveillance is always a bad thing. As with most technology, AI has its pros and cons, and with the correct application, the benefits (say, for crime prevention) could be argued to outweigh the costs. However, AI technology is often challenging to regulate, so misuse and abuse is a real concern. Video monitoring is the most prevalent and well-known use of AI-based government surveillance. Whether it is through closed circuit television (CCTV) or unmanned drone, many people believe that someone is watching at all times, especially in public areas and secure areas such as airports.  Today’s surveillance technologies take many forms – well beyond the stationary security camera in a mall or airport. In this article, we explore seven specific, unique AI surveillance use-cases around the world: Robotic birds Smart glasses AI-enabled body cameras EEG headbands Uniforms Wristbands Social Credit Score We’ll begin by exploring one of the more unique use-cases on our list: Robotic Birds Though extensive of discussion on robotics and drones as an instrument for covert civilian surveillance is available elsewhere, some tactics to bring this about is worth mentioning for sheer cleverness.One of these is drones that look and move like birds, but take much more interest in the people below them than real ones will ever do. Birds are everywhere, and most people do not give them much attention. This fact has brought about an interest in using bird forms to carry out surveillance. Robotic birds capable of autonomy and staying in the air for more than a few minutes have been around since 2011 with Festo’s Smartbird, which looks and moves like a herring gill.  However, the first iteration of robotic birds for video surveillance is doves rather than gulls. Appropriately called the Dove program, a team of top scientists at the Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian led by Song Bifeng developed bird drones for deployment in several areas in China, particularly Xinjiang. While the program is still in its early stages, Dove team member Yang Wenqingsays she believes it “has some unique advantages to meet the demand for drones in the military and civilian sectors.” Of particular benefit is the ability of these drones to go about largely undetected, even by radar. Here is an illustration of the Dove itself: Source: SCMP SCMP hosts a one-minute video showing this robotic dove in flight. The US Army reportedly invested in bird-like drone technology in 2013, purchasing 30 microdrones called Maveric fromPrioria Robotics. However, these are much chunkier than the Chinese Dove, and one company claimed it is a substandard product overall.  Whatever the case, there is no indication that the US has progressed any further in bird-like technology for domestic video surveillance. The nearest the US has come to this type of aerial drone surveillance was during an NYC new year’s celebration – and the effort was foiled by the rain. Smart Glasses Another way the government might be monitoring its citizens is through “smart” glasses equipped with facial recognition software to scan faces and match them to persons of interest in second. Developed byXloong, these augmented reality (AR) eyewear (such as the AR Boss Smart Glasses Techlens T2) provide law enforcement with a quick way to patrol a large number of people. With China’s plans to create adatabase of its 1.3 billion citizens for facial recognition, it is definitely a good match.  Below is the sports version of the Xloong AR glasses:  According to this article, expanded use of such smart glasses to Southeast Asian countries and the US is in the works. However, such technology is already available in the US. In fact, the company LLVision that supplied the AR product GLXSS to Chinese law enforcement is remarkably similar to the commercially less-than-successful Google Glass, which incidentally is making a comeback as an enterprise rather than consumer product. AI-enabled Body Cameras Wearable surveillance tech is also making its debut in Malaysia through body cameras. The Auxiliary Force Sdn. Bhd. (AFSB) struck a deal with YITU Technology to supply them with video systems using facial recognition to look for criminals. AFSB CEO Dato’ Rosmadi Bin Ghazali stated: “This is a significant step forward for us as we leverage artificial intelligence to increase public safety and security.” Unlike China, however, the AFSB facial recognition system analyzes captured footage rather than live feeds, although the AFSB plans to expand it in that direction.  At leastone law enforcement agency in the US is using Amazon’s facial recognition systemRekognition in a similar, though less obtrusive way. Instead of body cameras, the police use the system to collate videos and images online, dash cams, and from other sources to find matches to a database of persons of interest. While apparently very useful in identifying criminates, concerns aboutaccuracy and racial profiling continue to restrict its widespread use in law enforcement. The Washington Post hosts a 6:11-minute video on law enforcement uses of the Rekognition system, and the resulting questions about privacy that they stir up. The Wall Street Journal summarizes China’s growing us of surveillance technology in the short video below:  China is also beginning to employ facial recognition and computer vision in classrooms, inuring students to surveillance at a young age, and – purportedly – encouraging greater concentration and focus in the classroom:  For better or for worse, artificial intelligence applications for government surveillance are likely to proliferate as these use-cases (in airports, schools, shopping malls) gain traction and prove valuable from an economic or security perspective. EEG Headbands An interesting development in AI wearable tech is brainwave monitoring. North America boasts dozens of electroencephalography (EEG) startups – including brands like Muse, Thync, and others. Most of these brands claim to aide in some kind of mood control (aiding with focus or meditation, for example), while others serve as open platforms for brain-computer interface experiments. The Chinese government sanctioned the use of brain monitoring equipment on employees to capture data on emotions and other brain activities. Employees wear sensor-equipped caps and special cameras developed by Deayea Technology Co., Ltd.. Dubbed “emotional surveillance,” the project targets train operators, military personnel, production workers in some sectors, and perhaps schoolchildren in the future, to increase productivity and efficiency. US-based company BrainCo plans to provide headband brain-reading units called Focus for a pilot study in China. The idea is to help teachers identify students that might need extra help. Below is a 3:21-minute video demonstrating how the Focus system works:  Uniforms It would be difficult to decide if this is as worrisome when it comes to extreme control as “intelligent uniforms” students at 10 schools in Guizhou Province have to wear. Chips integrated into these uniforms track and identify students, enabling parents, teachers, and other figures of authority to know where they are at all times. Yet China is not alone in using AI to monitor schoolchildren. Federally funded schools have to install Safety Management Platforms (SMPs) – such as Securly, and GoGuardian – in school computers to monitor student activity.  These SMPs use natural language processing to scan the millions of words typed by students into these computer to look for undesirable acts (bullying) or harmful behavior (self harm).  A school in France is using Nestor software for two online classes to see if students are paying attention to a lecture. Below is a 1-minute promotion video for GoGuardian, highlighting its value proposition for teachers, and reviewing its basic features:  Wristbands Students are not the only targeted population segment under scrutiny, however. Prison inmates expect to be under constant surveillance, such as cameras covering most of the prison, including cells. However, Yancheng Prison in Hong Kong is apparently prepared to go a bit farther, including robotic arms checking waste matter for drug stashes (such at pills wrapped in plastic), and wristbands. According to SCMP: Woo said other new technology, such as a wristband to be tested at Lo Wu Correctional Institution, would help officers prevent suicides. … The wristband, which is similar to fitness products sold on the market, would allow officers to monitor an inmate’s heart rate and whereabouts in real time. “If the pulse is irregular, staff will be alerted,” [Commissioner of Correctional Services Danny Woo Ying-ming] said. Should an inmate try to remove the wristband, the alarm will also be triggered. Below is a one-minute video illustrating how camera surveillance might work in Yancheng Prison – according to a report by the South China Morning Post:  It isn’t entirely clear whether the wristbands of waste-inspecting robots leverage artificial intelligence at this time – but the technologies could certainly be combined with computer vision to create a tighter perspective on Artificial Intelligence for “Social Credit” Scoring There is an episode in the Twilight Zone-esque British television series Black Mirror entitled “Nosedive” that explored a world where social media, eye implants, and a star rating system dictates each person’s place in that world. A high star rating system means more privileges, while a low star rating means becoming a virtual outcast. While the basis of the premise is on peer acceptance and largely subjective and arbitrary, an eerily similar scenario is in the making with the Social Credit Score program – a national reputation system being developed by the Chinese government. The premise behind the program is basic governance: Punish the bad, reward the good. The idea is to motivate Chinese citizens to be good members of society so they can enjoy the benefits. The national rollout of the program will be in 2020, but dozens of pilot programs are gathering data to make it more responsive. The problem with this system is not the bad things that can happen to people with low scores, but the sources of data used to separate the good from the bad. As might be expected, the data from social media and other online activities would definitely be part of the mix. Such a comprehensive sweep of each person’s private and personal information is certainly a disturbing thought, especially in the hands of an openly authoritarian state. Add to that the fact that there is no transparency to the algorithms used to determine ranking. In a very real sense, the government can control a person’s socioeconomic success or failure. France 24 put together a 4-minute video exploring the social scoring system from the perspective of Chinese citizens:  Its hard to keep 1.4 billion people in line, and China’s social score (combined with a more obedient Confucian culture) might help the ruling party do just that.  Some experts – including Emerj founder Daniel Faggella – believe that China’s surveillance technologies will lift AI-based monitoring to a level of new “normal” – potentially spreading the more invasive use-cases of these technologies to Western nations. European countries, including the UK, might consider implementing a similar program for its citizens, although survey results indicate a majority (78%) or participants thought it was a bad idea. The growing awareness of China’s scoring system has prompted mostly a dystopian sentiment from Western citizens and news outlets. Concluding Thoughts on AI for Government Surveillance Government surveillance is integral to national security. It is necessary to ensure the safety and security of its citizens from internal and external factors. However, it is not always easy to discern the fine line between security and control. That said, there is also a fine line that separates advocacy from paranoia. The key is achieving the right balance in either case, depending on the context. China features quite prominently in many of current applications of artificial intelligence for government surveillance, and frequently in a negative light. However, it is important for privacy advocates to understand that the cultural and ideological differences between China and Western countries are huge. China’s policies on privacy and personal freedom work for them, and condemning them from a Western point of view is ineffectual as well as offensive. There is even theidea that when it comes to AI for government surveillance and data protection, China has a better understanding of the best way to engage with AI. Whether this is true or not, the fact is China is handling the disruptive influence of AI technology in a much more proactive manner than other countries, especially the US. As Daniel Faggella points out, “The West needs a new strategy to both maintain it’s own values, and compete on the international stage. The default is not good enough if the West wants to ensure its values and prosperity continue.” While the US and other countries might eventually benefit from its more cautious and circumspect approach to AI, China is currently reaping the economic benefits from the gaps left in the consumption and implementation of AI for government surveillance. It may be the case that squashing individual rights and freedoms can be done in a way the promotes economic and technological predominance on the global scale.

Majoring in engineering might not guarantee you a lofty job much longer.A new study from Brookings found that workers with bachelor's and graduate degrees are five and four times more likely, respectively, to get impacted by AI than people with just a high school degree. Brookings can't predict whether the impact would mean job loss, but the technology will likely replace some job functions.

In addition to manufacturers, white-collar workers in business, finance, and tech industries face greater career consequences of AI impact when the technology becomes more advanced. These findings differ from other reports that say low-income workers will be the ones getting replaced by AI.Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings and lead author on the study, told Business Insider that the report suggests a college degree won't give graduates a ""pass"" on avoiding AI's potentially negative impact on jobs. STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) graduates, who currently have lower unemployment than general grads, might not have as much job security when AI becomes more advanced.

""I think this raises questions about whether STEM analysis, STEM education, or college degrees per se, offer a way to completely avoid these kinds of technology transitions at work,"" Muro said in an interview. ""I think this throws attention on what we educate for and what we train for.""Unlike other surveys, Brookings analyzed the ""exposure,"" or how much of the job will get replaced or supplemented by AI, by comparing job descriptions to patents that have been filed for the technology. Other reports tend to be more subjective by using expert commentary, Muro said.The study comes at a time when college degrees are pricier than ever. As Business Insider's Hillary Hoffower reported, the cost of undergraduate degrees rose by 213% for public schools and 129% for private schools, adjusting for inflation.Plus, the total amount of student loans in the US has topped $1 trillion. Hoffower has also reported that nearly half of college grads with debt don't think their college degree helped them earn more money.

The report may shock some STEM graduates who for years have been practically guaranteed high-paying work after graduation. All but two of the 20 highest-paying college majors are in some kind of engineering occupation, and the STEM college majors have higher median incomes and lower unemployment rates compared to the general graduate population. Muro said exposure to AI does not necessarily mean job loss, and AI might just supplement work. But he said that AI exposure will likely lower wages and lead to job replacement if human workers can no longer bring ""extra value"" that AI can't.Jobs that AI won't have as much impact on include relatively low-paying work in food preparation and education. The reason might be because these jobs require interpersonal skills that are difficult for machines to replicate. For instance, there are already machines that can flip burgers, yet fast food workers are cheaper and better at it so companies haven't invested much in the tech, wrote Ellen Ruppel Shell in her book, ""The Job: Work and Its Future in a Time of Radical Change.""""It may be that college education, or educational training in general, should be [focused] on things like interpersonal relations and judgement ethical decision making,"" Muro said. ""A college degree won't give someone a pass on dealing with these transitions but it also may be useful if it allows for people to be better equipped to do things that machines can't.""

Recchi's lecture was part of the FHSU Entrepreneur Direct lecture series.Carolina and her sister grew up in Italy, and Carolina came to the United States to study at Babson College where she earned her degree in international business. Carolina is only five years out of college. She initially went to work for Bloomberg, where she was selling data to universities. She soon learned she loved working with higher education clients, and this eventually lead she and her sister to strike out on their own.Recchi's current company — EdSights — uses artificial intelligence to help students navigate their college experience. The ultimate goal is to increase student success and increase graduation rates.Some of the schools EdSights is currently working with include Pittsburg State University, Northwestern and Baker University. The sisters have raised a $1 million in venture capital for their company and graduated from the the Techstars accelerator program in Kansas City.However, EdSights was not the original concept for the sisters' business. They first created an app called ClassPulse, which allowed students to give professors real-time feedback on their performance.Recchi and her sister realized course evaluations were flawed. Students fill them out without paying attention, she said. Faculty don't have good ways of receiving real-time feedback, and it ends up penalizing both faculty and students, she said.The Chronicle of Higher Education published a story about the app while the sisters were testing it at Georgetown. The sisters were inundated with requests for the app.Carolina quit her job at Bloomberg to pursue ClassPulse and her sister turned down a job at Amazon., which she said was a mistake.The company scaled quickly with as many as 200 colleges using the app, but the sisters realized they had no way of monetizing the app. Students didn't want to pay for it. Professors liked it, but not enough to pay for it. Universities did not see enough value in it to pay for it.They realized they didn't have a business model and they needed to pivot the focus of their company.""This is embarrassing to admit, but it keeps happening,"" she said. ""I keep seeing founders, even second-time founders, who say I will just grow this thing and get so many users, and they'll figure out the money part later. This is like the Instagram model. You don't want to do that.""Recchi went back to her customers and asked them what problems they were facing and what they would be willing to pay for. They found universities were eager for help with student retention.Twenty million students enroll in college every year, but only about half of them graduate in six years. Six thousand students drop out of college every day. College dropouts earn about 35 percent less than their peers and are four times more likely to default on student debt.An average college loses $10 million annually due to student dropouts. The higher education system in North America as a whole loses about $41 billion annually because of student dropouts.EdSights built a chat bot, a robot, that engages with students over text message. They name the bot after the school mascot. The bot can answer questions, such as 'How do I drop a class?' or 'How do I find a tutor?'.""As we talk to students, we are doing two things. We are connecting students with helpful resources, and we are looking at the data and making suggestions to universities on which populations or demographics may need extra resources,"" Recchi said.Students responded well to the chat bot. EdSights had a 95 percent opt in from students. Seventy percent of student were active engagers.The bot helped increase retention by 7.3 percent and saved universities $1.7 million.Recchi concluded her talk by sharing some lessons she and her sister learned in launching their startup.""As a first-time founder, inevitably you make so many mistakes, because you don't know what you don't know and you kind of learn it in the process,"" Recchi said. ""Work hard, you are smart enough I hope you know that.""But there are some specific actionable things that over time will create luck for you because there is such thing is luck but you can create it for yourself.""Don't plan, prototype""What I mean by that is don't overthink your idea because it probably is not going to be what you end up with,"" Recchi said. ""Your idea is your starting point. Your idea is not your business. It is just an idea. Pick a business or a space that you are passionate about.""She said you can try out an idea without blowing through your 401k by using a minimum buy-in product and testing it.""You have to be lean,"" she said. ""You have to be able to change everything and not just jump into it and see how people respond to it.""Embrace change and pivot""If something isn't working, ask yourself why,"" she said. ""I see so many founders banging their head against the wall, but the wall isn't going to move.""As a startup, you are at a disadvantage at almost everything, including money and employees. However, you can do more a lot faster, she said.""You have nothing to lose and everything to gain,"" Recchi said. ""So if something isn't working, start from scratch, pivot, make small changes. You have to be nimble. You have to move fast, learn fast, throw thing away if they are not working. There is no real big repercussions.""Ask for help and make it easy for people to help youAsk for something very specific. If you want to be introduced to an investor, name a specific investor. EdSights seeks introductions to specific university officials to pitch their products.Follow upRecchi said she is very direct with her potential investors and clients. She said she contacted one investor eight times before the investor finally agreed to invest in the company. Now that investor is one of the biggest investors in EdSights.Listen to feedback(But pick mentors wisely)The Recchies are using mentors who are five to 10 years ahead of them in the growth of their companies, in their industry and successful.Recchi said avoid mentors who want something from you. Don't pay a consultant and don't give up equity in your company for advice, she said.Choose a co-founder wiselyRecchi was lucky because she has her sister as a co-founder, but one of the top reasons why startups don't do well is problems between founders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These technologies, from digital twins to 3D printing, not only support humans in their design and engineering work, but they can also efficiently uncover new ways of solving problems that humans hadn't thought of before. The human professionals in design and engineering roles in organizations will see changes to their job duties, will be challenged to acquire new skills and flexibility, and learn new ways of collaborating with machines. They also need to learn how to work with new design, engineering, and product development tools enabled by these new technologies. Things are changing rapidly. Organizations and professionals in engineering and design roles can't ignore the changes if they want to remain competitive. Here are the five biggest technology trends that are disrupting engineering and design. 
The 5 Biggest Technology Trends Disrupting Engineering And Design In 2020Adobe Stock

Digital Twins

Imagine the power of being able to design and build something virtually to see how everything comes together before you expend real-world resources and then figure out a flaw in the design. You no longer have to imagine. While the concept for digital twins has existed for quite some time, the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) makes digital twins affordable. Digital twins create an exact virtual replica of something in the physical world using data and algorithms instead of materials. The transformative potential of digital twins is so incredible, the technology was listed on Gartner’s Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2017 and 2018. Digital twin technology has been deployed in Formula 1 car racing to evaluate the performance and reliability of new parts. Ultimately, a digital twin provides design and engineering teams real-time information about how whatever they are creating will perform under a variety of circumstances.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial intelligence continues to be one of the fastest-growing emerging technologies, so you likely aren't surprised that it is also disrupting design and engineering now that Industry 4.0 is here. Engineers will need to learn how to collaborate with artificial intelligence to produce better products and to be open to evolving to work with the latest tools available to them. Engineers must embrace flexibility and adapt to changes that artificial intelligence will bring to the way they work from robotics, natural language processing, automation, and more.
PROMOTED
Generative Design
Generative design uses artificial intelligence (AI) software and the computing power of the cloud to create design solutions that would never have been conceived by the human mind—or at least as quickly. Engineers have a new partner in designing solutions and can collaborate with generative design algorithms to co-create. To start the process, an engineer or designer gives the algorithm design parameters, and then the software explores all possible combinations and generates hundreds or even thousands of design options. Then, the engineer or designer takes those options and explores the feasibility of the design solutions. Generative design has been used to design everyday objects such as chairs and power tools as well as help solve larger engineering feats such as when Airbus used generative design to redesign an interior partition for its A320 aircraft. In that example, the collaboration between man and machine came up with a solution that shaved off 45 percent of the part’s weight. 
Robotics
Most organizations will benefit from enhanced performance, improved products, higher productivity, and more with the adoption of new technology. Robots that are deployed today can do much more than provide physical strength to tasks or move items around a warehouse—they can complement human work in a variety of ways, even with cognitive tasks. Engineering time and risk have been reduced thanks to software that can simulate robotic applications and maintenance. Robots can now ""think out-of-the-box"" rather than just be programmed to do repetitive tasks.

3D Printing
Additive manufacturing, more commonly known as 3D printing for three-dimensional printing, is transforming the way business is done as well as how things are designed and made. From 3D printed parts on commercial airplanes to those implanted in humans through innovative healthcare applications, 3D printing is incorporated in many areas of our lives. Now that 3D printing is a critical part of how businesses and manufacturers design and make products, it’s changing the future of engineering and the engineering degree. This technology allows for prototypes to be made quickly and economically.

Given the Indian government’s recent focus on developing a plan for artificial intelligence, we decided to apply our strengths (deep analysis of AI applications and implications) to determine (a) the state of AI innovation in India, and (b) strategic insights to help India survive and thrive in a global market with the help of AI initiatives. We traveled to Bangalore in an effort to speak with experts from the Government of India, Indian AI startups, AI academic researchers in India and data science executives at some of the largest companies operating in India, including Reliance ADA, Amazon, AIG, Equifax, Infosys, NVIDIA and many more. Through the course of this research our objective was threefold: To understand the state of AI adoption in India To determine the opportunities and risks that artificial intelligence poses for Indian industry and society To provide the Indian government and tech community leaders with strategic recommendations for using AI to promote prosperity in India We have broken our analysis down into the following sections below: AI Adoption and Potential in India – an Overview Strengths and Opportunities for India in Artificial Intelligence Weaknesses and Risks for India in Artificial Intelligence Strategic Recommendations for Success in the Indian Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem The Big Themes Strategic Recommendations – The High-Level View We’ll begin by examining what we learned about AI adoption in India: 1 – AI Adoption and Potential in India – an Overview  The Initiatives of the Indian Government Thus Far Since the early 90s, the IT and ITeS services sector in India has been of tremendous importance to its economy eventually growing to account for 7.7% of India’s GDP in 2016. In an attempt to capitalize on this foundation, the current Indian administration announced in February 2018 that the government think-tank, National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog (Hindi for Policy Commission), will spearhead a national programme on AI focusing on research.  This development comes on the heels of the launch of a Task Force on Artificial Intelligence for India’s Economic Transformation by the Commerce and Industry Department of the Government of India in 2017.  The industry experts we interviewed seemed to agree that artificial intelligence has certainly caught the attention of the Indian government and the tech community in recent years. According to Komal Sharma Talwar, Co-founder XLPAT Labs and member of India’s AI Task Force: “I think the government has realized that we need to have a formal policy in place so that there’s a mission statement from them as to how AI should evolve in the country so it’s beneficial at large for the country.” Indeed it’s comments like Komal’s that made us realize that we should aid in determining a strategic direction for artificial intelligence development in India – and learn as much as possible about the possible strategic value of the technology. In our research and interviews, we saw consensus (from executives, non-profits, and researchers alike) that healthcare and agriculture would be among the most important sectors of focus in order to improve living conditions for India’s citizens.  Just as Google, Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon are battling to serve the cloud computing and machine learning needs of the US government, the next three to five years may lead to a similar dynamic within India. As the Indian government pushes for digitization and enacts more AI initiatives, private firms will flock to win big contracts – adding to the pool of funds to develop new technologies and spin out new AI and data science-related startups. Mayank Kapur, CTO of Indian AI startup Gramener, says that the government is still the largest potential customer for data science services in the country. Other experts we spoke with have enunciated that more and more Indian startups and established tech firms are beginning to implement AI in their products and services.  Mr. Avik Sarkar, the Head of the Data Analytics Cell for NITI Aayog explains that the think-tank – which has been tasked with spearheading India’s AI strategy – is currently engaged in the following public sector initiatives: “The current areas of focus for AI applications in India are majorly focused in 3 areas: Precision Agriculture – The government has initiated a proof of concept pilot in 15 districts (counties) in India to use artificial intelligence based real-time advisory based on satellite imagery, weather data, etc. to increase farm yields where the farm production levels are low Healthcare – Pathologists and Radiologists are very few in number India relative to the overall population, (especially in rural areas) and these are applications which can be augmented through image recognition AI. We are working on augmenting the productivity of existing pathologists and radiologists as the first (of many planned) pilot project in healthcare. NITI Aayog is working on early diagnosis and detection of Diabetic Retinopathy and Cardiac Risk based on the AI models. Such initiatives would in the long run help patients on proactive medication in early stages rather than reactive healthcare in advanced stages – bringing down healthcare costs and better chances of recovery.  Indian Languages Project – We have initiated a long-term project to build a complete natural language processing platform for Indian languages. This would aid in the development of several applications, like conversational general and career counseling through chatbots and assistants, conversing in 22 Indian languages.” How is AI Interest in India Manifesting Itself Today? With the government’s growing interest around AI applications in India, Deepak Garg the Director at NVIDIA-Bennett Center of Research in Artificial Intelligence (and Director LeadingIndia.ai) believes that there has been a significant growth in interest levels around AI across all industry sectors in India. He explains that although AI attention is considerably smaller in India than in China or the USA, the increased AI interest has manifested itself in the following three ways:  “1) Industries have started working to skill their manpower to enable themselves to compete with other global players 2) Educational institutions have started working on their curricula to include courses on machine learning and other relevant areas  3) Individuals and professionals have started acquiring these skills and are comfortable investing in upgrading their own skills.” The Current Challenges to AI Traction in India Despite the initial enthusiasm for AI, there were also a few opinions from experts about a sense of unfulfilled potential and that the country could be doing far more to adopt and integrate AI technologies. Another common theme we heard often during our interviews was that – culturally speaking – the cost of failure is much higher in India than the West. While failing in an attempt at bold innovation and grand goals might be seen as noble or brave in Silicon Valley or New York City (or even Boston), failure often implies a loss of face in India and some Asian countries. This has historically meant a lack of room for innovative experimentation. Dr. Nishant Chandra, the Data Science Leader of Science group at AIG adds a valuable insight about the high stakes for failure in India and that cultural and economic factors play into raising these stakes: “Indian society is not as forgiving to failure in entrepreneurship as US or Europe. So far, this has led to ideas borrowed from other places and implemented after customization. Yet I believe, entrepreneurs will build upon the success of IT services industry and establish globally competitive AI companies in near future.” At the IIIT Banglore University Campus where we caught up with Mr. Professor Manish Gupta, CEO of VideoKen We caught up with Professor Manish Gupta at IIIT Bangalore – Manish is also a startup founder (VideoKen) and former AI researcher at Xerox and Goldman Sachs India. He expressed his disappointment in India’s lack of global AI participation: “I think that we are not doing enough justice to our potential [in India]; I think we are really far behind some of the other leaders. I see a lot of American and Chinese companies at global AI conference like NIPS / AAAI and these two countries seem to be far ahead of the rest of the pack. I look at India as a country that ought to be doing a lot more.” A number of our interviewees mentioned the prevalence of copy-catting business models in India (taking a famous or successful business model in the USA or Europe and reconstructing it in India), as opposed to the invention of entirely new business models.  Google is not the copy-cat of another business in another country, nor is Facebook, Amazon, or Microsoft – and many of the same interviewees we spoke with are hopeful that India will have its own global trend-setters as it’s technology ecosystem develops. Next Steps for AI Development in India Our previous research on AI enterprise adoption seems to indicate that it may be another 2-5 years until AI adoption becomes mainstream in the Fortune 500 – and even that is only at the level of pilots and initiatives, not of revolutionary results.  This “learning” phase – evident given the state of AI adoption the Western markets – may last longer in India’s relatively underdeveloped economy. Aakrit Vaish, CEO of Haptik, Inc. also seems to suggest that in the next 10 years we can expect that understanding of AI and how it works will potentially be more commonplace among most technical industry executives: “India may go in the direction that China has gone, become their own economies. There are probably going to be pockets, Bangalore might be good at deep tech like robotics or research / Hyderabad being good at data/ AI training, Mumbai being good at BFSI and  Delhi for agriculture and government. Like China, most solutions will probably be applied to the local economy.” India’s services sector (call centers, BPOs, etc – roughly 18% of the Indian GDP) have a significant potential opportunity to cater to the coming demand for data cleaning and human-augmented AI training (data labeling, search engine training, content moderation, etc).  Komal Talwar from Government of India’s AI Task Force added her views on what the Indian government’s future strategy around AI might be focused on: “We think AI could have a great impact in health sector. There is a scarcity for good doctors and nurses, with AI the machine can do the first round of diagnostics. Staff can carry machines with them to help cut down in the physical presence needed for doctors.  The government is really encouraging startups to have AI applications that really have a social impact (AI in health, AI in education, etc), where startups compete to solve social problems.” Key Points: Has India “woken up” to artificial intelligence? Expert opinions on this topic seem mixed, yet through our analysis, we managed to distill the following themes:  Most experts agreed that there is some indication of grassroots level AI adoption today in India, yet the pace of innovation around establishing a comprehensive AI strategy for the future isn’t comparable to America or China today. Most of the traction today in India seems to be in the form of AI pilot projects from the government in agriculture and healthcare and the emergence of AI startups in Indian software hubs like Bangalore and Hyderabad. Some of the experts we interviewed believe that India’s underdeveloped economy will considerably slow broad AI adoption. The Indian government and Indian tech hubs are certainly aware of (and often excited about) AI, but adoption lags interest. India could become the hub for data cleaning around the world. The IT services industry could easily transition into human-trainers of AI, a need that already exists (as evidenced by Figure Eight, Clickworker, Gengo.ai, and other players in the human-assisted AI training market). In India, the government push is towards AI applications that have social benefits like health care, education and agriculture. The direct financial impact of these sectors is massive, but the government seems to be focused first on improving the health and well-being of its citizens. Interested readers can learn more about AI applications in India today from our other articles about AI traction in some of India’s largest sectors: Artificial Intelligence in Indian Agriculture – An Industry and Startup Overview Artificial Intelligence at India’s Top eCommerce Firms – Use Cases from Flipkart, Myntra, and Amazon India Artificial Intelligence Initiatives at India’s Top IT Services Firms AI Applications in the Top 4 Indian Banks 2 – Artificial Intelligence in India – Strengths and Opportunities  The majority of our Indian AI respondents and interviewees showed optimism about India’s potential to be one of the key global players in the future of AI. Optimism about the prospects of one’s own nation’s success seems a natural bias (and one that we’ve seen before in our geography-specific coverage in Montreal, Boston, and more) – but India’s optimism isn’t unwarranted. Since the early 90’s when the Indian economy opened up to foreign investment, the country has been considered by some economists as the “dark horse” among the larger economies in the world.  An Existing Foundation For Taking Advantage of AI Historically, the slower adoption of IT services by domestic Indian companies (in some cases by even by a period of around 10 years) as compared to global competitors was an indicator of the unfulfilled potential according to some experts we spoke to.  Yet, most of the interviewees seemed bullish on the fact that this time around in the wave of AI, India is firmly backing its strengths as represented in the quote below from Aakrit Vaish Co-founder and CEO of Haptik, Inc.  “The Indian foundation of IT services and business process outsourcing makes me believe that such AI training jobs will be even more lucrative for India than elsewhere in the future.” During the interview with him, Aakrit explained his stance with an example about the possibility that Indian BPO services providers could potentially be attractive in terms of skills and cost for tasks (which he believes will for a long time remain a manual effort) like cleaning and tagging of data in the near future. We heard opinions from other experts favoring the view that India may be positioned well to take advantage of the AI disruption. Sundara Ramalingam Nagalingam, Head of Deep Learning Practice at NVIDIA India, shares his thoughts on some of the advantages India may have over other countries in terms of AI: “India is the third largest startup ecosystem in the world, with three to four startups being born here daily. We believe India has a major advantage over other countries in terms of talent, a vibrant startup ecosystem, strong IT services and an offshoring industry to harness the power of AI.” Kiran Rama, the Director of Data Sciences at the VMware Center of Excellence (CoE) in Bangalore also seems to agree that the cost-competitive talent in India will be an opportunity for companies looking to open offices in India: “There seems to be a lot of opportunity for companies that are setting u shop in India. Especially since there is a supply of data science talent at a good cost advantage. I also think there Indians are starting to contribute to the advancement of machine learning libraries and algorithms.” Strong IT Services and Existing IT Ecosystem Subramanian Mani, who heads the analytics wing at BigBasket.com, an online Indian grocery e-commerce firm, reiterates the idea that the IT services background in India is an advantage.  We are seemingly joined by Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan (their brand ambassador) during our visit to the BigBasket Offices to interview Subramaniam Mani, their Analytics Head. He believes that the major difference between the software and AI waves is that although India was slow to adopt software service as compared to America, this time around with the AI wave, adoption will be much faster and only slightly behind the leading countries.  “This is the second wave. The software wave was 30 years ago. Folks in India realized that they’ve been able to scale software and I think AI / ML is an extension of software development.” While software was often taught through books and in classrooms exclusively, many of the latest artificial intelligence approaches are available to learn online – along with huge suites of open-source tools (from scikit-learn to TensorFlow and beyond). Going in, we knew that one of the key advantages for India would, in fact, be the very IT and ITeS sectors which will make it easy for Indian tech providers to transition into AI services, given that well-developed ecosystems have evolved over the past 25 years in cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad.  Manish Gupta, Director of Machine Learning & Data Science at American Express India, expressed optimism in Bangalore as an innovation hub: “Bangalore has always been seen as the Silicon Valley of India and today there are lots of analytics companies here. It has all the ingredients to be a leader in the AI space. The state government is interested in planning and grooming for startups in this space as witnessed by the launch of the Center for Excellence (CoE) in AI setup by the GOI and NASSCOM in Bangalore.” Diversity (at Scale) May be a Massive Opportunity With Rony Thomas (Right) and Madhusudan Shekar (Far right) from Amazon AWS right after our breakfast meeting at Novotel, Bangalore While the advantage from the existing Indian IT sector may have been more intuitive, Madhusudan Shekar, Principal Technology Evangelist at Amazon AWS explains through an example how India’s diversity and scale (generally considered a challenge) can be an opportunity to make the best out of a tough situation: “In India, people speak over 40+ formal languages in about 800+ dialects. There are 22 national languages and if you want to build a neural network for speech, India is the best place to build that neural net. If you can build for India, you can most likely build it for other parts of the world.” In this respect, India – with all of its language challenges – could be a petri dish for translation-oriented AI applications. The market for this technology – especially when backed by the Indian government – may well rival the kind of AI innovations developed around translation in other parts of the world. Hundreds of Millions of People Coming Online Another insight that was oft repeated by the experts was around the potential to have access to vast amounts of data in India. To further explain,  According to a report by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) the total number of internet subscribers in the country as a percentage of the overall population increased by 12.01% from December 2013 to reach 267.39 million in December 2014.  Along these lines, Mayank Kapur Co-founder of Gramener cites the increased level of data collection and the scale to which it could potentially grow as an opportunity for India in public sector AI applications: “In the public sector, we have an advantage of scale the amount of data that can potentially be gathered is huge. For example, leveraging data to provide access to services is a huge differentiator in the healthcare sector for applications like disease prevention or nutrition.” Figure. Number of internet subscribers  in India in 2014 by access type (Source)  Juergen Hase the CEO of Unlimit- A Reliance Group Company, one of India’s largest private sector companies, expressed his thoughts during our research: “The direct switch to mobile platforms in India means that there are no legacy systems to deal with and new technologies can be developed from scratch.” As shown in the figure to the right, an overwhelming majority of India’s Internet subscribers gain access through mobile wireless networks.  As Juergen points out, what this means is that large-scale AI projects in India can be somewhat insulated from issues cropping up from legacy systems. This might also lead to a greater immediate mobile-fluency for India’s startup and developer communities, who need to appeal to an almost exclusively mobile market. Juergen adds, in the future, we can expect that AI software will also potentially have this advantage in India as compared to developed countries where the ratio is more evenly distributed among mobile and fixed wireless users. Take-Aways At InMobi’s swanky office with Avi Patchava, VP Data Science right after our interview We think our business audience will indeed find the next quote from Avi Patchava, Vice President, Data Sciences, ML & AI – InMobi, highly insightful in terms of gaining an overview of India’s biggest strengths with respect to the country’s ability to leverage AI. Avi neatly summed up what he believes are India’s four biggest strengths to face the upcoming AI disruption: “India has an abundance of engineering talent which has been trained over the last 2 decades which needs to be funneled into a new direction due to the automation of IT services. This core base of engineering is required to do things with AI at scale” “India has a culture that produces a large number of mathematicians, coders, and statisticians (independent of the engineers) Bangalore and to some extent Hyderabad already have decent ecosystem set up. London essentially tried to build its tech ecosystem in the past 5 years Bangalore has been at it for the last 25 years.” “Data – We’ve got a country that is rapidly moving towards digitization – For example, the Aadhar or UIDAI Project in India is the largest ever unique identifier project in the world. India is actively pushing more and more into creating public datasets and the fact that it is a democracy helps with this fact over China where public data may be restricted to the government” You’ve got over 3 million people who are either directly engaged in the IT services world in India and its around 14% of the Indian GDP. It was skilled work, but it was routine, which makes it a key opportunity for machine learning and automation. The IT services players like Infosys, Wipro etc have noticed this and started internal reorganizations to adopt AI” The following points became evident through our interviews about India’s AI strengths and opportunities: India’s current focus on mobile platform first approach has meant that the most Indians’ first access to the internet is likely to be a mobile device. There were over 1 billion mobile telephone subscribers in India in 2016. What this means for AI in the country is that in many cases of B2C and B2B applications there are no standardization or compatibility issues cropping from legacy systems (like PCs or Macs) for new technologies which are being developed from scratch. The scale and diversity inherent in India can be an opportunity in terms of access to vast amounts of data which is an underlying necessity for any large scale AI project.  Every year, India’s many universities produce a huge number of engineers and mathematicians; these are skills which play a key role in developing any AI system. The internet promises to limit the lag from first-world computer science classrooms to Indian companies and researchers, allowing a nation with a swelling young population to potentially keep pace (at least in some sectors or cities) with the genuine cutting-edge of AI. There seems to be a government push towards digitalization indicated by the launch of AI-oriented government initiatives like the AI Task Force and NITI Aayog – and these efforts are likely to spurn more artificial intelligence enthusiasm, companies, and research investment. 3 – Artificial Intelligence in India – Weaknesses and Risks  While there were many favorable views on the future outlook of the Indian AI ecosystem, there seemed to be different views among experts regarding the challenges that the country might have to overcome to survive and thrive in the AI disruption. AI Hype vs AI Reality – and Often Stark Difference We heard a significant number of experts allude to the fact that the hype around AI may still be very real in India and there exists here a common tendency to view AI as a discrete industry rather than the broad, core technology that it is (like the internet).  In addition to being misunderstood and not being properly leveraged, many of the experts we spoke with were candid about addressing what they see as relative weaknesses of the Indian AI ecosystem. Aakrit Vaish from Haptik, Inc. shares his thoughts on the AI hype that he sees in the Indian tech scene today: “Today AI is getting a lot of attention in India but nobody knows what it is or what are the best applications for it. There’s a little of a spray-and-pray attitude across the board.” While AI hype is hard to escape in the tech press in any country – our speaking engagements in India seemed to affirm the state ambiguity around AI. We received post-presentation questions from attendees (about AI taking jobs, about the definition of AI itself, about the ongoings of Google and Facebook) that seemed like less informed questions than we might hear from a similarly technical audience in Boston or San Francisco.  This may mostly be due to the fact that AI applications are less well understood, and genuinely knowledgeable AI talent is rarer. We might suspect that over the coming few years – particularly in a tech hub like Bangalore – we’d see this knowledge lessen over time. Venture Capital in AI still in Early Stages Co-founder of XLPAT Labs and member of India’s AI Task Force Komal Sharma specifically points out that even some of the government projects have faced issues in terms of receiving funding for initiating AI pilot projects. She seems to indicate that the current Indian AI and startup funding ecosystem is not mature enough to be comparable to the US or even China. “The problem that we have faced I think is funding in areas where our field is very niche. In India, IP is developing lots of interest, but we’re nowhere near the US or other countries.” Komal was far from being alone in her lamenting AI’s lack of VC funding, and the sentiment of our respondents seems to be backed up by the data. The World Economic Forum chart below features information from Ernst & Young:  Taken as a percent of GDP, Israel’s VC investments represent about 0.006% of GDP, while India’s investments represent around 0.002%. As the Indian economy continues to develop – and if India’s entrepreneurship trend continues – we should expect to see investment increase. Lack of Collaboration Between Industry and Academia Madhu Gopinathan Vice President, Data Science at MakeMyTrip, India’s largest online travel company, touches on a point repeated by other experts as well. He thinks that the two underlying factors here are larger salaries lie in the corporate sector, which is potentially creating a dearth of mentors for the next generation of software developers looking to transition into AI and the availability of data. 
“Academia and Industry collaboration is a serious issue in India. Although we have a lot of universities, the incentives are skewed towards the corporate sector. For example, people like me who have an understanding of the technology may not be inclined to teach the next generation at universities, since working at the larger companies is far more lucrative today. “ Madhu believes that much of the “AI upskilling” of India’s development talent will occur on the job in the cutting-edge work environments of venture-backed companies, as opposed to in the classroom. As Nishant Chandra from AIG puts it, the boom in the Indian IT services sector in the early 90s was partially born out of necessity – India just did not have a good “products ecosystem”. India has historically not done well with products and according to the experts, there also seems to be a dearth of good talent specifically for design and user-interface functions.  Sumit Borar, Sr. Director – Data Sciences at Myntra, the Indian fashion eCommerce firm, is of the opinion that the scale of AI talent in India is still very nascent although he expects this to change in the next three years: “Talent will be the biggest strength for India with respect to AI. But AI is still new, so current talent in the market is very limited but in 3 years time I think that will become a strength.  Industry-university partnerships where students can work with real world data science applications and reskilling of existing workforces (example: getting software engineers to look at statistics or vice versa) are just beginning to take shape in India (starting with the unicorns).” Cultural Factors The cultural factors in India play a role in talent development here as explained by Nimilita Chatterjee SVP, Data and Analytics at Equifax: At Bangalore’s Equifax offices after our interview with Namilita “I see issues in AI talent in India are at 3 levels: Data science courses in India are tailored to technique and not to business context and application. Due to the high demand for data scientists with an experience level of 0 to 2 or 0 to 3 years, they are being recruited by other companies quite soon after you hire them; therefore, there is a risk of losing talented employees. At Equifax, we know that in order to attract and retain talent, we have to invest in a culture that people want to be a part of. We are providing employees with skill set training, offering collaborative projects, and investing in creating the next generation of leaders. The third problem is that it is sometimes tough to transition analysts to leaders. Many of our analysts are great individual contributors and although young talent in India are encouraged to be studious, there is not a very capable system in place for ensuring technically strong people transition well into ‘inspiring leaders.’ We are seeking to change this at Equifax. We’re offering rotational development programs that train our employees, offering them access to different parts of the business, as well as networking opportunities.” The issues that Nimilita addresses above aren’t all that different from what we see in the United States (indeed in Silicon Valley) on a daily basis. It does seem safe to say, however, that experienced data science talent (more specifically: Talent who have applied data science and AI skills in a real business context) is much more sparse in India than it is in the USA – at least for now. Access to Large Amounts of Data in the Finance Sector Is Still an Issue Nilmilita also believes that another weakness for India today in terms of data access for AI applications in the finance sector stems from the fact that the Indian economy still operates primarily on cash. As of 2017, India’s Economic Times claims that cash comprises 95% of the Indian economy. Although there is a small percentage of the population that is making the switch to digital transactions, she believes that this segment of the population is still not significant enough before AI adoption in this sector becomes widespread in India. “India moving away from cash and being comfortable on a mobile phone, however that part of the population is still small. It will come into play in the future, but today it is still an issue in the finance sector.” Professor Manish Gupta, CEO of VideoKen is of the opinion that the Indian tech community and government efforts around AI have not been “thinking big” in terms of how India can effectively leverage AI. Professor Gupta also mentions the lack of collaboration between academia and industry: “One of the things we lack is courage… I think we lack the courage to set ambitious enough goals and to go solve those problems.  Just being cheaper than a Western idea is not true innovation… that’s not ALL that we should be thinking about.” Take-Aways The following points became evident through our interviews about India’s AI risks and weaknesses: Although there are VCs in AI starting to emerge, access to venture funding is rare. Lack of collaboration between the industry and academia specifically in the AI domain. Lack of ambitious or creative goal setting from the tech community. Language and translation issues are rife in India, making collaboration from state to state very challenging – slowing down information transfer and posing difficulty expanding businesses. A general lack of AI fluency – even in the tech community – compared to tech hubs in Europe or the United States. 4 – Strategic Recommendations for Success in the Indian Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem In light of NITI Aayog’s recent report, and in light of our research on AI in India (and our understanding of AI’s economic possibilities in various tech ecosystems), we were determined to contribute to the national conversation about AI in India. The purpose of this final section of our AI in India analysis is to provide the Indian government and Indian tech community with a set of actionable ideas for making the most of AI in terms of economic and social benefit. We’ve broken this conclusion down into two sections: Maximizing the Economic Impact of AI. We highlight the area that we believe is of the greatest import for India’s economic prosperity (IT services) – including an analysis of possible future of paths and action steps. This section was written by Daniel Faggella, Founder of Emerj. AI in India SWOT Analysis Highlights. We provide an overview of what we believe to be the most important 1 or 2 strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and risks of AI in India. This section was written by Raghav Bharadwaj of Emerj. This final section – as with the rest of this research – is grounded in our conversations with dozens of AI experts in India, in addition to our analysis of other research efforts and precedents of AI’s impact in other tech ecosystems. We hope that the advice that follows will be of value for the tech and government leaders who will carry India into an age of AI disruption. Maximizing the Economic Impact of AI: “Skills and IT Services at the Speed of Now” With Madhu Gopinathan of MakeMyTrip at their Bangalore office. MakeMyTrip is one of India’s most prominent tech “unicorns” (companies valued at over $1B) India picked up on the software wave and the internet wave well behind the USA and Europe.  With the AI wave, there is the potential to catch up immediately thanks to  substantial and continuing growth in internet connectivity, and India’s swollen population of young engineers could hypothetically leap directly to the cutting edge of programming, development, and data science. India has a bulging population of young people and a clear academic focus on information technologies. If India can marshall this next generation of the tech-savvy workforce people into the right skills, they can form a huge base of just the kind of engineers and data scientists experts that the world will need most in the years ahead.  Hopefully, with access to all the latest algorithms, approaches, and use-cases thanks to the internet, Indian companies and schools can upgrade their skills nearly as quickly as do their peers in Boston or San Francisco. We suspect that the business process outsourcing (BPO) and IT services sectors has It is an industry in which India plays a strong global role, giving Indian firms a base of knowledge and skills to allow them to potentially leap over It is capable of absorbing India’s young technology graduates, allowing India to retain its best tech talent The IT services sector could serve as an additional education period, keeping talent strong in the most modern and important technology skills (including data science, data infrastructure, machine learning) Artificial intelligence isn’t destined for a necessarily positive impact on the Indian BPO and IT services sector. Automation and new technology solutions could erode India’s dominance in this back-office IT domain. With IT services being such an important center of growth for the Indian economy – it behooves India to make sure that AI technologies make their economic engine stronger, not weaker. With the advent of artificial intelligence, there seem to be three main transitions that could happen to the BPO and IT services sectors in India: 1. They could be eaten away by companies that automate their work (basic IT services, customer service work, human resources work, payroll, etc…). There’s almost certainly nothing good about this situation, unless India itself creates these new companies, and is able to retrain many of its talent to work in these new firms (which would involve significant upskilling). 2. They could stay at the bottom of the value chain, basically being relegated to tagging images, combing through data for edge cases, training algorithms, etc (we might name this scenario “The nation of mechanical turks”). India already fills the role of the world’s outsourcing destination, and many of the firms in the crowdsourced data cleaning and tagging space (Figure Eight, Mighty.ai, etc…) have large teams in India, and for good reason: Costs are low. It seems unlikely that this work will bring much additional economic value to India. Staying at the bottom of the value chain is economically limiting, and completely unlikely to position India as a technology leader. 3. They could take their deep expertise in different business processes, and be the first to automate or augment them with artificial intelligence. This would involve taking their existing expertise in BPO and IT services and finding new and better ways to solve those business problems with AI and ML This could pull out of a “copycatting” mentality (i.e. being a cheaper version of some Western business model), and become the kind of firms that the rest of the world references as “leading” and “premier,” not merely “less expensive.” The services sector is where much of India’s current and future growth is likely to come from (https://www.ibef.org/industry/services.aspx), with IT services and business process outsourcing (BPO) services employing millions of Indians.  We believe this area is worthy of focus because: IT services firms are the low-hanging fruit of practical tech experience for India’s millions and millions of technology graduates who want to stay within the country after leaving school. If these firms move their services up the value chain, they are more likely to keep India’s top graduates inside the country (paying higher wages, doing more interesting and valuable work), as opposed to losing them as many of India’s most promising graduates leave for the USA, Europe, or elsewhere. Keeping young talent in the country – and giving them more engaging and cutting-edge problems – seems to be a natural step in the direction of new innovation, as opposed to technology and service “copy-catting” (simply taking a business model created elsewhere and trying to do it cheaper in India). Having young talent working on more high-level problems in the IT services space seems likely to spin out startups, as young people engage with hard problems together. Only with more promising talent and projects will VC investments continue to grow (the base of young companies needs to be there for investment to increase). India should think about its competitive advantage the same way that Silicon Valley VCs think about the AI advantage of their portfolio companies. Namely, India should assess its areas of expertise areas and the areas where it collects masses of proprietary data. So what is the “proprietary data plume” (a term we heard first in our interview with Silicon Valley investor Ben Narasin), or self-feeding data ecosystem that India can “own” and continue to build more and more value around? Focusing on BPO and IT services sector, it seems safe to say that India has tremendous expertise in: Customer service operations (chatbots, routing, directing customers to support resources, etc) Call center operations (automating voice and conversation, routing calls, providing analytics and feedback on call performance, etc) Data entry, data management, and quality assurance workflows HR and payment processing workflows Leading in the field of white-collar and business process automation would indeed force India to compete on technical developments, rather than price. Automating office and IT work is an opportunity for all businesses and markets. For this reason, should India decide to lead the world in automating and augmenting its BPO and IT services businesses, it will be competing with startups and with large consulting firms (such as McKinsey, Accenture, Deloitte) on many fronts. The key for Indian BPO, IT, and tech firms will be to pick the domains of focus where their expertise is strongest (relative to the rest of the world), and where economic opportunity is the largest. AI in India SWOT Analysis Highlights Strengths: India has historically produced a large number of engineers, mathematicians and software developers every year. In addition to this, nearly two-thirds of Indians are under the age of 35 and almost half are under 25. By 2020, India will be the youngest country in the world, with a median age of 29 years, compared with a median age of 37 years in China at that point. India will need to put to work its growing number of young engineers and scientists in the coming decade. Enacting any AI policy at the scale of a country like India will require this foundation of this young talented workforce.  Existing IT ecosystem in India will enable a relatively easier transition into AI services. Over the last 25 years, the IT and ITeS sectors have accounted for a major chunk of the country’s GDP (see figure below). Cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad are developing hubs for IT service exports today. India is also the third largest startup ecosystem in the world today with Bangalore again being at the top of that list. The industry is now somewhat mature and added to the cheaper labor costs, a strong foundation for the upskilling using AI is already in place and economically makes sense. Source: NASSCOM Timely government funding initiatives to create good building blocks for an AI ecosystem. (Historically the Indian Government has been slow to react to technology waves – The domestic Indian IT sector was a decade slower to fully arrive in comparison to the US or China)  In terms of providing financial support for AI programmes, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India, has been funding projects by educational institutions in the areas of ubiquitous computing and wireless sensor networks for real-time landslide monitoring and perception engineering (e.g. artificial sensing, perceptual robotics). The ministry has also been operating a Technology Incubation and Development of Entrepreneurs (TIDE) scheme for facilitating technology innovation over the last decade.  Although this is a start in the right direction, the level of funding from the government so far is much smaller in India compared to US and China. The recommendation here would be to develop more such public sector initiative where private sector firms can gain large contracts, strengthening the government-industrial complex in AI  Weaknesses: Industry and academic collaboration has been historically very underdeveloped. According to this report by Fujitsu in 2005, on university-industry collaborations in Asian countries, such collaborations in India were only significant (comparable) in number after 2003. Building a network of alliances between the services and products industries, academia, government organizations and start-ups. For example like the Danish ROBOCLUSTER initiative in Denmark focused on Robotics. Centers of Excellence are a good start in this regard. Opportunities: Leveraging BPO and back-office expertise, India’s IT services firms could potentially develop the world’s best office automation and BPO AI applications. This would allow India to develop a higher margin product industry, in addition to their wide low-cost services sector. Data cleaning and data tagging is a huge opportunity for near-term business. The BPO industry in India may find an opportunity in data cleaning and tagging in massive datasets, which will eventually be used to train and error-correct AI. Cheap skilled IT labor can potentially enable this opportunity. (Note: We believe that reliance on this method of AI-related work could be a detriment in the long term, which we cover in the “risks” below.) Upgrading the IT education to be on par with USA and China. There should be no “gap” between India and other nations in IT learning, and the internet could help to ensure that India’s youth bulge could receive exposure to the most modern AI approaches. Having access to a young and skilled data science workforce with graduates right at the cutting edge of the technology could be a massive boost for innovation. Risks: AI may automate low-end services work, call center work, and BPO work: The fear that AI is stealing jobs is not unique to India, but it could hit this country particularly hard because a big of its economy comes from IT services which involve relatively routine work that is prime for computers to take over. Looking ahead five years in the future, in some cases, Indian IT services companies will automate the work themselves (requiring upskilling of the workforce). In other cases, companies in the West will do it, so they no longer have to outsource work out to humans in India (resulting in loss of business). We believe that if the Indian tech services sector doesn’t embrace AI, or if they only embrace low-end data entry and data labeling work, automation and encroachment from foreign tech firms could be a significant financial blow to the country. While the NITI Aayog released the National Strategy for AI which addresses what would be India’s strategy in AI, the Ministry of IT and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry have also made similar efforts in the past.  According to Mr. P. Anandan, CEO of Wadhwani AI, nonprofit independent research institute with mission of AI for social good (and previously the Founder and Managing Director of Microsoft Research India, Professor of AI at Yale University and a member of Board of Governors of IIT Madras), the most prominent area of convergence among all these efforts has been around answering the question – What could be India’s leadership position in AI?  Anandan goes on to add:  “Germany, Japan, France etc. all have AI strategies tailored for their own countries needs and opportunities. India can be a country that leads ‘AI for all’ simply because that is necessary problem for us to solve and if we do, it will be useful for the rest of the world as well. India’s real opportunity is doing AI for social good as we have historically always been a technology test bed for social efforts and we possess the technological know-how to get it done reasonably well here.” We certainly hope that India can make the most of artificial intelligence – both for the wellbeing of its citizens and to ensure the health of its economy. The next five years will be a time to set both the pace and trend of AI adoption in the country.   Header image credit: trendingus Related Posts How Investors Feel About Artificial Intelligence - from 29 AI Founders and ExecutivesAI investments have become more and more prevalent over the last 5 years, and articles… AI and ML Adoption Survey Results from Applied Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017Artificial intelligence and machine learning adoption among different industries represents a new chapter in digital… Could Artificial Intelligence Become Conscious? 33 Researchers Contribute Their OpinionOver the last five months, we've combined a mix of interviews and surveys with some of… Artificial Intelligence in Atlanta - Strengths, Weaknesses, and Trends in the Atlanta AI EcosystemLast September I had the chance to do a series of AI-related speaking engagements in… Risks of AI - What Researchers Think is Worth Worrying AboutThe year 2015 might be seen as the year that ""artificial intelligence risk"" or ""artificial… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.
