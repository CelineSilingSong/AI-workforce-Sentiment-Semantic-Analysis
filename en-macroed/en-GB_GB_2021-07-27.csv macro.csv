Mr. Pasquale is the author of “New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI.”Americans have good reason to be skeptical of artificial intelligence. Tesla crashes have dented the dream of self-driving cars. Mysterious algorithms predict job applicants’ performance based on little more than video interviews. Similar technologies may soon be headed to the classroom, as administrators use “learning analytics platforms” to scrutinize students’ written work and emotional states. Financial technology companies are using social media and other sensitive data to set interest rates and repayment terms.Even in areas where A.I. seems to be an unqualified good, like machine learning to better spot melanoma, researchers are worried that current data sets do not adequately represent all patients’ racial backgrounds.U.S. authorities are starting to respond. Massachusetts passed a nuanced law this spring limiting the use of facial recognition in criminal investigations. Other jurisdictions have taken a stronger stance, prohibiting the use of such technology entirely or requiring consent before biometric data is collected. But the rise of A.I. requires a more coordinated nationwide response, guided by first principles that clearly identify the threats that substandard or unproven A.I. poses. The United States can learn from the European Union’s proposed A.I. regulation.In April, the European Union released a new proposal for a systematic regulation of artificial intelligence. If enacted, it will change the terms of the debate by forbidding some forms of A.I., regardless of their ostensible benefits. Some forms of manipulative advertising will be banned, as will real-time indiscriminate facial recognition by public authorities for law enforcement purposes.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe list of prohibited A.I. uses is not comprehensive enough — for example, many forms of nonconsensual A.I.-driven emotion recognition, mental health diagnoses, ethnicity attribution and lie detection should also be banned. But the broader principle — that some uses of technology are simply too harmful to be permitted — should drive global debates on A.I. regulation.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.The proposed regulation also deems a wide variety of A.I. high risk, acknowledging that A.I. presents two types of problems. First, there is the danger of malfunctioning A.I. harming people or things — a threat to physical safety. Under the proposed E.U. regulation, standardization bodies with long experience in technical fields are mandated to synthesize best practices for companies — which will then need to comply with those practices or justify why they have chosen an alternative approach.Second, there is a risk of discrimination or lack of fair process in sensitive areas of evaluation, including education, employment, social assistance and credit scoring. This is a risk to fundamental rights, amply demonstrated in the United States in works like Cathy O’Neil’s “Weapons of Math Destruction” and Ruha Benjamin’s “Race After Technology.” Here, the E.U. is insisting on formal documentation from companies to demonstrate fair and nondiscriminatory practices. National supervisory authorities in each member state can impose hefty fines if businesses fail to comply.To be sure, Europe’s proposal is far from perfect, and the E.U. is not alone in considering the problems of artificial intelligence. The United States is starting to grope toward basic standards of A.I. regulation as well. In April, the Federal Trade Commission clarified a 2020 guidance document on A.I., stating that U.S. law “prohibits the sale or use of … racially biased algorithms.”However, the problems posed by unsafe or discriminatory A.I. do not appear to be a high-level Biden administration priority. As a remarkable coalition of civil rights and technology policy organizations complained this month: “Since assuming office, this administration has not pursued a public and proactive agenda on the civil rights implications of A.I. In fact, the Trump administration’s executive orders and regulatory guidance on A.I. remain in force, which constrains agencies across the federal government in setting policy priorities.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThings are somewhat better on the state level. A more robust proposal is now under discussion in California to regulate public contracts for the provision of A.I.-based products and services. Legislators in Washington State are discussing a similar proposal. The proposed California law has some elements in common with the European approach and with the Canadian model of “Algorithmic Impact Assessment,” designed to mitigate bias and unfairness in emerging A.I. for public administration. Despite its limited scope, the California proposal would require tech companies that provide A.I. to state agencies to prepare a detailed data management plan, to make algorithms explainable even to a nonexpert audience and to prevent discriminatory biases.The states can accomplish a lot on their own. However, the real challenge now is national leadership. The Biden administration should harmonize the U.S. approach with that of Europe, committing to require “high quality data, documentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy and robustness” for high-risk A.I. systems, as the proposed European A.I. Act puts it. For example, if a machine is going to decide whether or not you are hired for a job, at the very least you deserve regulatory oversight to ensure that it is using proper data, that it has actually performed well and in a nondiscriminatory way in the past and that you can appeal to someone if you can demonstrate it has made a mistake. And if the system is based on pseudoscientific claptrap, you should not be judged by it at all.Federal agencies like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can either address these problems under existing law or propose statutory language to grant them the authority to do so. But they need to act more aggressively now, while the technology is still developing. The White House needs to bring agency leaders together to learn from experts about best practices, and solicit comments from those affected by A.I. This approach would both democratize and professionalize U.S. technology policy in crucial areas.A.I. developers should not simply “move fast and break things,” to quote an early Facebook motto. Real technological advance depends on respect for fundamental rights, ensuring safety and banning particularly treacherous uses of artificial intelligence. The E.U. is now laying the intellectual foundations for such protections, in a wide spectrum of areas where advanced computation is now (or will be) deployed to make life-or-death decisions about the allocation of public assistance services, the targets of policing and the cost of credit. While its regulation will never be adopted verbatim by the United States, there is much to learn from its comprehensive approach.Frank Pasquale is a professor at Brooklyn Law School and the author of “New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI.” Gianclaudio Malgieri is an associate professor at the EDHEC Augmented Law Institute in France.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The AlphaFold machine-learning tool can predict 3D structures of full protein chains for 98% of human proteinsCredit: Karen Arnott/EMBL-EBI


“I didn’t think we would get to this point in my lifetime.” That’s how one research leader in structural biology responded to last week’s publication of research in which artificial intelligence (AI) was used to predict the structure of more than 20,000 human proteins, as well as that of nearly all the known proteins produced by 20 model organisms such as Escherichia coli, fruit flies and yeast, but also soya bean and Asian rice. That is a combined total of around 365,000 predictions1.The data, publicly accessible for the first time (see https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk), were released online on 22 July by researchers at DeepMind, a London-based AI company owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and the European Bioinformatics Institute, based at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EBI-EMBL) near Cambridge, UK.

DeepMind’s AI predicts structures for a vast trove of proteins
The DeepMind team developed a machine-learning tool called AlphaFold. The team trained this program on DNA sequences, including their evolutionary history, and the already-known shapes of tens of the thousands of proteins contained in a public-access database of proteins hosted by the EBI-EMBL researchers. A week earlier, DeepMind also released the source code for AlphaFold and detailed how it was constructed2, at the same time that researchers from the University of Washington, Seattle, published details of another protein-structure prediction program — inspired by AlphaFold — called RoseTTAFold3.The unveiling of this catalogue of predicted structures would not be nearly such good news were the data and the methodology not open and freely available. Structural biologists and other researchers are already starting to use AlphaFold to obtain more-accurate models for proteins that have been difficult or impossible to characterize by current experimental methods.Speeding up structure predictionPredicting the 3D shape that proteins fold into has been one of biology’s unsolved ‘grand challenges’ since the discovery in 1953 of the structure of DNA itself. Before AI, structure prediction from sequence was an intensely time-consuming, not to say labour-intensive, process with little guarantee of getting an accurate result. The new data will still need to be validated and experimentally verified. But the AI tools can accurately predict protein structures in minutes to hours — compared with the months, or years, that it used to take to determine the structure of just one or two proteins. And that opens up possibilities for applications, for example in the engineering of enzymes to break down environmental pollutants such as microplastics.

Read the paper: Highly accurate protein structure prediction for the human proteome
Last week’s breakthrough depended not just on the sharing of open data, but on advances in fundamental science and technology. Since the 1960s, structural biologists have worked on parallel approaches to understanding the science of protein folding. One involves piecing together the structures of proteins by understanding the underlying physical forces. Another attempts to predict the shapes by making comparisons with closely related proteins, using an organism’s evolutionary history. And then there’s been the all-important role of imaging technologies, starting with X-ray crystallography and now cryo-electron microscopy.In the basic science of structural biology, key problems remain to be solved. Although AI in science and technology is good at producing accurate results, it doesn’t (at least for now) explain how, or why, those results happened. The teams at DeepMind, EBI-EMBL, the University of Washington and elsewhere should be congratulated for crucial breakthroughs. But there is still work to be done to unlock the science — the essential biology, chemistry and physics — of how and why proteins fold.Public and privateIn terms of significance, some are comparing the latest advances to the first draft human genome sequence 20 years ago. And it’s true that there are comparisons to be made. Both the Human Genome Project and DeepMind’s catalogue of human protein-structure predictions equip their fields with a tool that is set to markedly accelerate discovery.The human genome’s first draft was the result of a race. Solving protein folding has also benefited from a kind of competition — an annual event called the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (or CASP), which has been essential to getting a result.

Today’s research teams — just like those involved in early genome sequencing — needed open access to data. In making the data and the methodology openly available to all, DeepMind now sets a benchmark that will make it harder for other corporations in this space, such as Facebook and Microsoft, to continue arguing for proprietary data.And so, what of the future? Over the past week, Nature interviewed nearly a dozen researchers in the field. The consensus is that it’s too early to predict exactly what impact the application of AI in the life sciences will have, except that any impact will be transformative.Accurately predicting how AI will change biology needs good training data, which we don’t yet have. But in AI, the structural-biology research community — and its collaborators in other fields — have a vast trove of fresh data. In addition to its research and data, AI provides a window into models for research organization and management that universities should study. For today’s researchers, and those in future generations, there is much work to follow up on.

Artificial Intelligence Assists with EHR Data Organization


A recent study looked at how artificial intelligence systems can be used to sort through electronic health records.

According to a recent study, physicians devote 62 percent of their time per patient reviewing electronic health records (EHRs), with the most time-consuming portion being clinical data review. To increase efficiency, researchers studied the development of an artificial intelligence system to assist with reviewing patient information.







As EHRs became increasingly common, physicians have spent more time studying these data bases to review clinical data. With more data being stored in EHRs, users could experience a type of information overload. By incorporating artificial intelligence technology to work with these EHRs, physicians will avoid burnout and improve the patient experience.
In this prognostic study, researchers created an AI system to organize patient records and improve data retrieval. To ensure that the system was fast and accurate, a nonblinded, prospective study took place at Stanford University.
Recruitment emails were sent to all physicians in the gastroenterology division, and 12 of them agreed to participate in the study.
“Each of the clinicians participating in the study received 2 referral records: 1 AI-optimized patient record and 1 standard (non–AI-optimized) patient record. For each record, clinicians were asked 22 questions requiring them to search the assigned record for clinically relevant information,” the study stated.
The clinicians reviewed records from June 1 to August 30, 2020. Researchers compared the time and accuracy of the AI-optimized patient record and the standard patient record. Physicians were then asked to assess their overall satisfaction with the AI system, their preferred method of review, and other topics to evaluate clinical utility.
Compared to the standard patient record review, the artificial intelligence system saved physicians 18 percent of the time used to answer clinical questions. Additionally, there was no significant change in accuracy when physicians retrieved the data with the AI system vs without.
Eleven of the 12 physicians indicated that they preferred the AI record review to the standard review.
“Despite a learning curve pointed out by respondents, 11 of 12 physicians believed that the technology would save them time to assess new patient records and were interested in using this technology in their clinic,” the study stated.
Through the study, the AI system was able to help physicians extract relevant patient data in a shorter amount of time while remaining accurate.
“This finding is particularly germane to the ever-increasing amounts of medical data and increased stressors on clinicians. Increased user familiarity with the AI system, along with further enhancements in the system itself, hold promise to further improve physician data extraction from large quantities of patient health records,” the study stated.
When artificial intelligence is integrated into the healthcare system, physicians can use it as a tool to provide better and more efficient patient care. Not only does it improve the productivity of healthcare, but AI can also lighten the load for physicians.

So why are they rolling out across the country?Supported byAbout this contentVirginia Eubanks and Alexandra MateescuWed 28 Jul 2021 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 Jul 2021 06.01 EDTShareFor years, LeDanté Walker set aside what little extra cash he could find so no matter the issue with his health insurance coverage, his caregiver was always taken care of.Walker, who sustained a spinal cord injury when he was ejected from the back seat of a car in a 1997 accident, relies on a home care worker for many day-to-day functions, from moving from his bed to his wheelchair every morning, to helping him shower, get dressed, go to the bathroom and prepare meals.But earlier this year, Walker abruptly had to dip deeper into his rainy day fund than ever before, after his caregiver’s paychecks fell $900 short of what she was owed. Walker offered her every spare dime he had saved, preferring to pay out-of-pocket to maintain the freedom and stability his worker provided than see her left in a financial lurch.“I want to be independent,” he says. “That’s my right.”The missing wages were caused by flaws in a new digital tool called electronic visit verification (EVV), an app downloaded to a home care worker’s smartphone that tracks their daily work output, physical location and hours.Tech companies and lawmakers promise that EVV will increase efficiency and accountability in home care and will reduce fraud, waste and abuse in government-funded programs. But the tool has been a catastrophe for many in Arkansas, like Walker, and thousands of others across the nation. Advocacy groups and people with disabilities warned from the start that EVV systems would erode clients’ autonomy, make home care more difficult and threaten the progress of the disability rights and independent living movements.At the heart of these disagreements are clients and workers – often women of color or immigrants – who feel as if they are constantly surveilled and under suspicion.The Obama administration passed legislation requiring that EVV be implemented to manage all in-home personal care services paid for by Medicaid, the program that helps poor and working families in the US with healthcare costs. And on 1 April, under a federal deadline to implement or lose a percentage of its Medicaid funding, Arkansas rolled out EVV for self-directed clients like Walker who manage their care workers directly rather than go through a home healthcare agency. Most other states are also currently unveiling EVV systems.According to Walker and dozens of other program participants in Arkansas, the implementation has been a disaster. Walker didn’t get official notification of the state’s digital transformation until four days before the EVV rollout. He called and texted his support coordinator, but she wasn’t answering. He was eventually guided to a training video on YouTube aimed at home healthcare agencies, not self-directed clients like him. It didn’t answer his questions.Walker spent hundreds of dollars to purchase an extra cell phone for his home care worker, who asked not to be named in this story. She downloaded the state’s EVV app, called AuthentiCare, and began to use it. But it was frequently glitchy. Her 13-26 April timesheet was denied for “insufficient funds,” which made no sense to Walker, who carefully reconciles his worker’s schedule with the care hours the state allows him.She was out $900 for two weeks’ work. Walker’s cash helped her keep groceries in the fridge and the lights on in her house, but it wouldn’t last long.“It was chaos,” Walker says.He adjusts his mask and pushes his waist-length dreadlocks out of his face. “I’ll be okay, because I worked out a system with my caregiver,” he says. But there are more than 2,000 people like him who receive self-directed services through ARChoices, a waiver program intended to help disabled and older Arkansans receive Medicaid-funded care in their own homes. He knows that few of them have the resources to underwrite their home care workers’ paychecks.“We’ve been together 10-plus years,” Walker says. “If we were new, she’d be gone.”View image in fullscreenLeDanté Walker: ‘They need to listen to people with disabilities. Ask. The. People.’ Photograph: Rory Doyle/The GuardianThe care crisis is especially acute in Arkansas. Pay here is notoriously low: after a decade, Walker’s caregiver still makes just $12.08 an hour, barely more than Arkansas’ $11 minimum wage. The cost of in-home care in Arkansas is 17% lower than the national average, in part because of low pay and high turnover. If Palco, the contractor that provides financial management services for self-directed clients in Arkansas, doesn’t pay his worker regularly, Walker knows, she might find work elsewhere through an agency or leave the industry altogether.In a 18 June joint statement, Palco and Arkansas DHS conceded: “When we went live April 1 with the EVV system for self-direction clients, there were more issues than we anticipated.”But self-directed clients and their advocates have been warning that the roll-out would fail for years. The state and its contractor, they say, were just not listening.As far back as April 2019, Brenda Stinebuck, the executive director of Spa Area Independent Living Services, worried that the system would be a catastrophe. Arkansas did not include self-directed clients or live-in caregivers in pilot testing. DHS had no communication about EVV with her office. “The ability to direct your own care is getting harder and harder and harder,” she said at the time.‘She’s with me 24/7. I don’t get overtime’The move to EVV has also made the jobs of family and live-in caregivers more difficult.Nancy Morell, 60, rises at 4am every day to bring her older sister Carolyn her coffee, bathe her, dry her hair and dress her. She sets her up to watch TV in the living room, with its broad windows overlooking the Ozark mountains outside Eureka Springs. Carolyn, who has cerebral palsy, can’t talk or move much, but they’ve found other ways to communicate.Morell, a slender woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, is a natural planner, running a complicated multigenerational household with grace and focus. She does Carolyn’s shopping and laundry, prepares her meals, carries her to the bathroom and shifts her between a beanbag, recliner and sofa to keep her comfortable. In good weather, she takes her to the back porch and they watch the hummingbird feeders together. She trims Carolyn’s nails, puts on her deodorant and lotion, and takes care of any other personal needs that come up before her sister goes to bed – she shares a room with her 85-year-old mother– at about 8pm.Morell attends Carolyn 16 hours a day, seven days a week – and she’s always available if there is an emergency in the night. “She’s with me 24/7. I don’t get overtime,” Morell said. Even so, the Arkansas department of human services (DHS) has determined that Carolyn’s needs can be met with 8 hours of care a day, so Morell is paid about $550 a week after taxes.Before the EVV rollout, Morell attended one of only two trainings offered by Palco. She downloaded the 43-page manual. She watched the YouTube video.She’s with me 24/7. I don’t get overtimeNancy MorellDespite all her efforts, Morell couldn’t access the system for two weeks. When she finally succeeded, her paycheck was three weeks late. She logged on to the website to find out why it was delayed, and saw the system had red-flagged all 16 of her shifts. In the 13 years she’s worked for her sister, she’s had just two shifts red-flagged by Palco, and the problems had been quickly resolved. Now, like Walker, she couldn’t get through to a support coordinator on the phone.But for Morell, the real problem is that EVV’s inflexibility adds new and seemingly arbitrary responsibilities to an already demanding job. Morell has to clock in and out of the app as often as four times a day, and on a fixed schedule, even though Carolyn gets care whenever she needs it, not at predetermined times. She sets alarms on her phone, terrified she’ll miss a clock-in because she is preparing meals or helping Carolyn to the bathroom. Her mother, who is Carolyn’s legal representative, has to sign the app at the end of every day.The 2016 federal law that paved the way for EVV – the 21st Century Cures Act – requires that the systems be “minimally burdensome.” But Arkansas, like many other states, appears to have implemented an approach with burdens galore.As Morell wrote in an 11 June letter to Arkansas DHS: “What took a total of 15 seconds – to sign a timesheet and submit to Palco – now takes many hours; hours that should be given to the client for care.”What happened when a ‘wildly irrational’ algorithm made crucial healthcare decisions Read moreEVV vendors promise their solutions will save states money by cutting down on what they claim is pervasive fraud and waste. A 2016 federal report claimed that EVV use across the country would eventually lead to $290m in cost savings over a ten year period, in part by reducing improper billing.But in practice there is little evidence to suggest fraud is either widespread or significant. Only seven people were charged with fraud in self-directed personal care services in Arkansas in 2020, out of a workforce of more than 4,500, according to data collected by Applied Self-Direction, a Boston-based consultancy. The state secured three convictions, recovering $1,930 total – $643 per case. The EVV system has cost the state $5.7m so far.And its human costs continue to mount.Recent complaints to Arkansas’s DHS, acquired through a public records request, illustrate the life-altering consequences of the widespread delays in payment. DHS made the following note about a voicemail the agency received from a home care worker: “She said she cannot buy groceries, her utilities are being shut off and she has an eviction notice.”In their statement, Palco and the Arkansas DHS say that “the EVV system is working and caregivers are getting paid. There is a very low error rate for submitted claims – just 2 percent.” Since Palco processes approximately 25,000 claims every two weeks, a 2% error rate affects the lives of 500 caregivers each pay period. And a single missed paycheck can quickly spell catastrophe for a low-wage worker.“There are, to this day, still beneficiaries trying to get their caregivers paid back to early April,” said Trevor Hawkins, staff attorney at Legal Aid of Arkansas, in an email. “There were no accommodations made to cover them while the bugs were worked out.”Digital timesheet or ankle monitor?For some, the new system feels like being under house arrest. The EVV app incorporates GPS to verify a home care worker’s location and a feature called “geofencing”. It establishes a maximum distance around a client’s home inside which a care worker is allowed to clock in or out without getting flagged as noncompliant.“The metal building down there, we know we can go that far,” says Melissa Harville, 46, standing near her front porch in rural Greenbrier, about 40 miles north of Little Rock. “And to the end of the driveway.”Harville used the EVV app to map out how far away from her home she is allowed to go without triggering an “unauthorized location” alert that will have to be resolved by her agency before she can be paid. In May, Harville and her partner Kevin Hoover, 57, were sitting outside their simple log home as bees buzzed loudly in the early summer sun. She was pointing out the boundaries of what the couple characterize as an invisible dog fence for humans. “It’s like living in a box,” she says.EVV has eroded both her and Hoover’s autonomy.View image in fullscreenLeDanté Walker uses his electronic visit verification app at his home in Hot Springs. Photograph: Rory Doyle/The GuardianBefore the home care agency she works for started using the AuthentiCare app in November 2020, she and Hoover, who has used a manual wheelchair since he lost the use of his legs in 2009, were always on the go. She could take him to therapy, grocery shopping, to see friends. “And now we can’t. You have to be at home to clock in and clock out,” Harville says.The intentions behind using GPS to verify a home care worker’s location might be to keep workers accountable and clients safe, but the implications are digital borders that undermine the philosophy behind independent living, advocates say.For more than six decades, disability activists have asserted the right to autonomy over one’s life and the ability to live, work and receive services within the broader community. Geo-fencing in EVV is built on a premise that contradicts this: it assumes that people like Kevin Hoover, who loves to fish, work on cars and play music with his friends, are homebound, not living active and vibrant lives.The state and Palco say that federal law requires them to log the location at which services are provided, and that the exception notices that caregivers and agencies perceive as errors are simply “informational geofencing messages” and “do not mean that time outside of the home will not be paid.”But the National Council on Independent Living conducted a survey of home care recipients and their care providers across 36 states in 2020, and found that one-third of respondents said that they “stay at home more often than prior to EVV use, due to fear that geofencing limitations will flag a visit as fraud or cause delay in or loss of provider wages.”What’s more, because workers and clients tend to be nearby when care services are delivered, “what EVV is doing is unintentionally tracking the recipient of care,” says Kendra Scalia, director of policy for the grassroots campaign Stop EVV.Karin Willison, disability editor at the digital health blog The Mighty, has argued that “electronic visit verification is the equivalent of putting an ankle monitor on people with disabilities and telling us where we can and can’t go.”‘We don’t deserve this’The EVV rollout tells a wider story about misplaced priorities. State Medicaid programs face perennial pressures to patch budget deficits by restricting eligibility, slashing benefits and suppressing worker wages.In this environment, tech solutions that promise cost savings appear appealing. But the human costs of EVV, whether financial or personal, may well exceed any gains in efficiency.The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that home health and personal care aides will be among the fastest growing occupations in the coming years. But on top of low wages, these jobs typically do not come with standard workplace benefits like health insurance, paid sick leave, vacation or disability insurance. This leads to chronic labor shortages, which will only be worsened if care workers feel forced to abandon the profession because of delayed paychecks and digital surveillance.“Just stop,” says Nancy Morell, the woman who cares for her sister in Eureka Springs. “That app on your phone? It doesn’t guarantee that the work is being done any more than a paper timesheet does. Go back to the way it was before. That will attract people back into the job they signed up for. This job takes people with heart. We don’t deserve this.”‘They need to listen to people with disabilities’From the start, disability and labor advocates have been vocal about their concerns, providing input on ways to design systems that are less onerous and invasive. In California, the labor union United Domestic Workers and Disability Rights California collaborated with clients, workers and state officials to design an in-house web portal that did not collect GPS data or require workers to log their hours in real-time.However, the federal government said that this system would not be compliant, stating that web-based timesheets alone do not provide auditable confirmation of data submitted.Palco and the Arkansas DHS insist that EVV is inescapable.But the federal mandate is not inflexible. The state of Virginia chose to exempt live-in caregivers from EVV requirements entirely. Geofencing is optional, as well.To LeDanté Walker, the lack of consultation with the affected communities feels like contempt. “They need to listen to people with disabilities,” he says. “Ask. The. People.”This article was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAutomating carenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘Some of the most shocking photographs ever taken’ – The Camera Never Lies reviewRepublican convention day three: JD Vance to speak as focus turns to foreign policyJon Stewart on Trump assassination attempt: ‘We dodged a catastrophe’LiveBiden says he’d consider withdrawing from 2024 race if ‘medical condition’ emerges – liveWho is Usha Vance, the Indian American lawyer married to JD Vance?",,,,,,,,

NSF partnerships expand National AI Research Institutes to 40 states


 



July 29, 2021





WASHINGTON –Today, the U.S. National Science Foundation announced the establishment of 11 new NSF National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes, building on the first round of seven institutes funded in 2020. The combined investment of $220 million expands the reach of these institutes to include a total of 40 states and the District of Columbia.
The institutes are focused on AI-based technologies that will bring about a range of advances: helping older adults lead more independent lives and improving the quality of their care; transforming AI into a more accessible “plug-and-play” technology; creating solutions to improve agriculture and food supply chains; enhancing adult online learning by introducing AI as a foundational element; and supporting underrepresented students in elementary to post-doctoral STEM education to improve equity and representation in AI research.
“I am delighted to announce the establishment of new NSF National AI Research Institutes as we look to expand into all 50 states,” said National Science Foundation Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “These institutes are hubs for academia, industry and government to accelerate discovery and innovation in AI. Inspiring talent and ideas everywhere in this important area will lead to new capabilities that improve our lives from medicine to entertainment to transportation and cybersecurity and position us in the vanguard of competitiveness and prosperity.”
Led by NSF, and in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Google, Amazon, Intel and Accenture, the National AI Research Institutes will act as connections in a broader nationwide network to pursue transformational advances in a range of economic sectors, and science and engineering fields — from food system security to next-generation edge networks.
“In the tradition of USDA-NIFA investments, these new institutes leverage the scientific power of U.S. land-grant universities informed by close partnership with farmers, producers, educators and innovators to provide sustainable crop production solutions and address these pressing societal challenges,” said USDA-NIFA Director Carrie Castille. “These innovation centers will speed our ability to meet the critical needs in the future agricultural workforce, providing equitable and fair market access, increasing nutrition security and providing tools for climate-smart agriculture.”
The new awards, each at about $20 million over five years, will support 11 institutes spanning seven research areas:

Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration
AI for Advances in Optimization
AI and Advanced Cyberinfrastructure
AI in Computer and Network Systems
AI in Dynamic Systems
AI-Augmented Learning
AI-Driven Innovation in Agriculture and the Food System.

 
The focus of the 11 National AI Institutes are listed below:
NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups. Led by the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), the institute, also known as AI-CARING, will seek to create a vibrant, fully developed discipline focused on personalized, longitudinal (over months and years) collaborative AI systems that learn individual models of human behavior and how they change over time and use that knowledge to better collaborate and communicate in caregiving environments. The collaborative AI Partners in Care developed as part of this institute will help support a growing population of older adults sustain independence, improve quality of life, and increase effectiveness of care coordination across the care network.
This institute is partially funded by Amazon and Google.
NSF AI Institute for Advances in Optimization. Led by Georgia Tech, this institute will revolutionize decision-making on a large scale by fusing AI and mathematical optimization into intelligent systems that will achieve breakthroughs that neither field can achieve independently.

PULLMAN, Wash. – With a new $20 million federal grant, Washington State University will lead a multi-institutional research institute to develop artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to tackle some of agriculture’s biggest challenges related to labor, water, weather and climate change.
The new institute is one of 11 launched by the National Science Foundation and among two funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture in 2021. It’s called the AgAID Institute, which is short for USDA-NIFA Institute for Agricultural AI for Transforming Workforce and Decision Support.
While traditional AI development involves scientists making tools and delivering them to end-users, the AgAID Institute will involve the people who will use the AI solutions—from farmers and workers to policy makers—in their development, said Ananth Kalyanaraman, a WSU computer science professor and the lead principal investigator for the Institute.
“People are very much part of the agricultural ecosystem. It’s not just plants growing. Humans manipulate crops on a daily basis and make complex decisions, such as how to allocate water or mitigate the effects of an incoming storm,” said Kalyanaraman, who also holds the Boeing Chair in WSU’s School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “We aim to partner human knowledge with AI tools in a way that amplifies the end outcomes where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”
Ananth Kalyanaraman
The AgAID Institute will be a multi-disciplinary, collaborative effort involving faculty and scientists with expertise on a diverse range of areas in computer science, agriculture and agricultural outreach.
In addition to WSU, the Institute members include Oregon State University; University of California, Merced; University of Virginia; Carnegie Mellon University; Heritage University; Wenatchee Valley College; and Kansas State University. Private sector partners include IBM Research and the start-up innov8.ag.
The AgAID Institute will take an “adopt-adapt-amplify” approach, Kalyanaraman said. This means first the Institute will design AI solutions in partnership with the people who use the tools, so they are practical and more likely to be adopted. The researchers will also work to make solutions that can adapt to changing environments and that amplify productivity by combining human skills and machine capabilities to be more effective than either would be alone. For instance, pruning trees is a highly skilled task, but a beginner-level worker could benefit from an AI tool that provides expert guidance to help decide which is the best branch to prune. The task is done better, and the worker starts to learn from the feedback, and with a shortage of skilled labor, AI can benefit both the orchard and the worker, said Kalyanaraman.
“It’s a partnership. AI can help us basically bridge the divide between high-skilled and low-skilled workers,” he said.
Educating the workforce at all levels is central to the AgAID Institute not just to encourage AI adoption but as a matter of equity, according to the Institute leaders. The Institute plans multiple education programs from K-12 through higher education and worker training. The goal is to raise AI skill levels and open new career paths, which can improve pay and quality of life for agricultural workers. It can also attract more people to agriculture and computing professions.
The AgAID Institute will undertake several challenging test cases involving specialty crops, many of which grow in the Western United States, such as apples, cherries, mint and almonds. These crops encompass several major challenges: they require intensive labor and irrigation. They are also vulnerable to weather events and climate change. Specialty crops account for 87% of the U.S. agricultural workforce, and about 40% of these crops are perennial, requiring long-term management and resource planning.
The difficult challenges posed by these cases would mean AgAID Institute’s solutions would be rigorously tested before being transferred to other regions in the country, said Kalyanaraman.
“We know that AI has a serious potential to make groundbreaking discoveries and transform our decision-making capabilities in a data-informed way, but the technology needs to be developed in a very careful manner,” he said.
This award is part of a significant investment by the federal agencies in state of Washington AI leadership, noted U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell. Two of the 11 funded institutes will be headed by universities in the state: in addition to the WSU-led AgAID Institute, the University of Washington will be leading the NSF AI Institute for Dynamic Systems.
“The state of Washington is already a leader in artificial intelligence,” said Cantwell. “From the University of Washington’s Tech Policy Lab that studies the grand challenges around artificial intelligence to Washington State University’s work in precision agriculture, we are more than ready for these two grants to help us understand more artificial intelligence applications. The UW will work in the area of complex systems to improve fields like manufacturing and WSU will work on improvements in farming.”
Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers expressed her support for the new AgAID Institute.
“Washington State University has long been a leader in agriculture, innovation and technology,” said McMorris Rodgers. “I was proud to be a part of the conversation at the university’s Agriculture AI Summit in October 2020 and am pleased to see that WSU received designation as the USDA-NIFA Institute for Agricultural AI for Transforming Workforce and Decision Support today. This institute, also known as AgAID, will integrate AI methods into agriculture operations for prediction, decision support and robotics-enabled agriculture to address the complex agricultural challenges facing Eastern Washington and the nation. I look forward to seeing the innovative work that will come out of this Institute to support our state’s agricultural industries.”

Artificial intelligence can help.Matt AldertonPlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:000:58AD0:10SKIPClosedCaptionOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenEducators are at the ends of their ropes. So suggests a fall 2020 survey by RAND Corp., which found that a quarter of all teachers were thinking about leaving education.Remote learning and COVID-19 are partly to blame: More than half (57 percent) of teachers said they worked more hours per week during the pandemic than they did before it, according to RAND, and 80 percent reported feelings of burnout as a result. Even before COVID-19, however, former public-school teachers were struggling, and reported finding better pay, better work/life balance, more resources and a more manageable workload in jobs outside of education.“Part of the problem is that teachers spend a lot of time doing things that ... in their view are not the best and highest use of their time,” says former teacher Jake Bryant, now a partner at management consulting firm McKinsey & Co., where he serves the company’s education practice. “Nobody becomes a third-grade teacher because they love collecting permission slips and filling out attendance sheets. What motivates you to get into the profession is interacting and engaging with students, and helping them learn.”Technology might be the remedy, according to Bryant, who cites McKinsey research finding that teachers currently spend as much as 40 percent of their time on activities that could be automated. That’s hours every week that could be reallocated from administration to education.To be clear, robots won’t replace teachers. By deploying artificial intelligence (AI) in the classroom, however, experts like Bryant believe schools can remake education in ways that make teachers happier and students smarter.Building BandwidthBecause teachers are stretched so thin, AI can make a significant difference by streamlining administrative tasks.“The strongest use cases for AI in education are those that automate the more tedious aspects of the educator workload,” says Eric Wang, senior director at education technology company Turnitin AI. Take grading, for instance: Turnitin’s Gradescope platform uses AI to analyze students’ work. It finds and groups similar answers, then creates an automated rubric that helps teachers grade assignments in half the time.“The advantage of artificial intelligence is its ability to scale complex tasks or reduce time spent on redundant tasks,” Wang continues. “AI-powered learning products give faculty more time to focus on teaching and the interpersonal aspects of their interactions with students.”In 2016, Georgia Institute of Technology computer science professor Ashok Goel used AI to create a time-saving solution of his own: a virtual teaching assistant named Jill Watson that’s available 24/7 to answer routine questions posed by graduate students, such as when exams will take place.“Having an AI agent available to answer basic questions allows students to get help any time, any place, and reduces the load on teachers,” Goel explains. “Teachers spend so much time on mundane activities. Freeing them up would allow them to engage more deeply with learners, which is what teachers should be doing in the first place.”The Power of PersonalizationNo matter how much of it they have, AI can maximize teachers’ time by way of personalized and adaptive learning.“The typical classroom is incredibly diverse in terms of where students are starting from, what things they understand, what motivates them and how they feel engaged,” Bryant says. “Technology creates an opportunity for teachers to give instruction that’s more personalized with less effort.”Knewton’s Alta and Thinkster Math are two examples of adaptive learning. The former is an adaptive courseware system that uses AI to create personalized learning experiences in college-level math, science and economics. As students complete assignments inside the system, AI automatically recognizes knowledge gaps and retrieves content to address them. Students who understand the material can breeze through and move on, while those who don’t will receive extra, targeted instruction. All the while, the system feeds data to instructors to inform subsequent instruction.“The technology accelerates students through pieces where they don’t need help and spends more time with them in areas where they do,” explains Matthew Leavy, executive vice president and general manager of education publishing at Wiley, Knewton’s parent company. “And for instructors looking over large classrooms, it helps them understand where they should focus their teaching and where they don’t need to spend as much time.”Thinkster Math is a tutoring platform for K-12 students. First, learners take an online assessment that determines their knowledge in a given domain. Then, the system builds a personalized learning plan and assigns custom worksheets to complete. AI captures students’ work, provides video tutorials when learners get stuck and isolates learning opportunities that human instructors can focus on during subsequent live tutoring sessions.“We’ve married man with machine,” says Thinkster Math founder and CEO Raj Valli, who likens the technology to a swimming coach who watches his swimmers’ every stroke. “If you tell me to jump in the pool and swim back and forth, I’m never going to be a good swimmer. But if you jump in the pool with me and point out that I’m not kicking my right leg or using my left arm, then you can make me better. That’s the kind of observations our tutors are able to make using our technology.”Reading Progress, a brand-new tool from Microsoft, applies AI and speech recognition to reading fluency. Teachers assign reading level-appropriate passages that students read on camera and submit for review; with the help of AI, instructors can then assess performance and identify reading errors.“Everything Reading Progress does, a teacher could do if they were able to sit next to each of their students all day and coach them on every single word they read. But in a classroom of 20 or 30 students that’s often not possible,” says Anthony Salcito, Microsoft vice president of worldwide education. “Reading Progress helps teachers quickly assess how students are progressing so they can coach them where they need help.”Education EvolutionAI in the future might optimize not only individual curriculums, but also entire classrooms. For example, Goel says AI could be used for “matchmaking” — pairing students with the teachers and schools that are best suited to them based on their learning style. Meanwhile, Sean Ryan, president of the School Group at McGraw-Hill, says there’s an opportunity to organize students into classes based on aptitude instead of age. “For the most part, today we sort students chronologically no matter what. But AI gives us the ability to group students based on what they’re ready to learn next,” says Ryan.  McGraw-Hill’s ALEKS adaptive learning program uses AI to create personalized learning paths for students in kindergarten through college. “That can be hard to embrace because of social components. But with more education taking place in hybrid and online environments, there’s no reason not to put an eighth grader in a pre-calculus class if they’re cognitively ready,” Ryan says.It’s the beginning of a new era wherein learning is a journey instead of a destination. That makes teachers navigators — which is precisely what most of them want to be.“Teachers become teachers to help children maximize their potential,” Ryan concludes. “By allowing them to focus more on the social components of learning, technology helps them have the kind of impact they got into the profession to have.”CompareCredit.com2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026With no annual fee & no interest for 18 months, these cards are helping Americans pay off debt in record time.CompareCredit.com|AdAdRead MoreUndoYiffanyThis New AC Cooler Cools the Room In SecondsYiffany|AdAdLearn MoreUndoBetterBuckI'm a massive savings nerd: Here are 15 tricks that saved me money this year.How to copy-and-paste my favorite money-saving hacks from the past year, and how much you could potentially save (it's probably more than you'd think).BetterBuck|AdAdUndoHealth Insight JournalNew Edema Device Leaves Experts Speechless (It's Genius!)Health Insight Journal|AdAdLearn MoreUndoBarestepThese New Shoes Are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarestep|AdAdUndoCar Insurance DiscountVirginia Launches New Coverage for Cars Used Less Than 50 Miles/DayCar Insurance Discount|AdAdRead MoreUndo3SkipAds by HomeBuddyHere's an Estimated Cost for a One-Day Walk-in ShowerHomeBuddy|AdAdUndoHomebuddy.comRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards...Here's What They DiscoveredMore Than 410,000 Homeowners Have Already Done it.

MU is one of eight institutions collaborating within the new AI institute.

July 29, 2021

The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has announced the establishment of the AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture (AIIRA), one of 11 new NSF National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes that will work to advance AI technologies and their associated benefits to society. The AIIRA will be led by Iowa State University (ISU) and feature collaboration across eight institutions, including the University of Missouri.
While the 11 AI Institutes will cover a wide range of AI technology and applications, the AIIRA will focus on a simulation technology that can create “digital twins” of real-world crops and farms, an approach that would provide specific, detailed information for better-informed crop management, technological development and agricultural policies. Using sensors to send real-time data about weather, soil composition and other factors to the digital twin, researchers plan to create a system that can accurately predict the outcome of a variety of “what-if” scenarios.
Michelle Segovia's research focuses on behavioral and experimental economics.
“Agricultural industries are facing a number of challenges in the coming years, including concerns about a more variable climate, growing population numbers and less available cropland,” said Michelle Segovia, an assistant professor of agricultural and applied economics at the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources. “This technology would allow researchers to test how those scenarios would impact food resources, and at MU, our job is to determine whether such a technology would be adopted by potential users.”
MU’s team, including Segovia and Corinne Valdivia, will conduct surveys, participatory workshops and economic experiments to identify the social, behavioral and business catalysts, and barriers to adoption of the digital twins. Insights gained from these efforts will directly inform the development and deployment of the technology, providing crucial information about the values, concerns and practices of decision makers — i.e. farmers, consumers, and other stakeholders — resulting in digital twins innovations that are salient, trusted and actionable.
Through collaboration among each of the eight AIIRA institutions, the institute will not only develop the AI technology and investigate the keys to its successful adoption, but will involve a wide variety of associated efforts, including education and workforce development in Native American communities, the development of cyberinfrastructure, robotics and rural outreach.
Corinne Valdivia is a professor of agricultural and applied economics in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources.
“The institute is collaborative by design, and the relationships between the researchers and institutions have been years in the making,” Segovia said. “MU’s expertise in social sciences, economics and translational research in innovations for agriculture will focus on AI innovation pathways that  create a feedback process among all actors and institutions in the Ag ecosystem. This is the case for each of the AAIRA institutions, and the result is a diverse cooperative process that allows us to cover many different angles of research and development at once.”
With a five-year, $20 million grant, the AAIRA is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA), one of several organizations funding the 11 new national institutes; others are funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, NSF and companies such as Google, Amazon, Intel and Accenture. In total, the 11 institutes represent an investment of about $220 million.
“In the tradition of USDA-NIFA investments, these new institutes leverage the scientific power of U.S. land-grant universities informed by close partnership with farmers, producers, educators and innovators to provide sustainable crop production solutions and address these pressing societal challenges,” said USDA-NIFA Director Carrie Castille. “These innovation centers will speed our ability to meet the critical needs in the future agricultural workforce, providing equitable and fair market access, increasing nutrition security and providing tools for climate-smart agriculture.”
In addition to MU and ISU, the partner institutions in the AIIRA are Carnegie Mellon University, New York University, the University of Arizona, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, George Mason University and the Iowa Soybean Association.

By Lorena Anderson, UC Merced, and Sara Zaske, Washington State UniversityJuly 29, 2021A machine developed in Professor Reza Ehsani's lab improves almond harvests by reducing the amount of dust stirred up as the nuts are gathered from the ground.With a new $20 million federal grant, UC Merced becomes part of a multi-institutional research collaborative to develop artificial intelligence — or AI — solutions to tackle some of agriculture’s biggest challenges related to water management, climate change and integration of new technology into farming.
The new institute is one of 11 launched this year by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and among two funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The newly announced AgAID Institute is shorthand for the collaborative USDA-NIFA Institute for Agricultural AI for Transforming Workforce and Decision Support.
The AgAID Institute features four core institutions: UC Merced; Washington State University (WSU), the lead campus; Oregon State University; and the University of Virginia. The AgAID Institute bolsters UC Merced’s already strong focus on ag-tech solutions for sustainable food systems in California and beyond.
Professor Joshua Viers“This is only the second round of AI centers the NSF has funded, so we’re really honored to be contributing to this important and cutting-edge research effort,” environmental engineering  Professor Joshua Viers  said. Viers is the lead principal investigator from UC Merced and the campus director of the  Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute, which has been advancing ag-tech solutions for the San Joaquin Valley broadly. “We’ll be working to leverage computational knowledge to arrive at actionable decisions for farmers and water managers, and we’ll be the application test beds for much of what is developed at the other core institutions.”
Much of that testing will be done at UC Merced’s new experimental smart farm, a 40-acre site adjacent to campus that is in the planning stages.


""Not only are we building the future in the heart of California, but we are doing it in a way that speaks to our commitment to innovation in research and education that uplifts our region and results in a new generation of leaders for the Valley.""
UC Merced Chancellor Juan Sánchez MuñozWhile traditional AI development involves scientists making tools and delivering them to end-users, the AgAID Institute will involve the people who will use the AI solutions — from farmers and workers to policy makers — in their development. This “adopt-adapt-amplify” approach ensures solutions are practical and more likely to be adopted. The researchers will also work to create solutions that can adapt to changing environments and that amplify productivity by combining human skills and machine capabilities to be more effective than either would be alone.
“People are very much part of the agricultural ecosystem. It’s not just plants growing. Humans manipulate crops on a daily basis and make complex decisions, such as how to allocate water or mitigate the effects of an incoming storm,” said Ananth Kalyanaraman, a WSU computer science professor and AgAID Institute director. “We aim to partner human knowledge with AI tools in a way that amplifies the end outcomes where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”
Professor Jian-Qiao SunThe AgAID Institute will be a multi-disciplinary, collaborative effort involving faculty and scientists with expertise in a diverse range of areas in computer science, agriculture and agricultural outreach. In addition to the four core institutions, the collaborative includes Carnegie Mellon University and Kansas State University, and in an effort to train the next generation of educators and farm managers, UC Merced will work closely with other minority-serving institutions such as Heritage University and Wenatchee Valley College. Private sector partners include IBM Research and the start-up innov8.ag.
At UC Merced, School of Engineering professors Reza Ehsani, Jian-Qiao Sun,  John Abatzoglou  and  Josué Medellín-Azuara  will all be co-investigators and part of the Institute, as will social scientist Leigh Bernacchi, Ph.D., the CITRIS program director.
With this grant, NSF has made a $220 million investment in AI-based collaborations, building on the first round of seven AI Institutes funded in 2020.
The goal is to develop AI-based technologies that bring about a range of advances: helping older adults lead more independent lives and improving the quality of their care; transforming AI into a more accessible “plug-and-play” technology; creating solutions to improve agriculture and food supply chains; enhancing adult online learning; and supporting underrepresented students from elementary to post-doctoral STEM education to improve equity and representation in AI research.
Professor Reza EhsaniLed by NSF and in partnership with USDA-NIFA, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Google, Amazon, Intel and Accenture, the AI Institutes will act as connections in a nationwide network pursuing transformational advances in a range of economic sectors, and science and engineering fields — from food-system security to next-generation edge networks.
“AI is an enabling technology that can help us develop the next generation of intelligent farm equipment and implements. These machines could potentially be more efficient, easier to operate and could reduce production costs,” Ehsani said.
For instance, pruning trees is a highly skilled task, but a beginner-level worker could benefit from an AI tool that provides expert guidance to help decide which are the best branches to prune. The task is done better, and the worker starts to learn from the feedback. With a shortage of skilled labor, AI can benefit both the orchard and the worker, bridging a divide between high-skilled and low-skilled workers.


“AI is an enabling technology that can help us develop the next generation of intelligent farm equipment and implements. These machines could potentially be more efficient, easier to operate and could reduce production costs.""
Professor Reza EhsaniProfessor Josué Medellín-AzuaraEducating the workforce at all levels is central to the AgAID Institute not just to encourage AI adoption but as a matter of equity, Institute leaders said. The Institute plans multiple education programs from K-12 through higher education and worker training. The goal is to raise AI skill levels and open new career paths, which can improve pay and quality of life for agricultural workers. It can also attract more people to agriculture and computing professions.
The AgAID Institute will undertake several challenging test cases involving specialty crops, many of which grow in the western United States, such as almonds, pistachios, apples, cherries and hops. These crops encompass several major challenges: They require intensive labor and irrigation. They are also vulnerable to weather events and climate change. Specialty crops account for 87% of the U.S. agricultural workforce, and about 40% of these crops are perennial, requiring long-term management and resource planning.
Professor John Abatzoglou“AgAID seeks to apply advances in computational technology to the long-standing wicked challenge of agricultural lands in the semi-arid West that are constrained by climate, land and people,” Abatzoglou said. “This support will help develop tech-based solutions for ameliorating the cascading impacts of water scarcity in agricultural systems we’ve experienced recently and will continue to face.”
Chancellor Juan Sánchez Muñoz, Ph.D., who champions UC Merced’s leadership in sustainability and its strong integration into the future of the San Joaquin Valley and its communities, addressed the importance of the AgAID Institute for students and the Valley.
“This artificial intelligence institute for transforming workforce and decision support in agriculture speaks to our increasing national and global recognition for cutting-edge research,” Muñoz said. “Sustaining the future of agriculture — the primary economic activity in our region — is paramount. Not only are we building the future in the heart of California, but we are doing it in a way that speaks to our commitment to innovation in research and education that uplifts our region and results in a new generation of leaders for the Valley.""

Washington State University will lead a new federally funded research institute to take the agriculture industry further into the future via artificial intelligence.
The USDA-NIFA Institute for Agricultural AI for Transforming Workforce and Decision Support – also known as the AgAID Institute – will look at how AI can help tackle farming challenges related to climate change, weather, water supply and labor.
To that end, WSU researchers will lead a coalition of colleges and universities as well as private sector partners through the AgAID Institute, which will be funded through a five-year, $20 million U.S. Department of Agriculture grant.
“We also know that agriculture has entered in some ways a new era. It’s what some people talk about as Agriculture 4.0,” said WSU professor Ananth Kalyanaraman, director of the AgAID Institute. “It’s almost an evolution that is needed in agriculture to tackle some of the 21st century challenges.”
AgAID is one of 11 new AI research institutes announced Thursday by the National Science Foundation.
The University of Washington will lead another: The NSF AI Institute for Dynamic Systems will focus on AI innovations with real-time learning and control of complex dynamic systems, which describe chaotic situations caused by constantly shifting conditions, according to the university.
“Some of our specific questions include: Can we develop better machine-learning technologies by baking in and enforcing known physics, such as conservation laws, symmetries, etc.?” institute associate director Steve Brunton, a UW associate professor of mechanical engineering, said in a statement. “Similarly, in complex systems where we only have partially known or unknown physics – such as neuroscience or epidemiology – can we use machine learning to learn the ‘physics’ of these systems?”
Kalyanaraman, a professor with WSU’s School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, will lead the AgAID Institute.
Partners with the institute include Oregon State University; University of California, Merced; University of Virginia; Carnegie Mellon University; Heritage University; Wenatchee Valley College; Kansas State University; IBM Research and the start-up innov8.ag.
Kalyanaraman said WSU first formed an internal team of computer science researchers and agricultural stakeholders a few years ago to look into the perceptions and practical applications of AI with farming. The team then grew with external partners, including a number of the institute’s partnering universities.
These partnerships incidentally put the coalition in prime position when the National Science Foundation put out a call for proposals with the research institute initiative last year, Kalyanaraman said.
One of the focuses of the institute will be education programs from K-12 through higher education and worker training. Kalyanaraman also said much of the institute’s initial years will be spent working directly with stakeholders in the agricultural industry – essentially the end users of these systems – to determine their needs and practical restraints.
“It’s one thing to have AI tools and design AI tools to work in lab settings,” he said, “but it’s a completely different beast when we talk about transferring AI to work while in the field.”
AI, Kalyanaraman said, can help farm managers better forecast the availability of water and allocate that supply in smart ways to prevent significant losses. He said such innovations can also help farmers better predict the weather and plan for extreme weather .
“How can you take the data that is being generated and convert that into some kind of actionable knowledge to make real-time decisions?” Kalyanaraman said. “That is where AI comes in.”
Labor, meanwhile, is another challenge particularly with specialty crops – such as apples, cherries, mint and almonds – that require skill-intensive processes. Specialty crops account for 87% of the U.S. agricultural workforce, according to the university; many are grown in the Western U.S.
As an example, Kalyanaraman said an AI-driven device could  guide a farm worker with pruning crops with adroitness.
But don’t expect robots to manage these specialty crops anytime soon.
“A machine simply can’t substitute the human on the farm,” Kalyanaraman said. “Farmworkers are an integral part of the chain, and they will continue to be. Except now with machines, we can help train them better and also have some degree of automation in the sense that guidance is possible.”
U.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray lauded Thursday’s announcement.
Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement the investments involving both WSU and UW “will be critical to ensuring that the state of Washington remains a leader in innovation, research and scientific achievement.”
“From the University of Washington’s Tech Policy Lab that studies the grand challenges around artificial intelligence to Washington State University’s work in precision agriculture, we are more than ready for these two grants to help us understand more artificial intelligence applications,” Cantwell, D-Wash., said in a statement.

The possibilities of technology are leaving everyone in awe. Truly, the worldly applications of artificial intelligence are arming up to automate anything and everything. At a time when artificial intelligence is at its peak, we are bound to discuss its adverse side. Although technology is minimizing human workload, in some cases, it is stealing the job from humans. In the worst-case scenario, AI is taking over data science jobs from mankind in 2021..While artificial intelligence is moving all the heavy rocks, it still induces an array of fear among people. One reason for this is because of the scary sci-fi movies we have come across. Many of them portray technology and automation as human enemies. Besides, people are also terrified of the fact that machines are replacing their stance in the workforce. Today, many of the heavy machinery works in manufacturing houses, factories, and the shipping industry is being carried out by machines. But originally, despite the hardship, human laborers did the work and were getting paid for it. What initially started as a wipeout move to replace time-consuming jobs, is now taking over intellectual works like data processing. Data science is a vast field that employs and sorts many big data-related issues. Technology has been spearheaded to be the core of many business decisions in the 21st century. Owing to its hype, the demand for data science jobs has also drastically surged. For over a decade now, being a data scientist is the hottest job in the tech sphere. Maybe, not anymore. AI is taking over data science jobs by carrying out whatever big data-related works they do. Without much effort, automation can process, sort, and analyze data, and make well-informed business decisions..WHY IS IT NECESSARY FOR ENGINEERS TO LEARN DATA SCIENCE IN 2021?DATA SCIENCE IS HERE TO SPEARHEAD ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH TOUGH COMPETITIONBEST DATA SCIENCE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS TO DISCOVER CAREER OPPORTUNITIES.The Routine of Data Scientists.In order to learn how artificial intelligence is slowly replacing data scientists, we need to take a look at the routines of data scientists. Data scientists are professionals who take data from their repository in order to design, build, and test advanced models, based on machine learning algorithms. Their frequent tasks include preparing data, cleansing, checking for correctness, identifying outliers, and empty records. Besides, data scientists also detect prediction features and represent them, identify obsolescence of models, build basic models through intuitive interfaces, etc..What are the Tasks that AI is Automating?.As the influence of artificial intelligence has spiraled in the digital world, it leads us to a debate on how automation will take over human jobs. Because of the recent advancements, we don't even have a choice to think of 'how,' but are moving towards 'what' jobs profiles will be filled by AI in 2021. One thing that stands first in the line is data science. Yes, to be precise, companies are paying a fortune for data scientists today. Although data scientists play a big role in business decision-making and problem shooting, organizations still prefer to look for an alternative that could cost them less..Already, emerging AI algorithms are used to analyze data and provide solutions similar to those provided by data scientists. Automating the data processing tasks is more likely to surge in the coming years as it is easy for data professionals to get what they need without requiring human intervention. According to a Gartner report, around 40% of data science work was anticipated to be automated by 2020. As a result of this, the demand for data scientists has fallen flat. On a general scale, AI is taking over data science jobs without much hesitation. It can surely outperform data scientists in terms of speed and risk management. However, one thing that still keeps automation away from certain data science tasks is human intelligence. Although machines can take over the programmed routine tasks, troubleshooting and sorting a problem would be difficult for artificial intelligence..While we talk about the critical points that keep the machine from becoming human competition, let's also look at some of the data science routines that AI can effortlessly take over. Artificial intelligence and data science work in accord to improve each other's efficiencies. A dynamic, multi-faceted decision process obtained through automation will outperform any single algorithm, no matter how advanced, by automatically testing, iterating, and monitoring data quality. In a nutshell, automation can genuinely take over lower-level tasks without any hesitation. Besides, if we move out of the job replacement bubble, artificial intelligence could even stand by data scientists' side in a supportive way. They can function as intelligent assistants to data scientists, allowing them to run more complex data simulations than ever before..Machines are Pumping up the Skill Demand.The AI transformation is introducing a quest for special skills in the job market. Even in the data science field, the wave of automation has spiked the demand for specialized skills that data scientists need to possess in order to sustain this storm. They are openly keeping the bar of expectation high for many data science professionals with companies adding up more skill demands to their hiring process..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Weekly roundup: Anaheim Union announces artificial intelligence internship, students return to community college campuses, and more Ian Hanigan July 30, 2021 
 The Anaheim Union High School District says it’s partnered with an Irvine-based technology firm to launch a new artificial intelligence internship program.
According to a joint news release, the collaboration with Loko AI will give AUHSD students real-world, hands-on experience with software engineering and machine learning.
Loko AI leverages autonomous systems, computer vision and synthetic data to tackle security, surveillance, public safety and loss-prevention challenges. The company was created as a response to the Route 91 festival shooting in Las Vegas in 2017.
Founder and CEO Joseph Zaki emphasized the importance of introducing the next generation to artificial intelligence and machine learning.
“We intend to help catalyze Orange County into an AI superhub of job creation, education, community building,” he said, “and we’re excited to be pushing the frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning with AUHSD.”
The Anaheim Union High School District currently offers an artificial intelligence pathway at Kennedy High School, emphasizing robotics, computer science and engineering design.
“We are excited to be working with the innovative team at Loko AI and creating real-world, workforce opportunities for our students in the disruptive field of artificial intelligence and machine learning,” Superintendent Michael Matsuda said.
And here are some of the other education news stories from the week ending July 30:

Orange County’s community colleges are bringing some students back for the fall session — with hopes of fully reopening in the spring.


Eight electric buses are making their way to the Anaheim Elementary School District, which unveiled half of the clean-energy fleet at the district’s transportation depot.


The OC Board of Education held the first of its two summer forums on ethnic studies and critical race theory following a pair of local news conferences expressing differing views, the Orange County Register reported. The Voice of OC and Daily Pilot also covered the forum.


Federal health officials are now recommending that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in public if they’re in areas with substantial or high transmission. The CDC also revised its school recommendations, calling for universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students and visitors to schools, regardless of their vaccination status.


Dr. Gregory A. Franklin, who has been superintendent of the Tustin Unified School District for the last decade, announced that he’ll retire on Dec. 31, capping a career in education that has spanned more than 35 years.


State data shows that charter school enrollment in Orange County climbed to 4.6 percent in the 2020-21 school year from 2.4 percent in 2014-15. Meanwhile, some are expressing concerns about a lack of oversight, the Voice of OC reports.


The Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified school board voted 3-2 in favor of a resolution asking the California Department of Public Health to give schools the option of having students wear face coverings while indoors.


The California State University system says it will require students, faculty and staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to its 23 campuses for the fall semester. The Los Angeles Times reports that medical and religious exemptions will be permitted, but unvaccinated students will have to be tested regularly.


Meanwhile, Californians are split over whether the COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory for students and teachers in public schools, KTLA channel 5 reports.


And finally, parents of high school students have the right to request a grade change — to pass or no-pass — for courses they took in 2020-21 under new legislation signed by the governor on July 1, EdSource reports. The idea is not to punish students for the impacts of the pandemic.

Artificial intelligence is the most disruptive technology of our time, transforming business processes and the world we live in. Companies are using artificial intelligence to extract its full potential and improve the overall customer experience. Artificial intelligence trends for 2021 are moving in the direction of innovation. The results are already visible in the form of algorithms. For example, Google’s BRET transformative neural network is a new algorithm that promises to revolutionize NLP. Similarly, new tools are being developed for businesses to automate machine learning tasks and accelerate innovation and solution development. Artificial intelligence is also moving towards conceptual models, smaller devices and multi-model applications. It is therefore important for technology organizations to keep abreast of available technological developments.
1.Machine learningAutoML will provide enhanced tools to improve data labelling and neural network architectures. Data tagging is an essential component of industries, which is now outsourced to countries such as India, Central and Eastern Europe and South America. Because of the pandemic-related business disruption, companies are now looking for extra days to avoid or minimize this part of the process. The advantage of automating the work of selecting and tuning a neural network model is that AI will become available at a low cost and therefore more new solutions can be created.
Conceptual design using AITraditionally, the main applications of artificial intelligence have been in optimizing processes related to data, image and language analysis. Sectors such as finance, retail and healthcare have used the technology to automate repetitive tasks. Recent developments in OpenAI will change this mindset. Known as DALL E and CLIP, these models will combine language and images to generate new visual models by understanding textual descriptions.Supporting multiple learning domainsDue to frequent advances, the ability of artificial intelligence to support multiple modalities within a single ML model is improving. The technology can now leverage data from text, vision, speech and IoT sensors. Developers are also taking advantage of this capability and innovating in various ways to improve common tasks. In healthcare, patient data collected by health systems includes visual labs, clinical trial reports and other documents. With the right layout and presentation style, this can help doctors better understand the situation. Artificial intelligence models that can work with multimodal techniques can do the job of presenting reports and improving medical diagnosis.Miniature MLMiniature or tiny machine learning is being developed. These tiny models will work on devices that don’t use much hardware, such as microcontrollers to power machines. Tiny ML algorithms can be used for local analysis of voice commands or simple gestures to identify sounds such as a gunshot or a baby crying.AI for employee experienceEvery time a new development in artificial intelligence emerges, there is concern that it will threaten people’s jobs. Leaders combat this concern by improving the employee experience with artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence will help offload human tasks, for example in sales and customer service teams. With RPA, artificial intelligence can automate tedious tasks and free up human effort for better work.Quantum machine learningQuantum computing can create powerful AI and ML models. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon and IBM have started working on this technology to make quantum computing more accessible via the cloud. With this potential, organizations can solve critical problems and pursue quantum applications across industries.AI for allThe constant evolution of artificial intelligence is making things easier for everyone.
